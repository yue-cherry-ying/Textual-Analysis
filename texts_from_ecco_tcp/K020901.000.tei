            <p>THE hint of this Piece was taken from one of the <hi>Contes Moraux</hi> of <hi>Marmon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tel,</hi> stiled <hi>L'Hereux Divorce.</hi> The foible ri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diculed in the tale is, perhaps, the only one imputed to our sex which has never yet been exposed by a theatrical representation. It is a simplicity, not a coquetry; it is the error of a delicate and elevated mind, unacquainted with the manners of real life, or the general frame of the human heart.</p>
            <p>The novel was too barren of incident to furnish out an entertainment for the stage, which obliged me to contrive an intire un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der-plot, and introduce several new charac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters into the Comedy, which I shall not take up the reader's time to point out here; and submit this performance to the candor and clemency of the public, after having, per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps, too adventurously hazarded their criti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cism and censure.</p>

               <l>Know then, my lords, and gentlemen o'th' jury,</l>
               <l>We've found a bill i'th' records of old Drury,</l>
               <l>In which the culprit's charg'd, in this here cause,</l>
               <l>With rankest treason against nature's laws,</l>
               <l>By introducing 'mong the scenes of life,</l>
               <l>A thing unheard-of, a <hi>Platonic</hi> Wife;</l>
               <l>Fair, blooming, and 'bout twenty-five—no more—</l>
               <l>I thought, at least, she had been sixty-four!</l>
               <l>Here rests my plea: In order to make good</l>
               <l>The rights and properties of flesh and blood,</l>
               <l>For evidence upon yourselves I call,</l>
               <l>And set the cause on this, to stand or fall,</l>
               <l>Have ye now one <hi>Platonic</hi> Wife among ye all?</l>

               <speaker>PLACID.</speaker>
               <l>My lords and gentlemen, attend a while,</l>
               <l>Nor let too specious words your sense beguile.</l>
               <l>My brother's somewhat warm; but, <hi>entre nous,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Might not <hi>Platonic</hi> Wives suit some of you?</l>
               <l>Men fond of hunting, drinking, or <hi>debate,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Would they repine at a <hi>Platonic</hi> mate?</l>
               <l>Their hearts are aliened from domestic life,</l>
               <l>And hounds, or wine, or <hi>party,</hi> are a wife.</l>
               <l>Besides, he argues from the <hi>common laws,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But I in <hi>equity</hi> defend the cause;</l>
               <l>Plead, women are not bound by Nature's rules,</l>
               <l>Nor are their morals borrow'd from the schools:</l>
               <l>How many sacrifice their youthful charms</l>
               <l>To an old, wealthy husband's feeble arms!</l>
               <l>Or yield to titles what they owe to merit,</l>
               <l>Wretched themselves, that children may inherit!</l>
               <l>These sure are <hi>Platonists,</hi> who thus forego</l>
               <l>Nature's true joys for wealth, or rank, or shew!</l>
               <l>Our heroine, tho' she differs wide from these,</l>
               <l>Has but refin'd upon the same disease.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="6"/>
Our auth'ress too, perhaps, to aid her cause,</l>
               <l>May boast herself the great sublime she draws.</l>
               <l>By reason's standard, then, you judge amiss</l>
               <l>Of those whose legislator is <hi>caprice:</hi>

               <l>I therefore <hi>crave exception</hi> for this night,</l>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady FANSHAW.</speaker>
                  <p>Why really, Clarinda, I look upon it, that next to the felicity of widowhood is that of being sepa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rated. However, there are, my dear, some mate<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rial differences: While the tyrant lives to whom we have been bound, we never can forget we have been slaves. There are, besides, some other dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>agreeable circumstances which attend a separation, from which, thank Heaven, my state is free.</p>

               <sp>

                  <speaker>CLARINDA.</speaker>
                  <p>You mean, I suppose, the power a husband has of withdrawing alimony, in case of indiscretion, and forcing the wretched wife upon certain <hi>moyens de vivre,</hi> whether she will or no.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady FANSHAW.</speaker>
                  <p>True. Now you know that since that Gothic statute of the Black-Ram, in the North-west Rid<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, has been abolished, we widows may chuse what hobby-horse we please; sometimes, for varie<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty, perhaps an ass; but oh! defend me from a mule, 'tis so vastly like a husband.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CLARINDA.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh! the happiest simile in the world: for, on my conscience, they seem equally to be deviations from the laws of nature. However, when broke, from restiveness, they are the best pack-saddle am<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blers in the world.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady FANSHAW.</speaker>
                  <p>But now, my dear Clarinda, that we have got this pretty little bird out of its cage, what think you will it do with its freedom? 'Tis vastly wild, and will, I imagine, take flight to some Arcadian grove, and sit and sing alone.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CLARINDA.</speaker>
                  <p>O no; that must not be: it would disgrace our generalship. She dies for sentimental passion; and when once her romance is known, I warrant we shall be able to supply her with pretenders enough, who may assume by turns, the crook and scrip, the helmet and the lance, to hold her in play. Nay, piqued as she was at what she stiled lord Frank<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land's indifference toward her, I am persuaded that if one tender tear had but glistened in his eye, at the instant of their separation, she would have sunk into his arms, and like the plaintive turtle, have
<pb n="3" facs="10"/>
moaned and cooed away the remainder of her life, in true conjugal insipidity.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady FANSHAW.</speaker>
                  <p>I am surprized this did not happen, for I am quite of opinion that lord Frankland loves her.</p>

                  <speaker>CLARINDA.</speaker>
                  <p>He certainly does; but then he did not deify her. My lord knows himself to be a mere mortal man, and has not the presumption of lxion, to cope with goddesses.</p>

                  <p>I dare not indulge the hope; but I shall endea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vour though, to lay every obstacle in the way to their re-union. Lady Frankland is young and handsome; she may be virtuous too; but how long that same fortress, called Chastity, will hold out when besieged by flattery, the love of which is her chief foible, I cannot say.</p>

                  <p>Why just as long, Clarinda, as any other fortress, where the governor loves money, and the besiegers come up to his price. But among those who either are, or pretend to be, her adorers, I cannot yet per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceive that she has shewn the smallest preference; and I really believe that she admires Alexander, Cy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rus, or Orondates, more than any man alive.</p>

fifteen hundred; but the same man, heir to lord Frankland's rank and fortune, sounds well enough.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>EMILIA.</speaker>
                  <p>Bless me, what had stars to do in that case?—unless you mean stars and garters; and I dare say his lordship might easily have obtained a red ribbon, at least, if that could have rendered you happy.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady FRANKLAND.</speaker>
                  <p>My dear wild girl, you have wandered very far from my meaning. When I accused my fate, in order to excuse my lord, it was for not having af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>forded me some glorious opportunity of manifest<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing a passion for him, by some noble, generous deed, which must have extorted his admiration, his gratitude, and love. For, to deal candidly, what right had I to have expected that lord Frankland should be a passionate lover? what sacrifice had I made him? by what heroic devotement had I awakened the sensibility of his soul? where was the merit of having obeyed my parents, and accepted for an husband one, to whom I could possibly have no exception?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>EMILIA.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, my dear lady Frankland, you talk strange<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly, and put me in mind of a young lady of my ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quaintance, deeply versed in romance, who, with a
<pb n="12" facs="19"/>
large fortune, ran away with an ensign; but when they had got clear off, she would not be content unless he returned and suffered her to leap out of a window to him: The experiment was made, and the poor lady discovered, and confined, till a more suitable match could be found out for her.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady FRANKLAND.</speaker>
                  <p>With which, I suppose, she was miserable for life. Why should love meddle in matches of con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venience? Oh, ye delights of sensible souls! charms of impassioned hearts! where are ye? alas! in free and independent love alone, in the mutual yield<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing of two fond hearts, which have bestowed them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>EMILIA.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, for Heaven's sake, dear lady Frankland, don't run on at this rate! I vow I am frightened lest you should tempt me to throw away myself and fortune, upon some beggar in pursuit of these same transports, which, after all, I do not believe are to be found any where but in the heated imagination of some poet or romance-monger.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady FRANKLAND.</speaker>
                  <p>I hope that my dear Emilia will experience every happiness which she can wish. I own your reproof is just, and I shall henceforth avoid any discourse that may elevate your notions to such an height, as may perhaps make you feel those bitter pangs of disappointment, which have been my lot.</p>

                  <speaker>EMILIA.</speaker>

                  <p>I thank ye, ladies, for your congratulations; but as yet I confess I do not see of what great advan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tage this same boasted liberty will be of to me. I have really no pursuits to follow, no inclinations to indulge, that need restraint; and to become one's own mistress, at my age, is, I think, a thing rather to be feared than wished.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
                  <p>Why truly, madam, yours is a critical situation. But what is <hi>female</hi> liberty, after all, but a name? for a fine woman can never enjoy it, but in the mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment she renounces it; and it is only worth pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serving, in order to part with it to good purpose.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady FANSHAW.</speaker>
                  <p>I am astonished, Sir Harry, to hear you preach such absurd doctrine: Lady Frankland is very young; her ignorance is therefore pardonable; but give me leave, who have been my own mistress these ten years, to instruct her ladyship in the charms and use of liberty, and I fancy she will find there is something in them more than <hi>a name.</hi>

                  <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
                  <p>Madam, I bow to your superior judgment, and must confess I do not know a more experienced guide, to all the paths of pleasure. You and the gay Clarinda here, would have made notable priest<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>esses,
<pb n="14" facs="21"/>
were the mysteries of the <hi>Bona Dea</hi> now in vogue. But, madam, <stage>[to lady Frankland]</stage> I would not have your ladyship discouraged by what I have said with regard to liberty, for 'tis, doubtless, a most delightful thing to be free.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady FANSHAW.</speaker>
                  <p>True, Sir Harry, provided one knows how to use that freedom; but to run gadding about the world, without meaning or design, is certainly a gross abuse of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
                  <p>Absolute prostitution of our greatest blessing—But, in my opinion, there is but one measure for your ladyship to pursue; to chuse a proper con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ductor, and leave the rest to him. A person, en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dowed with your ladyship's beauty, and delicacy of sentiment, must surely have the choice of many.</p>

                  <p>There lies the difficulty, Sir Harry. When they who wished my happiness, as ardently as I can do, whose judgment and experience were far superior to mine, have erred, what have I not to fear, even in the choice of a mere sentimental friendship, which is all my situation can admit of?</p>

                  <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>

                  <speaker>CLARINDA.</speaker>
                  <p>I swear, for my part, I ever thought it an ill<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>suited match.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, he is really a good sort of man, and sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sible enough too, but unhappily wants taste; not at all cut out for discovering the elegant and re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fined charms of your ladyship's mind. Besides,
<pb n="15" facs="22"/>
really the desire of pleasing an husband, is in gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral so very languid, that a fine woman seldom ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>erts her most amiable qualities, toward him. To charm, to conquer, she reserves for other eyes, and other hearts than his.</p>

                  <p>Indeed, Sir Harry, I should look upon myself as highly culpable, if that had been my case. My ut<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most wish was to inspire lord Frankland with the most delicate passion: How I have failed, I know not!</p>

This French

woman may be of use: She certainly knows her lady's secrets; and it will be very extraordinary, if an Englishman's gold, and an Irishman's kisses, may not be able to open the lock of that curious repo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sitory.

                  <speaker>Sir WILLIAM.</speaker>
                  <p>It is impossible to divest a lover of the fond hope of being pitied, at least, by the object he adores; and while he confines his wishes within that bound, he is indeed a lover: but when he vainly thinks his services should merit a reward, perhaps incon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sistent with the honour or happiness of the beloved object, self-love assumes the place of passion, and it no longer deserves even the name.</p>

I dare say you may be safely trusted with the keeping of them yourself. But, as I most sin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerely wish your happiness, I must say, that I think you would have a better chance for it with any other man, than Mr. Frankland: There is a reserve, even in his gayest manners, that seems to squint suspicion.</p>

                  <p>Helas, ma chere innocente! don't you meet a thousand ghosts in every public place? Bodies without souls, who have haunted the world so long, that they are worn out of every one's remem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brance, and might glide in and out, without ever being taken notice of, if it were not for the space they occupy. Have you never been jostled by a fat red ghost, in the box lobby of the playhouse,
<pb n="37" facs="44"/>
or at the puppet-show cascade at Vauxhall? ha! ha! ha!</p>

                  <speaker>Lady FRANKLAND.</speaker>
                  <p>As they differ in every respect from spirits, I should never have thought of stiling them ghosts, tho', as you have explained it, I own the term is apt enough; yet I fancy that <hi>blanks</hi> would do still better, as some authors have lately used them, merely to make up bulk, and stuff life's volume.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
                  <p>I vow, madam, your ladyship has an infinity of wit, as well as beauty. But now, prithee, dear lady Frankland, what do you seriously mean to do with them both?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady FRANKLAND.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not find myself overburthen'd with either of those rare qualities, Sir Harry; but if I should, I must e'en look out for some good-natured person, who will be kind enough to assist me in bearing the load.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, now your ladyship talks reason. Mutual offices are the very bands of society. And among the croud of adorers, who bow before your shrine, have you yet fixed on one whom you think equal to so blest a charge? I may be impertinent—Your ladyship's blushes seem to hint as much.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady FRANKLAND.</speaker>
                  <p>No, Sir Harry, a heart like mine has nothing to disguise—If I blushed, it was not shame, but pride, that glowed upon my cheek, from the slight notion you seem to have conceived of me, that among the trifling characters which frequent my drawing room, there could be found one capable of attaching my confidence, or regards.</p>

                  <p>Why, that is vastly severe now, when there are such a number of pretty fellows, who dedicate their services to your ladyship. What pains she takes to shew me she is not engaged?</p>

                  <p>It would be the height of vanity in me, to set down their visits to my own account, Sir Harry, while I am blest with a companion in my house, whose mind is free, and person disengag'd, and where each charm that can attract in both, unite in my Emilia.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
                  <p>Faith I have always heard your ladyship reck<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>oned a little romantic, but never believed it till now. Emilia! why we know her price is matri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mony, to become a property for life, egad. And sure no man of spirit would condescend to such terms, unless with a view to lord Frankland's circumstances, madam.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
                  <p>I vow I did not mean it, and ask a thousand pardons—but surely, madam, with that blaze, that glow of youth and beauty which surrounds you, it is impossible you should think of living disengag'd! Were the Hesperian fruit planted in our streets, it would require ten dragons to secure it. Alas! you have not one.</p>

                  <p>I assure your ladyship you are wrong to make a jest of my behaviour to lady Subtle; there are few men of my rank in life, who have either morals, or politeness, sufficient to pay the least regard to a dying reputation.—Now, madam, it has ever been my principle and practice both, never pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lickly to abandon a mistress; and when I have been insufferably tired of a lady, I have kept my chamber, and seen no company for three days to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gether, in order to give her the credit of the rup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture. But you are not to expect such nice morals from the generality of men, I'll assure you, madam.</p>

                  <p>Why truly, madam, I think we are both very near taking a nap; we have wandered from the point strangely; and I ought to beg your lady<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship's pardon, for having made so improper an use of the favour you have indulged me in. Eh donc, ma belle, will you now seriously fix upon the happy man, who is to love and be beloved by you?</p>

                  <p>I am young, perhaps not insensible; but neither my youth nor sensibility shall ever betray me into imprudence.

                  <p>To be short then, her ladyship assumed all the airs of an heroine in romance, talked of constancy, assiduity, friendship, esteem—and modestly gave me to understand, that I must dangle some months, at least, after her, before she could think of re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>warding my labour.

                  <p>That is perhaps, the very reason why they fought about her. A woman in her circumstances, is looked upon as lawful plunder, to which the long<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>est sword gives a title.</p>

                  <p>YOU cannot imagine, my dear Emilia, how much I am shocked at what you have told me. I fear I shall now become a common topic of dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>course. What a triumph for lord Frankland! his character will rise upon the ruin of mine.—Good heaven, what will become of me!</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>EMILIA.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, my dear lady Frankland, you first de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceive yourself, and then argue right, upon wrong principles. You must certainly imagine lord Frank<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land a monster, before you can suppose it possible for him to rejoice at your dishonour. On the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trary, I am certain he would be sensible of the highest concern, were he acquainted even with your present distress.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady FRANKLAND.</speaker>
                  <p>O! do not say so, Emilia, I can bear his resent<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment better than his pity. I fear I have de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>served the one, and am certain I have no claim to the other.</p>

                  <p>You judge too hardly of yourself, my dear; but I have strong hopes that this unlucky affair will never reach his, or any other ears. Sir Harry has nothing to boast of; we may therefore depend on his silence; and I have too good an opinion of Sir William Belville, to suppose him capable of ever

mentioning it; and I would not have your ladyship seem to know one word of the matter.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady FRANKLAND.</speaker>
                  <p>Grant it should remain a secret, Emilia; how painful must my situation be! conscious of the highest obligation, which I must not acknowledge, even to the generous hand that has conferr'd it To a mind open and grateful as mine, this must be torture.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>EMILIA.</speaker>
                  <p>Have a care, lady Frankland, of over-rating the obligation. Sir William knows that your situation cannot admit of a return, and if I am not much deceiv'd with regard to his character, his senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments are too generous to expect one.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady FRANKLAND.</speaker>
                  <p>That may perhaps be one reason for our staying at home, Sir William. I hate crowds of every kind.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir WILLIAM.</speaker>
                  <p>If half the world could entertain themselves or others, as either of you ladies can, there would

scarce be such a thing as a crowd: select parties and rational conversation, would then become the fashion. But when the mind is vacant of ideas; its activity will seek them from outward objects, which strike upon the senses, yet leave no more impression, than our forms do on a looking glass; while the charms of refined sense, and elegant converse, remain indelible upon the soul.</p>

                  <p>For my part, Sir William, I relinquish any share in that very fine compliment, for I confess I have great pleasure in seeing a number of well dressed people together, looking as if they were pleased themselves, and wishing to please others; and I should certainly have been in the park an hour ago, if I had not staid in compliment to her lady<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship.</p>

                  <p>Tho' you modestly refuse it, madam, you have still a part in the eulogium; nor is it for want of ideas in yourself, but to inspire them in others, that you need ever wish to appear in public; and who that sees Emilia, must not be captivated with the pleasing one of sprightly innocence?</p>

                  <p>Do not speak of it, Emilia; my wounds all bleed afresh. There was no way to cure it, nor could we have lived on any terms, but by indulging it to an excess, which must have rendered us both contemptible. I am impatient till you see my wife; alas! all that remains to me of that endearing name, is that fair shadow <stage>[pointing to the picture.]</stage> Let her break off all further commerce with Clarinda, if she regards her own honour, or my peace.</p>

                  <p>I am grieved at thinking what may be the event of this connection. All women who have forfeited their own title to virtue, envy those who possess it; and would wish to sink them to their own base level. I am certain lady Frankland is virtuous, open, and sincere. But alas! what arms are these, to combat the charms of flattery, the attractions of
<pb n="61" facs="68"/>
pleasure, and the snares of seduction! should she sink under them. I surely am to blame, who have exposed her youth and inexperience to a trial, per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps too hard. But should she pass this more than ordeal fire, unsullied and unhurt, she will be something more than woman; and adoration, late her claim, will then become her due. I'll hope the best.</p>

                  <p>Why, that same doughty knight-errant, you have named, took it into his wise head, that be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause a certain fair lady had never allowed him a tête à tête, she never meant to indulge herself, or any body else, with one; and upon my declaring that she had done me that favour, talked in a high, ridiculous, romantic strain of the lady's honour and character; and seemed to hint as if he suspected me of a falsehood.

                  <p>O, by no means, Sir Harry. However, I have not quite so much pity for you, as I had, as you were paid, I suppose, before-hand. A tête à tête with lady Frankland, was, I think, an over-pay<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment for the slight scratch you have received.

                  <p>Why now, my dear Clarinda, there's the mis-chief on't. I had nothing to boast of; for this same petite partie ended in a very absurd proposal on her side, for entering into the Platonic system, which I positively refused. Car je n'ai pas le tems.

                  <p>Very absurd and ridiculous, truly! Equally so, on both sides. I never could have supposed, that a man who knows the world, as well as you have a right to do, could have slipp'd such an opportu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity, so simply. Ha, ha, ha.</p>

                  <p>Why faith, Clarinda, there is a kind of bashful courage about those modest dames, that is capable of putting the most impudent fellow in the world out of countenance; and tho' I was never in better spirits for an attack, she talked so queerly of friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship, esteem, honour, and such stuff, that she left me little to say, and less to do; so I e'en quitted the field, and marched off.</p>

                  <p>Delusion all! they never yet existed in your breast; self-love alone assumed the form of senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mental passion, and has imposed on you, but never shall again on me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir WILLIAM.</speaker>
                  <p>Cruel, unkind! vain metaphysical distinction! you know I would sacrifice a thousand lives to please you, detach myself from the whole uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verse, and give up every thought to you, and you alone! Is this self-love?</p>

                  <p>True love requires no sacrifice, but the heart; self love must have its triumphs: suspicion is its constant mate, and the least degree of complaisance shewn to another object, appears a robbery to selfish minds.

                  <p>Sir William, I shall ever acknowledge the high<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>est obligations to you; you have drawn me from the verge of a precipice, into which my own im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prudence had like to have plunged me—I awake from an illusion, and can dream no more—Be my friend still, this is the only rank that you can ever hold in my regards.</p>

                  <p>Far from it, Sir William; I wish your happi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, so far as it may not be inconsistent with my own; and by depriving you of all right to be jealous, I lay you under the happy necessity of ceasing to be so.

                  <p>I begin to know you, Madam, in my turn; the refinement of a platonic passion, but ill agrees with the slightness of your conduct. Sir Harry Wilmot would have been a more suitable lover, and I was certainly wrong to interfere—</p>

                  <p>MY dearest Emilia, I have now opened my whole soul to you. My mind is a perfect chaos; yet I feel as if a weight had been taken off my breast, by this most fortunate breach with Sir William. Oh, my Emilia, how near have I been to ruin! I am frighted even at the prospect.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>EMILIA.</speaker>
                  <p>You should contemplate it rather, with that kind of pleasure, with which they view the wreck, who have just escaped the storm, with a proper sense toward providence, and a steady purpose never to run the same risque again.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady FRANKLAND.</speaker>
                  <p>Humbled as I now am, Emilia, such resolutions are natural, and bare remembrance of the peril I've escaped, must certainly insure my perseverance. But alas, my friend, have I not reason to accuse my fate, for turning those advantages, which are deemed a blessing to my sex, into a curse for me! youth, beauty, innocence, and sensibility, to what have ye reduced me! to become the sport of fop<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pery, or victim of jealousy! Is this the world I have been taught to admire? For what illusions have I strayed from real happiness, which I am now convinced is only to be found, in the calm in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dulgence
<pb n="74" facs="81"/>
of rational affections. In the repose, rather than tumult of the soul.</p>

                  <speaker>EMILIA.</speaker>
                  <p>I rejoice to find that the natural good sense of my amiable friend has been only hoodwinked, but not blinded, and that she can so clearly see her errors now</p>

                  <speaker>Lady FRANKLAND.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, wretch that I am! I see them but too late; after I have forfeited the friendship, the confidence, and regards, of the best of men and husbands! thank heaven, though, that I have nothing to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proach myself with, except imprudence; and yet, Emilia, can I hope that Lord Frankland should take my word for this, or even condescend to listen to my justification? How I detest the writers of romance! Oh, Emilia, 'tis but too easy to swerve from the right path, but difficult indeed to recover it again.</p>

                  <speaker>EMILIA.</speaker>
                  <p>Why difficult? the little deviation you have made, requires no artful clue. There are no bars against you, but those your fears create. Lord Frankland is still the same tender, affectionate husband he has ever been, and gave a proof of it this morning, by requesting you to quit all farther intimacy with Clarinda, whom he seems to think no safe companion for your honour.</p>

escaped from many dangers yet unknown. Nor can a wife e'er find a place of safety, but under the protection of that heaven-appointed guard, her husband.

                  <speaker>Lady FANSHAW.</speaker>
                  <p>Why then, in plainer English, Sir William is grown jealous, and will, if possible, prevent any other man from coming near her. By this means, she will find herself prisoner, and may then probably surrender her person, to obtain her liberty, en parole, at least.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady FANSHAW.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, but you understand me, for all that, Clarinda. You know full well that when a woman puts herself into the power of a man, he becomes a tyrant, she a slave, from that moment; and all the difference I can find, between marriage and gallan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try, is, that one is perpetual, the other temporary, only.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CLARINDA.</speaker>
                  <p>I care not by what means her ruin is accom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plished, provided it be accomplished. Her fatal marriage with Lord Frankland, blasted all my
<pb n="79" facs="86"/>
hopes, and I cannot bear to think that she should taste the heart-felt joy of her own virtue, while I am de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prived of that, as well as of what I resigned it for.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady FANSHAW.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, as to that Clarinda, it is no such mighty matter, that one need wish to rob her of it, for we both know with regard to the world, the appearance will answer, as well as the reality. But if you are bent upon her ruin, blast her reputation, my dear—The story you told me of the duel, pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perly managed, is sufficient to do that effectually.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>CLARINDA.</speaker>
                  <p>That alone shall destroy her fame, should she even preserve her chastity, which you seem to think improbable.</p>

                  <speaker>Lady FANSHAW.</speaker>
                  <p>I have half a score visits to make to morrow morning and I shall take care to whisper this ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venture in every one of them, with the tenderest professions of pity for her misfortune, and a <q>who could have suspected it? I vow I thought her perfectly innocent, but I am afraid lord Frankland had his reasons—though he had too much pride to publish them,</q>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CLARINDA.</speaker>
                  <p>This will do, my dear Lady Fanshaw; for let women value themselves ever so much upon their in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nocence, the loss of character is next to that of virtue.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lady FANSHAW.</speaker>
                  <p>O much worse, Clarinda—But I must go and visit that simple Sir Harry, as he is confined; I own I despise him, but to persons of certain ranks in life, one must be civil, you know.</p>

                  <p>I shall send to know if Lady Frankland be at home. If she is, I'll pay her a visit; perhaps Sir William may be there, and I may possibly discover something to corroborate our story. But that silly chit Emilia never leaves her, so that the woman wants opportunity, were she ever so well inclined—I wish that girl was any how out of the way.</p>

                  <p>I shall ever consider it as the greatest happiness of my life, that it has been in my power to render you any, madam; and if it might not appear to be presuming too much upon the present incident, I should intreat you to accept all the future services of my life. I rejoice to find your ladyship has led the way into the only path to real happiness.</p>

                  <p>If your ladyship thinks you have any, 'tis in your power to overpay them now, by joining me to request the fair Emilia to accept my hand and heart. Both your ladyship and I have seen the error of imagining they can be separated.</p>

                  <p>Too true, Sir; I made his vile accomplice, trem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bling and scared, convey me to the place where he lay concealed; but when he saw me stand before him, guilt and confusion flashed into his face—He thought it was an apparition, and stiffened quite with horror. I closed upon him instantly, and seized the pistols which lay by his side. He then fell on his knees, confessed his crime, and begged that I would give him from my hand, that death which he deserved.</p>
