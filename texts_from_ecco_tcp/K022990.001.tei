                  <p>IT was certainly a great Satisfaction to me to see and converse with a Man, whom in his Writings I had so long known with Pleasure: But it was a high addition to it, to hear you, at our very first meeting, doing justice to your dead friend Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi> I was not so happy as to know him; <hi>Virgilium tantum vidi</hi>—Had I been born early enough, I must have known and lov'd him: For I have been assur'd, not only by your self, but by Mr.
<pb n="2" facs="2"/>
                     <hi>Congreve</hi> and Sir <hi>William Trumbul,</hi> that his personal Qualities were as amiable as his Poetical, notwithstanding the many libel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous Misrepresentations of them (against which the former of these Gentlemen has told me he will one day vindicate him <note place="bottom" n="a">He since did so, in his Dedication to the Duke of <hi>New<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>castle,</hi> prefix'd to <hi>Tonson</hi>'s <hi>Duodecimo</hi> Edition of <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Plays, 1717.</note>) I suppose those Injuries were begun by the Violence of Party, but 'tis no doubt they were continu'd by Envy at his success and fame: And those Scriblers who attack'd him in his latter times, were only like Gnats in a Summer's evening, which are never very troublesome but in the finest and most glorious Season; (for his fire, like the Sun's, shin'd clearest towards its set<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ting.)</p>
                  <p>You must not therefore imagine, that when you told me of my own perfor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mances that they were above those Cri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticks, I was so vain as to believe it; and yet I may not be so humble as to think my self quite below their notice. For Critics, as they are Birds of Prey, have ever a na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tural inclination to Carrion: And though such poor Writers as I, are but Beggars, however no Beggar is so poor but he can keep a Cur, and no Author is so beggarly but he can keep a Critic. So I'm far from
<pb n="3" facs="3"/>
thinking the Attacks of such people either any honour or dishonour, even to me, much less to Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi> I think with you, that whatever lesser Wits have risen since his Death, are but like Stars appearing when the Sun is set, that twinkle only in his absence, and with the Rays they have borrowed from him. Our Wit (as you call it) is but Reflexion or Imitation, there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore scarce to be call'd ours. True Wit I believe, may be defin'd a Justness of Thought, and a Facility of Expression; or (in the Midwives phrase) a perfect Conception, with an easy Delivery. However this is far from a compleat definition; pray help me to a better, as I doubt not you can.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been so busy of late in cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>recting and transcribing some of my Madrigals, for a great Man or two who desir'd to see them, that I have (with your Pardon) omitted to return you an Answer to your most ingenious Letter: So Scrib<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lers to the Publick, like Bankers to the Pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lick, are profuse in their voluntary Loans
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
to it, whilst they forget to pay their more private and particular, as more just Debts, to their best and nearest Friends. How<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever, I hope, you who have as much good Nature as good Sense, (since they gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rally are Companions) will have Patience with a Debtor, who you think has an In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clination to pay you his Obligations, if he had wherewithal ready about him; and in the mean time should consider, when you have oblig'd me beyond my present Power of returning the Favour, that a Debtor may be an honest Man, if he but intends to be just when he is able, tho' late. But I should be less just to you, the more I thought I could make a Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn to so much Profuseness of Wit and Humanity together; which tho' they sel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom accompany each other, in other Men, are in you so equally met, I know not in which you most abound. But so much for my Opinion of you, which is, that your Wit and Ingenuity is equal'd by no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing but your Judgment, or Modesty; which (though it be to please my self) I must no more offend, than I can do either right.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I will say no more now of them, than that your good Wit ne'er for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>feited your good Judgment, but in your Partility to me and mine; so that if it
<pb n="3" facs="5"/>
were possible for a harden'd Scribbler to be vainer than he is, what you write of me would make me more conceited, than what I scribble my self; yet I must confess I ought to be more humbled by your Praise than exalted; which commends my little Sense with so much more of yours, that I am disparag'd and dishearten'd by your com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mendations; who give me an Example of your Wit in the first Part of your Letter, and a Definition of it in the last: to make writing well (that is like you) more dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficult to me than ever it was before. Thus the more great and just your Example and Definition of Wit are, the less I am capa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble to follow them. Then the best way of shewing my Judgment, after having seen how you write, is to leave off writing; and the best way to shew my Friendship to you, is to put an end to your Trouble, and to conclude</p>

                  <p>WHEN I write to you, I foresee a long Letter, and ought to beg your
<pb n="4" facs="6"/>
Patience beforehand; for if it proves the longest, it will be of course the worst I have troubled you with. Yet to express my Gratitude at large for your obliging Letter, is not more my Duty than my Interest; as some People will abundantly thank you for one Piece of Kindness, to put you in mind of bestowing another. The more favourable you are to me, the more distinctly I see my Faults; Spots and Blemishes you know, are never so plainly discovere'd as in the brightest Sun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shine. Thus I am mortified by those Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mendations which were design'd to encou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rage me: for Praise to a young Wit, is like Rain to a tender Flower; if it be mode<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rately bestow'd, it chears and revives, but if too lavishly, overcharges and depresses him. Most Men in years, as they are ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nerally discouragers of Youth, are like old Trees, that being past Bearing themselves, will suffer no young Plants to flourish be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neath them: But as if it were not enough to have out-done all your Coaevals in Wit, you will excel them in good Nature too. As for my <note place="bottom" n="a">His <hi>Pastorals,</hi> written at 16 Years of Age.</note> green Essays, if you find any pleasure in 'em, it must be such as a Man naturally takes in observing the first Shoots and Buddings of a Tree which he
<pb n="5" facs="7"/>
has rais'd himself: and 'tis impossible they should be esteem'd any otherwise, than as we value Fruits for being early, which ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vertheless are the most insipid, and the worst of the Year. In a word, I must blame you for treating me with so much Compliment, which is at best but the Smoak of Friendship. I neither write, nor con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verse with you, to gain your Praise but your Affection. Be so much my Friend as to appear my Enemy, and tell me my Faults, if not as a young Man, at least as an un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>experienc'd Writer.</p>

                  <p>YOUR Letter of the Twenty-fifth of <hi>March</hi> I have receiv'd, which was more welcome to me than any thing cou'd be out of the Country, tho' it were one's Rent due that Day: and I can find no fault with it, but that it charges me with Want of Sincerity, or Justice, for giving you your Due; who shou'd not let your Modesty be so unjust to your Merit, as to reject
<pb n="6" facs="8"/>
what is due to it, and call that Compliment which is so short of your desert, that it is rather degrading than exalting you. But if Compliment be the Smoak only of Friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship (as you say) however you must allow there is no Smoak but there is some Fire; and as the Sacrifice of Incense offer'd to the Gods wou'd not have been half so sweet to others, if it had not been for its Smoak; so Friendship like Love, cannot be without some Incense, to perfume the Name it wou'd praise and immortalize. But since you say you do not write to me to gain my <hi>Praise,</hi> but my <hi>Affection,</hi> pray how is it possible to have the one without the other? We must admire before we love. You affirm, you would have me so much your Friend as to appear your Enemy, and find out your Faults rather than your Perfections: But (my Friend) that would be so hard to do, that I who love no Difficulties, can't be persuaded to it. Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sides, the Vanity of a Scribbler is such, that he will never part with his own Judgment to gratify another's; especially when he must take Pains to do it: And tho' I am proud to be of your Opinion, when you talk of any Thing, or Man but your self, I cannot suffer you to murther your fame, with your own hand, without opposing you; especially when you say your last Let<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter
<pb n="7" facs="9"/>
is the worst (since the longest) you have favoured me with; which I therefore think the best, as the longest Life (if a good one) is the best, as it yields the more Variety and is more Exemplary; as a chearful Summer's Day, tho' longer than a dull one in the Winter, is less tedious and more entertain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing: Therefore let but your Friendship be like your Letter, as lasting as it is agreeable, and it can never be tedious, but more ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceptable and obliging to</p>

                  <p>I HAVE receiv'd yours of the Fifth, wherein your Modesty refuses the just Praise I give you, by which you lay claim to more, as a Bishop gains his Bishoprick by saying he will not Episcopate: But I must confess, whilst I displease you by commend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing you, I please my self; just as Incense is sweeter to the Offerer than the Deity to whom 'tis offered, by his being so much above it: For indeed, every Man partakes of the Praise he gives, when it is so justly given.</p>

As to my enquiry after your Intrigues with the <hi>Muses,</hi> you may allow me to make it, since no old Man can give so young, so great, and able a Favourite of theirs, Jea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lousy. I am, in my Enquiry, like old Sir <hi>Bernard Gascoign,</hi> who us'd to say, That when he was grown too old to have his Visits admitted alone by the Ladies, he always took along with him a young Man, to ensure his Welcome to them; who, had he come alone had been rejected, only because his Visits were not scandalous to them. So I am (like an old Rook, who is ruin'd by Gaming) forc'd to live on the good For<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tune of the pushing young Men, whose Fancies are so vigorous, that they ensure their Success in their Adventures with the Muses, by their Strength of Imagination.</p>
                  <p>—Your Papers are safe in my Custody (you may be sure) from any one's Theft but my own; for 'tis as dangerous to trust a Scribbler with your Wit, as a Gamester with the Custody of your Money.—If you happen to come to Town, you will make it more difficult for me to leave it, who am, dear Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi>

You must give me leave at once to wave all your Compliments, and to collect only this in general from 'em, that your Design is to encourage me. But I separate from all the rest that Paragraph or two, in which you make me so warm an Offer of your Friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship. Were I possess'd of That, it would put an End to all those Speeches with which you now make me blush; and change them to wholsome Advices, and free Sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timents, which might make me wiser and happier. I know 'tis the general Opinion, that Friendship is best contracted betwixt Persons of equal Age: but I have so much Interest to be of another Mind, that you must pardon me if I cannot forbear telling you a few Notions of mine, in opposition to that Opinion.</p>
                  <p>In the first place 'tis observable, that the Love we bear to our Friends is generally caused by our finding the same Dispositions in them, which we feel in our selves. This is but Self-love at the Bottom: Whereas the Affection betwixt People of different Ages cannot well be such, the Inclinations of such
<pb n="10" facs="12"/>
being commonly various. The Friendship of two young Men is often occasioned by Love of Pleasure or Voluptuousness, each being desirous, for his own sake, of one to assist or incourage him in the Courses he pursues; as that of two old Men is fre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently on the score of some Profit, Lucre, or Design upon others: Now, as a young Man who is less acquainted with the Ways of the World, has in all probability less of Interest; and an old Man who may be weary of himself, less of Self-love; so the Friendship between them is the more likely to be true, and unmix'd with too much Self-regard. One may add to this, that such a Friendship is of greater Use and Advantage to both; for the old Man will grow more gay and agreeable to please the young one; and the young Man more discreet and pru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dent by the help of the old one; so it may prove a Cure of those epidemical Diseases of Age and Youth, Sourness and Madness. I hope you will not need many Arguments to convince you of the Possibility of this; One alone abundantly satisfies me, and con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vinces to the very Heart; which is, that <hi>I am,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> was at this time about Seventy Years old, Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> under Seventeen.</note>

                  <p>I Shou'd believe my self happy in your good Opinion, but that you treat me so much in a Style of Compliment. It has been observ'd of Women, that they are more subject in their youth to be touch'd with Vanity than Men, on ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count of their being generally treated this way; but the weakest Women are not more so than that weak class of Men, who are thought to pique them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves upon their Wit. The World is ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver wanting, when a Coxcomb is accom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plishing himself, to help to give him the finishing Stroke.</p>
                  <p>Every Man is apt to think his Neigh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bour overstock'd with Vanity, yet I can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not but fancy, there are certain Times, when most people are in a disposition of being inform'd; and 'tis incredible what a vast Good a little Truth might do, spo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ken in such seasons. A very small Alms will do a great kindness, to people in ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tream necessity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="14"/>
I could name an acquaintance of yours, who wou'd at this time think himself more obliged to you for the Information of his Faults, than the Confirmation of his Fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lies. If you would make those the subject of a Letter, it might be as long as I could wish your Letters always were.</p>
                  <p>I do not wonder you have hitherto found some difficulty (as you are pleas'd to say) in writing to me, since you have always chosen the Task of commending me: Take but the other way, and I dare ingage you will find none at all.</p>
                  <p>As for my Verses which you praise so much, I may truly say they had never been the cause of any Vanity in me, ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cept what they gave me when they first occasion'd my acquaintance with you. But I have several times since been in danger of this Vice, as often I mean as I receiv'd any Letters from you.</p>
                  <p>'Tis certain, the greatest magnifying Glasses in the World are a Man's own Eyes, when they look upon his own Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son; yet even in those, I cannot fancy my self so extremely like <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> as you wou'd persuade me: If I must be like him, 'tis you will make me so,
<pb n="13" facs="15"/>
by complimenting me into a better opinion of my self than I deserve: They made him think he was the <hi>Son of Jupiter,</hi> and you assure me I am a Man of Parts. But is this all you can say to my honour? You said ten times as much before, when you call'd me your Friend. After having made me believe I possess'd a share in your af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fection, to treat me with Compliments and sweet Sayings, is like the proceeding with poor <hi>Sancho Panca:</hi> They had persuaded him that he enjoy'd a great Dominion, and then gave him nothing to subsist up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on but <hi>Wafers</hi> and <hi>Marmalade.</hi> In our Days, the greatest obligation you can lay upon a Wit, is to make a Fool of him. For as when Madmen are found incurable, wise Men give them their Way, and please them as well as they can; so when those incorrigible things, Poets, are once irreco<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verably Be-Mus'd, the best way both to quiet them, and secure your selves from the effects of their Frenzy, is to feed their Vanity; (which indeed for the most part is all that is fed in a Poet.)</p>
                  <p>You may believe me, I could be hear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tily glad that all you say were as true, ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ply'd to me, as it wou'd be to your self, for several weighty Reasons; but for none so much, as that I might be to you what you

                  <p>I HAVE now chang'd the Scene from the Town to the Country; from <hi>Will</hi>'s Coffee-House to <hi>Windsor</hi> Forest. I find no other difference than this, betwixt the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon Town-Wits, and the downright Coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try Fools; that the first are pertly in the Wrong, with a little more Flourish and Gaiety, and the last neither in the Right nor the Wrong, but confirmed in a stupid, settled Medium betwixt both. However, methinks these are most in the Right, who quietly and easily resign themselves over to the gentle Reign of Dulness, which the Wits must do at last, tho' after a great deal of Noise, Pother, and Resistance. Ours are a sort of modest, inoffensive People, who neither have Sense, nor pretend to any, but enjoy a jovial Sort of Dulness. They are commonly known in the World by the Name of honest, civil Gentlemen. They live much as they ride, at random; a kind of hunting Life, pursuing with earnestness and hazard, something not worth the catching; never in the way, nor out of it. I can't but prefer Solitude to the Company of all these; for tho' a
<pb n="12" facs="18"/>
Man's self may possibly be the worst Fel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low to converse with in the World, yet one would think the Company of a Person whom we have the greatest regard to, and affection for, could not be very un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pleasant: As a Man in love with a Mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stress, desires no Conversation but hers, so a Man in love with himself, (as most Men are) may be best pleased with his own. Besides, if the truest and most useful Know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge, be the knowledge of our selves, So<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>litude conducing most to make us look into our selves, should be the most instructive State of Life. We see nothing more com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monly, than Men, who for the sake of the circumstantial Part, and meer outside of Life, have been half their Days rambling out of their Nature, and ought to be sent into Solitude to study themselves over again. People are usually spoil'd instead of being taught, at their coming into the World; whereas by being more conversant with Obscurity, without any Pains, they would naturally follow what they were meant for. In a word, if a Man be a Coxcomb, So<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>litude is his best School; and if he be a Fool, it is his best Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>These are good Reasons for my own Stay here, but I wish I could give you any for your coming hither, except that I earnestly invite you. And yet I can't help
<pb n="13" facs="19"/>
saying, I have suffer'd a great deal of dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>content that you do not, tho' I so little merit that you should.</p>
                  <p>I must complain of the shortness of your last: Those who have most Wit, like those who have most Money, are generally most sparing of either.</p>

dispair of seeing you, who, in return to your inviting me to your Forest, invite you to my Forest, the Town; where the Beasts that inhabit, tame or wild, of long Ears or Horns, pursue one another either out of Love or Hatred. You may have the Pleasure to see one Pack of Blood<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hounds pursue another Herd of Brutes, to bring each other to their Fall, which is their whole Sport: Or, if you affect a less bloody Chace, you may see a Pack of Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niels, called <hi>Lovers,</hi> in hot pursuit of a two-legg'd <hi>Vixen,</hi> who only flies the whole low'd Pack to be singled out by one Dog, who runs mute to catch her up the sooner from the rest, as they are making a Noise, to the Loss of their Game.

                  <p>I HAVE receiv'd your kind Letter, with my Paper <note place="bottom" n="*">The same which was printed in the Year 1717, in a <hi>Miscellany</hi> of <hi>Bern. Lintot</hi>'s, and in the present Edition of the Posthumous Works of Mr. <hi>Wycherley.</hi>
                     </note> to Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> corrected. I own you have made more of it by making it less, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> are said to burn half the Spices they bring home to inhance the Price of the remainder, so to be greater Gainers by their Loss, (which is indeed my Case now.) Well; you have prun'd my fading Lawrels of some superfluous, sapless,
<pb n="16" facs="22"/>
and dead Branches, to make the remainder live the longer; thus like your Master <hi>Apollo,</hi> you are at once a Poet and a Physician.</p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, as to my impudent invitation of you to the Town, your good Nature was the first Cause of my confident request; but excuse me, I must (I see) say no more upon this Subject, since I find you a little too nice to be dealt freely with; tho' you have given me some Encouragement to hope, our Friendship (tho' young) might be without Shyness, or criminal Modesty; for a Friend like a Mistress, tho' he is not to be mercenary to be true, yet ought not to refuse a Friend's kindness because it is small or trivial: I have told you (I think) that a <hi>Spanish</hi> Lady said to her poor, po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>etical Gallant, that a Queen if she lay with a Groom, would expect a Mark of his kindness from him, tho' it were but his Curry-comb. But you and I will dispute this Matter when I am so happy as to see you here; and perhaps 'tis the only Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pute in which I might hope to have the better of you.</p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, to make you another Excuse for my boldness in inviting you to Town, I design'd to leave with you some more of my Papers, (since these return so much bet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter out of your Hands than they went from mine) for I intended (as I told you formerly)

                  <p>BY yours of the last Month, you desire me to select, if possible, some Things from the <note place="bottom" n="†">Printed in <hi>Folio,</hi> in the Year 1704.</note> first Volume of your Miscel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lanies, which may be alter'd so as to ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pear again. I doubted your meaning in this; whether it was to pick out the best of those Verses, (as that on the <hi>Idleness of Business;</hi> on <hi>Ignorance;</hi> on <hi>Laziness,</hi> &amp;c.) to make the Method and Numbers exact, and avoid Repetitions? For tho' (upon reading 'em on this occasion) I believe they might receive such an Alteration with Advantage; yet they would not be chang'd so much, but any one would know 'em for the same at first sight. Or if you mean to improve the worst Pieces, which are such as to render them very good, would require a great addition, and almost the entire new writing of them? Or, lastly, if you mean the middle sort, as the Songs and Love-Verses? For these will need only to be shortned, to omit repetition; the Words remaining very little different from what they were before. Pray let me know
<pb n="19" facs="25"/>
your mind in this, for I am utterly at a loss. Yet I have try'd what I could do to some of the <hi>Songs,</hi> 
                     <note place="bottom" n="*">Vid. <hi>better of</hi> Nov. 20, 1707. <hi>a.</hi>
                     </note> and the <hi>Poems</hi> on <hi>Laziness</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> but can't (e'en in my own partial Judgment) think my al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terations much to the purpose. So that I must needs desire you would apply your Care wholly at present, to those which are yet unpublished, of which there are more than enough to make a considerable Volume, of full as good ones, nay, I verily believe, of better than any in Vol. I. which I could wish you would defer, at least 'till you have finish'd these that are yet unprinted.</p>
                  <p>I send you a Sample of some few of these; namely, the Verses to Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> in <hi>his old Age;</hi> your new ones on the <hi>Duke of Marlborough,</hi> and two others. I have done all that I thought could be of advantage to them: Some I have con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tracted, as we do Sun-beams, to improve their Energy and Force; some I have ta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ken quite away, as we take Branches from a Tree, to add to the Fruit; others I have entirely new express'd, and turned more into Poetry. <hi>Donne</hi> (like one of his Suc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessors) had infinitely more Wit than he wanted Versification: for the great dealers
<pb n="20" facs="26"/>
in Wit, like those in Trade, take least Pains to set off their Goods; while the Haberdashers of small Wit, spare for no Decorations or Ornaments. You have com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mission'd me to paint your Shop, and I have done my best to brush you up like your Neighbours. But I can no more pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tend to the Merit of the Production, than a Midwife to the Virtues and good Qua<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lities of the Child she helps into the Light.</p>
                  <p>The few Things I have entirely added, you will excuse; you may take them law<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fully for your own, because they are no more than Sparks lighted up by your Fire; and you may omit them at last, if you think them but Squibs in your Triumphs.</p>

I beg you to peruse my Papers, and select what you think best, or most tolerable, and look over them again; for I resolve suddenly to print some of them, as a harden'd old Gamester will (in spite of all former ill usage by Fortune) push on an ill Hand, in expectation of re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>covering himself; especially, since I have such a <hi>Croupier</hi> or Second to stand by me as Mr. <hi>Pope.</hi>

                  <p>MR. <hi>Engiefyld</hi> being upon his Journey to <hi>London,</hi> tells me I must write to you by him, which I do, not more to comply with his desire, than to gratify my own; tho' I did it so lately by the Mes<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>senger you sent hither: I take it too as an opportunity of sending you the fair Copy of the <hi>Poem</hi> 
                     <note place="bottom" n="a">The Original of it in Blots, and with Figures of the References from Copy to Copy, in Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Hand, is in the <hi>Harley-Library,</hi> among other such <hi>Broüillons</hi> of Mr. <hi>Wy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cherley</hi>'s Poems, corrected by him. <hi>Vid. Lett.</hi> Ap. 10, 1705/6. <hi>Note</hi> (a).</note> on <hi>Dulness,</hi> which was not then finish'd, and which I should not care to hazard by the common Post. Mr. <hi>Englefyld</hi> is ignorant of the Contents, and I hope your prudence will let him re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>main so, for my sake no less than your own: Since if you should reveal any thing of this nature, it would be no wonder Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ports should be rais'd, and there are those (I fear) who would be ready to improve them to my disadvantage. I am sorry you told the great Man, whom you met in the <hi>Court of Requests,</hi> that your Papers were in my hands: No Man alive shall ever know any such thing from me; and
<pb n="25" facs="31"/>
I give you this warning besides, that tho' your self should say I had any way as<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sisted you, I am notwithstanding resolv'd to deny it.</p>
                  <p>The method of the Copy I send you is very different from what it was, and much more regular: For the better help of your Memory, I desire you to compare it by the <hi>Figures</hi> in the Margin, answer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to the same in this Letter. The Poem is now divided into four Parts, mark'd with the literal Figures I. II. III. IV. The first contains the <hi>praise</hi> of Dulness, and shews how upon several suppositions, it passes for 1. Religion. 2. Philosophy. 3. Example. 4. Wit. And 5. The cause of Wit, and the end of it. The second Part contains the <hi>advantages</hi> of Dulness: 1st, In Busi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness; and 2dly, at Court; where the Si<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>militudes of the Byass of a Bowl, and the Weights of a Clock, are directly tend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to illustrate those advantages of Dul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, tho' introduced before in a place where there was no mention made of them; (which was your only objection to my ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ding them.) The third contains the <hi>happi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness</hi> of Dulness in all Stations, and shews in a great many Particulars, that it is so fortunate, as to be esteem'd some good Quality or other in all sorts of People; that it is thought Quiet, Sense, Caution,
<pb n="26" facs="32"/>
Policy, Prudence, Majesty, Valour, Cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumspection, Honesty, &amp;c. The fourth Part I have wholly added, as a Climax which sums up all the <hi>praise, advantage,</hi> and <hi>happiness</hi> of Dulness in a few words, and strengthens them all by the opposition of the <hi>disgrace, disadvantage,</hi> and <hi>unhappiness</hi> of Wit, with which it concludes <note place="bottom" n="b">This is totally omitted in the present Edition: Some of the Lines in the H. M. are these.

                           <l>Thus Dulness, the safe Opiate of the Mind,</l>
                           <l>The last kind refuge weary Wit can find,</l>
                           <l>Fit for all stations, and in each content,</l>
                           <l>Is satisfy'd, secure, and innocent;</l>
                           <l>No pains it takes, and no offence it gives,</l>
                           <l>Un-fear'd, unhated, undisturb'd it lives, &amp;c.</l>

                  <p>Tho' the whole be as short again as at first, there is not one Thought omitted, but what is a Repetition of something in your first Volume, or in this very Paper: Some Thoughts are contracted, where they seem'd encompass'd with too many words; and some new express'd, or added, where I thought there wanted heightning, (as you'll see parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culary in the Simile of the <hi>Clock-Weights;</hi> 
                     <note place="bottom" n="c">
                        <p>It was originally thus express'd: <q>As Clocks run fastest when most Lead is on.</q> We find it so in a Letter of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> to Mr. <hi>Wycherley,</hi> dated <hi>April</hi> 3, 1705. and in a paper of Verses of his, <hi>To the Author of a Poem call'd Successio,</hi> which got out in a Miscellany in 1712, three Years before Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> died, and two after he had laid aside the whole design of publishing any Poems.</p>

and the Versification throughout, is, I be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lieve such, as no Body can be shock'd at. The repeated permissions you give me of dealing freely with you, will (I hope) ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cuse what I have done; for if I have not spar'd you when I thought Severity would do you a kindness, I have not mangled you where I thought there was no absolute need of Amputation. As to Particulars, I can satisfy you better when we meet; in the mean time pray write to me when you can, you cannot too often.</p>

                  <p>YOU may see by my Stile, I had the happiness and satisfaction to receive yesterday (by the hands of that Wagg, Mr. <hi>Englefyld</hi>) your extream kind and obliging Letter of the 20th of this Month; which like all the rest of yours, did at once mor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tify me, and make me vain; since it tells me with so much more Wit, Sense and Kindness than mine can express, that my Letters are always welcome to you. So that even whilst your Kindness invites me to write to you, your Wit and Judgment
<pb n="28" facs="34"/>
forbids me; since I may return you a Let<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter, but never an Answer.</p>
                  <p>Now, as for my owning your assistance to me, in over-looking my unmusical Num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bers, and harsher Sense, and correcting them both, with your Genius, or Judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment; I must tell you I always own it, (in spite of your unpoetick Modesty) who would do with your Friendship as your Charity; conceal your Bounty to magnify the Obligation; and even whilst you lay on your Friend the Favour, acquit him of the Debt: But that shall not serve your turn; I will always own, 'tis my infallible Pope has, or would redeem me from a poetical Damning, the second time; and save my Rhimes from being condemn'd to the Criticks Flames to all Eternity: But (by the Faith you profess) you know your works of Supererrogation, transfer'd upon an humble, acknowledging Sinner, may save even Him; having good Works enough of your own besides, to ensure yours, and their Immortality.</p>
                  <p>And now for the pains you have taken to recommend my <hi>Dulness,</hi> by making it more methodical, I give you a thousand thanks; since true and natural <hi>Dulness</hi> is shown more by its pretence to form and method, as the sprightliness of Wit by its despising both. I thank you a thousand

                  <p>THE Compliments you make me, in regard of any inconsiderable Service I could do you, are very unkind, and do but tell me in other words, that my Friend has so mean an opinion of me, as to think I expect acknowledgments for trifles; which upon my faith I shall equally take amiss, whether made to my self, or to any others. For God's sake, (my dear Friend <hi>Wycherley</hi>) think better of me, and believe I desire no sort of Favour so much, as that of ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ving you, more considerably than I have yet been able to do.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE had yours of the 23d of this Instant, for which I give you many thanks, since I find by it, that even absence (the usual bane of Love, or Friendship) can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not lessen yours no more than mine. <note place="bottom" n="*">Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> had this from Mr. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> after his Enquiry, in these Words. <q rend="inline">"I returned to Town last <hi>Saturday,</hi> and inquiring (as you desir'd) about Mr. <hi>Wycherley,</hi> was told, in two several Places, that he had been very ill, and that he was even gone off our Stage: But I cou'd not ima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gine this report to be true, or that so great a Man could leave the World without its being instructed to lament so considerable a Loss."</q>
                     </note> As to your hearing of my being ill; I am glad,
<pb n="32" facs="38"/>
and sorry for the report: In the first place, glad that it was not true; and in the next sorry that it shou'd give you any disturb<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance, or concern more than ordinary for me; for which as well as your concern for my future well-being or life, I think my self most eternally oblig'd to you; as<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>suring, your concern for either will make me more careful of both. Yet for your sake I love this Life so well, that I shall the less think of the other; but 'tis in your power to ensure my Happiness in one and the other, both by your Society and good Example, so not only contribute to my fe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>licity here, but hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Now as to your Excuse for the plain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness of your Stile, or Letter, I must needs tell you, that Friendship is much more ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceptable to a true Friend than Wit, which is generally false Reasoning; and a Friend's reprimand often shews more Friendship than his compliment: Nay Love, which is more than Friendship, is often seen, by our Friend's correction of our Follies or Crimes. Upon this Test of your Friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship I intend to put you when I return to <hi>London,</hi> and thence to you at <hi>Binfield,</hi> which I hope will be within a Month.</p>
                  <p>Next to the News of your good Health, I am pleas'd with the good News of your going to print some of your Poems, and

proud to be known by them to the Pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lick for your Friend; who intend (perhaps the same way) to be reveng'd of you for your kindness; by taking your Name in vain in some of my future Madrigals: yet so as to let the World know, my love or esteem for you are no more Poetick than my Talent in scribbling.

becomes more Publick; and in spite of Custom will bring Modesty again into Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shion, or at least make her Sister-rivals of this Age, blush for Spite, if not for Shame. As for my stale, antiquated, poetical Puss, whom you would keep in countenance, by saying she has once been tolerable, and wou'd yet pass Muster by a little licking over; it is true that (like most vain anti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quated Jades which have once been passa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble) she yet affects Youthfulness, in her Age, and wou'd still gain a few Admirers, (who the more she seeks, or labours for their liking, are but more her contemners.) Nevertheless, she is resolv'd henceforth to be so cautious as to appear very little more in the World, except it be as an attendant on your Muse, or as a Foil, not a Rival to her Wit, or Fame: So that let your Country<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gentlewoman appear when she will in the World <note place="bottom" n="*">This, and the following Extract, are a full Confutation of the Lying Spirit of <hi>John Dennis</hi> and others, who impudent<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly asserted that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> wrote these Verses on himself, (tho' publish'd by Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> six Years before his Death.)

Methinks <hi>Strada</hi> has given a good De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scription of these kind of Collections; <hi>Nullus hodié mortalium aut nascitur, aut moritur, aut proeliatur, aut rusticatur, aut abit peregrè; aut redit, aut nubit; aut est, aut non est, (nam etiam mortuis isti canunt) cui non illi ea templò cudant Epicoedia, Genethaliaca, Protreptica, Panegyrica, Epi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thalamia, Vaticinia, Propemptica, Saterica, Paroenctica, Noenias, Nugas.</hi> As to the suc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cess which you say my part has met with, it is to be attributed to what you were pleas'd to say of me to the World; which you do well to call your <hi>Prophecy,</hi> since whatever is said in my favour, must be a Prediction of things that are not yet; you, like a true Godfather, engage on my part for much more than ever I can perform. My Pastoral Muse, like other Country Girls, is but put out of Countenance, by what you Courtiers say to her; yet I hope you would not deceive me too far, as knowing that a young Scribler's vanity needs no Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cruits from abroad: for Nature like an in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dulgent Mother, kindly takes care to sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ply
<pb n="39" facs="45"/>
her sons with as much of their own, as is necessary for their Satisfaction. If my Verses should meet with a few flying Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mendations, <hi>Virgil</hi> has taught me that a young Author has not too much reason to be pleas'd with them, when he considers, that the natural consequence of Praise, is Envy and Calumny.

When once a Man has appear'd as a Poet, he may give up his Pretensions to all the rich and thriving Arts: Those who have once made their court to those Mistresses without Portions, the Muses, are never like to set up for Fortunes. But for my part, I shall be satisfy'd if I can lose my Time agreeably this way, without losing my re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>putation: As for gaining any, I am as indifferent in the Matter as <hi>Falstaffe</hi> was, and may say of <hi>Fame</hi> as he did of <hi>Honour, If it comes, it comes unlook'd for; and there's an End on't.</hi> I can be content with a bare saving game, without being thought an Eminent hand, (with which Title <hi>Jacob</hi> has graciously dignify'd his adventurers and vo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>luntiers in Poetry.) <hi>Jacob</hi> creates Poets, as Kings sometimes do Knights, not for their honour, but for money.

                  <p>THE last I receiv'd from you, was dated the 22d of <hi>May.</hi> I take your charitable hint to me very kindly, where<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>in you do like a true Friend, and a true Christian, and I shall endeavour to follow your Advice, as well as your Example,—As for your wishing to see your Friend an Hermit with you, I cannot be said to leave the world, since I shall enjoy in your conversation, all that I can desire of it; nay, can learn more from you alone, than from my long experience of the great, or little vulgar in it.</p>
                  <p>As to the success of your Poems in the late Miscellany, I told you of in my last; (upon my word) I made you no Compli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, for you may be assur'd, that all sorts of Readers like them, except they are

                  <p>MY Letters, so much inferior to yours, can only make up their scarcity of Sense by their number of Lines; which is like the <hi>Spaniards</hi> paying a debt of Gold with a load of brass Money.

                  <p>I HAVE had yours of the 30th of the last Month, which is kinder than I de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sire it shou'd be, since it tells me you cou'd be better pleas'd to be sick again in Town

in my company, than to be well in the Country without it; and that you are more impatient to be depriv'd of Happiness than of Health: yet, my dear Friend, set raillery or compliment aside, I can bear your ab<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sence (which procures your Health and Ease) better than I can your company when you are in Pain: for I cannot see you so without being so too. Your love to the Country I do not doubt, nor do you (I hope) my love to it or you, since there I can en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>joy your company without seeing you in Pain to give me Satisfaction and Pleasure; there I can have you without Rivals or Di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sturbers; without the C<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters" rend="content:_+">

I hope (in point of your good nature) you will have no cruel Charity for those Pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pers of mine, you were so willing to be troubled with; which I take most infinite<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly kind of you, and shall acknowledge with gratitude, as long as I live. No Friend can do more for his Friend than preserving his Reputation (nay not by preserving his Life)
<pb n="45" facs="51"/>
since by preserving his Life he can only make him live about threescore or four<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>score Years; but by preserving his Reputa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, he can make him live as long as the World lasts; so save him from damning, when he is gone to the Devil: Therefore I pray condemn me in private, as the Thieves do their Accomplices in <hi>Newgate,</hi> to save them from condemnation by the Publick. Be most kindly unmerciful to my poetical Faults, and do with my Papers, as you Country-gentlemen do with your Trees, slash, cut, and lop-off the Excres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cencies and dead Parts of my wither'd Bayes, that the little remainder may live the lon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ger, and increase the value of them, by di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>minishing the number. I have troubled you with my Papers rather to give you Pain than Pleasure, notwithstanding your compliment, which says, you take the trou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble kindly: Such is the generosity to your Friends, that you take it kindly to be de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sired by them to do them a kindness; and you think it done to you, when they give you an opportunity to do it to them. Wherefore you may be sure to be troubled with my Letters out of Interest, if not Kindness; since mine to you will procure yours to me, so that I write to you more for my own sake than yours; less to make you think I write well, than to learn from
<pb n="46" facs="52"/>
you to write better. Thus you see Interest in my Kindness, which is like the Friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship of the World, rather to make a Friend than be a Friend; but I am yours, as a true <hi>Plain-dealer.</hi>

                  <p>I AM sorry you persist to take ill my not accepting your Invitation, and to find (if I mistake not) your Exception not unmixt with some Suspicion. Be certain I shall most carefully observe your Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quest, not to cross over, or deface the Copy of your Papers for the future, and only to mark in the Margin the Repetitions: But as this can serve no further than to get rid of those Repetitions, and no way rectify the <hi>Method,</hi> nor <hi>connect</hi> the <hi>Matter,</hi> nor improve the <hi>Poetry</hi> in <hi>Expression</hi> or <hi>Numbers,</hi> without further blotting, adding, and altering; so it really is my opinion, and desire, that you should take your Pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pers out of my hands into your own; and that no Alterations may be made but when

both of us are present; when you may be satisfied with every Blot, as well as every Addition, and nothing be put upon the Papers but what you shall give your own sanction and assent to, at the same time.</p>
                  <p>Do not be so unjust, as to imagine from hence that I would decline any part of this Task: On the contrary you know, I have been at the pains of transcribing some Pieces, at once to comply with your desire of not defacing the Copy, and yet to lose no Time in proceeding upon the Correction.

                  <p>I Return you the <note place="bottom" n="†">Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Pastorals.</note> Papers you favour'd me with, and had sent them to you ye<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sterday morning, but that I thought to have brought them to you last night my self. I have read them over several
<pb n="56" facs="61"/>
times with great satisfaction. The Preface is very judicious and very learned; and the Verses very tender and easy. The Author seems to have a particular Genius for that kind of Poetry, and a Judgment that much exceeds the years you told me he was of. He has taken very freely from the Ancients, but what he has mixt of his own with theirs, is no way inferior to what he has taken from them. 'Tis no flattery at all to say, that <hi>Virgil</hi> had written nothing so good at his Age<note n="*" place="marg">Sixteen.</note>. I shall take it as a favour if you will bring me acquainted with him; and if he will give himself the trouble any morning to call at my House, I shall be very glad to read the Verses over with him, and give him my opinion of the particulars more largely than I can well do in this Letter. I am, <hi>Sir,</hi>

                  <p>I Receiv'd the favour of your Letter, and shall be very glad of the continuance of a correspondence by which I am like to be so great a gainer. I hope when I have the happiness of seeing you again in <hi>London,</hi> not only to read over the Verses I have now of yours, but more that you have written since; for I make no doubt but any one who writes so well, must write more. Not that I think the most voluminous Poets al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ways the best, I believe the contrary is ra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther true. I mention'd somewhat to you in <hi>London</hi> of a <hi>Pastoral Comedy,</hi> which I should be glad to hear you had thought upon since. I find <hi>Menage</hi> in his observa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions upon <hi>Tasso</hi>'s <hi>Aminta,</hi> reckons up four<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>score Pastoral Plays in <hi>Italian:</hi> And in look<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing over my old <hi>Italian</hi> Books, I find a great many Pastorals and Piscatory Plays, which I suppose <hi>Menage</hi> reckons together. I find also by <hi>Menage,</hi> that <hi>Tasso</hi> is not the first that writ in that kind, he mentioning an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>other before him, which he himself had never seen, nor indeed have I. But as the <hi>Aminta, Pastor Fido,</hi> and <hi>Filli di Sciro</hi> of <hi>Bonarelli</hi> are the three best, so I think there
<pb n="58" facs="63"/>
is no dispute but <hi>Aminta</hi> is the best of the three: Not but that the Discourses in <hi>Pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stor Fido</hi> are more entertaining and copious in several peoples opinion, tho' not so pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>per for Pastoral; and the Fable of <hi>Bonarelli</hi> more surprizing. I do not remember many in other Languages, that have written in this kind with success. <hi>Racan</hi>'s <hi>Bergeries</hi> are much inferior to his Lyrick Poems; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are all too full of Conceits. <hi>Rapin</hi> will have the design of Pastoral Plays to be taken from the <hi>Cyclops</hi> of <hi>Euripides.</hi> I am sure there is nothing of this kind in <hi>English</hi> worth mentioning, and therefore you have that Field open to your self. You see I write to you without any sort of con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>straint or method, as things come into my head, and therefore pray use the same free<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom with me, who am, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I Cannot omit the first opportunity of making you my acknowledgments for reviewing those Papers of mine. You have no less right to correct me, than the same hand that rais'd a Tree has to prune it. I am convinc'd as well as you, that one may
<pb n="59" facs="64"/>
correct too much; for in Poetry as in Paint<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, a Man may lay Colours one upon an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>other, till they stiffen and deaden the Piece. Besides to bestow heightning on every part is monstrous: Some parts ought to be lower than the rest; and nothing looks more ri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diculous, than a Work, where the Thoughts, however different in their own nature, seem all on a level: 'Tis like a Meadow newly mown, where <hi>Weeds, Grass,</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> are all laid even, and appear undistinguish'd. I believe too that sometimes our first Thoughts are the best, as the first squeez<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing of the Grapes makes the finest and richest Wine.</p>
                  <p>I have not attempted any thing of Pasto<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral Comedy, because I think the Taste of our Age will not relish a Poem of that sort. People seek for what they call <hi>Wit,</hi> on all subjects, and in all places; not consi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dering that Nature loves Truth so well, that it hardly ever admits of flourishing: <hi>Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceit</hi> is to Nature what <hi>Paint</hi> is to Beauty; it is not only needless, but impairs what it wou'd improve. There is a certain Majesty in Simplicity which is far above all the Quaintness of Wit: insomuch that the Cri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tics have excluded it from the loftiest Poet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry, as well as the lowest, and forbid it to the Epic no less than the Pastoral. I shou'd certainly displease all those who are charm'd
<pb n="60" facs="65"/>
with <hi>Guarini</hi> and <hi>Bonarelli,</hi> and imitate <hi>Tasso</hi> not only in the Simplicity of his Thoughts, but in that of the <hi>Fable</hi> too. If surpri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sing discoveries shou'd have place in the story of a Pastoral Comedy, I believe it wou'd be more agreeable to Probability to make them the effects of <hi>Chance</hi> than of <hi>Design;</hi> Intrigue not being very con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sistent with that Innocence, which ought to constitute a Shepherd's Character. There is nothing in all the <hi>Aminta</hi> (as I re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>member) but happens by meer accident; unless it be the meeting of <hi>Aminta</hi> with <hi>Syl<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>via</hi> at the <hi>Fountain,</hi> which is the contrivance of <hi>Daphne,</hi> and even that is the most simple in the world: The contrary is observable in <hi>Pastor Fido,</hi> where <hi>Corisca</hi> is so perfect a Mistress of Intrigue, that the Plot cou'd not have been brought to pass without her. I am inclin'd to think the Pastoral Come<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dy has another disadvantage, as to the <hi>Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ners:</hi> Its general design is to make us in love with the Innocence of a rural Life, so that to introduce Shepherds of a vicious Chara<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cter must in some measure debase it; and hence it may come to pass, that even the virtuous Characters will not shine so much, for want of being oppos'd to their contra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ries.—These Thoughts are purely my own, and therefore I have reason to doubt
<pb n="61" facs="66"/>
them: but I hope your Judgment will set me right.</p>
                  <p>I wou'd beg your opinion too as to an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>other point: It is how far the liberty of <hi>Borrowing</hi> may extend? I have defended it sometimes by saying, that it seems not so much the Perfection of Sense, to say things that have <hi>never</hi> been said before, as to ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>press those <hi>best</hi> that have been said <hi>oftenest;</hi> and that Writers in the case of borrowing from others, are like Trees which of them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves wou'd produce only one sort of Fruit, but by being grafted upon others, may yield variety. A mutual commerce makes Poetry flourish; but then Poets like Mer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chants, shou'd repay with something of their own what they take from others; not like Pyrates, make prize of all they meet. I de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sire you to tell me sincerely, if I have not stretch'd this Licence too far in these Pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>storals? I hope to become a Critic by your Precepts, and a Poet by your Example. Since I have seen your Eclogues, I cannot be much pleas'd with my own; however you have not taken away all my Vanity, so long as you give me leave to profess my self</p>

                  <p>I Had sooner return'd you thanks for the favour of your Letter, but that I was in hopes of giving you an account at the same time of my Journey to <hi>Windsor;</hi> but I am now forc'd to put that quite off, being en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gag'd to go to my Corporation of <hi>Rich<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mond</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi> I think you are per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fectly in the right in your Notions of Pastoral, but I am of opinion, that the re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dundancy of Wit you mention, tho' 'tis what pleases the common people, is not what ever pleases the best judges. <hi>Pastor Fido</hi> indeed has had more admirers than <hi>Aminta;</hi> but I will venture to say, there is a great deal of difference between the admi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rers of one and the other. <hi>Corisca,</hi> which is a Character generally admir'd by the ordinary judges, is intolerable in a Pastoral; and <hi>Bo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>narelli</hi>'s fancy of making his Shepherdess in love with two men equally, is not to be defended, whatever pains he has taken to do it. As for what you ask of the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Borrowing;</hi> 'tis very evident the best <hi>Latin</hi> Poets have extended this very far; and none so far as <hi>Virgil,</hi> who is the best
<pb n="63" facs="68"/>
of them. As for the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets, if we cannot trace them so plainly, 'tis perhaps because we have none before them; 'tis evi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dent that most of them borrow'd from <hi>Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mer,</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> has been accus'd of burn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing those that wrote before him, that his Thefts might not be discover'd. The best of the modern Poets in all Languages, are those that have the nearest copied the An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cients. Indeed in all the common Subjects of Poetry, the Thoughts are so obvious (at least if they are natural) that whoever writes last, must write things like what have been said before: But they may as well applaud the Ancients for the Arts of eat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing and drinking, and accuse the Moderns of having stol'n those Inventions from them; it being evident in all such cases, that whoever live first, must first find them out. 'Tis true, indeed, when
<q>
                        <l>—unus &amp; alter Assuitur pannus,</l>
                     </q>
when there is one or two bright Thoughts stol'n, and all the rest is quite different from it, a Poem makes a very foolish figure: But when 'tis all melted down together, and the Gold of the Ancients so mixt with that of the Moderns, that none can distin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guish the one from the other, I can never
<pb n="64" facs="69"/>
find fault with it. I cannot however but own to you, that there are others of a dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent opinion, and that I have shewn your Verses to some who have made that obje<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ction to them. I have so much Company round me while I write this, and such a noise in my ears, that 'tis impossible I should write any thing but Nonsense, so must break off abruptly.</p>

                  <p>AT my return from the North I re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceiv'd the favour of your Letter, which had lain there till then. Having been absent about six weeks, I read over your Pastorals again, with a great deal of pleasure, and to judge the better read <hi>Vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gil</hi>'s Eclogues, and <hi>Spenser</hi>'s Calendar, at the same time; and I assure you I continue the same opinion I had always of them. By the little hints you take upon all occa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions to improve them, 'tis probable you
<pb n="65" facs="70"/>
will make them yet better against Winter; tho' there is a mean to be kept even in that too, and a Man may correct his Verses till he takes away the true Spirit of them; especially if he submits to the correction of some who pass for great Critics, by me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chanical Rules, and never enter into the true Design and Genius of an Author. I have seen some of these that would hardly allow any one good Ode in <hi>Horace,</hi> who cry <hi>Virgil</hi> wants fancy, and that <hi>Homer</hi> is very incorrect. While they talk at this rate, one would think them above the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon rate of mortals: but generally they are great admirers of <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Lucan;</hi> and when they write themselves, we find out all the Mystery. They scan their Verses upon their Fingers; run after Conceits and glaring Thoughts; their Poems are all made up of Couplets, of which the first may be last, or the last first, without any sort of prejudice to their Works; in which there is no Design, or Method, or any thing Natural or Just. For you are certainly in the right, that in all Writings whatsoever (not Poetry only) <hi>Nature</hi> is to be follow'd; and we shou'd be jealous of our selves for being fond of <hi>Similies, Conceits,</hi> and what they call saying <hi>Fine Things.</hi> When we were in the North, my Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> shew'd
<pb n="66" facs="71"/>
me a Letter he had receiv'd from a certain great <note place="bottom" n="*">The Earl of <hi>P.</hi>
                     </note> General in <hi>Spain;</hi> I told him I wou'd by all means have that General recall'd, and set to writing here at home, for it was im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>possible that a Man with so much Wit as he shew'd, cou'd be fit to command an Army, or do any other Business. As for what you say of Expression: 'tis indeed the same thing to Wit, as Dress is to Beau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty; I have seen many Women over-drest, and several look better in a careless Night-gown, with their hair about their ears, than Mademoiselle <hi>Spanheim</hi> drest for a Ball. I do not design to be in <hi>London</hi> till towards the Parliament: then I shall certainly be there; and hope by that time you will have finisht your Pastorals as you would have them appear in the world, and particularly the third of <hi>Autumn</hi> which I have not yet seen. Your last Eclogue be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing upon the same Subject as that of mine on Mrs. <hi>Tempest</hi>'s Death, I shou'd take it very kindly in you to give it a little turn, as if it were to the Memory of the same Lady, if they were not written for some particular Woman whom you wou'd make immortal. You may take occasion to shew the difference between Poets Mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stresses, and other Men's. I only hint this,

which you may either do, or let alone just as you think fit. I shall be very much pleas'd to see you again in Town, and to hear from you in the mean time. I am with very much esteem,</p>

                  <p>AFter the Thoughts I have already sent you on the subject of <hi>English</hi> Versifi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cation, you desire my opinion as to some farther particulars. There are indeed cer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain Niceties, which tho' not much observed even by correct Versifiers, I cannot but think deserve to be better regarded.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not enough that nothing offends the Ear, but a good Poet will adapt the ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry Sounds, as well as Words, to the things he treats of. So that there is (if one may express it so) a Style of Sound. As in de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scribing a gliding Stream, the Numbers shou'd run easy and flowing; in describing a rough Torrent or Deluge, sonorous and swel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ling,
<pb n="66" facs="73"/>
and so of the rest. This is evident every where in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and no where else that I know of to any observable degree. The following Examples will make this plain, which I have taken from <hi>Vida.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Molle viam tacito lapsu per levia radit.</l>
                     <l>Incedit tardo molimine subsidendo.</l>
                     <l>Luctantes ventos, tempestatesque sonoras.</l>
                     <l>Immenso cum praecipitans ruit Oceano Nox.</l>
                     <l>Telum imbelle sine ictu, Conjecit.</l>
                     <l>Tolle moras, cape saxa manu, cape robora Pastor,</l>
                     <l>Ferte citi flammas data tela, repellite pestem.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>This, I think, is what very few observe in practice, and is undoubtedly of wonder<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful force in imprinting the Image on the reader: We have one excellent Example of it in our Language, Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Ode on St. <hi>Caecilia</hi>'s Day, entitled, <hi>Alexander</hi>'s <hi>Feast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Every nice Ear, must (I believe) have observ'd, that in any smooth <hi>English</hi> Verse of ten syllables, there is naturally a <hi>Pause</hi> at the fourth, fifth, or sixth syllable. It is
<pb n="67" facs="74"/>
upon these the Ear rests, and upon the ju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dicious Change and Management of which depends the Variety of Versification. For example,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>At the fifth.</hi> Where-e'er thy Navy ‖ spreads her canvass Wings,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>At the fourth.</hi> Homage to thee ‖ and Peace to all she brings.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>At the sixth.</hi> Like Tracts of Leverets ‖ in Morning Snow.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Now I fancy, that to preserve an exact Harmony and Variety, the Pauses of the 4th or 6th shou'd not be continu'd above three lines together, without the Interpo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sition of another; else it will be apt to wea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry the Ear with one continu'd Tone, at least it does mine: That at the 5th runs quicker, and carries not quite so dead a weight, so tires not so much tho' it be continued longer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another nicety is in relation to <hi>Exple<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tives,</hi> whether Words or Syllables, which are made use of purely to supply a vacan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cy: <hi>Do</hi> before Verbs plural is absolutely such; and it is not improbable but future Refiners may explode <hi>did</hi> and <hi>does</hi> in the same manner, which are almost always
<pb n="68" facs="75"/>
used for the sake of Rhime. The same Cause has occasioned the promiscuous use of <hi>You</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> to the same Person, which can never sound so graceful as either one or the other.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I would also object to the Irruption of <hi>Alexandrine</hi> Verses of twelve syllables, which I think should never be allow'd but when some remarkable Beauty or Propriety in them attones for the Liberty: Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has been too free of these, especially in his latter Works. I am of the same opinion as to <hi>Triple Rhimes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. I could equally object to the <hi>Repetition</hi> of the same Rhimes within four or six lines of each other, as tiresome to the Ear thro' their Monotony.</p>

To come to the <hi>Hiatus,</hi> or Gap be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween two words which is caus'd by two Vowels opening on each other (upon which you desire me to be particular) I think the rule in this case is either to use the <hi>Caesura,</hi> or admit the <hi>Hiatus,</hi> just as the Ear is least
<pb n="69" facs="76"/>
shock'd by either: For the <hi>Caesura</hi> some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>times offends the Ear more than the <hi>Hiatus</hi> itself, and our language is naturally over<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>charg'd with Consonants: As for example; If in this Verse,
<q>
                        <l>The Old have Int'rest ever in their Eye,</l>
                     </q>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hiatus</hi> which has the worst effect, is when one word ends with the same Vowel that begins the following; and next to this, those Vowels whose sounds come nearest to each other are most to be avoid<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed. O, A, or U, will bear a more full and graceful Sound than E, I, or Y. I know some people will think these Observations trivial, and therefore I am glad to corro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>borate them by some great Authorities, which I have met with in <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Quin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tilian.</hi> In the fourth Book of Rhetoric to <hi>Herennius,</hi> are these words: <hi>Fugiemus cre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bras Vocalium concursiones, quae vastam at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>que hiantem reddunt orationem; ut hoc est, Baccae aeneae amaenissimae impendebant.</hi> And Quintilian <hi>l.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Vocalium concursus cum accidit, hiat &amp; intersistit, at quasi la<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>borat oratio.

Theopompum reprehendunt, quod eas literas tanto opere fugerit, etsi idem magister ejus Isocrates:</hi> which last Author, as <hi>Turnebus</hi> on <hi>Quintilian</hi> observe, has hardly one <hi>Hia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tus</hi> in all his Works. <hi>Quintilian</hi> tells us that <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Demosthenes</hi> did not much observe this Nicety, tho' <hi>Tully</hi> himself says in his Orator, <hi>Crebra ista Vocum concursio, quam magna ex parte vitiosam, fugit Demosthenes.</hi> If I am not mistaken, <hi>Malherbe</hi> of all the Moderns has been the most scrupulous in this point; and I think <hi>Menage</hi> in his Ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>servations upon him says, he has not one in his Poems. To conclude, I believe the <hi>Hi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tus</hi> should be avoided with more care in Poetry than in Oratory; and I would con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stantly try to prevent it, unless where the cutting it off is more prejudicial to the Sound than the <hi>Hiatus</hi> itself.

                  <p>I Believe it was with me when I left the Town, as it is with a great many Men when they leave the World, whose loss it self they do not so much re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gret, as that of their Friends whom they leave behind in it. For I do not know one thing for which I can envy <hi>London,</hi> but for your continuing there. Yet I guess you
<pb n="76" facs="81"/>
will expect I should recant this Expression, when I tell you, that <hi>Sapho</hi> (by which hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thenish Name you have christen'd a very orthodox Lady) did not accompany me in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to the Country. However, I will confess my self the less concern'd on that account, because I have no very violent Inclination to lose my Heart, especially in so wild and savagè a place as this Forest is: In the Town, 'tis ten to one but a young Fellow may find his stray'd Heart again, with some <hi>Wild<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>street</hi> or <hi>Drury-lane</hi> Damsel; but here, where I could have met with no redress from an unmerciful, virtuous Dame, I must for ever havé lost my little Traveller in a Hole, where I cou'd never rummage to find him again.—Well, Sir, you have your Lady in the Town still, and I have my Heart in the Country still, which being wholly unemploy'd as yet, has the more room in it for my Friends, and does not want a Corner at your Service.—To be serious, you have extreamly oblig'd me by your. Frankness and Kindness to me: And if I have abus'd it by too much Freedom on my part, I hope you will at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tribute it to the natural Openness of my Temper, which hardly knows how to show Respect, where I feel Affection. I wou'd love my Friend, as my Mistress, without Ceremony; and hope a little rough Usage
<pb n="77" facs="82"/>
sometimes may not be more displeasing to the one, than it is to the other.</p>
                  <p>If you have any Curiosity to know in what manner I live, or rather lose a Life, <hi>Martial</hi> will inform you in one Line: (the Translation of which cost a Friend of ours three in <hi>English,</hi>

                  <p>Every Day with me is literally an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>other yesterday; for it is exactly the same: It has the same Business, which is Poetry; and the same Pleasure, which is Idleness. A man might indeed pass his Time much better, but I question if any Man could pass it much easier. If you will visit our Shades this Spring, which I very much desire, you may perhaps instruct me to manage my Game more wisely; but at present I am satisfy'd to trifle away my Time any Way, rather than let it stick by me; as Shop-keepers are glad to be rid of those Goods at any rate, which would otherwise always be lying upon their hands.</p>
                  <p>Sir, if you will favour me sometimes with your Letters, it will be a great Satisfaction

to me on several accounts; and on this in particular, That it will show me (to my Comfort) that even a wise Man is some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>times very idle; for so you must needs be when you can find leisure to write to</p>

                  <p>I Have nothing to say to you in this Let<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter; but I was resolv'd to write to tell you so. Why should not I content my self with so many great Examples, of deep Di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vines, profound Casuists, grave Philosophers; who have written, not Letters only, but whole Tomes and voluminous Treatises about Nothing?

                  <p>YOU talk of Fame and Glory, and of the great Men of Antiquity: Pray tell me, what are all your great dead Men, but so many little living Letters? What a vast Reward is here for all the Ink wasted by Writers, and all the Blood spilt by Princes? There was in old time one <hi>Severus</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor. I dare say you never call'd him by any other Name in your Life: and yet in his days he was styl'd <hi>Lucius, Septimius, Severus, Pius, Pertinax, Augustus, Parthi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cus, Adiabenicus, Arabicus, Maximus,</hi>—and what not? What a prodigious waste of Letters has Time made! what a Number have here dropt off, and left the poor sur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>viving Seven unattended! For my own part, Four are all I have to take care for; and I'll be judg'd by you if any man cou'd live in less compass? except it were one Mon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sieur <hi>D.</hi> and one <hi>Romulus</hi> ⁂ But these, con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trary to the common Calamity, came in

process of time, to be call'd Monsieur <hi>Boileau Despreaux,</hi> and <hi>Romulus Three<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>points.</hi>—Well, Sir, for the future I'll drown all high Thoughts in the <hi>Lethe</hi> of Cowslip-Wine; as for Fame, Renown, Reputation, take 'em Critics!

                  <p>I Have been so well satisfy'd with the Country ever since I saw you, that I have not so much as once thought of the Town, or enquir'd of any one in it besides Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> and your self. And from him I understand of your Journey this Sum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mer into <hi>Leicestershire;</hi> from whence I guess you are return'd by this time, to your old Apartment in the Widow's Corner, to your old Business of comparing Critics, and re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>conciling
<pb n="81" facs="86"/>
commentators; and to the old di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versions of a losing game at picquet with the ladies, and half a play, or a quarter of a play, at the theatre; where you are none of the malicious Audience, but the chief of amorous Spectators; and for the infirmity of one <note place="bottom" n="*">His Hearing.</note> Sense which there for the most part could only serve to disgust you, enjoy the vigour of another which ravishes you.
<q>
                        <l>You know, when one Sense is supprest,</l>
                        <l>It but retires into the rest.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>(According to the poetical, not the learn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, <hi>Dodwell;</hi> who has done one thing wor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thy of eternal memory; wrote two lines in his life that are not nonsense!) So you have the advantage of being entertain'd with all the beauty of the boxes, without being trou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bled with any of the dulness of the stage. You are so good a critic, that 'tis the great<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>est happiness of the modern Poets that you do not hear their works; and next, that you are not so arrant a critic, as to damn them (like the rest) without hearing. But now I talk of those critics, I have good news to tell you concerning my self, for which I expect you shou'd congratulate with me: It is that beyond all my expectations, and
<pb n="82" facs="87"/>
far above my demerits, I have been most mercifully repriev'd by the fovereign power of <hi>Jacob Tonson,</hi> from being brought forth to publick punishment; and respited from time to time from the hands of those bar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>barous executioners of the Muses, whom I was just now speaking of. It often happens, that guilty Poets, like other guilty criminals, when once they are known and proclaim'd, deliver themselves into the hands of Ju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stice, only to prevent others from doing it more to their disadvantage; and not out of any Ambition to spread their fame, by be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing executed in the face of the world, which is a same but of short continuance. That Poet were a happy man who cou'd but obtain a grant to preserve his for ninety-nine years; for those names very rarely last so many days, which are planted either in <hi>Jacob Tonson</hi>'s, or the <hi>Ordinary of Newgate</hi>'s Miscellanies.</p>
                  <p>I have an hundred things to say to you, which shall be deferr'd till I have the hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piness of seeing you in town, for the sea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son now draws on, that invites every body thither. Some of them I had commu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nicated to you by Letters before this, if I had not been uncertain where you pass'd your time the last season: So much fine weather, I doubt not, has given you all the pleasure you cou'd desire from the coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try,
<pb n="83" facs="88"/>
and your own thoughts the best com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pany in it. But nothing cou'd allure Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> to our Forest, he continu'd (as you told me long since he wou'd) an ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stinate lover of the town, in spite of friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship and fair weather. Therefore hence<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>forward, to all those considerable qualities I know you possest of, I shall add that of Prophecy. But I still believe Mr. <hi>Wycher<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ley</hi>'s intentions were good, and am satisfy'd that he promises nothing but with a real design to perform it: how much soever his other excellent qualities are above my imi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tation, his sincerity, I hope, is not; and it is with the utmost that I am,</p>

                  <p>I Had sent you the inclos'd <note place="bottom" n="*">This was a Translation of the first Book of <hi>Statius,</hi> done when the Author was but 14 Years old, as appears by an Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vertisement before the first Edition of it in a Miscellany pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lish'd by <hi>B.

<pb n="84" facs="89"/>
without suspicion of their miscarrying; not, that they are of the least value, but for fear some body might be foolish enough to imagine them so, and inquisitive enough to discover those faults which I (by your help) wou'd correct. I therefore beg the favour of you to let them go no farther than your chamber, and to be very free of your re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>marks in the margins, not only in regard to the accuracy, but to the fidelity of the tran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>slation; which I have not had time of late to compare with its original. And I desire you to be the more severe, as it is much more criminal for me to make another speak nonsense, than to do it in my own proper, person. For your better help in comparing, it may be fit to tell you, that this is not an entire version of the first book. There is an omission from the 168th line—<hi>Jam murmura serpunt plebis ageno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reae</hi>—to the 312th—<hi>Interea patriis olim vagus exul ab oris</hi>—(between these <note place="bottom" n="*">These he since translated, and they are extant in the printed Version.</note> two <hi>Statius</hi> has a description of the council of the Gods, and a speech of <hi>Ju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piter;</hi> which contain a peculiar beauty and majesty, and were left out for no other reason, but because the consequence
<pb n="85" facs="90"/>

This I had actually translated, but was very ill satis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fied with it, even in my own words, to which an author cannot but be partial enough of conscience; it was therefore omitted in this copy, which goes on above eighty lines farther, at the words—<hi>Hic pri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mum lustrare oculis,</hi> &amp;c.—to the end of the book.</p>

And it is the happiness of this age, that the modern in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vention of printing Poems for pence a-piece, has brought the Nosegays of <hi>Parnassus</hi> to bear the same price; whereby the publick<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spirited Mr. <hi>Henry Hills</hi> of <hi>Black-fryars</hi> has been the cause of great ease and singular comfort to all the Learned, who never over<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>abounding in transitory coin, shou'd not be discontented (methinks) even tho' Poems were distributed <hi>gratis</hi> about the streets, like <hi>Bunyan</hi>'s Sermons and other pious treatises, usually publish'd in a like Volume and Cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racter.</p>

                  <p>I Have receiv'd part of the Version of <hi>Statius,</hi> and return you my thanks for your remarks which I think to be just, ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cept where you cry out (like one in <hi>Horace</hi>'s <hi>Art of Poetry</hi>) <hi>Pulchrè, bené, recté!</hi> There I have some fears, you are often, if not al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ways, in the wrong.</p>

One of your objections, namely on that passage,
<q>
                        <l>The rest, revolving years shall ripen into Fate,</l>
                     </q>
may be well grounded, in relation to its not being the exact sense of the words—<note place="bottom" n="*">See the first book of <hi>Statius,</hi> Verse 302.</note> 
                     <hi>Cae<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tera reliquo ordine ducam.</hi> But the duration of the Action of <hi>Statius</hi>'s poem may as well be excepted against, as many things besides in him: (which I wonder <hi>Bossu</hi> has not ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serv'd) For instead of confining his narra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion to <hi>one year,</hi> it is manifestly exceeded in the very first two books: The Narration begins with <hi>Oedipus</hi>'s prayer to the <hi>Fury</hi> to promote discord betwixt his Sons; af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terward the Poet expresly describes their entring into the agreement of reigning a year by turns; and <hi>Polynices</hi> takes his flight for <hi>Thebes</hi> on his brother's refusal to resign the throne. All this is in the first book; in next, <hi>Tydeus</hi> is sent Ambassador to <hi>Etheo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cles,</hi> and demands his resignation in these terms,<q>
                        <l>—Astriferum velox jam circulus orbem</l>
                        <l>Torsit, &amp; amissae redierunt montibus umbrae,</l>

                     <pb n="93" facs="98"/>
But <hi>Bossu</hi> himself is mistaken in one particular, relating to the commencement of the Action; saying in Book 2. Cap. 8. that <hi>Statius</hi> opens it with <hi>Europa</hi>'s <hi>Rape,</hi> where<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>as the Poet at most only deliberates whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther he shou'd or not?<q>
                        <l>—Unde jubetis</l>
                        <l>Ire, Deae? Gentisne canam primor dia, dirae,</l>
                        <l>Sidonios raptus? &amp;c.</l>
                     </q> but then expresly passes all this with a <hi>Lon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ga retro series</hi>—and says
<q>
                        <l>—Limes mihi carminis esto</l>
                        <l>

                     </q>
Indeed there are numberless particulars blame-worthy in our Author, which I have try'd to soften in the version:
<q>
                        <l>—Dubiam{que} jugo fragor impulit Oeten</l>
                        <l>In latus, &amp; geminis vix fluctibus obstitit Isthmus</l>
                     </q>
is most extravagantly hyperbolical: Nor did I ever read a greater piece of Tautology than<q>
                        <l>—Vacua cum <hi>solus</hi> in Aula</l>

                  <p>THE Morning after I parted from you, I found my felf (as I had prophecy'd) all alone, in an uneasy Stage-Coach; a dole<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful change from that agreeable company I enjoy'd the night before! without the least hope of entertainment but from my last recourse in such cases, a Book. I then be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gan to enter into acquaintance with the <hi>Moralists,</hi> and had just receiv'd from them
<pb n="95" facs="100"/>
some cold consolation for the inconvenien<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cies of this life, and the incertainty of hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man affairs; when I perceiv'd my Vehicle to stop, and heard from the side of it the dreadful news of a sick Woman preparing to enter it. 'Tis not easy to guess at my mortification, but being so well fortify'd with Philosophy I stood resign'd with a Stoical constancy to endure the worst of evils, a sick Woman. I was indeed a little comforted to find, by her voice and dress, that she was Young and a Gentlewoman; but no sooner was her hood remov'd, but I saw one of the finest faces I ever beheld, and to increase my surprize, heard her salure me by my name. I never had more reason to accuse Nature for making me short-sight<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed than now, when I could not recollect I had ever seen those fair eyes which knew me so well, and was utterly at a loss how to address my self; till with a great deal of simplicity and innocence she let me know (even before I discover'd my ignorance) that she was the daughter of one in our Neigh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bourhood, lately marry'd, who having been consulting her Physicians in Town, was re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turning into the Country, to try what good Air and a new Husband cou'd do to recover her. My Father, you must know, has sometimes recommended the Study of Phy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sick to me, but I never had any ambition
<pb n="96" facs="101"/>
to be a Doctor till this instant. I ventur'd to prescribe some Fruit (which I happen'd to have in the Coach) which being forbid<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>den her by her Doctors, she had the more inclination to. In short, I tempted, and she eat; nor was I more like the Devil than she like <hi>Eve.</hi> Having the good success of the 'foresaid Gentleman before my eyes, I put on the Gallantry of the old Serpent, and in spite of my evil Form accosted her with all the Gaiety I was master of; which had so good effect, that in less than an hour she grew pleasant, her colour return'd, and she was pleas'd to say my prescription had wrought an immediate cure: In a word, I had the pleasantest journey imaginable.</p>
                  <p>Thus far (methinks) my Letter has some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing of the air of a Romance, tho' it be true. But I hope you will look on what fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lows as the greatest of truths, That I think my self extreamly oblig'd by you in all points, especially for your kind and ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nourable Information and Advice in a mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter of the utmost concern to me, which I shall ever acknowledge as the highest proof at once of your friendship, justice, and sin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerity. At the same time be assur'd, that Gentleman we spoke of, shall never by any alteration in me discover my knowledge of his Mistake; the hearty forgiving of which is the only kind of Return I can possibly
<pb n="97" facs="102"/>
make him for so many favours. And I may derive this pleasure at least from it, that whereas I must otherwise have been a little uneasy to know my incapacity of returning to his Obligations; I may now, by bearing his Frailty, exercise my Grati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tude and Friendship more than Himself either is, or perhaps ever will be sensible of.<q>

                  <p>IF I were to write to you as often as I think of you, my Letters wou'd be as bad as a Rent-charge; but tho' the one be but too little for your Good-nature, the other wou'd be too much for your Quiet, which is one blessing Good-nature shou'd indispensably receive from mankind, in re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn for those many it gives. I have been inform'd of late, how much I am indebted to that quality of yours, in speaking well of me in my absence; the only thing by which
<pb n="100" facs="105"/>
you prove your self no Wit or Critic: Tho' indeed I have often thought, that a friend will show just as much indulgence (and no more) to my faults when I am absent, as he does severity to 'em when I am present. To be very frank with you, Sir, I must own, that where I receiv'd so much Civility at first, I cou'd hardly have expected so much Sincerity afterwards. But now I have only to wish, that the last were but equal to the first, and that as you have omitted nothing to oblige me, so you wou'd omit nothing to improve me.</p>
                  <p>I caus'd an acquaintance of mine to en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quire twice of your welfare, by whom I have been inform'd, that you have left your speculative Angle in the Widow's Coffee-house, and bidding adieu for some time to all the <hi>Rehearsals, Reviews, Ga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>zettes,</hi> &amp;c. have march'd off into <hi>Lin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>colnshire.</hi> Thus I find you vary your life in the scene at least, tho' not in the Action; for tho' Life for the most part, like an old Play, be still the same, yet now and then a new Scene may make it more entertaining. As for my self, I would not have my life a very regular Play, let it be a good merry Farce, a G-d's name, and a fig for the critical Unities! Yet (on the other side) I wou'd as soon write like <hi>Durfey,</hi> as live like <hi>T<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters" rend="content:_+">

<pb n="101" facs="106"/>
merry life, is (if you will excuse such a si<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>militude) not unlike a F<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters" rend="content:_+">
                        <desc>blank</desc>
                     </gap>t, at once nasty and laughable. For the generality of men, a true modern life is like a true modern play, neither Tragedy, Comedy, nor Farce, nor one, nor all of these: every Actor is much better known by his having the same Face, than by keeping the same Character: for we change our minds as often as they can their parts, and he who was yesterday <hi>Caesar,</hi> is to day Sir <hi>John Daw.</hi> So that one might ask the same question of a mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dern life, that <hi>Rich</hi> did of a modern play; <q rend="inline">"Pray do me the favour, Sir, to inform me; Is this your Tragedy or your Comedy?"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have dwelt the longer upon this, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause I perswade my self it might be useful, at a time when we have no other Theatre, to divert our selves at this great one. Here is a glorious standing Comedy of Fools, at which every man is heartily merry, and thinks himself an unconcern'd Spectator. This (to our singular comfort) neither my Lord Chamberlain, nor the Queen her self can ever shut up, or silence. While that of <hi>Drury</hi> (alas!) lies desolate, in the pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>foundest peace: and the melancholy pros<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pect of the Nymphs yet lingring about its beloved avenues, appears no less moving than that of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Dames lamenting over their ruin'd <hi>Ilium!</hi> What now can they
<pb n="102" facs="107"/>
hope, dispossess'd of their antient seats, but to serve as Captives to the insulting Victors of the <hi>Hay-Market?</hi> The afflicted subjects of <hi>France</hi> do not, in our <hi>Post-man,</hi> so grie<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vously deplore the obstinacy of their arbi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trary Monarch, as these perishing people of <hi>Drury</hi> the obdurate heart of that <hi>Pharaoh, Rich,</hi> who like him, disdains all Proposals of peace and accommodation. Several Li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bels have been secretly affix'd to the great gates of his imperial palace in <hi>Bridges-street;</hi> and a Memorial representing the distresses of these persons, has been accidentally dropt (as we are credibly inform'd by a person of quality) out of his first Minister the chief Box-keeper's pocket, at a late Conference of the said Person of quality and others, on the part of the Confederates, and his Theatrical Majesty on his own part. Of this you may expect a copy as soon as it shall be transmitted to us from a good hand. As for the late Congress, it is here reported, that it has not been wholly ineffectual; but this wants confirmation; yet we cannot but hope the concurring prayers and tears of so many wretched Ladies may induce this haughty Prince to reason.</p>

                  <p>I MAY truly say I am more oblig'd to you this summer than to any of my Acquaintance, for had it not been for the two kind letters you sent me, I had been perfectly, <hi>oblitusque meorum, obliviscendus &amp; illis.</hi> The only companions I had were those Muses of whom <hi>Tully</hi> says, <hi>Adoles<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>centiam alunt, Senectutem oblectant, secundas res ornant, adversis perfugium ac solatium praebent, delectant domi, non impediunt foris, pernoctant nobiscum, peregrinantur, rustican<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tur.</hi> Which indeed is as much as ever I expected from them; for the Muses, if you take them as Companions, are ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry pleasant and agreeable; but whoever should be forc'd to live or depend up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on 'em, would find himself in a very bad condition. That Quiet, which <hi>Cowley</hi> calls the <hi>Companion of Obscurity,</hi> was not want<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to me, unless it was interrupted by those fears you so justly guess I had for our Friend's welfare. 'Tis extreamly kind in you to tell me the news you heard of him, and you have deliver'd me from more an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>xiety than he imagines me capable of on his account, as I am convinc'd by his long
<pb n="104" facs="109"/>
silence. However the love of some things rewards itself, as of Vertue, and of Mr. <hi>Wy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cherley.</hi> I am surpriz'd at the danger you tell me he has been in, and must agree with you, that our nation would have lost in him alone, more wit, and probity, than would have remain'd (for ought I know) in all the rest of it. My concern for his friendship will excuse me, (since I know you honour him so much, and since you know I love him above all men) if I vent a part of my uneasiness to you, and tell you, that there has not been wanting one to insinuate malicious untruths of me to Mr. <hi>Wycherley,</hi> which I fear may have had some effect upon him. If so, he will have a grea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter punishment for his credulity than I cou'd wish him, in that fellow's acquain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tance. The loss of a faithful creature is something, tho' of ever so contemptible an one; and if I were to change my Dog for such a Man as the aforesaid, I shou'd think my Dog undervalu'd: (who follows me about as constantly here in the country, as I was us'd to do Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> in the Town.)</p>
                  <p>Now I talk of my Dog, that I may not treat of a worse subject which my spleen tempts me to, I will give you some account of him; a thing not wholly unprecedented, since <hi>Montaigne</hi> (to whom I am but a Dog
<pb n="105" facs="110"/>
in comparison) has done the very same thing of his Cat. <hi>Dic mihi quid melius desidiosus agam?</hi> You are to know then, that as 'tis Likeness begets affection, so my favourite dog is a little one, a lean one, and none of the finest shap'd. He is not much a Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niel in his fawning, but has (what might be worth any man's while to imitate from him) a dumb surly sort of kindness, that rather shows itself when he thinks me ill<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>us'd by others, than when we walk quietly and peaceably by our selves. If it be the chief point of Friendship to comply with a friend's Motions and Inclinations, he pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sesses this in an eminent degree; he lies down when I sit, and walks when I walk, which is more than many good friends can pretend to, witness our Walk a year ago in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park.—Histories are more full of examples of the Fidelity of Dogs than of Friends, but I will not insist upon ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny of 'em, because it is possible some may be almost as fabulous as those of <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Orestes,</hi> &amp;c. I will only say for the ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour of Dogs, that the two most antient and esteemable books sacred and prophane extant, (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi>) have shewn a particular regard to these animals. That of <hi>Toby</hi> is the more remarkable, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause there was no manner of reason to take notice of the Dog, besides the great hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manity
<pb n="106" facs="111"/>
of the Author. <hi>Homer</hi>'s account of <hi>Ulysses</hi>'s Dog <hi>Argus</hi> is the most pathe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tick imaginable, all the Circumstances con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sider'd, and an excellent proof of the old Bard's Good-nature. <hi>Ulysses</hi> had left him at <hi>Ithaca</hi> when he embark'd for <hi>Troy,</hi> and found him at his return after twenty years, (which by the way is not unnatural as some Critics have said, since I remember the dam of my dog was twenty-two years old when she dy'd: May the omen of lon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gaevity prove fortunate to her successor!)

                  <p>AFTER I had recover'd from a dan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gerous Illness which was first con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tracted in Town, about a fortnight after my coming hither I troubled you with a letter, and a paper inclos'd, which you had been so obliging as to desire a sight of when last I saw you, promising me in return some translations of yours from <hi>Ovid.</hi> Since when, I have not had a syllable from your hands, so that 'tis to be fear'd that tho' I have escap'd Death, I have not Oblivion.

my own part will die at discretion, and at my leisure. But I fear I must be forc'd like many learned Authors, to write my own Epitaph, if I wou'd be remember'd at all. <hi>Monsieur de la Fontaine</hi>'s wou'd fit me to a hair, but it is a kind of Sacrilege, (do you think it is not?) to steal Epitaphs. In my present, living dead condition, nothing wou'd be properer than <hi>Oblitusque meorum, obliviscendus &amp; illis,</hi> but that unluckily I can't forget my friends, and the civili<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties I receiv'd from your self, and some others. They say indeed 'tis one quality of generous minds to forget the obligations they have conferr'd, and perhaps too it may be so to forget those on whom they con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferr'd 'em? Then indeed I must be forgot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ten to all intents and purposes! I am, it must be own'd, dead in a natural capacity, according to Mr. <hi>Bicker staff;</hi> dead in a po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>etical capacity, as a damn'd author; and dead in a civil capacity, as a useless mem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber of the Common-wealth.

If he who has nothing to do him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self, will not comfort and support another in his idleness?

                  <p>I Give you thanks for the Version you sent me of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Elegy. It is very much an image of that author's writing, who has an agreeableness that charms us without correctness, like a mistress whose faults we see, but love her with them all. You have very judiciously alter'd his me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thod in some places, and I can find nothing which I dare insist upon as an error: What I have written in the margins being meer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly Guesses at a little improvement, rather than Criticisms. I assure you I do not ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pect you shou'd subscribe to my private notions but when you shall judge 'em agreeable to reason and good sense. What I have done is not as a Critic, but as a Friend; I know too well how many qua<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lities are requisite to make up the one, and that I want almost all I can reckon up; but I am sure I do not want inclina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, nor I hope capacity, to be the other. Nor shall I take it at all amiss, that an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>other dissents from my opinion: 'Tis no more than I have often done from my own; and indeed, the more a man advances in understanding, he becomes the more every
<pb n="122" facs="125"/>
day a critic upon himself, and finds some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing or other still to blame in his for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mer notions and opinions. I cou'd be glad to know if you have translated the 11th Elegy of <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Ad amicam navigantem.</hi> the 8th of Book 3, or the 11th of Book 3, which are above all others my parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cular favourites, especially the last of these.</p>
                  <p>As to the passage of which you ask my opinion in the second <hi>Aeneid,</hi> it is either so plain as to require no solution; or else (which is very probable) you see farther into it than I can. <hi>Priam</hi> wou'd say, that <q rend="inline">"<hi>Achilles</hi> (whom surely you only feign to be your Father, since your actions are so different from his) did not use me thus inhumanly. He blush'd at his murder of <hi>Hector</hi> when he saw my sorrows for him; and restored his dead body to me to be buried."</q> To this the answer of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> seems to be agreeable enough. <q rend="inline">"Go then to the shades, and tell <hi>Achilles</hi> how I degenerate from him:"</q> granting the truth of what <hi>Priam</hi> had said of the difference between them. Indeed Mr. <hi>Dry<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>den</hi>'s mentioning here what <hi>Virgil</hi> more ju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diciously passes in silence, the circumstance of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s selling <hi>for mony</hi> the body of <hi>Hector,</hi> seems not so proper; it in some measure less'ning the character of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s
<pb n="123" facs="126"/>
generosity and piety, which is the very point of which <hi>Priam</hi> endeavours in this place to convince his Son, and to reproach him with the want of. But the truth of this circumstance is no way to be question'd, being expresly taken from <hi>Homer,</hi> who re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>presents <hi>Achilles</hi> weeping for <hi>Priam,</hi> yet receiving the gold, <hi>Iliad</hi> 24: For when he gives the body, he uses these words, <q rend="inline">"O my friend <hi>Patroclus!</hi> forgive me that I quit the corps of him who kill'd thee; I have great gifts in ransom for it, which I will bestow upon thy funeral."</q>

is a common word for any Garden; but in <hi>English</hi> it bears the signification and conveys the idea of <hi>Eden,</hi> which alone is (I think) a reason against making <hi>Ovid</hi> use it; who will be thought to talk too like a Christian in your version at least, whatever it might have been in <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Greek.</hi> As for all the rest of my Remarks, since you do not laugh at them as at this, I can be so civil as not to lay any stress upon 'em (as I think I told you before) and in parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cular in the point of <hi>Trees enjoying,</hi> you have, I must own, fully satisfy'd me that the Expression is not only defensible, but beautiful. I shall be very glad to see your Translation of the Elegy, <hi>Ad Amicam na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vigantem,</hi> as soon as you can; for (without a complement to you) every thing you write either in verse or prose, is welcome to me; and you may be confident, (if my opinion can be of any sort of consequence in any thing) that I will never be unsin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cere, tho' I may be often mistaken. To use Sincerity with you is but paying you in your own coin, from whom I have expe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rienc'd so much of it; and I need not tell you how much I really esteem you, when I esteem nothing in the world so much as that Quality. I know you some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>times say civil things to me in your Episto<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lary Style, but those I am to make allow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance
<pb n="127" facs="130"/>
for, as particularly when you talk of <hi>Admiring;</hi> 'tis a word you are so us'd to in conversation of Ladies, that it will creep into your discourse in spite of you, ev'n to your Friends. But as Women when they think themselves secure of admiration, com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mit a thousand Negligences, which show them so much at disadvantage and off their guard, as to lose the little real Love they had before: so when men imagine others entertain some esteem for their abilities, they often expose all their Imperfections and foolish works, to the disparagement of the little Wit they were thought masters of. I am going to exem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plify this to you, in putting into your hands (being encourag'd by so much indulgence) some verses of my Youth, or rather Child<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hood; which (as I was a great admirer of <hi>Waller</hi>) were intended in imitation of his manner; and are perhaps, such imitations, as those you see in awkward country Dames of the fine and well-bred Ladies of the Court. If you will take 'em with you into <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> they may save you one hour from the conversation of the country Gen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tlemen and their Tenants, (who differ but in Dress and Name) which if it be there as bad as here, is even worse than my Poetry. I hope your stay there will be no longer than (as Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> calls it) to rob the
<pb n="128" facs="131"/>
Country, and run away to <hi>London</hi> with your money. In the mean time I beg the fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vour of a line from you, and am (as I will never cease to be)</p>

                  <p>I Deferr'd answering your last, upon the advice I receiv'd that you were leaving the town for some time, and expected your return with impatience, having then a de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sign of seeing my Friends there, among the first of which I have reason to account your self. But my almost continual Ill<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nesses prevent that, as well as most o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther satisfactions of my life: However I may say one good thing of sickness, that it is the best Cure in nature for Ambition, and designs upon the World or Fortune: It makes a man pretty indifferent for the future, provided he can but be easy, by intervals, for the present. He will be con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tent to compound for his Quiet only, and leave all the circumstantial part and pomp of life to those, who have a health vigo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous enough to enjoy all the Mistresses of their desires. I thank God, there is no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing out of my self which I would be at
<pb n="129" facs="132"/>
the trouble of seeking, except a Friend; a happiness I once hop'd to have possess'd in Mr. <hi>Wycherley;</hi> but—<hi>Quantum mutatus ab illo!</hi>—I have for some years been em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ploy'd much like Children that build houses with Cards, endeavouring very busily and eagerly to raise a Friendship, which the first breath of any ill-natur'd By-stander cou'd puff away.—But I will trouble you no farther with writing, nor my self with thinking, of this subject.</p>
                  <p>I was mightily pleas'd to perceive by your quotation from <hi>Voiture,</hi> that you had track'd me so far as <hi>France.</hi> You see 'tis with weak heads as with weak stomachs, they immediately throw out what they re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceiv'd last: and what they read, floats up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on the surface of their mind, like Oil up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on water, without incorporating. This, I think however, can't be said of the Love<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verses I last troubled you with, where all (I am afraid) is so puerile and so like the Author, that no body will su<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spect any thing to be borrow'd. Yet you, (as a friend, entertaining a better opinion of 'em) it seems search'd in <hi>Wal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ler,</hi> but search'd in vain. Your judgment of 'em is (I think) very right,—for it was my own opinion before. If you think 'em not worth the trouble of correcting,
<pb n="130" facs="133"/>
pray tell me so freely, and it will save me a labour; if you think the contrary, you wou'd particularly oblige me by your re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>marks on the several thoughts as they oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cur. I long to be nibling at your verses, and have not forgot who promis'd me <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Elegy <hi>ad Amicam Navigantem?</hi> Had <hi>Ovid</hi> been as long composing it, as you in sending it, the Lady might have sail'd to <hi>Gades,</hi> and receiv'd it at her return.

                  <p>I Am glad to find by your last letter that you write to me with the freedom of a friend, setting down your thoughts as they occur, and dealing plainly with me in the matter of my own Trifles, which I assure you I never valu'd half so much as I do that Sincerity in you which they were the occa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion of discovering to me; and which while I am happy in, I may be trusted with that dangerous weapon, Poetry; since I shall do
<pb n="132" facs="135"/>
nothing with it but after asking and fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowing your advice. I value Sincerity the more, as I find by sad experience, the pra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ctise of it is more dangerous; Writers rarely pardoning the executioners of their verses, ev'n tho' themselves pronounce sentence up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on them.—As to Mr. <hi>Philips</hi>'s Pastorals, I take the first to be infinitely the best, and the second the worst; the third is for the greatest part a Translation from <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Daphnis.</hi> I will not forestal your judgment of the rest, only observe in that of the Nightingale these lines, (speaking of the Musician's playing on the harp.)<q>
                        <l>Now lightly skimming o'er the Strings they pass,</l>
                        <l>Like Winds that gently brush the plying Grass,</l>
                        <l>And melting Airs arise at their command;</l>
                        <l>And now, laborious, with a weighty hand,</l>
                        <l>He sinks into the Cords, with solemn pace,</l>
                        <l>And gives the swelling Tones a manly grace.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which nothing can be objected, but that they are too lofty for Pastoral, espe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cially being put into the mouth of a Shep<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>herd, as they are here; in the Poet's own person they had heen (I believe) more pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>per. These are more after <hi>Virgil</hi>'s manner than that of <hi>Theocritus,</hi> whom yet in the character of Pastoral he rather seems to
<pb n="133" facs="136"/>
imitate. In the whole, I agree with the <hi>Tatler,</hi> that we have no better Eclogues in our language. There is a small copy of the same Author publish'd in the <hi>Tatler</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 12. on the <hi>Danish</hi> Winter: 'Tis Poetical Paint<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, and I recommend it to your per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>usal.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Garth</hi>'s Poem I have not seen, but believe I shall be of that Critic's opinion you mention at <hi>Will</hi>'s, who swore it was good: For tho' I am very cautious of swear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing after Critics, yet I think one may do it more safely when they commend, than when they blame.</p>
                  <p>I agree with you in your censure of the use of <hi>Sea-terms</hi> in Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s <hi>Virgil;</hi> not only because <hi>Helenus</hi> was no great Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phet in those matters, but because no Terms of Art or Cant-Words suit with the Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jesty and dignity of Stile which <hi>Epic</hi> Poetry requires.—<hi>Cui mens divinior atque os magna soniturum.</hi>—The Tarpawlin Phrase can please none but such <hi>Qui Aurem habent Batavam;</hi> they must not expect <hi>Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ribus Atticis probari,</hi> I find by you. (I think I have brought in two phrases of <hi>Martial</hi> here very dextrously.)</p>
                  <p>Tho' you say you did not rightly take my Meaning in the verse I quoted from <hi>Juve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nal,</hi> yet I will not explain it; because tho' it seems you are resolv'd to take me for a
<pb n="134" facs="137"/>
Critic, I wou'd by no means be thought a Commentator.—And for another reason too, because I have quite forgot both the Verse and the Application.</p>
                  <p>I hope it will be no offence to give my most hearty service to Mr. <hi>Wycherly,</hi> tho' I perceive by his last to me, I am not to trouble him with my letters, since he there told me he was going instantly out of Town, and till his return was my Ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vant, &amp;c. I guess by yours he is yet with you, and beg you to do what you may with all truth and honour, that is, as<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure him I have ever borne all the Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spect and Kindness imaginable to him. I do not know to this hour what it is that has estrang'd him from me; but this I know, that he may for the future be more safely my friend, since no invitation of his shall ever more make me so free with him. I cou'd not have thought any man had been so very cautious and suspicious, as not to credit his own Experience of a friend. Indeed to be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lieve no body, may be a Maxim of Safety, but not so much of Honesty. There is but one way I know of conversing safely with all men, that is, not by concealing what we say or do, but by saying or doing nothing that deserves to be conceal'd, and I can truly boast this comfort in my affairs

                  <p>THE System of <hi>Tycho Brahe</hi> (were it true, as it is <hi>Novel</hi>) cou'd have no room here: <hi>Lucan,</hi> with the rest of the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, seems to follow <hi>Plato;</hi> whose

order of the Spheres is clear in <hi>Cicero, De Natura Deorum, De somnio Scipionis,</hi> and in <hi>Macrobius.</hi> The Seat of the <hi>Semidei ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nes</hi> is <hi>Platonick</hi> too, for <hi>Apuleius de Deo Socratis</hi> assigns the same to the <hi>Genii, viz.</hi> the Region of the <hi>Air</hi> for their intercourse with Gods and Men; so that I fancy, <hi>Row</hi> mistook the situation, and I can't be re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>concil'd to, <hi>Look down on the Sun's Rays.</hi> I am glad you agree with me about the la<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>titude he takes; and wish you had told me, if the <hi>sortilegi,</hi> and <hi>fatidici,</hi> cou'd license his invectives against Priests? but I suppose you think them (with <hi>Helena</hi>) undeserving of your protection.

                  <p>TO make use of that freedom and fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>miliarity of style which we have ta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ken up in our Correspondence, and which is more properly Talking upon paper, than Writing; I will tell you without any pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>face, that I never took <hi>Tycho Brahe</hi> for one of the Antients, or in the least an acquain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tance of <hi>Lucan</hi>'s; nay, 'tis a mercy on this occasion that I do not give you an ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count of his Life and Conversation; as how he liv'd some years like an inchanted Knight in a certain Island, with a tale of a King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Mistress that shall be nameless.—But I have compassion on you, and wou'd not for the world you shou'd

                     </hi> is in the Milky way. These coelestial thoughts put me in mind of the <hi>Priests</hi> you mention, who are a sort of <hi>Sortilegi</hi> in one sense, because in their Lottery there are more Blanks than Prizes; the Adventurers being at best in an uncertainty, whereas the Set<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters-up are sure of something. Priests in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed in their Character, as they represent God, are sacred; and so are Constables as they represent the King; but you will own a great many of 'em are very odd fellows, and the devil a bit of likeness in 'em. Yet I can assure you, I honour the good as much as I detest the bad, and I think, that in condemning these, we praise those. I am so far from esteeming ev'n the worst unworthy of my protection, that I have defended their Character (in <hi>Congreve</hi>'s and <hi>Vanbrugh</hi>'s Plays) ev'n against their own Brethren. And so much for Priests in general, now for <hi>Trapp</hi> in particular whose Translations from <hi>Ovid</hi> I have not so good an opinion of as you; not (I will assure you) from any sort of preju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dice to him as a Priest, but because I
<pb n="143" facs="146"/>
think he has little of the main Characte<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ristick of his Author, a graceful Easiness. For let the sense be ever so exactly ren<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der'd, unless an author looks like himself, in his air, habit, manner, 'tis a Disguise and not a Translation. But as to the Psalm, I think <hi>David</hi> is much more beholding to him than <hi>Ovid;</hi> and as he treated the <hi>Ro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man</hi> like a <hi>Jew,</hi> so he has made the <hi>Jew</hi> speak like a <hi>Roman.</hi>

                  <p>IT seems that my late mention of <hi>Cra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shaw,</hi> and my quotation from him, has mov'd your curiosity. I therefore send you the whole Author, who has held a place among my other books of this nature for some years; in which time having read him twice or thrice, I find him one of those whose works may just deserve reading. I take this Poet to have writ like a Gentleman, that is, at leisure hours, and more to keep out of idleness, than to esta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blish a reputation: so that nothing regular or just can be expected from him. All that regards Design, Form, Fable, (which is the Soul of Poetry) all that concerns ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>actness, or consent of parts, (which is the
<pb n="146" facs="149"/>
Body) will probably be wanting; only pret<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty conceptions, fine metaphors, glitt'ring expressions, and something of a neat cast of Verse, (which are properly the dress, gems, or loose ornaments of Poetry) may be found in these verses. This is indeed the case of most other Poetical Writers of <hi>Miscellanies;</hi> nor can it well be otherwise, since no man can be a true Poet, who writes for diversion only. These Authors shou'd be consider'd as <hi>Versifiers</hi> and <hi>witty Men,</hi> rather than as <hi>Poets;</hi> and under this head will only fall the Thoughts, the Expression, and the Numbers. These are only the pleasing parts of Poetry, which may be judg'd of at a view, and comprehended all at once. And (to express my self like a Painter) their <hi>Colouring</hi> entertains the sight, but the <hi>Lines</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of the Picture are not to be in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spected too narrowly.</p>
                  <p>This Author form'd himself upon <hi>Pe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trarch,</hi> or rather upon <hi>Marino.</hi> His thoughts one may observe, in the main, are pretty; but oftentimes far fetch'd, and too often strain'd and stiffned to make them appear the greater. For men are never so apt to think a thing great, as when it is odd or wonderful; and inconsiderate Authors wou'd rather be admir'd than understood. This ambition of surprising a reader, is the true natural cause of all Fustian, or Bombast in
<pb n="147" facs="150"/>
Poetry. To confirm what I have said you need but look into his first Poem of the <hi>Weeper,</hi> where the 2d, 4th, 6th, 14th, 21st stanza's are as sublimely dull, as the 7th, 8th, 9th, 16th, 17th, 20th and 23d stanza's of the same copy, are soft and plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sing: And if these last want any thing, it is an easier and more unaffected expression. The remaining thoughts in that Poem might have been spared, being either but re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>petitions, or very trivial and mean. And by this example in the first one may guess at all the rest; to be like this, a mixture of tender gentile thoughts and suitable expressions, of forc'd and inextri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cable conceits, and of needless fillers-up to the rest. From all which it is plain, this Author writ fast, and set down what came uppermost. A reader may skim off the froth, and use the clear underneath; but if he goes too deep will meet with a mouthful of dregs: either the Top or bot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tom of him are good for little, but what he did in his <hi>own, natural, middle-way,</hi> is best.</p>
                  <p>To speak of his <hi>Numbers</hi> is a little diffi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cult, they are so various and irregular, and mostly Pindarick: 'tis evident his heroic Verse (the best example of which is his <hi>Musick</hi>'s <hi>Duel</hi>) is carelesly made up; but one may imagine from what it now is,
<pb n="148" facs="151"/>
that had he taken more care, it had been musical and pleasing enough, not extream<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly majestic, but sweet: And the time con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sider'd of his writing, he was (ev'n as un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>correct as he is) none of the worst Versifi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cators.</p>
                  <p>I will just observe, that the best Pieces of this Author are, a Paraphrase on Psal. 23. On <hi>Lessius,</hi> Epitaph on Mr. <hi>Ashton,</hi> Wishes to his suppos'd Mistress, and the <hi>Dies Irae.</hi>

As the fooling and toying with a mistress is a proof of fondness, not disrespect, so is raillery with a friend. I know there are Prudes in friendship, who expect distance, awe and adoration, but I know you are not of them; and I for my part am no Idol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>worshipper, tho' a Papist. If I were to address <hi>Jupiter</hi> himself in a heathen way, I fancy I shou'd be apt to take hold of his knee in a familiar manner, if not of his beard like <hi>Dionysius;</hi> I was just going to say of his buttons, but I think <hi>Jupiter</hi> wore none (however I won't be positive to so nice a Critick as you, but his robe might be <hi>Subnected</hi> with a <hi>Fibula.</hi>) I know some Philosophers define Laughter, <hi>A recommend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing our selves to our own favour, by compa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rison with the weakness of another:</hi> but I am sure I very rarely laugh with that view, nor do I believe <hi>Children</hi> have any such consideration in their heads, when they ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>press their pleasure this way: I laugh full as innocently as they, for the most part, and as sillily. There is a difference too betwixt laughing <hi>about</hi> a thing and laugh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing <hi>at</hi> a thing: One may find the inferior Man (to make a kind of casuistical di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stinction) provok'd to folly at the sight or observation of some <hi>circumstance of a thing,</hi> when the <hi>thing itself</hi> appears solemn and august to the superior Man, that is, out
<pb n="150" facs="153"/>
Judgment and Reason. Let an Ambassador speak the best Sense in the world, and de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port himself in the most graceful manner before a Prince, yet if the <hi>Tail</hi> of <hi>his Shirt</hi> happen (as I have known it happen to a very wise man) to hang out behind, more people shall laugh at that than attend to the other; till they recollect themselves, and then they will not have a jot the less respect for the Minister. I must confess the iniquity of my countenance before you; several Muscles of my Face sometimes take an impertinent liberty with my Judgment, but then my Judgment soon rises, and sets all right again about my mouth: And I find I value no man so much, as he in whose sight I have been playing the fool. I cannot be <hi>Sub-Persona</hi> before a man I love; and not to laugh with honesty, when Nature prompts, or Folly (which is more a second Nature than any thing I know) is but a knavish hypocritical way of ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>king a mask of one's own face.—To conclude, those that are my friends I <hi>laugh with,</hi> and those that are not I <hi>laugh at;</hi> so am merry in company, and if ever I am wise, it is all by my self.

As if he had not wrote two letters to you, he was for writing every Post; I put him in mind he had already. Forgive me this wrong, I know not whither my tal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>king so much of your great humanity and tenderness to me, and love to him; or whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther the return of his natural disposition to you, was the cause; but certainly you are now highly in his favour: now he will come this Winter to your house, and I must go with him; but first he will invite you spee<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dily to town.—I arrived on <hi>Saturday</hi> last much wearied, yet had wrote sooner, but was told by Mr. <hi>Gay</hi> (who has writ a pret<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty Poem to <hi>Lintot,</hi> and who gives you his service) that you was gone from home. <hi>Lewis</hi> shew'd me your letter which set me right, and your next letter is impatiently expected by me. Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi> came to town on <hi>Sunday</hi> last, and kindly surpriz'd me with a visit on <hi>Monday</hi> morning. We din'd and drank together; and I saying, <hi>To our Loves,</hi> he reply'd, <hi>'Tis Mr.</hi> Pope<hi>'s health:</hi> He said he would go to Mr. <hi>Tho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rold</hi>'s and leave a letter for you.

                  <p>I Receiv'd the entertainment of your Let<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter the day after I had sent you one of mine, and I am but this morning return'd hither. The news you tell me of the ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny difficulties you found in your return from <hi>Bath,</hi> gives me such a kind of plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure as we usually take in accompanying our Friends in their mixt adventures; for me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thinks I see you labouring thro' all your inconveniencies of the rough roads, the hard saddle, the trotting horse, and what not? What an agreeable surprize wou'd it have been to me, to have met you by pure accident, (which I was within an ace of doing) and to have carry'd you off triumphantly, set you on an easier Pad, and reliev'd the wandring Knight with a Night's lodging and rural Repast, at our Castle in the Forest? But these are only
<pb n="154" facs="157"/>
the pleasing Imaginations of a disappointed Lover, who must suffer in a melancholy absence yet these two months. In the mean time, I take up with the Muses for want of your better company; the Muses, <hi>Quae nobiscum pernoctant, peregrinantur, rustican<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tur.</hi> Those aerial Ladies just discover e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nough to me of their beauties to urge my pursuit, and draw me on in a wand'ring Maze of thought, still in hopes (and only in hopes) of attaining those favours from 'em, which they confer on their more happy Admirers. We grasp some more beautiful Idea in our own brain, than our endeavours to express it can set to the view of others; and still do but la<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bour to fall short of our first Imagina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion. The gay Colouring which Fancy gave at the first transient glance we had of it, goes off in the Execution; like those various figures in the gilded clouds, which while we gaze long upon, to separate the parts of each imaginary Image, the whole faints before the eye and decays into con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fusion.</p>
                  <p>I am highly pleas'd with the knowledge you give me of Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi>'s present temper, which seems so favourable to me. I shall ever have such a Fund of Affection for him as to be agreeable to my self when I am so to him, and cannot but be

                  <p>MR. <hi>Wycherley</hi> has, I believe, sent you two or three letters of invitation; but you, like the Fair, will be long solli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cited before you yield, to make the favour the more acceptable to the Lover. He is much yours by his talk; for that unbound<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed Genius which has rang'd at large like a libertine, now seems confin'd to you:

and I shou'd take him for your Mistress too by your simile of the Sun and Earth: 'Tis very fine, but inverted by the application; for the gaiety of your fancy, and the droop<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing of his by the withdrawing of your lustre, perswades me it wou'd be juster by the reverse. Oh happy Favourite of the Muses! how <hi>per-noctare,</hi> all night long with them? but alas! you do but toy, but skirmish with them, and decline a close Engagement. Leave Elegy and Translation to the inferior Class, on wbom the Muses only glance now and then like our Win<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter-Sun, and then leave 'em in the dark. Think on the Dignity of Tragedy, which is of the greater Poetry, as <hi>Dennis</hi> says, and foil him at his other weapon, as you have done in Criticism. Every one wonders that a Genius like yours will not support the sinking <hi>Drama;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> (tho' I think his Talent is Comedy) has express'd a furious ambition to swell in your Buskins. We have had a poor Comedy of <hi>John<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son</hi>'s (not <hi>Ben</hi>) which held seven nights, and has got him three hundred pounds, for the town is sharp-set on new Plays.

But indeed 'tis some consolation to me to reflect, that while I but write this period, I escape some hundred fatal Darts from those unerring Eyes, and about a thousand Deaths, or better.

Indeed, indeed, my friend, you cou'd never have found so improper a time to tempt me with Interest or Ambi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion: let me but have the Reputation of these in my keeping, and as for my own, let the Devil, or let <hi>Dennis,</hi> take it for ever.

                  <p>Now you that are a Critic, pray inform me, in what manner I may connect the foregoing part of this Letter with that which is to follow, according to the Rules?

                  <p>I Send you the book of Rudiments of <hi>Drawing,</hi> which you were pleas'd to command, and think my self oblig'd to inform you at the same time of one of the many excellencies you possess without knowing of 'em. You are but too good a Painter already; and no Picture of <hi>Raphael</hi>'s was ever so beautiful, as that which you have form'd in a certain heart of my ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quaintance. Indeed it was but just that the
<pb n="164" facs="164"/>
finest lines in nature shou'd be drawn upon the most durable ground, and none cou'd ever be met with that wou'd so readily re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceive, or so faithfully retain them, as this Heart. I may boldly say of it that you will not find its fellow in all the <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> in this book. But I must com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plain to you of my hand, which is an ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rant traitor to my heart; for having been copying your picture from thence and from <hi>Kneller</hi> these three days, it has done all pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sible injury to the finest Face that ever was made, and to the liveliest Image that ever was drawn. I have imagination enough in your absence, to trace some resemblance of you; but I have been so long us'd to lose my judgment at the sight of you, that 'tis past my power to correct it by the life, Your Picture seems least like when plac'd before your eyes, and contrary to all other pictures receives a manifest disadvantage by being set in the fairest Light in the world. The Painters are a very vain gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ration, and have a long time pretended to rival Nature; but to own the truth to you, she made such a finish'd piece about three and twenty years ago, (I beg your pardon Madam, I protest I meant but two and twenty) that 'tis in vain for them any lon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ger to contend with her. I know You in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed made one something like it, betwixt
<pb n="165" facs="165"/>
five and six years past: 'Twas a little girl, done with abundance of spirit and life: and wants nothing but time to be an ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mirable piece: But not to flatter your work, I don't think 'twill ever come up to what your Father made. However I wou'd not discourage you; 'tis certain you have a strange happiness, in making fine things of a sudden and at a stroke, with incredible ease and pleasure.</p>

                  <p>IT is too much a rule in this town, that when a Lady has once done a man a favour, he is to be rude to her ever after. It becomes our Sex to take upon us twice as much as yours allows us: By this me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thod I may write to you most impudent<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly, because you once answer'd me modest<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly; and if you shou'd never do me that honour for the future, I am to think (like a true Coxcomb) that your silence gives consent.

                     </hi> with whom I have the right of an old acquaintance, whereas you are a

fine Lady, have bright eyes, &amp;c. First Madam, I make choice of you rather than of your Mother, because you are younger than your Mother. Secondly, because I fancy you spell better, as having been at school later. Thirdly, because you have nothing to do but to write if you please, and possibly it may keep you from em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ploying your self worse: it may save some honest neighbouring Gentleman from three or four of your pestilent glances. Cast your eyes upon Paper, Madam, there you may look innocently: Men are seducing, books are dangerous, the amorous one's soften you, and the godly one's give you the spleen: If you look upon trees, they clasp in em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>braces; birds and beasts make love; the Sun is too warm for your blood, the Moon melts you into yeilding and melancholy. Therefore I say once more, cast your eyes upon Paper, and read only such Letters as I write, which convey no darts, no flames, but proceed from Innocence of soul, and simplicity of heart. However, I can al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low you a Bonnet lined with green for your eyes, but take care you don't tarnish it with ogling too fiercely: I am told, that hand you shade your self with this shining weather, is tann'd pretty much, only with being carried over those Eyes—thank God I am an hundred miles off from them—
<pb n="167" facs="167"/>
Upon the whole I wou'd sooner trust your hand than your Eyes for doing me mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chief; and tho' I doubt not some part of the rancour and iniquity of your heart will drop into your pen, yet since it will not attack me on a sudden and unprepar'd, since I may have time while I break open your letter to cross my self and say a <hi>Pater<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>noster,</hi> I hope Providence will protect me from all you can attempt at this distance.

                  <p>THE Wits would say, that this must needs be a dull Letter, because it is a marry'd one. I am afraid indeed you will find what Spirit there is must be on the side of the Wife, and the Husband's part as usual will prove the dullest. What an unequal Pair are put together in this sheet? in which tho' we sin, it is you must do penance. When you look on both sides of this paper, you may fancy that our words (according to a Scripture expression) are as a <hi>Two-edg'd Sword,</hi> whereof Lady <hi>M.</hi> is the shining blade and I only the Handle. But I can't proceed without so far mortifying Sir <hi>Robert</hi> as to tell him, that she writes this purely in obedience to
<pb n="169" facs="169"/>
me, and that it is but one of those honours a Husband receives for the sake of his Wife.</p>
                  <p>It is making court ill to one fine Woman to shew her the regard we have for another; and yet I must own there is not a period of this Epistle but squints toward another over<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>against it. It will be in vain to dissem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble: Your penetrating eyes cannot but disco<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver how all the letters that compose these words lean forward after Lady <hi>M</hi>'s letters, which seem to bend as much from mine, and fly from them as fast as they are able. Ungrateful letters that they are! which give themselves to another man in the very presence of him who will yield to no mor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tal in knowing how to value them.</p>
                  <p>You will think I forget my self, and am not writing to you; but let me tell you, 'tis you forget your self in that thought, for you are almost the only Woman to whom one can safely address the praises of another. Besides can you imagine a Man of my importance so stupid, as to say fine things to you before your Husband? Let us see how far Lady <hi>M.</hi> her self dares do any thing like it, with all the wit and address she is mistress of. If Sir <hi>Robert</hi> can be so ignorant (now he is left to himself in the country) to imagine any such matter, let him know from me, that here in town
<pb n="170" facs="170"/>
every thing that Lady says, is taken for Sa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tire. For my part, every body knows it is my constant practice to speak Truth, and I never do it more than when I call my self</p>

few proficients have a greater genius for Monsters than my self; but I never tasted a monster to that degree I have done this creature: It was not, like other monsters, produced in the Desarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> nor came from the country of the <hi>Great Mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gul,</hi> but is the production of the joint-en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deavours of a <hi>Kentish</hi> Parson and his Spouse, who intended in the singleness of heart to have begot a christian but of one sex, and providence has sent them one of two.</p>
                  <p>There are various opinions concerning this Creature about town, Mr. <hi>Cromwell</hi> observes that the Age is very licentious, and the present Reign very lewd and cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rupt, in permitting a Lady <hi>by Authority</hi> (as appears by the printed bills) to expose her personal curiosities for a shilling.</p>

                        </gap>
                     </hi> is of the same opinion.</p>
                  <p>Among these various conjectures, that I might be informed of the truth, I took along with me a Physician and a Divine, the one to inspect the state of its Body, the other to examine that of its Mind: The persons I made choice of were the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>genious Dr. <hi>P<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters" rend="content:_+">
                           <desc>blank</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> and the reverend Mr. <gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 word" rend="content: _____ ">
                        <desc>blank</desc>
                     </gap> We were no sooner in the room but the Party came to us drest in that habit in which the Ladies affect an Hermophrodi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tical imitation of Men—your sharp wit, my dear Sister, will immediately conclude that I mean a Riding-habit.</p>
                  <p>I think it not material to inform you, whether the Doctor, the Divine, or my self look'd first. The Priest you will ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liciously fancy was in his nature most an Infidel, and doubted most of this Miracle: we therefore propos'd to him to take the surest method of believing, seeing and feel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing: He comply'd with both admonitions, and having taken a large pinch of snuff upon it, advis'd us with a nod, that we should by no means regard it as a Female but as a Male, for by so doing we should be guilty of less sinfulness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="173"/>
The Doctor upon inspection differ'd from this opinion, he wou'd by no means allow it a miracle, or at most a natural one: He said upon the whole it was a woman; that whatever might give a handle to think otherwise, was a trifle, nothing being more common than for a child to be mark'd with that thing which the mother long'd for.</p>
                  <p>As for this Party's temper of mind, it appears to be a most even disposition, par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>taking of the good qualities of both sexes: for she is neither so inaccessible as other Ladies, nor is he so impudent as other Gentlemen. Of how obliging and com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plaisant a turn appears by this, that he tells the Ladies he has the Inclinations of a Gentleman, and that she tells the Gentlemen she has the <hi>Tendre</hi> of a La<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dy. As a further proof of this affable dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position, he formerly receiv'd visits of the fair sex in their masques, till an imperti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nent fellow in a female disguise mingled with a party of ladies, and impudently overheard their improving Speculations.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding this, she civilly promi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sed at my request, that my two sisters should be admitted privately whenever you wou'd do her the honour of your considera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="174"/>
How agreeable soever this sight has been to me, I assure you it cannot be so plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sing as the sight of you in town, and what<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever you may see in the country, I dare affirm no man or woman can shew you the like.</p>
                  <p>I therefore earnestly desire you to make haste to this place; for tho' indeed like most other brothers, I should be sorry you were married at my expence, yet I would by no means, like them, detain you in the country from your admirers, for you may believe me, no brother in the world ever lov'd a sister as I do you.</p>

                  <p>YOU are to understand, Madam, that my passion for your fair self and your sister, has been divided with the most won<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derful regularity in the world. Even from my infancy I have been in love with one after the other of you, week by week, and my journey to <hi>Bath</hi> fell out in the three hundred seventy sixth week of the Reign of my Sovereign Lady <hi>Sylvia.</hi> At the
<pb n="175" facs="175"/>
present writing hereof it is the three hun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dred eighty ninth week of the Reign of your most Serene Majesty, in whose service I was listed some weeks before I beheld your Sister. This information will account for my writing to either of you hereafter, as either shall happen to be Queen-Regent at that time.</p>
                  <p>Pray tell your sister, all the good qua<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lities and virtuous inclinations she has, never gave me so much pleasure in her conversation, as that one vice of her ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stinacy will give me mortification this month. <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> commands her to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and she refuses! indeed if I were in <hi>Berk<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shire</hi> I should honour her for this obstina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cy, and magnify her no less for disobedi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence than we do the <hi>Barcelonians.</hi> But people change with the change of places (as we see of late) and virtues become vi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces when they cease to be for one's interest, with me, as with others.</p>
                  <p>Yet let me tell her, she will never look so finely while she is upon earth, as she would here in the water. It is not here as in most other instances, for those Ladies that would please extremely, must go <hi>out</hi> of their own element. She does not make half so good a figure on horseback as <hi>Chri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden;</hi> but were she once seen in the Bath, no man wou'd part with
<pb n="176" facs="176"/>
her for the best Mermaid in christendom. You know I have seen you often, I perfectly know how you look in black and in white; I have experienc'd the utmost you can do in colours; but all your movements, all your graceful steps, deserve not half the glory you might here attain, of a moving and easy behaviour in <hi>Buckram:</hi> Some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing between swimming and walking, free enough, and more modestly-half-naked, than you can appear any where else. You have conquer'd enough already by land; show your ambition, and vanquish also by water. We have no pretty Admirals on these Seas, but must strike sails to your white Flags, were they once hoisted up. The Buckram I mention is a dress particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larly useful at this time, when we are told the Princess is bringing over the fashion of <hi>German</hi> Ruffs: You ought to use your selves to some degrees of stiffness beforehand. And when our Ladies chins have been tickled a-while with starch'd muslin and wire, they may possibly bear the brush of a <hi>German</hi> beard and whisker.</p>
                  <p>I cou'd tell you a delightful story of Dr <hi>P.</hi> but want room to display it in all its shining circumstances. He had heard it was an excellent cure for Love, to kiss the Aunt of the person beloved, who is gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rally of years and experience enough to

                  <p>IF you ask how the waters agree with me, I must tell you, so very well, that I question how you and I should agree if we were in a room by our selves? Mrs. <hi>T.</hi> has honestly assured me, that but for some whims which she can't entirely conquer, she would go and see the world with me in man's cloaths. Even you, <hi>Madam,</hi> I fancy (if you wou'd not partake in our adventures) would wait our coming in at the evening with some impatience, and be well enough pleas'd to hear 'em by the fire-side. That would be better than reading Romances, unless Lady <hi>M.</hi> would be our Historian; for as she is married, she has probably lei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure hours in the night-time, to write or do what she will in. What raises these desires in me, is an acquaintance I am be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ginning
<pb n="178" facs="178"/>
with my Lady <hi>Sandwich,</hi> who has all the spirit of the last age, and all the gay experience of a pleasurable life. It were as scandalous an omission to come to the <hi>Bath</hi> and not to see my Lady <hi>Sand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wich,</hi> as it had formerly been to have tra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vell'd to <hi>Rome</hi> without visiting the Queen of <hi>Sweden.</hi> She is, in a word, the best thing this Country has to boast of; and as she has been all that a woman of spirit could be, so she still continues that easy and independent creature that a sensible woman always will be.</p>
                  <p>I must tell you a truth, which is not however much to my credit. I never thought so much of your self and your sister, as since I have been fourscore miles distance from you. In the Forest I look'd upon you as good neighbours, at <hi>London</hi> as pretty kind of women, but here as divinities, angels, goddesses, or what you will. In the same manner I never knew at what a rate I valu'd your life, till you were upon the point of dying. If Mrs. <hi>T.</hi> and you will but fall very sick every season, I shall certainly die for you. Seriously I value you both so much that I esteem others much the less for your sakes; you have robb'd me of the pleasure of esteeming a thousand pretty qualities in them, by showing me so many finer in
<pb n="179" facs="179"/>
your selves. There are but two things in the world which could make you indifferent to me, which I believe you are not capa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble of, I mean Ill-nature and malice. I have seen enough of you not to overlook any Frailty you cou'd have, and nothing less than a Vice can make me like you less. I expect you shou'd discover by my con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duct towards you both, that this is true, and that therefore you should pardon a thousand things in me for that one dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position.

                     </hi> in particular, not to forestall your expectations before you see it: Only take a short account, which I will hazard my little credit is no unjust one. I never saw so great a thing with so much littleness in it: I think the Architect built it entirely in compliance to the taste of its Owners: for it is the most inhospitable thing imaginable, and the most selfish: it has, like their own hearts, no room for strangers, and no reception for any person of superior quality to themselves.
<pb n="185" facs="185"/>
There are but just two Apartments, for the Master and Mistress, below; and but two apartments above, (very much inferior to them) in the whole House. When you look upon the Outside, you'd think it large enough for a Prince; when you see the Inside, it is too little for a Subject; and has not conveniency to lodge a common family. It is a house of Entries and Pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sages; among which there are three Vi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sta's through the whole, very uselessly hand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>some. There is what might have been a fine Gallery, but spoil'd by two Arches towards the End of it, which take away the sight of several of the windows. There are two ordinary stair-cases instead of one great one. The best things within the house, are the Hall, which is indeed noble and well-proportion'd; and the cellars and offices under-ground, which are the most commodious, and the best contrived, of the whole. At the top of the building are several Cupola's and little Turrets that have but an ill effect, and make the building look at once fini<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cal and heavy. What seems of the best taste, is that Front towards the gardens, which is not yet loaded with these tur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rets. The two Sides of the building are intirely spoil'd by two monstrous bow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>windows
<pb n="186" facs="186"/>
which stand just in the middle, instead of doors: And as if it were fatal that some trifling littleness should every where destroy the grandeur, there are in the chief front two semicircles of a lower structure than the rest, that cut off the angles, and look as if they were purpose<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly design'd to hide a loftier and nobler piece of building, the top of which ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pears above them. In a word, the whole is a most expensive absurdity; and the Duke of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> gave a true character of it, when he said, it was a great <hi>Quarry of Stones above ground.</hi>

To eat <hi>Westphalia</hi>-Ham in a morning, ride over hedges and ditches on borrow'd Hacks, come home in the heat of the day with a feaver, and (what is worse a hundred times) with a red mark in the forehead from an uneasy hat; all this may qualify them to make excellent wives for Fox-hunters, and bear abundance of ruddy-complexion'd children. As soon as they can wipe off the sweat of the day, they must simper an hour and catch cold, in the Princess's apartment; from thence (as <hi>Shakespear</hi> has it) <hi>To dinner, with what ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>petite they may</hi>—and after that, 'till mid<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>night, walk, work, or think, which they please?

                  <p>NOthing could have more of that me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lancholy which once used to please me, than my last days journey; for after ha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ving pass'd through my favourite Woods in the forest, with a thousand Reveries of past pleasures: I rid over hanging hills, whose tops were edged with Groves, and whose Feet water'd with winding rivers, listning to the falls of Cataracts below, and the murmur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing of the winds above: The gloomy ver<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dure of <hi>Stonor</hi> succeeded to these; and then the shades of the evening overtook
<pb n="191" facs="191"/>
me. The Moon rose in the clearest sky I ever saw, by whose solemn light I paced on slowly, without company, or any interrup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion to the range of my thoughts. About a mile before I reach'd <hi>Oxford,</hi> all the bells toll'd in different notes; the clocks of every colledge answer'd one another; and sounded forth (some in a deeper, some a softer tone) that it was eleven at night. All this was no ill preparation to the life I have led since, among those old walls, venerable galleries, stone portico's, studious walks, and solitary scenes of the Univer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sity. I wanted nothing but a black gown and a salary, to be as meer a bookworm as any there. I conform'd my self to the Col<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lege hours, was roll'd up in books, lay in one of the most ancient, dusky parts of the University, and was as dead to the world as any Hermit of the desart. If any thing was alive or awake in me, it was a little Vanity; such as even those good men us'd to enter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain, when the Monks <hi>of their own Order</hi> extoll'd their piety and abstraction. For I found my self receiv'd with a sort of respect, which this idle part of mankind, the learn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, pay to their own species; who are as considerable here, as the busy, the gay, and the ambitious are in your world.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I was treated in such a manner, that I could not but sometimes ask my self
<pb n="192" facs="192"/>
in my mind, what College I was founder of, or what Library I had built? Methinks I do very ill to return to the world again, to leave the only place where I make a figure, and from seeing my self seated with dignity in the most conspicuous shelves of a libra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry, put my self into the abject posture of lying at a Lady's feet in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Square.</p>
                  <p>I will not deny, but that like <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the midst of my glory I am wounded, and find my self a meer man. To tell you from whence the dart comes, is to no pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose, since neither of you will take the ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der care to draw it out of my heart, and suck the poyson with your lips.</p>

And by this time, the Gentle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man you have made choice of is sensible, how great is the joy of having all those charms and good qualities which have pleas'd so many, now apply'd to please one only.

                  <p>THE chief cause I have to repent my leaving the town, is the uncertainty I am in every day of your Sister's state of health. I really expected by every post to have heard of her recovery, but on the contrary each letter has been a new awakening to my apprehensions, and I have ever since suffer'd alarms up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on alarms on her account. No one can be more sensibly touch'd at this than I; nor any danger of any I love cou'd af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect me with more uneasiness, (tho' as I never had a sister I can't be quite so good a judge as you, how far humanity wou'd carry me) I have felt some weaknesses of a tender kind, which I would not be free from, and I am glad to find my value for people so rightly plac'd, as to perceive them on this occasion.</p>
                  <p>I cannot be so good a christian as to be willing (tho' no less than God should order it) to resign my own happiness here for hers in another life. I do more than wish for her safety, for every wish I make I find immediately chang'd into a prayer,

and a more fervent one than I had learn'd to make till now.</p>

Therefore if you should take it into favour again upon its repentance, and continue in it, you would be so far from leading what is commonly call'd an un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>settled life, (and what you with too much unjust severity call a Vagabond Life,) that the wise cou'd only look upon you as a Prince in a progress, who travels to gain the affections he has not, or to fix those he already has; which he effectually does wherever he shews himself. But if you are resolv'd in revenge to rob the world of so much example as you may afford it, I be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lieve your design will be vain; for even in a Monastery your devotions cannot carry

you so far toward the next world as to make This lose the sight of you, but you'll be like a Star, that while it is fix'd to Hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven shines over all the Earth.</p>

You will do me an injustice if you look upon any thing I shall say from this in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stant, as a compliment, either to you or to my self: Whatever I write will be the real thought of that hour; and I know you'll no more expect it of me to perse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vere till death in every sentiment or no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion I now set down, than you would ima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gine a man's face should never change when once his picture was drawn.</p>
                  <p>The freedom I shall use in this manner of <hi>thinking aloud,</hi> may indeed prove me a fool; but it will prove me one of the best sort of fools, the honest ones. And since what folly we have, will infallibly buoy up
<pb n="200" facs="200"/>
at one time or other in spight of all our art to keep it down; methinks 'tis almost foolish to take any pains to conceal it at all, and almost knavish to do it from those that are our friends. If <hi>Momus</hi>'s project had taken, of having windows in our breasts, I shou'd be for carrying it further, and making those windows, casements; that while a man show'd his heart to all the world, he might do something more for his friends, even give it them, and trust it to their handling. I think I love you as well as King <hi>Herod</hi> did <hi>Herodias</hi> (tho' I never had so much as one dance with you) and would as freely give you my heart in a dish, as he did another's head. But since <hi>Jupiter</hi> will not have it so, I must be con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tent to shew my taste in life, as I do my taste in painting, by loving to have as lit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tle drapery as possible. Not that I think every body naked altogether so fine a sight, as your self and a few more would be; but because 'tis good to use people to what they must be acquainted with; and there will certainly come some day of judgment or other, to uncover every soul of us. We shall then see that the <hi>Prudes</hi> of this world ow'd all their fine figure only to their being straiter-lac'd than the rest; and that they are naturally as arrant Squabs as those that went more loose, nay as those
<pb n="201" facs="201"/>
that never girded their lions at all.—But a particular reason that may engage you to write your thoughts the more freely to me, is, that I am confident no one knows you better; for I find, when others express their thoughts of you, they fall ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry short of mine, and I know at the same time theirs are such as you would think sufficiently in your favour.</p>
                  <p>You may easily imagine how desirous I must be of a correspondence with a per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son, who had taught me long ago that it was as possible to esteem at first sight, as to love: and who has since ruin'd me for all the conversation of one sex, and almost all the friendship of the other. I am but too sensible thro' your means, that the company of men wants a certain softness to recommend it, and that of women wants every thing else. How often have I been quietly going to take possession of that tranquility and indolence I had so long found in the country; when one evening of your conversation has spoil'd me for a <hi>Solitaire!</hi> Books have lost their ef<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect upon me, and I was convinced since I saw you, that there is one alive wiser than all the Sages: a plague of female wis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom! it makes a man ten times more un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>easy than his own. What is very strange, Virtue her self, (when you have the dres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sing
<pb n="202" facs="202"/>
her) is too amiable for one's repose. You might have done a world of good in your time, if you had allow'd half the fine gentlemen who have seen you to have con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versed with you; they would have been strangely Bitt, while they thought only to fall in love with a fair Lady, and you had bewitch'd them with Reason and Virtue (two Beauties that the very fops pretend to no acquaintance with.)</p>
                  <p>The unhappy distance at which we cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>respond, removes a great many of those restrictions and punctilious decorums, that oftentimes in nearer conversation prejudice truth, to save good breeding. I may now hear of my faults, and you of your good qualities, without a blush; we converse upon such unfortunate generous terms, as exclude the regards of fear, shame, or design, in either of us. And methinks it would be as paltry a part, to impose (even in a single thought) upon each other in this state of separation, as for Spirits of a different sphere who have so little inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>course with us, to employ that little (as some would make us think they do) in putting tricks and delusions upon poor mortals.</p>
                  <p>Let me begin then, Madam, by asking you a question, that may enable me to judge better of my own conduct than most
<pb n="203" facs="203"/>
instances of my Life. In what manner did I behave the last hour I saw you? What degree of concern did I discover when I felt a misfortune which I hope you will never feel, that of parting from what one most esteems? for if my part<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing look'd but like that of your common acquaintance, I am the greatest of all the hypocrites that ever Decency made.</p>
                  <p>I never since pass by your house but with the same sort of melancholy that we feel upon seeing the Tomb of a friend, which only serves to put us in mind of what we have lost. I reflect upon the circumstances of your departure which I was there a witness of (your behaviour in what I may call your last moments) and I indulge a gloomy kind of pleasure in thinking that those last moments were gi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven to me. I would fain imagine this was not accidental, but proceeded from a penetration which I know you have, in finding out the truth of people's senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments; and that you were willing, the last man that <hi>would have</hi> parted from you, should be that last that <hi>did.</hi> I really look'd upon you just as the friends of <hi>Curtius</hi> might have done upon that Hero, at the instant when he was devoting himself to Glory, and running to be lost out of ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nerosity. I was oblig'd to admire your re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>solution,
<pb n="204" facs="204"/>
in as great a degree as I deplo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>red it; and had only to wish, that hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven would reward so much Virtue as was to be taken from us, with all the felicities it could enjoy elsewhere!</p>

                  <p>YOU will find me more troublesome than ever <hi>Brutus</hi> did his Evil Genius; I shall meet you in more places than one, and often refresh your memory be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore you arrive at your <hi>Philippi.</hi> These shadows of me (my letters) will be haunt<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing you from time to time, and putting you in mind of the man who has really suffer'd very much from you, and whom you have robb'd of the most valuable of his enjoyments, your conversation. The advantage of hearing your sentiments by discovering mine, was what I always thought a great one, and even worth the risque I generally run of manifesting my own indiscretion. You then rewarded my trust in you the moment it was given,

for you pleas'd or inform'd me the minute you answer'd. I must now be contented with more slow returns. However 'tis some pleasure, that your thoughts upon Paper will be a more lasting possession to me, and that I shall no longer have cause to complain of a loss I have so often re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gretted, that of any thing you said, which I happen'd to forget. In earnest, Madam, if I were to write to you as often as I think of you, it must be every day of my life. I attend you in spirit thro' all your ways, I follow you thro' every stage in books of Travels, and fear for you thro' whole folio's; you make me shrink at the past dangers of dead travellers; and if I read of a delightful prospect, or agreeable place, I hope it yet subsists to please you. I enquire the roads, the amusements, the company, of every town and country thro' which you pass, with as much diligence, as if I were to set out next week to over<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>take you. In a word, no one can have you more constantly in mind, not even your guardian Angel (if you have one) and I am willing to indulge so much Popery, as to fancy some Being takes care of you, who knows your value better than you do your self: I am willing to think that hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven never gave so much self-neglect and resolution to a woman, to occasion her

calamity, but am pious enough to believe those qualities must be intended to conduce to her benefit and her glory.</p>
                  <p>Your first short letter only serves to show me you are alive: it puts me in mind of the first Dove that return'd to <hi>Noah,</hi> and just made him know it had found no rest abroad.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing in it that pleases me, but when you tell me you had no Sea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sickness. I beg your next may give me all the pleasure it can, that is, tell me any that you receive. You can make no discoveries that will be half so valuable to me as those of your own mind: Nothing that regards the States or Kingdoms you pass thro', will engage so much of my curi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>osity or concern, as what relates to your self: Your welfare, to say truth, is more at my heart than that of Christendom.</p>
                  <p>I am sure I may defend the truth, tho' perhaps not the virtue, of this declaration. One is ignorant, or doubtful at best, of the Merits of differing religions and go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernments: but private virtues one can be sure of. I therefore know what particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lar person has desert enough to merit be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing happier than others, but not what Nation deserves to conquer or oppress an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>other.
