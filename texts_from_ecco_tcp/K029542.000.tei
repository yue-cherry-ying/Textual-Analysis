It takes its name from a contemptible black pool, which is said to be unfathomable, and of which there is a prophecy, that it shall

         <p>The Theatre is held in great repute.

<pb n="14" facs="21"/>
to have been modelled from be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore Shakespeare's time. The plot was in part similar to a burletta, which has frequently been exhi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bited in London, called La Serva Padrona, but the music was cer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tainly <hi>not</hi> Pergolen. The or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chestra, to be sure, was exceed<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ingly contracted; but we must reflect, that some of our best, as well as earliest dramas, were only accompanied by a Harp. The price of admittance to this ele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gant entertainment, would have

in height, but the latter is cer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tainly at least an hundred yards—both of them are shaded with beautiful woods on the sides of hills, whose summits are in the clouds, and whose feet are white<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ned by the foam of these tre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mendous cataracts.</p>
         <p>Before we reached Tan y Bwlch, we stopped to look into a small church; where some clean<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly villagers were assembled at evening prayers,—the women were by far the handsomest of

any I saw in this country; the clergyman was reading the lesson concerning David and his Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cubines, and I could not help reflecting, that if these ignorant people should any way confound the Old with the New Law, they might here find some excuse for that Gallantry, which sacrifices the virtue of so many females in this neighbourhood: to prevent such a mistake, would it not be proper to have an exposition made of this chapter, and trans<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lated

         <p>I was much struck with the situation of Mrs. Griffith's house at Tan y Bwlch,—at first fight it somewhat resembled Matlock Bath, but the hills in front are thrown to a fine distance, and behind the house they are co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vered with wood;—through a very spacious valley the river Dryryd runs, and from the tops

         <p>I made diligent enquiry through all Carnarvonshire, and this part of Denbighshire, for the Glyder Mountain, which Gibson has particularly described, and which, from its singularity, (say the Authors of a Tour through Wales,) we more wished to have seen, than the Summits of either Plinlimmon or Snow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>don.</p>

gained such Information, that I am confident any future Traveller may very readily satisfy his Cu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riosity; an old Boatman there informed me, that he had fre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently seen it,—that in his younger days indeed it was some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>times termed the Glyder, but was now known only by the name of Wythwar,—that it was within a mile or two of a Village, called Clynog, and upon the Shore almost opposite to Carnar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>von.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="86" facs="93"/>On my way to St. Asaph, I passed over the top of Penmaen Ross, a steep and formidable Mountain; this is by far the worst part of the road between Holyhead and Chester;—a nearer Path was some time since cut along the side of the sea cliff, but a Man and Horse had lately been killed, and by order of the Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>missioners it is now entirely broken up.</p>
         <p>The City of St. Asaph is called in British Llan Elwy, on account
<pb n="87" facs="94"/>
of its situation at the Conflux of the River Elwy with the Clwyd; and St. Asaph by the English, from its Patron Asaph, who in the year 560 erected a Bishop's See there. The Bishop of this Diocese has no entire County un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der his Jurisdiction, but Parts only of the Counties of Flint, Denbigh, Montgomery, Merio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neth, and Salop. The Cathedral is a mean Structure, and the Houses in general but ill built, St. Asaph however may boast that
<pb n="88" facs="95"/>
it stands in the delightful Vale of Clwyd, though by no means in the finest part of it.</p>
         <p>About five miles from thence, near the road to Holywell, You have the best View I think of that fertile and delicious Vale;—it is of an oval shape, about 25 miles in length, and about eight miles wide in its broadest part; it lies open only to the Ocean, and to the clearing North Wind, being elsewhere guarded with high mountains, which towards
<pb n="89" facs="96"/>
the East especially are like Battle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments or Turrets, for by an ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mirable Contrivance of Nature, says Camden, the tops of these Mountains resemble the Turrets of Walls. Upon the whole however I think that there are other cultivated Scenes in North Wales equal, if not superior; in the Vale of Clwyd indeed You have the Lively and the Beauti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful, but in Montgomeryshire the Awful and Sublime.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="90" facs="97"/>Holywell, and the History of its Virgin Saint, would require at least a Folio. I shall only say that I was truly sorry to find that blasphemous Papers should still be suffered to be publicly sold at the Spring there, which compare the ludicrous Legend of Winefrid with the most sacred Truths of the Gospel.</p>
         <p>It was my Intention to have seen Winstay, Erthig, and Chirk Castle<note place="bottom" n="*">Sir Watkin Wynne's, Mr. Yorke's and Mr. Middleton's.</note>,
<pb n="91" facs="98"/>
and afterwards to have traced the River Dee to Bala, but I was unexpectedly called off from my Tour; I had the good fortune however to join Party with the Bishop of Kildare, whose easy Manners and refined Conversa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion left me no room to regret a Disappointment.</p>
         <p>To the foregoing Account, which was in part printed off for the Use and Amusement of some select Friends only, I shall now add a few general Remarks on
<pb n="92" facs="99"/>
the History of the Country and the Manners of its Inhabitants.</p>
         <p>The Origin of every Nation is necessarily obscure, and always lost in a pretended Antiquity. On the Authority of Bochart we may trace the Welsh from Japhet, the Son of Noah; according to Others, from Trojans and Phoe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nicians, who were the Offspring of Gods; and one Writer I think has asserted that a True Briton is a Compound of all Nations under Heaven. That Britain
<pb n="93" facs="100"/>
however was peopled from Gaul 1000 years before Christ, appears very probable,—the arguments in favour of this opinion are de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duced from the State of Popula<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion on the Continent, and from the Progress of it in the Island it<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self. It has been well observed <note place="bottom" n="*">By Whitaker.</note> that Names descriptive of na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tional Manners cannot be the original Appellations of any peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple, they result from the inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>course
<pb n="94" facs="101"/>
and experience of the States around them, on whose territories they have dared to en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>croach; the Appellation of Bri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gantes, according to Strabo, came to signify a turbulent and plun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dering race, and the Denomina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions of Celtae and Gael came to import, even amongst themselves, the Ferocious and the Stranger.</p>
         <p>The Name of Cymri appears to have been the great hereditary Distinction of the Gauls upon the Continent, and to have been car<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ried
<pb n="95" facs="102"/>
with them into all their Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quests; it was not retained in our Island merely by the Natives of Wales, but was equally the Appellation of a Nation in the South-West of Somersetshire and the North-East of Cornwall.</p>
         <p>The first Denomination of our Island was certainly Albion, a name given before the Country was inhabited; it was the Celtic Term for Heights or Eminences; the Alps some ages before the Days of Strabo were called Al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bia,
<pb n="96" facs="103"/>
and in his time there remain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed two tribes on the Mountains that bore the Names of Albioeci, and Albienses.</p>
         <p>The second Denomination was that of Britain, derived from a Celtic Word likewise signifying <hi>Divided,</hi> not <hi>Painted</hi>; this Etymo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>logy has lately been proved not to have been applied to the Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gion, but bestowed on the Inhabi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters; not previously borne on the Continent by the original Settlers of the Country, but assumed o<gap resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">

         <p>The Title of Welsh seems to arise from the Word Wall or Gall, an appellation which the Britons frequently gave each other; nor will this Derivation appear forced if we add, that the Channel be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>twixt France and England was denominated Sinus Vallicus, or the Gallick Strait, so late as the eighth Century, and that the Dutch and Germans call the
<pb n="98" facs="105"/>
French by the Name of Walls and Walloons to this very Day.</p>
         <p>The general Denomination of Wales was not imposed on the Country by the Saxons, but was the acknowledged Appellation of the Region as early as the sixth Century, if we may believe a Quotation from Taliessin, as cited by Dr. Davies.</p>

of what They called True Reli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gion, they of course possessed the greatest authority among the peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple; No Laws were instituted by the Princes without their Advice, no Plunder taken in War without their partaking of it. They held the Dissolution of the World by Fire and Water, they taught the Immortality, and some say the Transmigration of the Soul, a Doctrine borrowed from the Py<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thagoreans, though Clemens A<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lexandrinus expressly asserts that
<pb n="102" facs="109"/>
the Pythagoreans borrowed that Doctrine from them; in my own opinion they never believed the Transmigration of the Soul at all; and I found this opinion on some late Accounts of Gaulish Funerals, which certainly cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>responded with the British ones, the Customs and Ceremonials of which were absolutely incompa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tible with that Doctrine.</p>
         <p>They sacrificed human Victims to propitiate the Gods; and pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phesied future Events from the
<pb n="103" facs="110"/>
falling of the Body, and the Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner in which the Members were convulsed;—they believed there was a divine Mystery in Misleto, but took their first Distinction from the Oak, to which the Jews paid the same regard during their Idolatry, according to a Pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sage in Ezekiel, <q rend="inline">"under every thick <hi>Oak</hi> did they offer sweet Sa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>crifice to their Idols."</q> Once a, year They, with their Chief, an Arch-Druid, assembled at a fixed time and place to hear Causes,
<pb n="104" facs="111"/>
and determine all Disputes; where their decisive Court was held has never been determined, but most probably in Anglesea, as that Island was certainly their Metropolis. So great was the Power of the Druids, that not only the Property, but also the Lives of the People were entirely at their Disposal, and this Power continued absolute till the time of Tiberius;—it was afterwards suppressed by Claudius, under the fair Pretext of abolishing human
<pb n="105" facs="112"/>
sacrifices, but the Priests them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves, their Gods and their Al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tars subsisted, though in obscurity, till the final Destruction of Paga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nism.</p>
         <p>The Manners of the People were naturally tinged with the Discipline of their Teachers; in proportion to their ignorance they were superstitious, and in proportion to their zeal they committed Cruelties and Fraud; I shall not raise Disgust by a recital of Barbarities, but rather refer my
<pb n="106" facs="113"/>
Readers to the Journals of mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dern Voyages, where they will find, that there is a Sameness in the primaeval State of every sa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vage Nation: a few other Particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lars however may not be uninte<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>resting. The Britons lived in Tribes or Clans, under the Aristo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cratical rule of their several Lords; their Villages were a con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fused Parcel of Huts placed at a small distance from each other, and, generally speaking, in the middle of a Wood, whereof the
<pb n="107" facs="114"/>
Avenues were defended with Trees, that were cut down to clear the ground.</p>
         <p>Their Trade was very inconsi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derable, notwithstanding the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venient situation of the Island for carrying on an extensive Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce; Their vessels were very small, with their Keels and Ribs made of slight Timber, inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>woven with Wicker, and covered with Hides, which shews that they never undertook long Voy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ages, most probably never ven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tured
<pb n="108" facs="115"/>
to Sea beyond the Coasts of Gaul.</p>
         <p>The Britons were not so total<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly destitute of Defence as has been imagined; the Island is of itself a Shield, and they certainly made use of the Battle-axe, as well as Military Chariot; these Chariots were drawn by Horses, and the Axle-trees were generally furnish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed with Scythes; but the People were not united under a well re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gulated government, or they would always have continued
<pb n="109" facs="116"/>
formidable to their Enemies;—a number of petty Communities will never act in concert with each other; tho' History informs us that upon great and extraordi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nary Dangers a Chief Commander was always chosen by common consent; but what State or Co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lony will acquiesce even with the Leader themselves have chosen? and in the end, if unsuccessful, he must always fall a Sacrifice to those Miseries their own Incon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sistencies alone have occasioned.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="111" facs="117"/>When that part of Britain which comprehends the present Kingdom of England and Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cipality of Wales, was divided into several petty Kingdoms, the Inhabitants were all distinguished by different names. The Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cipality of Wales, formerly com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prehending the whole Country beyond the Severn, was in the Roman times occupied by the Silures, the Dimetae, and Ordo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vices; to these belonged not only the twelve Counties of Wales,
<pb n="110" facs="118"/>
but likewise the two others ly<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing beyond the Severn, Hereford<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shire and Monmouthshire, which in the reign of Charles the Second were first reckoned amongst the English Counties.</p>
         <p>The Country now known by the name of North Wales was in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>habited by the Ordovices only, who held out first against the Romans, and afterwards against the English, after the other Bri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tons were subdued; for by the Romans they were not reduced
<pb n="112" facs="119"/>
till the time of Domitian, nor by the English till the Reign of Henry the First.</p>
         <p>About forty-five years before the Christian Aera, Britain was first invaded by the Romans un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der Julius Caesar,—afterwards by Claudius, and at length became a Province under the Roman em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pire; it was governed by Lieute<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nants, or Deputies, sent from Rome, as Ireland is now by De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>puties from England; and con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinued thus under the Romans
<pb n="113" facs="120"/>
for upwards of 400 years; till that Empire being invaded by the Goths and Vandals, the Romans were forced not only to recall their own armies, but also to draw from hence the bravest of the Britons, for their assistance against those Barbarians.</p>
         <p>The Country being left in a defenceless State, was invaded by the Scots, who were so rapacious, that the Britons sent over a miser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able application for relief to Aetius, the Roman General, who
<pb n="114" facs="121"/>
by several famous Successes, for a time, had repelled the violence of the Gothick Arms, but receiving no hopes of any Succours from that General, the South Britons invited over the Saxons, who no sooner delivered them from their ancient Foes the Picts and Scots, than they strengthened their own Numbers, turned their Arms a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gainst the Natives, and conquer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed them, some few excepted, who secured themselves in their Moun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tains of Wales; whence their De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scendants
<pb n="115" facs="122"/>
have always been distinguished by the Title of Ancient Britons.</p>
         <p>During the Saxon Heptarchy <gap resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">
               <desc>illegible</desc>
            </gap>ived the renowed Prince Arthur, whose Valour would have re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trieved the miserable state of the Britons, had Valour only been wanting; his History has been so blended with Fable, that some have doubted the real existence of such a Person; but it seems ra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther hard because Stories have been invented concerning the Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
<pb n="116" facs="123"/>
of his Life, that he should not be allowed to have lived at all; it is true that the Saxon An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nals make no mention of this King, but it was not probable that the Saxons would be fond of recording Exploits, which re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dounded only to their own dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>credit; an ancient English Histo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rian speaking of Cerdic, mentions his fighting several Battles with King Arthur; and William of Malmesbury owns, that though the Britons had vented innu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merable
<pb n="117" facs="124"/>
Fables concerning this Prince, he certainly was a Hero worthy to be celebrated in True History. The Britons bewailed <q rend="inline">"their long lost Arthur"</q> for se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veral Ages after his Death;—they believed he was still alive in Fairy Land, and that he would return once more to reign over them; nor was this notion rooted out till the reign of Henry the Second, about six hundred years after<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards, when his Coffin was dug up at Glastenbury in Somerset<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shire,
<pb n="118" facs="125"/>
with the following Inscrip<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, <q rend="inline">"Here lies buried the re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nowned King Arthur in the Island Avalonia."</q> The Exploits of this Warrior have not only been sung by Taliessin and other British Bards, but have been ce<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lebrated by one of the greatest of our English Poets; it seems by some Hints given by Spenser, that he intended a Poem whose title was to be expressly, King Ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thur;—Dryden tells us that he had some thoughts of making
<pb n="119" facs="126"/>
choice for the subject of an He<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>roic Poem, King Arthur's Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quests over the Saxons; Milton, in a Latin Address to Mansus, has likewise intimated the same Intention.</p>
         <p>Wales was anciently bounded by the Irish Seas, and by the Ri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vers Severn and Dee, till the Saxons became Masters of all the level Countries over those Rivers; and till Offa, king of Mercia, made the celebrated Trench, which is still called by
<pb n="120" facs="127"/>
his Name. This Trench, which extended from North to South,—from the mouth of the River Dee to that of the Wye, has been thought to have been an Imita<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of the Ramparts, which were thrown up by Agricola, Adrian, and Severus, to guard the Romans against the Incursions of the Nor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thern Barbarians; but from some Remains of it, as well as for se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veral other Reasons, it seems more probable, that it was not in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tended by Offa as a Fortification,
<pb n="121" facs="128"/>
but rather as a Boundary betwixt his Kingdom and the Cambrian Province.</p>
         <p>When after many Events be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween the several Races of the Heptarchy, Ecbert became the sole King of England, as it was now distinguished from the Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cipality of Wales, he possessed himself also of Mona, the Capi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tal of the Cambrian Province; but the Saxons some time after<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards being driven out of it, it was from them called Anglesea,
<pb n="122" facs="129"/>
Englishman's Island, a name which it has retained ever since.</p>
         <p>In the year eight hundred and forty-three all Wales was united under the Dominion, of Roderic, surnamed the Great; who, by a testamentary Settlement, made a new Division between three Sons into three Districts, which were called Kingdoms, and distinguish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed by the Names of South Wales, Powis Land, and North Wales this Partition gave rise to many Wars, which caused the King<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom
<pb n="123" facs="130"/>
of Powis Land to be por<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tioned among the Conquerors, and annexed partly to South Wales, and partly to North Wales, Divisions which subsist to this Day.</p>
         <p>No sooner were the Saxons set<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tled under one Monarch, than the Danes began to trouble them, as they (the Saxons) had before done the Britons, till, after many In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vasions, Edgar King of England set forth the first Navy, made Peace with the Danes, and allow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed
<pb n="124" facs="131"/>
them to live in his Dominions mixed with the English;—at this time we read of five Kings in Wales, who all did him Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mage for their Country.</p>
         <p>Notwithstanding many At<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tempts of the English, the Welsh enjoyed their own Laws, and lived under their own Princes, till in the year 1282 Llewellin lost both his Principality and Life; in the reign of Henry the Eighth Wales was incorporated and united with England; and
<pb n="125" facs="132"/>
by a Statute of the 27th of that Reign, all Laws and Liberties of England were to take place there; from which time the Welsh have approved themselves truly wor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thy of their high Origin, loyal and dutiful to their King, and always zealous for the Welfare of the Community.</p>
         <p>The Welsh Language is still the Gomerian or Old Celtic, the same that was once spoken throughout Europe, except that through length of time, and In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>termixture
<pb n="126" facs="133"/>
of the people with the Scythians and other nations, it has split into a variety of Dialects. No Tongue, either ancient or mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dern, I believe, bears greater Marks of antiquity; its strong resem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blance to the Hebrew has been generally admitted, insomuch that one Author of great Learning has given a Specimen of a consider<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able number of Phrases out of the Old Testament, which are so alike in both, that they seem to have been originally the same. It is
<pb n="127" facs="134"/>
no uncommon Error to give the Name of Mother Tongue to those Languages, from which some known Idioms only are derived; the Hebrew has been considered as a Mother Tongue, but was evidently borrowed from the Phoenician; the Latin is called the Mother tongue to the Italian, the Spanish, and the French, but the Latin itself was derived from the Tuscan, and the Tuscan from the Celtic and the Greek. It will reasonably be asked, how the Go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merians
<pb n="128" facs="135"/>
have preserved their Lan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guage almost entire, whilst the Jews have suffered theirs to be corrupted, and blended with those of their Conquerors?—for this, many reasons may be assigned; the Former have not been so fre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently subdued, and they have always preserved a considerable Regard for what They conceived to be a Mother tongue; a regard greatly kept up perhaps by the Custom which the Lowest of the People had, of reciting their Ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nealogies.
<pb n="129" facs="136"/>
This ancient Lan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guage is spoken the nearest to its original purity in the uncul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tivated parts of North Wales, but the Welsh in general still retain so high a veneration for it, that I am confident they will never readily suffer the English to be entirely made use of in their Churches, or taught solely in their Schools.</p>
         <p>Much has been said of those Druidical Remains, which by many Authors have been indis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>criminately
<pb n="130" facs="137"/>
called Carns, Car<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nedds, and Cromlechs; but of their original meaning, I shall venture the following Conjecture,—that by the word Carn, which signified a Rock, the Britons sim<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ply implied one large broad Stone, as a covering for a Grave<note place="bottom" n="*">The Word Carn was afterwards used in an ill sense, most probably when the Mode of Burial came to be changed on the Introduction of Christianity; ther<gap resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">

by a Carnedd, a heap of Stones thrown rudely together to com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>memorate an event; and by a Cromlech, an huge, broad, flat Stone raised high on other Stones, where the ancient Bri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tons, like the Hebrews, made Sacrifices or paid religious Ado<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ration.</p>
         <p>Those nice Distinctions that have been formed of the Druids, the Bards and the Vates, sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sisted only, I think, in particular Societies; the Druids in general
<pb n="132" facs="139"/>
composed and recited Hymns, as worship to their Deities; the Bards <note place="bottom" n="*">The Bards, who were inferior Druids, wore an ecclesiastical Ornament during the celebration of their Rites, called by the Latins Caputium, or Cu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cullus, which is still retained in our Uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versities; the Gauls, who borrowed this custom from the British Druids, wore the Cucullus remarkably long, whence it ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tained, on its being made use of at Rome, the name of Bardo-Cucullus, or Bard's Hood. It was in allusion to the Shape of this Hood, that Martial feared lest a Sheet of his Book should be rolled up to put Pepper or Frankincense in: <q>Ne Thuris Piperisve sit Cucullus. <bibl>VID. NICHOLLS.</bibl>
               </q>
            </note> certainly composed
<pb n="133" facs="140"/>
Hymns likewise; but it was in the hour of Battle that their labours were chiefly celebrated, by singing the Exploits of de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceased Heroes; while the Vates were principally engaged in the Rites of Sacrifice, or the Arts of Divination.</p>
         <p>The Welsh have always laid claim to the Discovery of Ame<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rica, in preference to the Great Co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lumbus, but this claim has hither<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to been supported with little more than bare Conjecture; in the
<pb n="134" facs="141"/>
twelfth Century, according to Powell, there was a War in Wales for the Succession, upon the Death of Owen Guinneth; and a Bast<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ard having carried it from the lawful Heirs, one of the latter, called Madoc, put to Sea, and sailing west from Spain, disco<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vered a new world of wonderful Fertility;—to prove that a coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try was thus discovered, the Welsh have recourse to the Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thority of Meridith ap Rhees, who composed an Ode in honour
<pb n="135" facs="142"/>
Prince Madoc and his new-found Land; and that this Country was America they have alledged on the credit of Peter Martyr, that the Natives of Virginia celebrated the memory of one Madoc, as a great and ancient Hero; and al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ways supposed their Ancestors to have come thither at first, from some very distant Countries on the other side the great Water, at the time that has been as<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serted, and from the same point of the Compass. The af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>finity
<pb n="136" facs="143"/>
of Language has since been frequently urged by modern Travellers, and Bishop Nicholson in particular, speaks confidently that the British makes a considerable part of several of the American Tongues; in an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swer to these Assertions, the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>genious Dr. Robertson has just now declared, that he conceives the skill of the Welsh in the twelfth Century, not to have been equal to such a Voyage; and that the instances given of
<pb n="137" facs="144"/>
the affinity of Language are so obscure and fanciful, that no conclusion can be drawn from them; to these remarks he adds, that if the Welsh towards the Close of the twelfth Century had settled in any part of America, some remains of the Christian doctrine must have been after<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards found among their Des<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cendants, when they were dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>covered three hundred years after their migration;—but here I must entirely disagree with the learned Author,—three hundred
<pb n="138" facs="145"/>
years cannot in this case be called a <q rend="inline">"short period;"</q>—one Century would probably have been suf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cient to have obliterated every mark of a Religion, that had to combat with the prejudices of an unlettered people; that did not address itself immediately to their Interests, and through a Mode of Civilization, teach them at first only, as Warburton well expresses it, <note place="bottom" n="*">
               <p>The Gospel, plain and simple as it is, and fitted in its nature for what it was ordained to effect, requires an intellect something above that of a Savage to ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prehend.

            <pb n="139" facs="146"/>Christianity seems to have been introduced into Britain, as early as the first Century, but of this great Event our Accounts must necessarily be very imper<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect, as the Saxons destroyed al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most all the Writings in which it was recorded; Mona, we read, had certainly a School of Chris<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tian

Learning many years before 182, when there was an Arch<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bishop of Caerleon, and Suffra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gans under him; but the Clergy had no distinct Parishes either in Anglesea or any other part of the kingdom, till many years afterwards. About the year 600, Pope Gregory sent Austin the Monk to preach the Gospel in England to the Heathen Saxons, who was received by Ethelbert; and being admitted to explain the Doctrine and
<pb n="141" facs="148"/>
Mysteries of it, so well succeeded that he converted great numbers, and at length the King himself. Thus the Christian Religion came to be established in England under the Rites and Authority of the Romish Church, by which Austin was instituted Chief Bishop, and seated by the Saxon king at Canterbury; but his Jurisdiction, though admitted in all the Saxon Territories, was not received by the British Priests or People in Wales.—In the
<pb n="142" facs="149"/>
reign of Elizabeth the Bible and Common Prayer were first trans<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lated into the Welsh Tongue, and at that time the People are said to have adhered to the Ru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brick and Constitution of the Church with a scrupulous exact<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness; how far the Doctrines and Worship of Christianity may have deviated from their origi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nal purity, or how far the Welsh may have been affected by the refined Tenets of their English Neighbours, I shall not presume
<pb n="143" facs="150"/>
to determine, at present I think there is every where much to be feared, from the Growth of Enthusiasm, the subtleties of In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fidelity, and the Necessity, as well as Danger of Innovation.</p>
         <p>Many Popish customs are still retained in Wales, particularly Offerings made to the Dead,—these Offerings must of course vary according to the Rank of the Persons deceased, as well as the Affection that is borne to their Memories; I was at a
<pb n="144" facs="151"/>
Pauper's Funeral where the Do<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nations amounted to half a Crown, and I met with a Clergyman afterwards who had once re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceived ninety Guineas.</p>
         <p>Great complaints are made in many parts of this Country of the exorbitant Demands of Land<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lords, and that the Rent of Ground is now advanced much higher than it will bear;—such Complaints must of course be expected from the Sufferers, but I believe, they are here in
<pb n="145" facs="152"/>
some instances made with reason; the landlords on the contrary may urge perhaps, that they act with strict Justice, and that they have a Right at least to try the experiment; but it should be remembered that the Extreme of Right is Wrong, and there is a Tribute of Hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manity due from the Superior, that He should be always on a Certainty that he does not exact too much.</p>

            <pb n="146" facs="153"/>National Characters should always be read with Exceptions; but if I must give my opinion of the Inhabitants of North Wales, I shall say, that the common people in general are civil and grateful, the Farmers rather slow and suspicious, a Few of the inferior 'Squires re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain somewhat of the sottish and the brutal, but among the higher Ranks, I have found, in the same proportion as in

England, lettered Society, hospi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>table Reception, and refined Address.</p>
