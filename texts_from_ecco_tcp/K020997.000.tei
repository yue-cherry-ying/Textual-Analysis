            <l>BLEST be the hour, when fav'ring gales restore</l>
            <l>The travell'd artist to his native shore!</l>
            <l>His mind enlighten'd, and his fancy fraught</l>
            <l>With finest forms by ancient genius wrought;</l>
            <l n="5">Whose magic beauty charm'd, with spell sublime,</l>
            <l>The scythe of Ruin from the hand of Time,</l>
            <l>And mov'd the mighty leveller to spare</l>
            <l>Models of grace so exquisitely fair.</l>
            <l>While you, whom Painting thus inspir'd to roam,</l>
            <l n="10">Bring these rich stores of ripen'd judgment home;</l>
            <l>While now, attending my accomplish'd friend,</l>
            <l>Science and Taste his soften'd colours blend;</l>
            <l>Let the fond Muse, tho' with a transient view,</l>
            <l>The progress of her sister art pursue;</l>
            <l n="15">
               <pb n="4" facs="6"/>Eager in tracing from remotest time</l>
            <l>The steps of Painting through each favour'd clime,</l>
            <l>To praise her dearest sons, whose daring aim</l>
            <l>Gain'd their bright stations on the heights of fame,</l>
            <l>And mark the paths by which her partial hand</l>
            <l n="20">Conducts her ROMNEY to this radiant band.</l>
            <l>Painting, sweet Nymph! now leaves in lifeless trance</l>
            <l>Exhausted Italy, and tinsel France,</l>
            <l>And sees in Britain, with exulting eyes,</l>
            <l>Her vot'ries prosper, and her glories rise.</l>
            <l n="25">Yet tho', my friend, thy art is thus carest,</l>
            <l>And with the homage of the public blest,</l>
            <l>And flourishes with growing beauty fair,</l>
            <l>The child of Majesty's adoptive care,</l>
            <l>The youthful artist still is doom'd to feel</l>
            <l n="30">Obstruction's chilling hand, that damps his zeal:</l>
            <l>Th' imperious voice of Vanity and Pride</l>
            <l>Bids him from Fancy's region turn aside,</l>
            <l>And quit the magic of her scene, to trace</l>
            <l>The vacant lines of some unmeaning face:</l>
            <l n="35">E'en in this work his wishes still are crost,</l>
            <l>And all the efforts of his art are lost;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="7"/>For when the canvas, with the mirror's truth,</l>
            <l>Reflects the perfect form of age or youth,</l>
            <l>The fond affections of the partial mind</l>
            <l n="40">The eye of judgment with delusion blind:</l>
            <l>Each mother bids him brighter tints employ,</l>
            <l>And give new spirit to her booby boy;</l>
            <l>Nor can the painter, with his utmost art,</l>
            <l>Express the image in the lover's heart:</l>
            <l n="45">Unconscious of the change the seasons bring,</l>
            <l>Autumnal beauty asks the rose of spring,</l>
            <l>And vain self-love, in every age the same,</l>
            <l>Will fondly urge some visionary claim.</l>
            <l>The luckless painter, destin'd to submit,</l>
            <l n="50">Mourns the lost likeness which he once had hit,</l>
            <l>And, doom'd to groundless censure, bears alone</l>
            <l>The grievous load of errors not his own.</l>
            <l>Nor is it Pride, or Folly's vain command,</l>
            <l>That only fetters his creative hand;</l>
            <l n="55">At Fashion's nod he copies as they pass</l>
            <l>Each quaint reflection from her crowded glass.</l>
            <l>The formal coat, with intersecting line,</l>
            <l>Mars the free graces of his fair design;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="6" facs="8"/>The towering cap he marks with like distress,</l>
            <l n="60">And all the motley mass of female dress.</l>
            <l>The hoop extended with enormous size,</l>
            <l>The corks that like a promontory rise;</l>
            <l>The stays of deadly steel, in whose embrace</l>
            <l>The tyrant Fashion tortures injur'd Grace.</l>
            <l n="65">But Art, despairing over shapes like these</l>
            <l>To cast an air of elegance and ease,</l>
            <l>Invokes kind Fancy's aid—she comes to spread</l>
            <l>Her magic spells—the Gothic forms are fled;</l>
            <l>And see, to crown the painter's just desire,</l>
            <l n="70">Her free positions, and her light attire!</l>
            <l>Th' ambitious artist wishes to pursue</l>
            <l>This brilliant plan with more extensive view,</l>
            <l>And with adopted character to give</l>
            <l>A lasting charm to make the portrait live;</l>

                     <hi>MAKE history to life new value lend.</hi>] One of the most elegant writers of the present age, has made an ingenious effort to intro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duce History into the dull province of Portrait-painting, "by repre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>senting a whole family in a single picture, under some interesting his<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>torical subject suitable to their rank and character." See Fitzosborne's Letters, p. 6. But as the beauties and advantages of this plan struck forcibly on the imagination of this amiable Author, the infinite diffi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culties attending its execution were likewise fully open to his discern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment. The success must depend on the choice of subject: where that is not very happily adapted, the picture will probably contain some most ridiculous absurdities—Perhaps the Reader may recollect an unfortu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nate instance or two of this kind.</p>

                     <hi>Not less absurd to flatter Nero's eyes.</hi>] Pliny furnishes us with this singular anecdote, as an instance of the extravagant abuse of Portrait-painting in his days, which, as he informs us, had arrived to a degree of madness. "Nero had ordered himself to be painted under the fi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gure of a Colossus, upon cloth or canvass, a hundred and twenty feet in height." The same author informs us, that this preposterous pic<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture, when it was finished, met with its fate from lightning, which consumed it, and involved likewise the most beautiful part of the gar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dens where it was placed in the conflagration.

                     <hi>Bless be the pencil! which from death can save.</hi>] The sweet illusion of this enchanting art is prettily expressed in a Letter of Raphael's to his friend Francesco Raifolini, a Bolognese painter. The two artists had agreed to exchange their own portraits, and Raphael, on receiving his friend's picture, addresses him in the following words:</p>
                  <p>"Messer Francesco mio caro ricevo in questo punto il vostro ritratto — egli è bellissimo, e tanto vivo, che m' inganno talora, creden<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>domi di essere con esso voi, e sentire le vostre parole."</p>

                  <p>The charm of Portrait-painting is still more beautifully described in verse by a friend of Raphael's, the amiable and accomplished Count Balthasor Castiglione.

                     <hi>Inspir'd by thee, the soft Corinthian Maid.</hi>] Pliny has transmitted to us the History of the Maid of Corinth and her father. "Dibutades, a potter of Sicyon, first formed likenesses in clay at Corinth, but was indebted to his daughter for the invention; the girl being in love with a young man who was soon going from her into some remote country, traced out the lines of his face from his shadow upon the wall by candle-light. Her father, filling up the lines with clay, formed a bust, and hardened it in the fire with the rest of his earthen ware." Plin. Lib. 35.</p>
                  <p>Athenagoras, the Athenian philosopher, gives a similar account of this curious and entertaining anecdote, adding the circumstance that the youth was sleeping when the likeness was taken from his shadow. <gap rend="content:〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉">

                  <p>Besides a general representation of the conflict, the flight of the barbarians, and a distant view of their ships, Theseus, Minerva, and Hercules were, according to this author, exhibited in the piece.

Pausanias speaks of the pictures here alluded to, and in his Tenth Book, introduces a very long description of other pictures by the same artist, painted also from Homer in the Temple at Delphos. The passage however gives but a confused and imperfect idea of the painter's performance. How much the art is indebted to this ancient master, what grace and softness he gave to the human countenance, what embellishments he added to the female figure and dress, are much more happily described by Pliny. Primus Mulieres lucidâ veste pinxit, capita earum mitris versicoloribus operuit, pluri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mumque picturae primus contulit: siquidem instituit os adaperire, dentes ostendere, vultum ab antiquo rigore variare.

                     <hi>Thy tragic pencil, Aristides, caught.</hi>] The city of Thebes had the honour of giving birth to this celebrated Artist. He was the first, according to Pliny, who expressed Character and Passion, the Human Mind, and its several emotions; but he was not remarkable for soft<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness of colouring. "His most celebrated picture was of an infant (on the taking of a town) at the mother's breast, who is wounded and expiring. The sensations of the mother were clearly marked, and her fear least the child, upon failure of the milk, should suck her blood." "Alexander the Great," continues the same author, "took this picture with him to Pella."</p>
                  <p>It is highly probable, according to the conjecture of Junius, (in his learned Treatise de Picturâ Veterum) that the following beautiful epigram of Aemilianus was written on this exquisite picture:

he was, according to Vasari, the best extempore Rimer of his Time.—His History and Works are well known.—The singular cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstance of his dying in the arms of Francis the First, king of France, is mentioned by a French poet of the present age,

And the particulars of his death are thus curiously recorded by Vasari, who speaks in raptures of his various and exalted talents:</p>

La quale unione mai non fu piu in altro tempo che nel suo. E questo aveniva perche restavano vinti dalla cortesia e dall' arte sua, ma più dal genio della sua buona natura.</p>

His capital pictures were executed about the year 1512, according to Vasari; who relates, in a very affect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing manner, the circumstances of his poverty and death.</p>
                  <p>Having taken a journey on foot, in extremely hot weather, he im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prudently drank cold water, which brought on a fever, of which he died at about the age of forty.</p>
                  <p>His colouring was most exquisitely adapted to the delicate softness of female beauty.

                     <hi>And thou, Velasquez, share the honour due.</hi>] Don Diego Velasquez de Silva, the most accomplished of the Spanish Painters, was born at Seville, 1594, and clos'd his honourable and splendid life at Madrid in 1660.—His master was Pacheco, a Spaniard, who united the sister arts of Painting and Poetry.—Velasquez was patronized by the fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mous Olivarez, and had the honour of painting our Charles the First, during his visit at Madrid: perhaps he contributed not a little to form the taste and passion for art, by which that Prince was so eminently distinguished. The Spanish Painter rose to great honours in his own country, and had, like Rubens, the singular fortune to unite the character of an Ambassador with that of an Artist, being sent on an extraordinary commission, in 1648, to Pope Innocent X.</p>
                  <p>One of his most striking historical pictures, was the expulsion of the Moors from Spain; a noble, national subject, which he painted for Philip the Third, in competition with three Artists of reputation, and obtained the preference.</p>
                  <p>But he is particularly celebrated for the spirit and energy of his Por<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>traits; concerning which there are two singular anecdotes related by his Spanish Biographer; and the following may possibly amuse the reader.</p>
                  <p>In 1639, he executed a portrait of Don Adrian Pulido Pareja, Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mander in chief of an armament appointed to New Spain; and pleased himself so well in the execution, that he affixed his name to the picture; a circumstance not usual with him. He had painted with pencils of uncommon length, for the sake of working at a greater distance, and with peculiar force; so that the picture (says my Spanish author) when near, is not to be distinguished, and at a distance is a miracle. As Velasguez,
<pb n="75" facs="77"/>
after this Portrait was finished, was at work in the palace, the King, as usual, went privately to his apartment to see him paint; when observing the figure of Pareja, and taking it for the real person, he exclaimed with surprize, <q>What! are you still here? have you not your dispatches? and why are you not gone?</q> But soon perceiv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing his mistake, he turn'd to Velasquez (who modestly doubted the reality of the deception) and said, "I protest to you it deceived me." For this story, such as it is, I am indebted to the author whom I have quoted in the preceding Note. The celebrated Murillo, whose pictures are much better known in England than those of his master, was a disciple of Velasquez.</p>

He is said to have refused the offer of an establishment in England from Charles the Second, and to have pleaded his age as an excuse for not quitting his own country; where he died, and was buried with great marks of honour, in 1685.</p>

with an apology, in which he speaks of his own talents, and extreme passion for his art, in the most modest and engaging man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner.—His generous desire of doing justice to the merit of others is most happily rewarded in the following Elogy, by the great Thu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>anus:</p>

                  <p>The style introduced by Lodovico is recommended by that excellent judge Sir Joshua Reynolds (See Discourse 1769) as better suited to grave and dignified subjects than the richer brilliancy of Titian.</p>

Those who are enchanted by the sublime con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceptions of the Roman school, are too apt precipitately to condemn every effort of the Dutch pencil as a contemptible performance; while those, who are satisfied with minute and faithful delineations

of nature, find absolute perfection in the very pictures, which are treated by others with the most supercilious neglect.—But sound and impartial judgment seems equally to disclaim this hasty censure, and this inordinate praise;— and ranking the most eminent Dutch artists below the great Italian masters, yet allows them considerable and pe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culiar merit.—A French author says, I think not unhappily, of the Dutch painters, that they are "Dans la peinture, ce que le comique &amp; le plaisant sont dans la poesie."

The history of his life furnishes a most striking incentive to the young painter's ambition.—The many accomplishments which he possest, the infinitude of works which he produced, the reputation and esteem, the various honours and ample f<gap resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">

Though he visited the court of Charles the First in the publick character of an ambassador, it does not appear how long he resided here;—Mr. Walpole conjectures about a year.—His pictures in the ceiling at Whitehall were not painted in England; which perhaps is the reason he has been at the pains of finishing them so neatly, that they will bear the nearest inspection; for he must have well known how greatly the reputation of any work depends on its first happy impression on the publick, and con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cluded his pictures would be viewed by the king and court instantly on their arrival, and that the critics would not be candid enough to delay their remarks on them till they were elevated to their in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tended

On his first visit to England he received no encouragement from the Court, but Charles, becoming soon afterwards acquainted with his merit, sent him an invitation to return. Vandyke embraced the offer with joy; and the king, who shewed him, by frequent sittings, the most flattering marks of esteem, conferred on him the honour of knight<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hood in 1632, rewarding him also with the grant of an annuity of £.200 for life.</p>

This honour however has been brought into question—Germany made a strong, but unsuccessful effort to rob Holland of the glory which she derives from the first invention of Printing: and Painting in oil (it has been said) was known in Italy before the time of John Van Eyck, or John of Bruges, as he is commonly called; to whom that discovery is generally ascribed, about the year 1410.—But Vasari, in his Life of Antonello da Messina, relates very particularly the circumstances
<pb n="80" facs="82"/>
of Van Eyck's invention, and the subsequent introduction of the se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cret into Italy. A most learned antiquarian and entertaining writer of our own time has supposed that Van Eyck might possibly "learn the secret of using oil in England, and take the honour of the inven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion to himself, as we were then a country little known to the world of arts, nor at leisure, from the confusion of the times, to claim the discovery of such a secret."—Walpole's Anecdotes of Painting, Vol. I. p. 29.—The conjecture is not without some little founda<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion;—but the conjectural claims which either Italy or England can produce to this excellent invention, are by no means sufficiently strong to annihilate the glory of the happy and ingenious Fleming.</p>
                  <p>Since the preceding part of this Note was written, the reputa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion both of Van Eyck, and his encomiast Vasari, has been very for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cibly attacked in an Essay on Oil-painting, by Mr. Raspe; an Essay which discovers such a zealous attachment to the arts, and such an active pursuit of knowledge, as do great credit to its ingenious au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thor. But, though I have perused it with the attention it deserves, it does not lead me to retract what I had said; because, after all his researches on this subject, it appears that although Oil-painting was not absolutely the invention of Van Eyck, it was yet indebted to him for those improvements which made it of real value to his profession. —The ingenious Fleming seems therefore to be still entitled to those honours that have been lavished on his name, as improvement in such cases is often more useful and more meritorious than invention itself, which is frequently the effect of chance, while the former arises from well-directed study.</p>

                     <hi>Untrodden paths of Art Salvator tried.</hi>] Salvator Rosa was born at a village near Naples, in 1615. After a youth of poverty and adven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture, he raised himself by his various and uncommon talents into lucrative reputation. Having passed nine years at Florence, in consi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derable employment, he settled in Rome, and died there at the age of 58, in 1673.—He was one of the few characters who have possessed a large portion of pleasant vivacity and satirical humour, with a sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lime imagination. His talents as a painter are universally celebrated; but his social virtues, though perhaps not inferior, are far from being so generally known. In the "Raccolta di Lettere sulla Pittura" there are many of his letters to his intimate friend Ricciardi, an Italian poet, and professor of moral philosophy at Pisa, which perfectly dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>play the warmth of his friendship, and the generosity of his heart.— They contain also some amusing anecdotes relating to his profession, and the great delight which he took in discovering historical subjects of a peculiar cast, untouched by other painters, and appearing to an ignorant eye almost beyond the limits of his art. He seems to des<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cribe himself with justice, as well as energy, in the following words of a letter to Ricciardi "tutto bile, tutto spirito, tutto suoco."— Though he must have been wonderfully pleasant as a companion, and valuable as a friend, yet he laments that his satires had made him many enemies, and heartily wishes he had never produced them: In that which relates to painting, he exposes indeed the vices of his brethren with great freedom and severity.—It is remarkable that his
<pb n="82" facs="84"/>
poetry abounds more with learned allusions than with high flights of imagination; yet in the satire I have mentioned, there is much whim<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sical fancy. An ape is introduced applying to a painter, and begging to learn his profession, as Nature he says has given him a genius for the mimetic arts.—The painter complies—but his disciple, after an apprenticeship of ten years, bids his master adieu, with many humo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous execrations against the art of Painting,—Other parts of the poem contain many sensible and serious remarks on the abuses of the pen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cil; and as the author has given us a portrait of himself in his poe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tical character, I shall present it to the reader as a specimen of his style.</p>

                     <hi>Untaught the moral force of Art to feel.</hi>] An accomplished Critic of our own time has touched on <hi>the moral Efficacy of Picture,</hi> with his usual elegance and erudition. After having illustrated the subject
<pb n="86" facs="88"/>
from the writings of Aristotle and Xenophon, he concludes his re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>marks with the following reflection:—"Yet, considering its vast power in morals, one cannot enough lament the ill destiny of this divine art, which, from the chaste handmaid of Virtue, hath been debauched, in violence of her nature, to a shameless prostitute of Vice, and procuress of Pleasure."—Hurd's Note on the following line of Horace:
<q>Suspendit picta vultum mentemque tabella.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this let me add one observation for the honour of our English artists!—The prostitution of the pencil, so justly lamented by this amiable writer, is perhaps less frequent in this kingdom, than in any country whatever, in which Painting has been known to rise to an equal degree of perfection.</p>

                     <hi>Yet to thy Palace Kneller's skill supplied.</hi>] Sir Godfrey Kneller, born at Lubec 1646, settled in England 1674, was knighted by King Wil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liam, created a Baronet by George the First, and died 1723.—No Pain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter was ever more flattered by the Muses; who gave him credit for talents which he never displayed. Dryden says, in his enchanting Epistle to Kneller:
<q>
                        <l>Thy genius, bounded by the times, like mine,</l>
                        <l>Drudges on petty draughts, nor dares design</l>
                        <l>A more exalted work, and more divine.</l>
                     </q>
But the drudgery of the Poet arose from the most cruel necessity; that of the Painter, from avarice, the bane of excellence in every profession!—If Sir Godfrey had any talents for history, which is sure<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly very doubtful, we have, as Mr. Walpole well observes, no reason to regret that he was confined to portraits, as his pencil has faithfully transmitted to us <hi>"so many ornaments of an illustrious age."</hi>

                     <hi>Teach but thy transient tints no more to fly.</hi>] Although the superior excellencies of this admirable artist make us peculiarly regret the want of durability in his exquisite productions; yet he is far from being the only artist, whose pictures soon discover an appearance of precipitate decay. Fugitive colouring seems indeed to be the chief defect among our present painters in oil; and it must be the most ardent wish of every lover of art, that so great an evil may be effec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tually remedied. As the Royal Academy is a society of enlightened artists, established for the improvement of every branch of Painting, it may be hoped that they will pay attention to this mechanical point, as well as to the nobler acquirements of art, and employ some person, who has patience and abilities for such an office, to discover, by a course of experiments, to what cause this important evil is ow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing. If it be found to arise from the adulteration of colours, oils, and varnishes, might it not be eligible for the Academy to follow the example of another profession, who, where health and life are con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerned, obviate the difficulty of getting their articles genuine from the individual trader, by opening a shop at the expence of the Socie<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty, to prepare and fell the various ingredients, free from those adul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terations which private interest might otherwise produce?</p>
                  <p>But there may be no just ground of complaint against the integrity of the colourman, and this failure may perhaps arise from the artist's
<pb n="89" facs="91"/>
mixing his colours, and their vehicles in improper proportions to each other; that is, instead of painting with oil properly thickened with colour, using oil only fully stained with it, to which a proper consistence (or body as the painters call it) is given by strong gum varnishes; in short, using more vehicle than colour; by which, al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>though most brilliant and transparent effects may be produced, yet the particles of colour are too much attenuated, and divided from each other, and consequently less able to withstand the destructive action of light. If the deficiency complained of originates from this source, the Academy, by a careful course of experiments, may be able clearly to ascertain what preparations of the more delicate colours are most durable; what oils and varnishes will best preserve the ori<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ginal brilliancy of the paint; what are the best proportions for this purpose in which they can be used; and how far glazing (that al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most irresistible temptation to oil-painters) may or may not be de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pended on. All these points are at present so far from being known with certainty, that perhaps there are not two Painters, who think perfectly alike on any one of them. The author hopes, that the gentlemen of the pencil will pardon his presuming to offer a hint on this delicate subject, with which he does not pretend to be intimately acquainted. The ideas, which he has thus ventured to address to them, arise only from the most ardent wish, that future ages may have a just and adequate sense of the flourishing state of Painting in England in the reign of George the Third, and that our present ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cellent artists may not be reduced to depend on the uncertain hand of the engraver for the esteem of posterity.</p>

He did not
<pb n="90" facs="92"/>
mean to touch on those changes in Painting, where the colours all grow darker, the lights become brown, and the shadows one mass of black. This is likewise a great evil, and calls aloud for redress. Perhaps the Critic above mentioned has pointed out the true cause of this defect, <hi>viz.</hi> the indiscriminate blending of the colours, and the not using pure, simple, uncompounded tints.</p>

                     <hi>Now Art exults, with annual Triumphs gay.</hi>] While we are de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lighted with the increasing splendor of these annual entertainments, it is but just to remember, that we are indebted to the Society of Arts and Sciences for our first public exhibition of Paintings. The dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent societies of artists soon followed so excellent an example; and our rapid and various improvements in this lovely art reflect the highest honour on this happy institution. Our exhibitions at once af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ford both the best nursery for the protection of infant genius, and the noblest field for the display of accomplished merit: nor do they only administer to the benefit of the artist, and the pleasure of the publick: they have still a more exalted tendency; and when national subjects are painted with dignity and force, our exhibitions may justly be regarded as schools of public virtue. Perhaps the young soldier can never be more warmly animated to the service of his country, than by gazing, with the delighted public, on a sublime picture of the expiring hero, who died with glory in her defence. But, not to dwell on their power of inspiring martial enthusiasm, our exhibitions may be said to have a happy influence on the manners and morals of those, who fill the different departments of more tranquil life. In support of this sentiment I beg leave to transcribe the following judi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cious remark from an author, who has lately obliged the public with two little volumes of elegant and spirited Essays. "They, whose natural feelings have been properly improved by culture, nor have yet become callous by attrition with the world, know from experi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence, how the heart is mollified, the manners polished, and the tem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>per sweetened, by a well-directed study of the arts of imitation. The same sensibility of artificial excellence, extends itself to the per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ception of natural and moral beauty; and the student returns from the artist's gallery to his station in society, with a breast more dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed to feel and to reverberate the endearments of social life, and of reciprocal benevolence."—KNOX's Essays, moral and literary, 1778, p. 264, on Sculpture.</p>

                     <hi>Thy Talents, Hogarth! &amp;c.</hi>] William Hogarth was born in London, 1698, and put apprentice to an engraver of the most ordinary class; but his comic talents, which are said to have appeared first in the prints to Hudibras, soon raised him to fame and fortune.—He married a daughter of Sir James Thornhill, and died 1764.—The peculiar merits of his pencil are unquestionable. His Analysis of Beauty has been found more open to dispute; but however the greater adepts in the science may differ on its principles, it may certainly be called an honourable monument of his genius and application.</p>

                     <hi>Whose needy Titian calls for ill-paid gold.</hi>] Richardson has fallen into a mistake concerning the famous Danae, and other pictures of Titian, which he says (in quoting a letter of Titian's without con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sidering its address) were painted for Henry the VIIIth of England, a tyrant indeed, voluptuous, and cruel, but still less detestable than the sullen and unnatural Philip the IId of Spain, who filled up the measure of his superior guilt by the horrid assassination of his son. Philip, on his marriage with Mary, assumed the title of King of Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land; and to him Titian addressed the letter, which speaks of the pic<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tures in question: the painter frequently mentions his attachment to his unworthy patron.</p>
                  <p>His sollicitude to ensure his protection and favour is strongly mark<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed in the following short passage of a letter which he addressed to one of Philip's attendants. "Mando ora la poesia di Venere e Adone, nella quale V. S. vedrà, quanto spirito e amore so mettere nell' opere di sua Maestà."—Raccolta, tom. ii. p. 21.</p>
                  <p>How poorly this great artist was rewarded for his ill-directed la<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bour, appears very forcibly in a long letter of complaint, which he had spirit enough to address to the king on the many hardships he suffered in being unable to obtain the payment of the pension which

had been granted to him by the emperor Charles the Vth.—Rac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>colta, tom. ii. p. 379.</p>

                     <hi>Bid English pencils honour English worth.</hi>] The great encouragement given our painters to select subjects from English history, has of late years been very observable. Many individuals of rank and fortune have promoted this laudable plan with spirit and effect; and the So<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciety of Arts and Sciences have confined their premiums to subjects taken from the British Annals.</p>

                     <hi>Her wounded Sidney, Bayard's perfect peer.</hi>] The gallant, the amiable and accomplished Sir Philip Sidney may be justly placed on a level with the noble Bayard, "Le Chevalier sans peur &amp; sans re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proche." whose glory has of late received new lustre from the pen of Robertson and the pencil of West. The striking scene here alluded to, which preceded the death of Sidney, has not yet, I believe, appeared upon canvass, but is forcibly described by the noble and enthusiastic friend of Sidney, the Lord Brooke.—See Biograph. Britan. Art. Sidney.</p>
                  <p>The particulars also are minutely described, and with great feeling, in a letter from his uncle Leicester to Sir Thomas Heneage, quoted in Collins's Memoirs of the Sidnies. The tide of national admiration flowed very strong in favour of Sidney, when Mr. Walpole, in speak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing of Lord Brooke, appeared to check the current; but the merits of Sidney are sufficient to bear down all opposition.—Instead of joining the elegant author I have mentioned, in considering Sir Philip Sidney as "an astonishing object of temporary admiration," I am surprized that so judicious an author should ever question so fair a title to universal regard. The learning and munificence, the courage
<pb n="94" facs="96"/>
and courtesy of Sidney endeared him to every rank, and he justly challenges the lasting affection of his country from the closing scene of his life, in which heroism and humanity are so beautifully blended. I never can think this accomplished character any ways degraded by his having written a tedious romance (in which however there are many touches of exquisite beauty and spirit) to amuse a most amiable sister, whom he tenderly loved; or by his having threatened an unworthy servant of his father's with death in a hasty billet, merely to intimi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>date and deter him from the future commission of an infamous breach of trust, in opening his letters.</p>

                     <hi>Th' heroic Daughter of the virtuous More.</hi>] Margaret, eldest daugh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter of the celebrated Sir Thomas More. The scene which I have proposed for the subject of a picture, is taken from the following pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sage in Ballard:</p>
                  <p>"After Sir Thomas More was beheaded, she took care for the burial of his body in the chapel of St. Peter's ad Vincula, within the precincts of the Tower, and afterwards she procured his corpse to be removed, and buried in the chancel of the church at Chelsea, as Sir Thomas More, in his life-time, had appointed. His head having remained about fourteen days upon London Bridge, and being to be cast into the Thames to make room for others, she bought it. For this she was summoned before the council, as the same author relates, and behaved with the greatest firmness, justify<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing her conduct upon principles of humanity and filial piety. She was, however, imprisoned, but soon released, and dying nine years after her father, at the age of thirty-six, was buried at St. Dunstan's, in Canterbury. The head of her father, which she had preserved with religious veneration, in a box of lead, was, at her particular re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quest, committed with her to the grave. It was seen standing on her coffin in the year 1715, when the vault of the Roper (her husband's) family was opened."—See Ballard's Memoirs of learned Ladies, p. 36.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="97"/>The character of this amiable woman is happily drawn both by Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dison and Walpole.—She married, at the age of twenty, William Roper, Esquire, of Kent, to the infinite satisfaction of her father; for she seems to have been the dearest object of his parental affection, which is very strongly marked in his letters addressed to her. She was indeed most eminently distinguished by her learning, in an age, when the graces of the mind were regarded as an essential article in female education: but the beauty and force of her filial piety reflects a still sperior lustre on this accomplished woman.—There is more than one passage in her life, which would furnish an admirable sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject for the pencil. Her interview with her father, on his return to the Tower, is mentioned as such by Mr. Walpole.</p>

                     <hi>But, oh! how poor the prostrate Satan lies.</hi>] It is remarkable, that the greatest painters have failed in this particular. Raphael, Guido, and West, are all deficient in the figure of Satan. Richardson ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serves, in his description of the pictures of Italy,—"Je n'ai jamais vu d'aucun Maître une representation du Diable, prince des Diables, qui me satisfit." Page 500.</p>
                  <p>In recommending this subject to the pencil, it may be proper to ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serve, that it is not only extremely difficult, but even attended with danger, if we credit the following curious anecdote, in a medical writer of great reputation:—Spinello, fameux Peintre Toscan, ayant peint la chute des anges rebelles, donna des traits si terribles à Lucifer, qu'il en fut lui-meme saisi d'horreur, &amp; tout le reste de sa vie il crut voir continuellement ce Demon lui reprocher de l'avoir representé sous une figure si hidieuse.—Tissot de la Santé des Gens de Lettres.</p>
                  <p>As this story is so singular, it may amuse some readers to see it in the words of Vasari, from whom Tissot seems to have taken it.— The Italian Biographer says, in describing a picture by Spinello Areti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>no,
<pb n="96" facs="98"/>
who flourished in the close of the 14th century, Si vede un Lucifero gia mutato in bestia bruttissima. E si compiacque tanto Spi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nello di farlo orribile, e contraffatto, che si dice (tanto puo alcuna fiata l'immaginazione) che la detta figura da lui dipinta gl'apparue in sogno domandandolo, doue egli l'hauvesse veduta si brutta e per che fattole tale scorno con i suoi pennelli: E che egli svegliatosi dal sonno, per la paura, non potendo gridare, con tremito grandissimo si scosse di maniera che la moglie destatasi lo soccorse: ma niente di manco fu per cio a rischio, stringendogli il cuore, di morirsi per cotale acci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dente, subitamente. Ben che ad ogni modo spiritaticcio, e con occhi tondi, poco tempo vivendo poi si condusse alla morte lasciando di se gran desiderio a gli amici.—Vasari Vita di Spinello Aretino, pag. 218.
