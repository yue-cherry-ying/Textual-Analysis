               <l>The men only wore wigs; but now, with the ladies,</l>
               <l>I've heard that the best of the wig-maker's trade is;</l>
               <l>The red-hair'd turn black, and the grizzle grow flaxen:</l>
               <l>The colour they change as they please of their caxon:</l>
               <l>All ranks now appear in the new-fashion'd rig, there;</l>
               <l>And no female's a beauty, who wears not a wig, there!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then I'll think it no shame to conceal my bald pate, dears!</l>
               <l>With curls that hung over some Blouzalind's great ears;</l>
               <l>Since damsels of fifteen throw off, as they scorn'd 'em,</l>
               <l>The beautiful locks with which Nature adorn'd 'em,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="12" facs="10"/>And frizzled wigs wear, as in public they dash on;</l>
               <l>Pray, why should not old men, too, follow the fashion?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And, since in the valley of years I'm declining,</l>
               <l>At what can't be help'd, in the stead of repining,</l>
               <l>I'll sport each new whimsy; in pantaloons strut too;</l>
               <l>To my throat a huge poultice I'll presently put too:</l>
               <l>Whilst, with two such kind wives, if I've any luck, dears!</l>
               <l>I think, when new wigg'd, I shall be quite a buck, dears!</l>
