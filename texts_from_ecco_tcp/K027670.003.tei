               <p>THIS letter, my dear Lydia, will distress thy good heart, for from the beginning thou wilt perceive no enter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>taining strokes of humour in it—I
<pb n="2" facs="3"/>
cannot be chearful when a thousand melancholy ideas surround me—I have met with a loss of near fifty pounds, which I was taken in for in an extraordinary manner—but what is that loss in comparison of one I may experience?—Friendship is the balm and cordial of life, and without it, 'tis a heavy load not worth sustain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing.—I am unhappy—thy mother and thyself at a distance from me, and what can compensate for such a destitution?—For God's sake persuade her to come and fix in England, for life is too short to waste in separation—and whilst she lives in one country, and I in another, many people will suppose it proceeds from choice—
<pb n="3" facs="4"/>
besides I want thee near me, thou child and darling of my heart!—I am in a melancholy mood, and my Lydia's eyes will smart with weeping when I tell her the cause that now affects me.—I am apprehensive the dear friend I mentioned in my last letter is going into a decline—I was with her two days ago, and I never beheld a being so alter'd—she has a tender frame, and looks like a drooping lily, for the roses are fled from her cheeks—I can never see or talk to this incompara<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble woman without bursting into tears—I have a thousand obligations to her, and I owe her more than her whole sex, if not all the world put
<pb n="4" facs="5"/>
together.—She has a delicacy in her way of thinking that few pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sess—our conversations are of the most interesting nature, and she talks to me of quitting this world with more composure than others think of living in it.—I have wrote an epitaph, of which I send thee a copy.—'Tis expressive of her mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dest worth—but may heav'n re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>store her! and may she live to write mine.</p>

               <p>I Am sincerely affected, my dear Mr. and Mrs. J.—by your friendly enquiry, and the interest you are so good to take in my health. God knows I am not able to give a good account of myself, having passed a bad night in much feverish agitation.—My physician ordered me to bed, and to keep therein 'till some favourable change—I fell ill the moment I got
<pb n="8" facs="9"/>
to my lodgings—he says it is owing to my taking James's Powder, and venturing out on so cold a day as Sun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>day—but he is mistaken, for I am certain whatever bears that name must have efficacy with me—I was bled yesterday, and again to day, and have been almost dead, but this friendly enquiry from Gerrard-street has pour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed balm into what blood I have left—I hope still (and next to the sense of what I owe my friends) it shall be the last pleasurable sensation I will part with—if I continue mending, it will yet be some time before I shall have strength enough to get out in a car<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riage—my first visit will be a visit of true gratitude—I leave my kind

               </opener>
               <p>I Was yesterday taking leave of all the town, with an intention of leav<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing it this day, but I am detained by the kindness of lord and lady S—, who have made a party to dine and sup on my account—I am impatient to set out for my solitude, for there the mind gains strength, and learns to lean upon herself—In the world it seeks or accepts of a few treacherous
<pb n="11" facs="12"/>
supports—the feigned compassion of one—the flattery of a second—the ci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vilities of a third—the friendship of a fourth—they all deceive, and bring the mind back to where mine is re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>treating, to retirement, reflection, and books. My departure is fixed for to-morrow morning, but I could not think of quitting a place where I have received such numberless and unmerited civilities from your lord<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship, without returning my most grate<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful thanks, as well as my hearty ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>knowledgments for your friendly en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quiry from Bath. Illness, my lord, has occasioned my silence—Death knocked at my door, but I would not admit him—the call was both unex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pected
<pb n="12" facs="13"/>
and unpleasant—and I am se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riously worn down to a shadow—and still very weak, but weak as I am, I have as whimsical a story to tell you as ever befel one of my family—Shan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dy's nose, his name, his sash window are fools to it—it will serve at least to amuse you—The injury I did myself last month in catching cold upon James's Powder—fell, you must know, upon the worst part it could—the most painful, and most dangerous of any in the human body. It was on this crisis I called in an able surgeon and with him an able physician (both my friends) to inspect my disaster<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>—'tis a venereal case, cried my two scientific friends—'tis impossible, how<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever,
<pb n="13" facs="14"/>
to be that, replied I—for I have had no commerce whatever with the sex, not even with my wife, added I, these fifteen years.—You are, however, my good friend, said the surgeon, or there is no such case in the world—what the devil, said I, without know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing woman?—We will not reason about it, said the physician, but you must undergo a course of mercury—I will lose my life first, said I—and trust to nature, to time, or at the worst to death—so I put an end, with some in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dignation, to the conference—and de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>termined to bear all the torments I underwent, and ten times more, ra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther than submit to be treated like a <hi>sinner,</hi> in a point where I had acted
<pb n="14" facs="15"/>
like a <hi>saint.</hi>—Now as the father of mischief would have it, who has no pleasure like that of dishonouring the righteous, it so fell out that from the moment I dismissed my doctors, my pains began to rage with a violence not to be expressed, or supported. Every hour became more intolerable.—I was got to bed, cried out, and raved the whole night, and was got up so near dead that my friends in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sisted upon my sending again for my physician and surgeon. I told them upon the word of a man of honour they were both mistaken, as to my case—but though they had reasoned wrong, they might act right; but that sharp as my sufferings were, I
<pb n="15" facs="16"/>
felt them not so sharp as the imputa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion which a venereal treatment of my case laid me under—They an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swered that these taints of the blood laid dormant twenty years, but they would not reason with me in a point wherein I was so delicate, but would do all the office for which they were called in, namely to put an end to my torment, which otherwise would put an end to me—and so have I been compelled to surrender myself—and thus, my dear lord, has your poor friend with all his sensibilities been suffering the chastisement of the gross<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>est sensualist.—Was it not as ridicu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lous an embarrassment as ever Yo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rick's spirit was involved in?—No<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing
<pb n="16" facs="17"/>
but the purest conscience of innocence could have tempted me to write this story to my wife, which by the bye would make no bad anecdote in Tristram Shandy's Life—I have mentioned it in my journal to Mrs. — In some repects there is no dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ference between my wife and herself—when they fare alike, neither can reasonably complain.—I have just received letters from France, with some hints that Mrs. Sterne and my Lydia are coming to England, to pay me a visit—if your time is not better employed, Yorick flat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters himself he shall receive a let<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter from your lordship, <hi>en attend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ant.</hi>

               <p>IT would be an insult on your hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manity (or perhaps look like it,) to apologize for the liberty I am taking.—I am one of those people whom the vulgar and illiberal call negroes.—The first part of my life was rather unlucky, as I was placed in a family who judged ignorance the best and
<pb n="23" facs="24"/>
only security for obedience.—A little reading and writing I got by unwea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ried application.—The latter part of my life has been, thro' God's blessing, truly fortunate—having spent it in the service of one of the best and greatest families in the kingdom—my chief pleasure has been books—Philan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thropy I adore—How very much, good Sir, am I (amongst millions) in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>debted to you for the character of your amiable Uncle Toby!—I declare I would walk ten miles in the dog<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>days, to shake hands with the honest Corporal.—Your sermons have touch'd me to the heart, and I hope have amended it, which brings me to the point—In your tenth discourse, page
<pb n="24" facs="25"/>
seventy-eight, in the second volume—is this very affecting passage—<q rend="inline">"Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sider how great a part of our species in all ages down to this—have been trod under the feet of cruel and capri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cious tyrants, who would neither hear their cries, nor pity their distresses.—Consider slavery—what it is—how bitter a draught—and how many mil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lions are made to drink of it."</q>—Of all my favourite authors not one has drawn a tear in favour of my misera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble black brethren—excepting your<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self, and the humane author of Sir Geo. Ellison.—I think you will for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>give me; I am sure you will applaud me for beseeching you to give one

half hour's attention to slavery, as it is at this day practised in our West In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dies.—That subject handled in your striking manner would ease the yoke (perhaps) of many—but if only of one—gracious God! what a feast to a benevolent heart! and sure I am, you are an epicurean in acts of cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity.—You who are universally read, and as universally admired—you could not fail.—Dear Sir, think in me you behold the uplifted hands of thousands of my brother Moors.

               <p>THERE is a strange coinci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dence, Sancho, in the little events (as well as in the great ones) of this world: for I had been writing a ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der tale of the sorrows of a friendless poor negro-girl, and my eyes had scarce done smarting with it, when your letter of recommendation, in be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>half of so many of her brethren and sisters, came to me—but why <hi>her bre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thren?</hi> or yours, Sancho! any more
<pb n="28" facs="29"/>
than mine? It is by the finest tints, and most insensible gradations, that nature descends from the fairest face about St. James's, to the sootiest com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plexion in Africa:—at which tint of these is it, that the ties of blood are to cease? and how many shades must we descend lower still in the scale, ere mercy is to vanish with them? But 'tis no uncommon thing, my good Sancho, for one half of the world to use the other half of it like brutes, and then endeavour to make 'em so.—For my own part, I never look <hi>west<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward,</hi> (when I am in a pensive mood at least) but I think of the burthens which our brothers and sisters are <hi>there</hi> carrying, and could I ease their
<pb n="29" facs="30"/>
shoulders from one ounce of them, I declare I would set out this hour upon a pilgrimage to Mecca for their sakes—which by the bye, Sancho, exceeds your walk of ten miles in about the same proportion, that a visit of hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manity should one of mere form.—However, if you meant my Uncle Toby more he is your debtor.—If I can weave the tale I have wrote into the work I am about—'tis at the ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vice of the afflicted—and a much greater matter; for in serious truth, it casts a sad shade upon the world, that so great a part of it are, and have been so long bound in chains of dark<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, and in chains of misery; and I cannot but both respect and felicitate
<pb n="30" facs="31"/>
you, that by so much laudable dili<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gence you have broke the one—and that by falling into the hands of so good and merciful a family, Provi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dence has rescued you from the other.</p>

               <p>BE so kind as to forward what letters are arrived for Mrs. S. at your office by to-day's post, or the next, and she will receive them before she quits Avignon, for England—she wants to lay out a little money in an annuity for her daughter—advise her
<pb n="64" facs="65"/>
to get her own life ensured in Lon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>don, lest my Lydia should die be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore her.—If there are any packets, send them with the ninth volume of Shandy, which she has failed of get<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ting—she says she has drawn for fifty louis—when she leaves Paris, send by her my account.—Have you got me any French subscriptions, or subscriptions in France?—Present my kindest service to Miss P. I know her politeness and good nature will incline her to give Mrs. J. her ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vice about what she may ven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture to bring over.—I hope every thing goes on well, though never half so well as I wish.—

               <p>MY dear friends Mr. and Mrs. J— are infinitely kind to me in sending now and then a letter to en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quire after me—and to acquaint me how they are.—You cannot conceive, my dear lady, how truly I bear a part in your illness.—I wish Mr. J— would carry you to the south of France in pursuit of health—but why need I wish it when I know his affection will make him do that and ten times
<pb n="67" facs="68"/>
as much to prevent a return of those symptoms which alarmed him so much in the spring—Your politeness and humanity is always contriving to treat me agreeably, and what you pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mise next winter, will be perfectly so—but you must get well—and your little dear girl must be of the party with her parents and friends to give it a relish—I am sure you shew no partiality but what is natural and praise-worthy in behalf of your daugh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter, but I wonder my friends will not find her a play-fellow, and I both hope and advise them not to venture along through this warfare of life without two strings at least to their bow.—I had letters from France by
<pb n="68" facs="69"/>
last night's post, by which (by some fatality) I find not one of my letters has reached Mrs. S— This gives me concern, as it wears the aspect of un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kindness, which she by no means me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rits from me.—My wife and dear girl are coming to pay me a visit for a few months; I wish I may prevail with them to tarry longer.—You must permit me, dear Mrs. J. to make my Lydia known to you, if I can prevail with my wife to come and spend a little time in London, as she returns to France.—I expect a small parcel—may I trouble you before you write next to send to my lodgings to ask if there is any thing directed to me that you can enclose under cover?—I have
<pb n="69" facs="70"/>
but one excuse for this freedom which I am prompted to use from a persua<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion that it is doing you pleasure to give you an opportunity of doing an obliging thing—and as to myself I rest satisfied, for 'tis only scoring up another debt of thanks to the millions I owe you both already—Receive a thousand and a thousand thanks, yes and with them ten thousand friendly wishes for all you wish in this world—May my friend Mr. J. continue bless'd with good health, and may his good lady get perfectly well, there being no woman's health or comfort I so ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dently pray for.—Adieu my dear friends—believe me most truly and faithfully yours,</p>

In Eliza's last letter dated from St. Jago she tells me, as she does you, that she is extremely ill—God protect her.—By this time surely she has set foot upon dry land at Madras—I heartily wish her well, and if Yorick was with her, he would tell her so—but he is cut off from this, by bo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dily absence—I am present with her in spirit however—but what is that you will say?</p>

notification of her intentions, which has a pitiful air on my side, though I have wrote her six or seven.—I ima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gine she will be here the latter end of September, though I have no date for it, but her impatience, which having suffered by my supposed silence I am persuaded will make her fear the worst—if that is the case she will fly to England—a most natural conclu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion.—You did well to discontinue all commerce with James's powder—as you are so well, rejoice therefore, and let your heart be merry—mine ought upon the same score—for I never have been so well since I left college—and should be a marvellous happy man, but for some reflections which bow
<pb n="73" facs="74"/>
down my spirits—but if I live but even three or four years, I will ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quit myself with honour—and—no matter! we will talk this over when we meet.—If all ends as tempe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rately as with you, and that I find grace, &amp;c. &amp;c.

               <p>I But copy your great civility to me in writing you word, that I have this moment received another letter wrote eighteen days after the date of the last from St. Jago—If our poor friend could have wrote another letter to Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land, you would in course have had it—but I fear from the circumstance of great hurry and bodily disorder in
<pb n="77" facs="78"/>
which she was, when she dispatched this, she might not have time.—In case it has so fallen out, I send you the contents of what I have received—and that is a melancholy history of herself and sufferings, since they left St. Jago—continual and most violent rheumatism all the time—a fever brought on with fits, and attended with delirium, and every terrifying symptom—the recovery from this left her low and emaciated to a skeleton.—I give you the pain of this detail with a bleeding heart, knowing how much at the same time it will affect yours.—The three or four last days of her journal leave us with hopes she will do well at last, for she is
<pb n="78" facs="79"/>
more chearful—and seems to be get<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ting into better spirits; and health will follow in course. They have crossed the line—are much becalmed, which with other delays she fears they will lose their passage to Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>drass—and be some months sooner for it at Bombay.—Heav'n protect her, for she suffers much, and with uncommon fortitude.—She writes much to me about her dear friend Mrs. J— in her last packet.—In truth, my good lady, she loves and honours you from her heart, but if she did not, I should not esteem her, or wish her so well as I do.—Adieu, my dear friends—you have

               <p>I Am truly surprised, my dear Ly<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dia, that my last letter has not reached thy mother, and thyself—it looks most unkind on my part, after your having wrote me word of your mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther's intention of coming to England, that she has not received my letter to welcome you both—and though in that I said I wished you would defer your journey 'till March, for before
<pb n="82" facs="83"/>
that time I should have published my sentimental work, and should be in town to receive you—yet I will shew you more real politesses than any you have met with in France, as mine will come warm from the heart.—I am sorry you are not here at the races, but <hi>les fêtes champêtres</hi> of the Marquis de Sade have made you amends.—I know B— very well, and he is what in France would be called admirable—that would be but so so here—You are right—he studies nature more than any, or rather most of the French comedians—If the Em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>press of Russia pays him and his wife a pension of twenty thousand livres a year, I think he is very well off.—
<pb n="83" facs="84"/>
The folly of staying 'till after twelve for supper—that you two excommu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nicated beings might have meat!—<q rend="inline">"his conscience would not let it be served before."</q>—Surely the Marquis thought you both, being English, could not be satisfied without it.—I would have given not my gown and cassock (for I have but one) but my topaz ring to have seen the <hi>petits maitres et maitresses</hi> go to mass, after having spent the night in dancing.—As to my pleasures they are few in compass.—My poor cat sits purring beside me—your lively French dog shall have his place on the other side of my fire—but if he is as devilish as when I last saw him, I must tutor
<pb n="84" facs="85"/>
him, for I will not have my cat abused—in short I will have nothing devilish about me—a combustion would spoil a sentimental thought.</p>
               <p>Another thing I must desire—do not be alarmed—'tis to throw all your rouge pots into the Sorgue be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore you set out—I will have no rouge put on in England—and do not be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wail them as — — did her silver seringue or glyster equipage which she lost in a certain river—but take a wise resolution of doing with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out rouge.—I have been three days ago bad again—with a spitting of blood—and that unfeeling brute ******* came and drew my cur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tains,

and with a voice like a trumpet, halloo'd in my ear—z—ds, what a fine kettle of fish have you brought yourself to, Mr. S—! In a faint voice, I bad him leave me, for com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fort sure was never administered in so rough a manner.—Tell your mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther I hope she will purchase what ei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther of you may want at Paris—'tis an occasion not to be lost—so write to me from Paris that I may come and meet you in my post-chaise with my long-tailed horses—and the moment you have both put your feet in it, call it hereafter yours.—Adieu dear Lydia—believe me, what I ever shall be,</p>

wrote the most whimsical letter to a lady that was ever read, and talk'd of body and soul too—I said she had made me vain, by saying she was mine more than ever woman was—but she is not the lady of Bond<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>street nor — square, nor the lady who supp'd with me in Bond<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>street on scollop'd oysters, and other such things—nor did she ever go <hi>tete-a-tete</hi> with me to Salt Hill.—Enough of such nonsense—The past is over—and I can justify myself un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to myself—can you do as much?—No faith!—<q rend="inline">"You can feel!"</q> Aye so can my cat, when he hears a fe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>male caterwauling on the house top—but caterwauling disgusts me.

I never think of, but with ideas of sensibility and obligation, that I have refrain'd.—Good God! to think I could be in town, and not go the first step I made to Gerrard Street!—My mind and body must be at sad variance with each other, should it ever fall out that it is not both the first and last place also where I shall betake myself, were it only to say, "God bless you."—May you have every blessing he can send you! 'tis a part of my litany, where you will always have a place whilst I have a tongue to repeat it.—And so you heard I had left Scarborough, which you would no more credit, than the reasons assign'd for it—I thank you
<pb n="99" facs="100"/>
for it kindly—tho' you have not told me what they were, being a shrewd divine, I think I can guess.—I was ten days at Scarborough in September, and was hospitably entertained by one of the best of our Bishops; who, as he kept house there, press'd me to be with him—and his houshold consisted of a gentleman, and two ladies—which, with the good Bishop, and my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self, made so good a party that we kept much to ourselves.—I made in this time a connection of great friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship with my mitred host, who would gladly have taken me with him back to Ireland.—However we all left Scarborough together, and lay fifteen miles off, where we kindly parted
<pb n="100" facs="101"/>
—Now it was supposed (and have since heard) that I e'en went on with the party to London, and this I suppose was the reason assign'd for my being there.—I dare say charity would add a little to the account, and give out that 'twas on the score of one, and perhaps both of the ladies—and I will excuse charity on that head, for a heart disengaged could not well have done better.—I have been hard writing ever since—and hope by Christmas I shall be able to give a gentle rap at your door—and tell you how happy I am to see my two good friends.—I assure you I spur on my Pegasus more violently upon that account, and am now de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>termined

quite stuck fast in the entrance upon his third general <hi>division,</hi> and finding himself unable to get either for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards or backwards with any grace—<q rend="inline">"Curse it," says he, (thereby ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>communicating every mother's son who should think differently) "why may not a man lawfully call in for help in this, as well as any other human emergency?"</q>—So without any more argumentation, except starting up and nimming down from the top shelf but one, the second volume of CLARK—tho' without any felonious intention in so doing, he had begun to clap me in (making a joint first) five whole pages, nine round para<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>graphs, and a dozen and a half of
<pb n="172" facs="172"/>
good thoughts all of a row; and be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause there was a confounded high gallery—was transcribing it away like a little devil.—Now—quoth HOMENAS to himself <q rend="inline">"tho' I hold all this to be fair and square, yet, if I am found out, there will be the deuce and all to pay."</q>—<hi>Why are the bells ringing backwards, you lad? what</hi> is <hi>all that crowd about, honest man?</hi> HOMENAS <hi>was got upon Doctor</hi> CLARK's <hi>back, sir—and what of that, my lad? Why an please you, he has broke his neck, and fractured his skull, and befouled himself into the bargain, by a fall from the pulpit two stories high.</hi> Alas! poor HOMENAS! HO<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>MENAS has done his business!—HO<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>MENAS
<pb n="173" facs="173"/>
will never preach more while breath is in his body.—No, faith, I shall never again be able to tickle it off as I have done. I may sit up whole winter nights baking my blood with hectic watchings, and write as solid as a FATHER of the church—or, I may sit down whole summer days evaporating my spirits into the finest thoughts, and write as florid as a MOTHER of it.—In a word, I may compose myself off my legs, and preach till I burst—and when I have done, it will be worse than if not done at all.—<hi>Pray Mr. Such-a-one, who held forth last Sunday? Doctor</hi> CLARK, <hi>I trow; says one. Pray what Doctor</hi> CLARK <hi>says a se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cond?</hi>

                  <hi>Why</hi> HOMENAS's <hi>Doctor</hi> CLARK, <hi>quoth a third.</hi> O rare HOMENAS! cries a fourth; your <hi>servant</hi> Mr. HO<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>MENAS, quoth a <hi>fifth.</hi>—'Twill be all over with me, by Heav'n—I may as well put the book from whence I took it.—Here HOMENAS burst into a flood of tears, which falling down helter skelter, ding dong without any kind of intermission for six minutes and almost twenty five seconds, had a marvellous effect upon his discourse; for the aforesaid tears, do you mind, did so temper the wind that was rising upon the aforesaid discourse, but falling for the most part perpendicu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larly, and hitting the spirits at right angles, which were mounting hori<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>zontally
<pb n="175" facs="175"/>
all over the surface of his harangue, they not only play'd the devil and all with the sublimity—but moreover the said tears, by their ni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trous quality, did so refrigerate, pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cipitate, and hurry down to the bot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tom of his soul, all the unsavory par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticles which lay fermenting (as you saw) in the middle of his conception, that he went on in the coolest and chastest stile (for a <hi>soliloquy</hi> I think) that ever mortal man uttered.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"This is really and truly a very hard case, continued HOMENAS to himself"</q>—PANURGE, by the bye, and all the company in the next room hearing all along every syllable he
<pb n="176" facs="176"/>
spoke; for you must know, that not<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>withstanding PANURGE had open'd his mouth as wide as he could for his blood, in order to give a round answer to LONGINUS RABELAICUS's interrogation, which concluded the last chapter—yet HOMENAS's rhe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>toric had pour'd in so like a torrent, slap-dash thro' the wainscot amongst them, and happening at that <hi>uncritical</hi> crisis, when PANURGE had just put his ugly face into the above-said posture of defence—that he stopt short—he did indeed, and tho' his head was full of matter, and he had screw'd up every nerve and muscle belonging to it, till all cryed <hi>crack</hi> again, in order to give a due
<pb n="177" facs="177"/>
projectile force to what he was go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to let fly, full in LONGINUS RA<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>BELAICUS's teeth who sat over against him.—Yet for all that, he had the continence to contain himself, for he stopt short, I say, without uttering one word except, Z....ds—many rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sons may be assign'd for this, but the most true, the most strong, the most hydrostatical, and the most philosophical reason, why PANURGE did not go on, was—that the fore<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mention'd <hi>torrent</hi> did so <hi>drown</hi> his voice, that he had none left to go on with.—God help him, poor fellow! so he stopt short, (as I have told you before) and all the time HOMENAS was speaking he said not another
<pb n="178" facs="178"/>
word, good or bad, but stood gap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, and staring, like what you please—so that the break, mark'd thus—which HOMENAS's grief had made in the middle of his discourse, which he could no more help than he could fly—produced no other change in the room where LONGINUS RABELAI<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>CUS, EPISTEMON, GYMNAST, TRI<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>BOULET, and nine or ten more honest blades had got Kerukopaedizing to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gether, but that it gave time to GYMNAST to give PANURGE a good squashing chuck under his double chin; which PANURGE taking in good part, and just as it was meant by GYMNAST, he forthwith shut his mouth—and gently sitting down upon
<pb n="179" facs="179"/>
a stool though somewhat excentrically and out of neighbours row, but listen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, as all the rest did, with might and main, they plainly and distinctly heard every syllable of what you will find recorded in the very next chapter.</p>
