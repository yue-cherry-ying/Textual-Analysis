            <p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . <q>As I have lately heard that it is now dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>puted, whether or not</q> you <q>ought to be excluded from the benefit of the late <hi>Nullum tempus act for quieting the possessions of the subject,</hi> I have taken the liberty to inclose, for your — perusal, a short tract on the general doctrine of <hi>Nullum tempus. occurrit regi.</hi> How far the same may be applicable to the point in contest between</q> you <q>and the trea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sury-board,
<pb n="iv" facs="3"/>
I cannot pretend to judge, because my information concerning that affair arises merely from common report, so that, of course, I must pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fess myself a stranger to the particular circumstances of the case. Neverthe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>less, as I happened, in the course of my reading the other day, to light up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on a passage in Bracton, which, to me, seemed capable of affording a clear explanation of the <hi>Nullum tempus doc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trine,</hi> I thought it a duty incumbent on me, to send</q> you <q>my thoughts upon it. It may indeed be said that Bracton is in the hands of every law<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>yer, and that I ought to have known that the learned gentlemen of the law, employed by</q> you, <q>are already ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prized of the passage to which I refer, as they must certainly, at some time or other, have read it; nevertheless, there is sufficient reason for me to <hi>pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sume</hi>
                  <pb n="v" facs="4"/>
that they have entirely <hi>overlooked or forgot it in the present case;</hi> and that even the whole legislature have also either forgot it, or else are entirely ig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>norant of it, because the late act of parliament (which was made expressly to guard against the <hi>mistaken doctrine of Nullum tempus</hi>) must otherwise <hi>ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pear absurd and superfluous.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I think it necessary to presume thus much, —, by way of excuse for having presumed to write to</q> you <q>about business which does not in the least concern me, as it might otherwise be deemed impertinent in me, to sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose that</q> you <q>have not already the most learned advice that can be procu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>red. If the little tract contains any hints that are thought capable of being enforced to your — advantage, it will give me real pleasure; for indeed I have no greater happiness than that of being

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN an author pretends to write a treatise on any particular subject, he ought to have leisure sufficient to examine and thoroughly consider every thing that has an intimate connex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ion with it; but, as the Writer of this has no such leisure, it is ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessary for him to declare that he professes no other knowledge of the subject, in question, than what has occurred to him occa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sionally in consulting the law-books on other points; and, there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore,
<pb n="viii" facs="7"/>
he offers this little Tract to his readers, not as a complete and regular system, but rather as a ground-work for future enqui<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ries upon the subject, by Writers who are blessed with more leisure and abilities for such researches than himself; and who may, perhaps, be hereby induced either to build upon the same founda<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, or to establish a better in its room.</p>

         <head>A SHORT TRACT CONCERNING THE Doctrine of <q>Nullum Tempus occurrit Regi,</q>

            <head>PART I.</head>
            <p>THE doctrine of <q>Nullum Tempus occurrit Regi,</q> if admitted in an unlimited and general sense, is capable of being wrested to the most arbitrary purposes, and may seem to au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thorize the most dangerous and oppres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sive pretensions and claims on the pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perty of the subject.</p>
            <p>As <hi>a general doctrine,</hi> therefore, it is <hi>unreasonable;</hi> and, consequently, incon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sistent with the fundamental principles
<pb n="2" facs="9"/>
of the <hi>common law;</hi> for which reason I never could esteem the <hi>Nullum Tempus</hi> doctrine as <hi>a maxim</hi> of the common law; and I have since found that my opinion of it was in some degree right, and that the doctrine is so far from being <hi>a general maxim,</hi> that it ought never to be menti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>oned without its peculiar <hi>exceptions,</hi> lest it should do injury, by being applied to improper cases, and be mistaken for <hi>a maxim,</hi> to the perversion of justice: for the true and proper <hi>maxims</hi> of the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon law demand the utmost deference when they are cited, their authority be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing unquestionable; because <q>Contra negantem principia <hi>(vel maxima)</hi> non est disputandum.</q> (Co. Lit. 343. Doc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tor &amp; Student, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> c. 8. p. 27.)</p>
            <p>This maxim may indeed seem appli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cable to myself, for denying that the authority and weight of <hi>a maxim</hi> is due to the doctrine of <hi>Nullum Tempus, &amp;c.</hi> But I hope to be able, in the course of
<pb n="3" facs="10"/>
this work, to obviate any such imputa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, and to prove <hi>that it really is not a general maxim.</hi> In order to set this point in a clear light, it will be necessary first of all to take a short view of those par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticular <hi>rights of the crown,</hi> which, <hi>in law,</hi> are justly esteemed <hi>unalienable,</hi> and which I apprehend to be as follows.</p>
            <p>The king is invested, by his office, with a kind of <hi>limited property</hi> in the per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sons of all his <hi>free subjects,</hi> by which he is enabled, and, indeed, bound in duty to claim, and <hi>free</hi> them whenever their persons are unlawfully seized, imprison<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, or otherwise detained at home or a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>broad, under pretence of right of ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vice, whereby their <hi>persons</hi> are claimed as <hi>private property,</hi> acquired by purchase, custom, or any other mode of acquisi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion <note place="bottom" n="*">Query. How far may this hold good since the ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>king of the Habeas Corpus act, which supposes that a man may be transported against his will if he has sign<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed a written contract? Sect. 13. This section, howe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver, gives no authority for such a forcible transporta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion; it only informs us, that the act does NOT <hi>"extend to give benefit" in such case;</hi> but the common law, we may presume, will or ought to <hi>"give benefit"</hi> in this, as in every other case, of <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>wrong,</hi> because <hi>"Lex semper dabit remedium:"</hi> and I have al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ready shewn that the right of the Crown is <hi>unalienable</hi> in this kind <hi>of property,</hi> for the maintainance of <hi>freedom.</hi>
               </note> whatsoever. For no claims of this
<pb n="4" facs="11"/>
kind, upon a <hi>freeman,</hi> are to be favour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed in law, or can possibly be accounted valid, because the maxim assures us that <hi>"Liber homo"</hi> is <hi>"res quasi sacra," "which may not be sold:"</hi> 
               <note place="bottom" n="†">
                  <q>Item quasi res sacra ut <hi>liber homo</hi> qui vendi non potest, cùm <hi>libertas</hi> non recipiat aestimationem,</q> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bracton, lib. 2, p. 14.</note> so that there can be no just claim of property <hi>in the person of a freeman,</hi> except the <hi>official right</hi> and <hi>claim of property</hi> vested in the king; and, as this is <hi>limited</hi> by the laws for the benefit and <hi>freedom of the subject,</hi> it is, for that very reason, <hi>unalienable from the crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="12"/>Other <hi>unalienable rights of the Crown</hi> are those which form the public revenue, and belong to the king's exchequer, all which are included by this author in the term <hi>"Res fiscalis,"</hi> 
               <note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <q>Et est res quasi sacra, <hi>Res fiscalis,</hi> quae dari non potest, nec vendi, nec ad alium transferri a principe vel a rege regnante—</q>
               </note> and which he also esteems <hi>"res quasi sacra."</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="‡">To this rule, about <hi>Res fiscalis,</hi> there are some ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessary exceptions which will hereafter be mentioned.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There are also several other rights, which are inherent in the Crown, <hi>for the public good,</hi> and cannot therefore be dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed of, or alienated, viz. such as <hi>Peace, Justice,</hi> &amp;c. — <q>et quae faciunt ipsam coronam, et communem utilitatem re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spiciunt, sicut est <hi>Pax</hi> et <hi>Justitia,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To all such things we may safely apply the doctrine of <q>Nullum tempus occurrit regi.</q>— The same is likewise applica<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble to a few other things, even of an inferior or second class; I mean such as
<pb n="6" facs="13"/>
are nevertheless so far <hi>alienable,</hi> that they may lawfully, without damage to the king or his subjects, be transferred, <hi>for a time,</hi> to other persons. — <q>Sunt et aliae res quae pertinent ad coronam propter privile<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gium regis, et ita communem non re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spiciunt utilitatem, quin dari possunt et ad alium transferri, quia, si transfe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rantur, translatio nulli erit damnosa, nec ipsi regi sive principi, &amp;c.</q>—The things, ranked in this class of <hi>Royal Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perty,</hi> are, <hi>sea-wrecks, treasures found, great fish,</hi> as <hi>whales, sturgeons,</hi> and other <hi>royal fish.</hi> And whosoever pretends to have a right to enjoy the profits arising from these particular things, must be a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble to produce a special <hi>warrant</hi> for that purpose; because <hi>prescription,</hi> even of a very long time, is not sufficient to justify the pretension: <q>Diuturnitas enim tem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poris, <hi>in hoc casu,</hi> injuriam <hi>non minuit, sed auget, nec in primo casu,</hi> NEC IN ISTO, CURRIT TEMPUS CONTRA REGEM,
<pb n="7" facs="14"/>
nec incumbit ei probatio quia ad ip<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sum pertineant, cum constare debeat singulis, quod hujusmodi de jure gen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tium pertineant ad coronam.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, with respect to things of a third class, as <hi>crown-manors, lands, tenements,</hi> &amp;c. the case is widely different, for the doctrine of <hi>Nullum tempus,</hi> &amp;c. affects them not at all! And I am astonished that so many gentlemen, learned in the law, whose attention has lately been em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ployed upon this point, should have thought it necessary to provide, by a spe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cial act of parliament, against this doc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trine, when <hi>the common law of England,</hi> that ought always to be preferred, <note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <q>When common law and statute law concur, the common law shall be preferred.</q> 4. Co. 71.</note> has already sufficiently guarded us against the tyrannical construction of the phrase, which, like a mere bug-bear, is formi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dable only whilst misunderstood, though it has raised an epidemical panic, of which
<pb n="8" facs="15"/>
the late act is a proof. — <q>Sunt etiam <hi>aliae res</hi> quae pertinent ad coronam, quae <hi>non sunt ita sacrae,</hi> quin transfer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ri possunt, sicut sunt, FUNDI, TERRAE, <hi>et</hi> TENEMENTA, <hi>et</hi> HUJUSMODI per quos corona regis roboratur, et in qui<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bus CURRIT TEMPUS CONTRA RE<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>GEM, <hi>sicut contra quamlibet privatam personam.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we are assured, by the authority of an ancient and unexceptionable writer, that <hi>crown-lands</hi> are exactly upon <hi>the same footing</hi> as <hi>private freeholds,</hi> with respect to <hi>time</hi> or <hi>prescription,</hi> which is the ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry reverse of the <hi>Nullum tempus</hi> doctrine, lately adopted by the Treasury.</p>
            <p>Now, it is a maxim in law, that a quiet and uninterrupted <hi>possession</hi> for sixty years creates a proper title. <q>Possessio pacifica <hi>POUR ANNS 60</hi> facit jus.</q> (Prin. Leg. et Aeq. p. 81. See also Jenk. cent. 26.) And, therefore, as we have be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore shewn, that <hi>Crown manors, lands,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="16"/>
and <hi>tenements,</hi> are exactly upon the same footing with respect to <hi>time</hi> or prescription <hi>as private freeholds,</hi> we must necessa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rily conclude that the king entirely loses his title to alienated lands, if there are better proofs of such a <hi>peaceable possession,</hi> on the one side, than of <hi>a continued claim</hi> on the other; in which case the lands must become wholly and entirely the property of the possessor. And, even when <hi>alien<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ated crown lands</hi> are claimed within any shorter term than sixty years, the king <hi>may not seize,</hi> for it is a maxim, <q>That the <hi>king can disseize no man,</hi> nor be disseized;</q> (Doctor &amp; Student);<note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <q>Item pro maximo habetur in legibus Angliae, quod <hi>nullus potest dominum regem disseisire,</hi> NEC DOMI<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>NUS REX ALIQUEM DISSEISIRE POTERIT, ita quod liberum tenementum per talem disseisinam transfere<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tur de rege ad alium, NEC E CONTRA.</q> Chap. 8.</note> and, even though the king <hi>cannot be disseized,</hi> yet this is not to be construed so as to annul that interest, which private persons acquire, <hi>by time,</hi> in the possession of alie<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nated
<pb n="10" facs="17"/>
lands, for that is sufficiently esta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blished by an act of 1 Edw. III. c. 12. which ordains, with respect to <q>lands and tenements holden of the king in chief, and <hi>ALIENED WITHOUT LICENCE</hi>
               </q>— that the <q>king shall <hi>NOT HOLD THEM AS FORFEIT</hi> in such case, but</q>—<q>there shall be a reasonable fine taken in Chancery by <hi>DUE PROCESS.</hi>
               </q> Here is no limited time for possession, so that the act is as ef<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficacious for those who have been <hi>in pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>session only</hi> 3 <hi>years,</hi> as for those who have held 20 <hi>times</hi> 3 <hi>years</hi> as above. See also 9 Edw. III. c. 2. 21 Jac. c. 25. 8. Hen. VI. c. 9. § 7. and 31 Eliz. c. 11.</p>
            <p>By the two last mentioned acts a peace<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able and quiet possession <hi>for</hi> 3 <hi>years</hi> creates a right that will justify "<hi>keeping possession</hi> WITH FORCE:" but as the king is not ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pressly named, I conceive that so short a time doth not bar his title to any <hi>reason<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able fines,</hi> not prohibited by 12 Char. II.
<pb n="11" facs="18"/>
c. 24.<note place="bottom" n="*">See sect. 1, 5, and 6, particularly the latter.— <q>Provided always and be it enacted, that any thing herein contained shall not take away, nor be con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>strued to take away, <hi>any fines for alienation,</hi> due by particular customs of particular manors and places, <hi>other</hi> than fines for alienations of lands or tenements holden immediately of the king in <hi>capite.</hi>
                  </q>
               </note> because it is a maxim that <q>the king is not bound by statute law, unless expressly named.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What hath hitherto been advanced, I hope, will be thought sufficient to esta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blish the <hi>absolute property</hi> of <hi>all persons,</hi> who shall be able to prove <hi>a peaceable pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>session of alienated crown-lands, unclaimed for</hi> 60 <hi>years,</hi> and also that those persons who have held <hi>alienated crown-lands for more than</hi> three <hi>years unclaimed,</hi> have a right <hi>to continue in possession,</hi> on paying a <hi>reason<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able fine;</hi> and consequently that <hi>the doc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trine of Nullum tempus,</hi> &amp;c. is by no means <hi>effectual</hi> for the recovery of <hi>ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nors, lands,</hi> or <hi>tenements, alienated from the crown.</hi> And I trust that my candid

            <head>PART II. Concerning some Precautions and Conditions necessary to be ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>served in the granting of Crown Lands, Tenements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE crown is limited, as well in the mode of <hi>granting,</hi> as in the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ditions to <hi>be granted;</hi> insomuch that when any grant or lease is made <hi>contrary to the rules prescribed by law,</hi> the same is there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>by rendered <hi>null and void.</hi> I shall not pretend to speak of all the particular pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cautions and conditions necessary to be observed on these occasions, but only some few of the most essential, which, I apprehend, have not been so much re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>garded <hi>of late</hi> as they ought.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="21"/>The legislature hath agreed, and laid it down as a rule, that all the ancient and <hi>military tenures of lands, and</hi> 
               <q>even <hi>SOCCAGE IN CAPITE,</hi> of the king, and the consequents upon the same, have been much more burthensome, grievous, and <hi>PREJUDICIAL,</hi> to the kingdom, than they have been <hi>BENEFICIAL</hi> to the king.</q> (See Preamble to 12 Cha. II. cap. 24.) For this just reason, <hi>founded on experi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence,</hi> the king hath ever since been <hi>re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>strained by the law</hi> from granting any part of his dominions upon such conditions.</p>
            <p>I have, indeed, heard of a foreign island being granted to a noble lord upon some such <hi>antiquated conditions,</hi> whereby he is said to be established as <hi>lord para<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mount,</hi> with a peculiar unconstitutional authority; but this, I am willing to pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sume, is merely report; and, even if it were true, the grant would be innocent enough, because it is <hi>null and void in it<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self,</hi> as the king has had no right since
<pb n="15" facs="22"/>
12 Cha. II. to make a grant <hi>on any other tenure than that of free and common soc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cage.</hi> 
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Sect. 4. <q>And be it farther enacted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That all tenures hereafter to be created by the king's ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jesty, his heirs, or successors, upon any gifts or grants of any manors, lands, tenements, or hereditaments, of any estate of inheritance, at the common law, shall be in <hi>free and common socage,</hi> and shall be ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>judged to be in <hi>free and common socage only,</hi> and not by knights service, or in capite, and shall be discharged of all wardship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> any law, statute, or reser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vation to the contrary thereof in any wise notwith<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>standing.</q>
               </note> — The king is also bound to have respect to <hi>former grants,</hi> because, even in cases when the king hath grant<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed <hi>during pleasure,</hi> a second grant, <hi>not mentioning the former, shall be void.</hi> (<gap resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">
                  <desc>illegible</desc>
               </gap> Hen. VIII. c. 15).</p>
            <p>Now, in order to set forth more clear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly some <hi>other</hi> circumstances wherein the crown is <hi>limited</hi> in the mode of grant<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, and in the conditions to be granted, I shall beg leave to <hi>suppose</hi> a case. — <hi>Suppose</hi> a crafty and litigious person makes interest with the <hi>lord-treasurer,</hi> or
<pb n="16" facs="23"/>
               <hi>the commissioners of the treasury,</hi> for a grant of alienated crown-lands, on condition that he shall, <hi>at his own expence,</hi> prove and establish <hi>the right of the crown, and recover the lands from the present possessor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us also <hi>suppose</hi> a lord-treasurer, or commissioners of the treasury, <hi>so regard<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>less of the necessary and legal precautions against abuses in granting crown-lands,</hi> that they approve the clandestine offer, and procure <hi>a grant</hi> from their royal mas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter agreeable to the wishes of the pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poser.</p>
            <p>But what will such an adventurer gain by his parchments, whilst the king's courts are worthy to be esteemed <hi>courts of justice and law?</hi> Be pleased to observe that my <hi>suppositions</hi> are now at a stand. They extend no farther than the <hi>imagi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nary case</hi> already laid down. For I am not <hi>to suppose,</hi> or <hi>conceive,</hi> that any learn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed persons, who preside in the king's courts, are subject to venal <hi>time-serving,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="24"/>
or the factious spirit of party influence, which is the source of the most dange<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous <hi>partiality;</hi> because <hi>partiality</hi> is en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tirely inconsistent with the high character of <hi>judges,</hi> and must necessarily make shipwreck of their souls!</p>
            <p>For a <hi>partial judge</hi> cannot truly be said to <hi>"have the fear of God before his eyes:"</hi> and, as this is the <hi>first principle</hi> which the common law of England requires, and deems absolutely necessary in all ranks of the community, but more particularly in <hi>judges,</hi> I am bound in Christian cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity not to suspect such <hi>a legal incapacity</hi> in any of them, until I am convinced, by experience, to the contrary.</p>
            <p>For this reason I have not attempted, by declamation and far-fetched argu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments, to establish my opinion; nor do I rely on the interest and number of my friends to make it pass current; neither do I demand favour of my readers, as being a friend to administration; but
<pb n="18" facs="25"/>
I have founded my opinion merely <hi>on the authority of law;</hi> and, whilst our judges as well as juries are susceptible of that <hi>just and indispensible fear</hi> before mentioned, and are in the least <q>mindful of the solemn account which they themselves must one day give,</q> so long shall I presume that our courts are <hi>impartial;</hi> and that they will carefully and conscientiously weigh and determine every case that is laid be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore them according <hi>to the known laws of the land;</hi> and, consequently, that they would reject, with disdain, the claim of <hi>my supposed adventurer,</hi> if his pretensions to the alienated lands in question had no better foundation than <hi>such a grant</hi> as I have <hi>supposed.</hi> The Courts would in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>form the litigious adventurer that his grant is of no signification, and cannot convey to him the least right in the alie<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nated lands, because the Crown is bound to prove and establish its own right in all manors, lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before <hi>it can grant
<pb n="19" facs="26"/>
them to any person whatever;</hi> for both the lord-chancellor and the lord-treasurer (and consequently the commissioners of the treasury) are absolutely restrained, by an act of parliament, (8 Hen. VI. c. 16.<note place="bottom" n="*">8 Hen. VI. c. xvi. <q>To eschew the dolours, grievances, and disherisons, which daily do happen to many of the king's liege-people, by the escheators, for that they take enquests, to inquire before them, as well by virtue of the king's writs, as of their offi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces, favourably <hi>and not duly,</hi> by people not impan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nelled, nor returned to them by the sheriffs of the counties, and more often for their <hi>private gain,</hi> and for <hi>the disherison of the king's liege-people, than for the profit of the same our lord the king,</hi> and also, for that the lands and tenements of many of the king's liege-people be seized into the king's hands upon such enquests, <hi>or let</hi> to ferm by the chancellor or treasurer <hi>before such enquests be returned</hi> in the chancery: our lord the king hath ordained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that no escheator or com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>missioner take in any wise <hi>any enquest to enquire,</hi> but of people <hi>returned and impanelled by the sheriff▪</hi> in the county, within which he is escheator or commissioner.

king's lands <hi>to farm,</hi> until <hi>lawful enquests</hi> and <hi>verdicts</hi> (that is from <hi>good towns,</hi> and <hi>of good people,</hi> 36 Ed. III. c. 13; or <hi>a jury of twelve sufficient men,</hi> 1 Hen. VIII. c. 8.) have been taken thereupon, and <q>
                  <hi>be fully returned</hi> in the Chancery, or in the Exchequer, but all such lands and tenements shall entirely and continu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ally remain in the hands of our lord the king, until the said enquests and ver<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dicts be returned,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — And, when the persons <q>
                  <hi>grieved by the same en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quests, or putting out of their lands and tenements,</hi> come into the Chancery, and proffer themselves to traverse the said enquests, and then offer to take the same lands or tenements to ferm. And, if they so do, that then the same lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be committed <hi>to them if they shew good evidence, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> So that there is
<pb n="21" facs="28"/>
no possibility for the crown to make <hi>a valid grant</hi> upon the conditions before de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scribed, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>the establishing of the Crown's right at the expence of the grantee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And another act was made in the eighteenth year of the same reign, (cap. 6.) expressly as a remedy to prevent such <hi>subtle and designing persons</hi> from suing <q>to obtain such gifts, and grants, and ferms, by the king's letters patents, before any inquisition <hi>(as above)</hi> or title found for the king of the same, pretending such gifts and grants not comprised and remedied by the said statute, &amp;c. <hi>And, if any letters patents be made to the contrary, they shall BE VOID AND HOLDEN FOR NONE.</hi>
               </q> — So that our adventu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rer's claim, founded on <hi>a grant</hi> made <hi>pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vious to these necessary steps,</hi> is absolutely <hi>null and void of itself.</hi> And the very conditions of it (viz. that of establishing the right of the crown at the grantee's own expence) would afford substantial proof, without any farther examination,
<pb n="22" facs="29"/>
that the crown had neglected all these <hi>legal precautions,</hi> which are absolutely necessary for the foundation and existence of every grant: and, consequently, such a condition is, of itself, sufficient to ren<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der any grant a <hi>mere nullity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must, likewise, observe that the crown, or its ministers, have no right to grant lands on any other terms or condi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions whatsoever, besides those which are prescribed by law <q>utterly void and of none effect,</q> 
               <hi>(says the 1st Stat. of queen Anne, sect. 5.)</hi> 
               <q>unless such <hi>GRANT, LEASE,</hi> &amp;c. be made for some term or es<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tate, not exceeding one and thirty years, or three lives, or for some term of years deter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>minable upon one, two, or three, lives; and, unless such grant, &amp;c. be made to com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mence from the date or making thereof;</q> which is impossible in the case that I have supposed, where the right is afterwards to be established by a contest at law.—There are also <hi>other conditions</hi> which are absolutely necessary: a reservation must be made of
<pb n="23" facs="30"/>
the ancient and most usual rent, or more, or such rent as hath been reserved, yield<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, and paid, for the greater part of twenty years, before the making of the grant; or a reserved rent, not under the third part <hi>of the clear yearly value.</hi> And whatever grant is made since the first of queen Anne, otherwise than according to the tenure and meaning of the said act, is <hi>absolutely null and void.</hi> It would be in vain for a <hi>Treasury-board</hi> to alledge, in such a case, that they abated their le<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gal conditions in consideration of the grantee being bound to prosecute and establish, at his own expence, <hi>the right of the crown:</hi> an impartial court (such as I have described) would freely declare that the crown is not empowered to change the above <hi>prescribed conditions,</hi> on any pretence whatsoever, being absolute<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly <hi>limited</hi> and bound by this Statute of 1st Anne, which declares (sect. 7.) <q>that all gifts, grants, &amp;c. of manors, &amp;c.
<pb n="24" facs="31"/>
or any part thereof, contrary to the pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>visions of this act, or any of them, shall <hi>BE NULL AND VOID,</hi> without any inqui<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sition, scire facias, or other proceeding, to determine or make void the same.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the most material thing to be con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sidered by a lord chancellor, a lord trea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>surer, or a treasury-board, before they presume to reclaim <hi>alienated lands, &amp;c.</hi> is, what I first of all touched upon, viz. whether the present possessors of lands, &amp;c. have enjoyed a <hi>quiet possession of sixty years?</hi> because that creates a good title; "FACIT JUS," as I have already proved; and such great officers ought to be aware that <q>Rescriptum principis contra <hi>JUS</hi> non valet;</q> so that they would betray the honour of their royal master, if they were to endeavour to pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cure his assent to grants of land, &amp;c. which, by <hi>time and possession,</hi> are thus to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tally <hi>and irrecoverably alienated;</hi> for <q>Do<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>natio principis intelligitur <hi>SINE PREJU<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>DICIO

            <p>The points of law and opinions, which I have here laid down, may perhaps be capable of perversion; for indeed the <hi>plainest truths</hi> may be wrested and <hi>per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verted</hi> by long, sophistical, and deceit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful, arguments;—but, let my opponents submit their objections to writing, as I have done, and collate them side by side with mine, and it will be impossible for the most subtle prevarication to set aside so many plain and intelligible laws, which acquire a collective force by being thus produced together: and, even if we could suppose an inclination or partiality in any of the king's justices, to favour and confirm <hi>every act of administration whatsoever,</hi> be it <hi>right or wrong;</hi> and, among the rest, such AN ILLEGAL ACT OF THE TREA<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>SURY LORDS as I have here stated in this supposed grant; yet, even the most

               <hi>partial</hi> of them would find themselves exposed to great difficulty, shame, and danger, by attempting to define away the true meaning of so many positive laws, in order to <hi>establish</hi> such <hi>an injustice:</hi> for the private opinions of the king's justices ought to have <hi>no weight,</hi> neither their <hi>will</hi> and <hi>inclination,</hi> except when clearly supported <hi>by law;</hi> because they are not allowed <hi>an arbitrary or wilful discretion,</hi> 
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Also discretion, as it is well described, is <q>scire per legem quid sit justum.</q> 10 Co. 140.</note> but merely <hi>a legal discretion,</hi> which is <hi>"discernere per legem quod sit justum."</hi> — <q>For <hi>discretion</hi> is a science, or understand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, to discern between <hi>falsity</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> between <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong,</hi> between <hi>sha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dows</hi> and <hi>substance,</hi> between <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>colourable glosses</hi> and <hi>pretences;</hi> and not to do according to their <hi>wills and private affections;</hi> for, as one faith, <q>Talis dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cretio discretionem confundit.</q>

maxims have been infringed by any <hi>great officer of the present times,</hi> through <hi>misinformation,</hi> or for want of duly considering the point in question, let them but acknowledge their error, together with a sincere intention to make what reparation may lie in their power, and they will easily regain that public confi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dence and esteem which they have for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>feited by their mistakes; for, sure I am, (with sir Edw. Cook,) <q>that no wise or true-hearted <hi>Englishman,</hi> that hath been <hi>persuaded</hi> before he was <hi>instructed,</hi> will refuse to be <hi>instructed</hi> in the truth, (which <hi>he may see with his own eyes,</hi>) lest he should be <hi>dissuaded</hi> from error, wherewith blindfold he hath been deceived; for <hi>miserable is his case, and worthy of pity, that hath been</hi> PER<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>SUADED <hi>before he was</hi> INSTRUCTED, <hi>and now will refuse to be</hi> INSTRUCTED <hi>because he will not be</hi> PERSUADED.</q> But, howsoever applicable the latter part
<pb n="28" facs="35"/>
of this quotation may be to any of his majesty's <hi>late</hi> or <hi>present ministers,</hi> yet am I thoroughly persuaded that it will never <hi>be justly</hi> said of himself.</p>
            <p>As a man, he is indeed liable to be im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed on, and may perhaps <hi>be persuaded</hi> to give his assent to some improper things, through the insinuation of mere <hi>worldly politicians;</hi> that the same are absolutely NECESSARY; and that he must submit to tread in the beaten tract of <hi>state-policy</hi> (howsoever <hi>corrupt</hi>) to avoid the danger of greater evils. <note place="bottom" n="‖">The NECESSITY of doing <hi>evil</hi> to avoid <hi>a greater evil</hi> is a doctrine too generally adopted by <hi>worldly</hi> poli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticians, and perfectly accords with the ancient <hi>iniquitous</hi> proposition, <hi>"Let us do</hi> EVIL, <hi>that</hi> GOOD <hi>may come."</hi> But the unhappy state of those wretched politicians, who give such pernicious counsel, is immediately ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ded, — <hi>whose damnation is just!</hi> Rom. iii. 8.</note>

            <p>If he ever has yielded to such <hi>fallacious</hi> and <hi>dangerous doctrines,</hi> (for no doctrines are so productive of <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>iniquity,</hi>

            <p>That he is a good christian, and <hi>sin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerely wishes to promote the general good of his people,</hi> I have not the least doubt; and therefore if any man hath <hi>been inju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>red</hi> by such <hi>an illegal grant</hi> as I have de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scribed, let him find some means of sta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ting the merits of his case in a proper and respectful manner to our gracious sove<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reign, and I will FORFEIT MY LIFE, <hi>if he does not find redress.</hi> — MY CONFIDENCE <note place="bottom" n="‖">N.
