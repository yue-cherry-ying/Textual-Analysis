            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE evident Approach of a War
having been spoken to, with some
Approbation; the evident Advantages of
it to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> seem as natural to be
spoken to, as they are necessary.</p>
            <p>The same Hand therefore applies it self
to this Part however officiously, yet with
the same Sincerity, to encourage the Nati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
in the prosecuting of the War, when
it shall be begun.</p>
            <p>If the many Disappointments which the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> have met with in forming
their Designs, and the dull Prospects they
have before them in carrying them on, have
not prevail'd on them to take better Mea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sures,
or to act a wiser Part; but that
they will go on, in spight, not of Reason on<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly,
but even of Nature; that very Obstina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cy
is an Encouragement to us, who have
so many Assurances of Success in every
Branch of the War.</p>
            <p>But when the Advantages to our Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce
come to be weighed also, and added
<pb facs="4"/>
to the Advantages of the War, one would
be apt to say that as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> seem
infatuated in the Beginning it; we should
all be infatuated, if we did not take hold
of the Occasion.</p>
            <p>The Author desires to capitulate for so
much Favour, (however otherwise discou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>raged,)
that as this Tract is written with
the same sincere Affection to the publick
Interest, as well of the Government as of the
whole Nation, as the former, it may be accep<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted
in the same manner; he earnestly wishes
that the Advantages to our Commerce, which
so evidently offer on the Occasion of this
War, may be embrac'd; that our Trade,
which at this Time suffers under many o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
Difficulties, may at least revive upon
the Follies of our Enemies, and by those
very Steps by which they think to ruin it.</p>
            <p>He is also ready at any time to disclose
some remaining Advantages of this War, as
they relate to Commerce, which seem yet
not to be noticed by our Superiors, and to
recommend them to Practice, and that with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out
any Prospect of Interest, or Hopes of
Reward.</p>

            <pb n="1" facs="5"/>THE EVIDENT
<hi>Advantages</hi> to GREAT BRITAIN, and its
ALLIES, from the <hi>Approaching</hi> WAR.</head>
         <div n="1" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <head type="sub">That the first Scheme of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Designs might be said
to have some Weight in them. That the Disappointments
they have met with ought to have made them despair, and
give over; but that their obstinate pursuing those broken
Measures, notwithstanding their Disappointments, makes
them appear Ridiculous and Absurd.</head>
            <p>WHAT has hitherto been spoken of the Certain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty
and Necessity of a War, and of its Evident
Approach, has been founded upon the Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>coveries
made by the Enemy themselves, or by
the general Knowledge of Things; as the Publick Affairs of
<hi>Europe</hi> had an evident Tendency in their Consequences to a
Rupture. <hi>What can't be otherwise, must be so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no great Concession in this Argument, for an Author
to say he is no Privy-Counsellor, no Secret-Service Man;
that he sees only <hi>without Doors,</hi> and judges only from <hi>what
is,</hi> to <hi>what may be.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and even the <hi>Imperialists,</hi>
(who in this Discourse, and for this Occasion in particular,
we call the Enemy) have taken care to act, not as if they de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sign'd
the Thing should be a Secret, or that they would amuse
the World about it, and that we should be at an Uncertainty
in the Question, whether they design'd to make a War of it,
or no; they seem rather to be removing all possible Doubts a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bout
it from our Thoughts, and making it appear, not that
they really intended it, but that it can be no otherwise; that
the <hi>Rubicon</hi> was past, the Thing determined, and that it could
not be avoided.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="6"/>
This made the former Discourse upon this Subject bear
the Title of Evident, <hi>The Evident Approach,</hi> &amp;c. intimating, that
the War was Evident and Visible in its Approach, and that
they must have some Defect in their Understanding, who made
any longer Doubt of it; that the Parties were as they say of Armies,
in full March to Engage. Indeed, it seems to cost the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
some Pains to obtain a Belief among Mankind, that they were
in Earnest; for such Difficulties offered themselves in the
Thing it self, to the meanest and most common Observation,
that it was not easy to bring People to believe the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
Weak enough to be in Earnest, or that they were really
entering upon a War (and especially making themselves Ag<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gressors)
in which they were as certain to be Losers, as
as they were to be Parties; as certain to be beaten, as to
fight, and in which indeed it could (by the Nature of Things)
be no otherwise.</p>
            <p>For this Reason, I must confess it seemed a necessary Piece
of Work, to perswade the People to believe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tended
a War, and that therefore That was first to be laid
down as a Principle, and rendered as Undeniable as all Princi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ples
in Matters of Dispute ought to be; and how could this
be done better, than by the concurring Testimony of the E<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nemy
themselves, either declared in plain Words at length,
or gathered as the Natural Consequences of all their A<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ctions?</p>
            <p>When
I say, the Meaning of an Enemy appears from the
natural Consequences of their Actions, I must be allowed to
argue thus: When I see plainly, that a Man resolves to put
such Hardships, such Pieces of Injustice, and such Affronts upon
me, as he has good Reason to know I will not and ought not to
bear, without the most Scandalous Reproach to my Character,
the utmost Damage and Loss to my Interest, and the utmost
Danger and Hazard to my Life; and that therefore he knows
at the same Time, such Usage of me will force me to resist
him, and repel Force with Force; when I see him, I say, act<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
in such a Manner, I may (without Injury to him) con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clude,
That in short he designs to Quarrel with me; it is the
natural Consequence of the Thing; the Language of his Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haviour
speaks it as plain, as if he sent me a Challenge, or de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fy'd
me in Words at length.</p>
            <p>Thus in Case of the Conduct of the several Powers we are
now speaking of: When we see them Leaguing and Confe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derating
together, forming a Strength of Interests, entering in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to
Secret Engagements, and those Secret Engagements pointed
directly and particularly at the Interest of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> at
<pb n="3" facs="7"/>
the Person, Honour, and Royal Dignity of his Majesty, as
King of <hi>Great Britain</hi>:</p>
            <p>It we see them concerting Measures for the somenting Di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>visions,
Feuds, and Factions among the People, and raising
Rebellion and Civil War in the Heart of his Majesty's Domi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nions:</p>
            <p>If
we see them breaking all Faith and Honour, Pledg'd and
Engaged in the most solemn Manner, by espousing that despicable
Interest which they had Renounced, and Promised effectually
to Abandon and Reject; I mean that of the Pretender, whom
they had mutually engag'd not to Assist or Support in any
manner whatsoever; and that those Engagements were enter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed
into in such Terms<note place="bottom" n="a">The Terms of the mutual Engagement between the two Courts of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Madrid,</hi> are said to be expresly thus: <hi>To Undertake to place the Pretender upon the Throne of</hi> Great Britain.</note> as could not be broken without a
Violation of Honour, in such a Manner, as few Persons of
such Dignity, in the World, could ever satisfie themselves to
be guilty of:</p>
            <p>If we see them, tho' Crowned Heads, tho' Princes, and
Christian Princes, stooping so far below the Dignity of Crowned
Heads, as to encourage Treason and Rebellion, supporting
Subjects in Traiterous Designs against their Sovereign; which
Sovereign, both these Crowned Heads had Own'd and Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceiv'd
in the Quality of Lawful and Rightful; and had So<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lemnly,
and in a particular Manner Engaged, not to disturb
in the Possession of his said Lawful and Rightful Government,
as above:<note place="bottom" n="b">The Sixth Article of the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> runs thus: <q rend="inline">'The Catholick King doth Promise, as well in his own Name, as in that of his Heirs and Successors. That they will not at any Time disturb or molest the QUEEN, her Heirs and Successors of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Line, being in Possession of the Crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the Do<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>minions Subject thereunto: Neither will the said Catholick King, or any of his Successors, give at any Time any <hi>Aid, Succour, Favour</hi> or <hi>Counsel,</hi> directly, or indirectly, to any Person or Persons, who on any Cause or Pretence, shall hereafter endeavour to Oppose the said Succes<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion, by Open War, or by any Conspiracies, against such Prince and Princes possessing the said Throne of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as aforesaid.'</q>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>If we see them Leaguing and Confederating, for the form<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
Interests destructive to the Commerce of these Kingdoms;
laying open such Branches of Trade as by former Leagues and
Conventions were expresly Limited and Restrain'd; Invading
the Commerce, which it was expresly Stipulated should not
<pb n="4" facs="8"/>
be invaded, and breaking in upon the Property of a Nation,
as well as of particular Persons in the said Commerce:</p>
            <p>If, I say, these things are evident, and that we know they
are such as the Nation of <hi>Great Britain</hi> will not sit down
satisfied with, or, as we may justly say, cannot but resent, and
that with the utmost Indignation; and that the said Enemy
must know they would be so resented; we must conclude
them likewise in earnest to quarrel with the People of <hi>Great
Britain,</hi> and to begin a War.</p>
            <p>It has not therefore been insignificant, in Order to convince
the People of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> of the stated and settled Resolu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
of the said <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Imperialists</hi> to insult and af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>front
his Majesty, and to bring about a War in <hi>Europe,</hi> for
the carrying those Designs and Resolutions on; I say, it has
not been insignificant to those Ends, that Methods have been
taken to expose the private, and, as I may call them, Clande<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stine
Methods of the said Confederating Powers, for the en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>couraging
Treason and Rebellion among the King's Subjects,
for animating disaffected Parties, and for forming unjustifiable
Schemes of Trade, such as must necessarily end in War and
Confusion.</p>
            <p>To prove that the Enemy resolve to bring the Allies to a
Necessity of making War in their own Defence, is to prove
that a War will necessarily be the Consequence; and in such
Case, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> resolve to prompt that Necessity, 'tis the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> make the War, not the Confederates.</p>
            <p>To put things upon us which it is not reasonable we shou'd
bear, which no Nation in their Senses can bear, and which
they may depend upon his Majesty will not bear, or his Al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lies
either, is indeed to begin the War, or at least to declare
the War to be inevitable.</p>
            <p>It was not therefore so remote from the Question in hand
to say we shou'd go to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to the Empe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ror,
and ask them whether we shall have <hi>War</hi> or <hi>Peace</hi>; it is
for them to answer that Question; and their Actions have in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed
determin'd it already, they have made the War a thing
not only Certain, but, as I say, Inevitable; nay they have begun
the War by a secret clandestine Conduct, full of Machinery,
full of Secret, and yet Evident Acts of Hostility; and by
carrying on such Mines and subterranean Attacks against the
<hi>Hanover</hi> Allies, as they might easily know and be sure those
Allies would not bear, and such as indeed they ought not to
expect wou'd be born with.</p>
            <p>In a Word, all the Conduct of the <hi>Hanover</hi> Allies has been
Pacific, Healing, and visibly endeavouring to heal and make
<pb n="5" facs="9"/>
up the Breaches which have appear'd, and to preserve a good Un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derstanding
between the Powers of <hi>Europe</hi>; on the other hand, all
the Conduct of the Enemy has been menacing, provoking, and
insulting; Clouds big with Thunder, tho' empty of Force;
<hi>Brutum fulmen</hi>; Noise without a Bolt; Threats without a
Hand to execute; pointing, but not pointed. In a Word,
They have breathed War on every Occasion, that if possible
they might make it necessary to the Allies to begin it.</p>
            <p>It seems they have 'till this time been able to do little more
than Urge and Provoke, using all the Methods possible to
show their ill Will, except that of Force; which tho' they
have been unable to make much use of, they have shown evi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dently,
that they intend all that is or shall be in their Power, to
injure and offend the <hi>Hanover</hi> Allies, and his <hi>Britannick</hi> Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jesty
in particular, that so a War may follow of Course.</p>
            <p>Not but that this Consequence may happen much sooner
than they will find for their Advantage, and before they may
be thoroughly ready for it; yet it might be very needful to ask up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
what particular Foundation they, who are in reality so ill able
to carry it on, seem so very hasty for bringing it to pass? Whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
they have not met with some Disappointments since they
begun thus to show themselves, and whether those Disappoint<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments
ever made any visible Alterations in their Schemes, or
no?</p>
            <p>That they have met with some Disappointments, is evident,
and that in several Articles. Nothing is more certain than that
they had a View of several things, which in their Embrio appear'd
probable and encouraging, which they have since found Rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son
to conclude will not answer their End, and the Defici<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ency
of which renders their Designs far less promising and
hopeful than at first. For Example:<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>'Tis evident,</hi> they had Hopes of obtaining some tolerable
Conditions for the Preserving the <hi>East-India</hi> Trade, that is to
say, for upholding the <hi>East-India</hi> Company erected at <hi>Ostend</hi>;
by which Commerce, the Imperial Court depended upon it, a
large Revenue would accrue to the Publick, as does by the like
Company to the Governments in <hi>England, Holland</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>'Tis Evident,</hi> they hoped for a mutual Assistance and
Communication between the united Powers of <hi>Vienna</hi> and
<hi>Madrid,</hi> the one assisting the other with Money, and the other
reciprocally supplying Powerful Bodies of Troops to carry on
an offensive War. The Imperial Court, I doubt not, depended
upon vast Supplies of Money in Specie; at least all the stipu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lated
Sums, which were very great; by which Money the Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perial
Armies, great and numerous already, wou'd be still made
<pb n="6" facs="10"/>
greater and more powerful, and the War be carry'd on into the
Dominions of the <hi>Hanover</hi> Allies to great Advantage.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>'Tis Evident,</hi> they hoped to bring off <hi>France</hi> from its At<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tachment
to the Interest of the Allies of <hi>Hanover,</hi> and particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larly
from its warm Adherence to all such farther Measures
as might embarrass the said Courts of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Vienna</hi> in a
War with <hi>France</hi>; believing perhaps, that at the worst, <hi>France</hi>
would not have come into an offensive Alliance against <hi>Spain,</hi>
and have turn'd its Arms against a Branch of the House of <hi>Bour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ben</hi>;
in which also we doubt not they are happily disappointed.</item>
                  <item>4. It is evident, <hi>Spain</hi> is particularly under a most mortify<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
Disappointment, in the <hi>British</hi> Squadron blocking up their
Plate-Fleet at <hi>Porto-Belo,</hi> and stopping the Returns of those im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mense
Sums of Money which should have been brought to
<hi>Europe</hi> by the Galeons and the <hi>Flota</hi>; which had they come safe,
had (as they tell us) brought them at one time forty Millions
of Pieces of Eight in Specie, which, with the Merchandizes load<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed
on board those Ships at the same time, amounted to above
Ten Millions Sterling; which immense Sum, tho' much
the greater Part of it was the Property of their own Subjects,
and of the Subjects of the Allies, as Merchants; yet perhaps
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> might have thought fit, at such a Jun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cture
as that of a War, to have borrowed some of, or
otherwise to have appropriated it to the publick Uses, for the
maintaining the Engagements mentioned above; perhaps how<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever
making Satisfaction to the Proprietors by some other way‚ñ™</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I may name several other Heads of Disappointment in the
first Views which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had of these things, in their Or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der,
and which had they foreseen, they would perhaps have
acted something more warily than they have done, and so
have given less Umbrage to the Allies, or at least stopp'd
their Hands, 'till they had gotten the Money, upon which all
the Rest so much depended, into their Hands.</p>
            <p>But I must note as I go, that here they have been overshot in
their own Bow: Here the Allies have been too old for them:
And now it seems they are going on without their Crutches,
walking without their Legs, and in a word, making the War
without the Money. I return to the Disappointments.</p>
            <p>It is evident, besides all this, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> met with a
very great Disappointment in the <hi>Baltick,</hi> where we are pretty
well assured they promised themselves great Assistance; and
from whence we are told they expected a Supply of Naval
Strength; which Supply they found as effectually lock'd up
in the Port of <hi>Revel,</hi> as they did the Money (that was to pay
for it) in the Haven of <hi>Porto-Belo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="11"/>
The <hi>Muscovites</hi> could no more part with their Ships, or
cause a Squadron of Men of War to sail without Money,
than the <hi>Imperialists</hi> could cause their Armies to march with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out
the same Supply; and if they (the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) expected it o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>therwise,
if they expected fifteen Sail of <hi>Russian</hi> Men of
War would come to their Assistance without Money, they
were much mistaken, and acted more like F<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters" rend="content:_+">
                  <desc>blank</desc>
               </gap>s than the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> generally used to do.</p>
            <p>Nor is it less wonderful to me, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who
used to act in former Days with such consummate Wisdom,
and by such impenetrable Councils, that it was said of <hi>Don
Lewis de Haro,</hi> he obey'd the Scripture in his Politicks, what<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever
he did in his Alms, and that he did not <hi>let his right Hand
know</hi> what <hi>his left Hand did</hi>; that these very wary circum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spect
<hi>Spaniards</hi> should let so much of their secret Service
come to light, and act in such an unwary and impolitick
Manner, as to have their Measures be talk'd publickly of, in
the ordinary Conversation at <hi>Petersburgh,</hi> as I have been
inform'd has been the Case.</p>
            <p>Nothing can excuse the Folly of it, in my Opinion, unless
I shall with some People suggest, that the Improbability of
their Schemes and Chimeras being Successful, should argue
they were not at all in earnest about them: But this has so
much of the <hi>Jacobite</hi> in it, and so little of the Politician, that I
think 'tis scarce worth repeating; 'tis much more certain, that the
locking up the <hi>Muscovite</hi> Fleet was an inexpressible Disap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pointment
to the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; and that it could not have been,
if their Expectations of Help from that <hi>Russian</hi> Fleet had not
been very great.</p>
            <p>It is true, under all these Disappointments, and more which I
shall speak of presently, it might have been expected the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
and the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> notwithstanding their Confederacy, should
have laid aside the Design it self, and should have carried on
the Project no farther; and indeed, this gave Occasion to my
calling the Design in general absurd and ridiculous, supposing
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not be so weak as to go on with it, and that
if they were in Earnest before, they could not be so now.</p>
            <p>But since it is so, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or the <hi>Imperialists,</hi>
think themselves still able to carry on their Designs, and that
they are not sufficiently discourag'd by their Disappointments,
let us then turn the Tables as they do, and talk seriously of
it as a thing really intended. And here, as I said before, tho' the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> are not so Considerable as to fright us, I hope we
may allow that they are not so Inconsiderable as not to awaken
<pb n="8" facs="12"/>
us. They are certainly strong enough to justifie our Prepa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rations,
tho' not so strong as to fill us with Apprehensions.</p>
            <p>Hence all the Precautions which have been made use of by
our Government, and by his Majesty's particular Direction,
have been not justified only, but are to be esteem'd as Effects
of the most wise and successful Councils imaginable; a Pru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dence
that has had something more than common in it, and
which has been the Foundation of all those (happy) Disappoint<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments
to the Enemy: <hi>Happy Disappointments</hi> I say to us, Un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>happy
enough to them, and which at this time may be said to
compleat the History of the Conduct and Success of the <hi>Vi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>enna
Alliance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Precautions and Provisions, at the same time that they
have disappointed the Executions of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Design, have
also made the carrying it on farther, absurd and foolish; have
really turn'd the Tables upon the Enemy, and made their too-well-concerted
Schemes become ridiculous; the Measures
which, as first proposed among themselves, appear'd rational
and probable, agreeable to a wise and prudent Nation, and
to the Counsel of able Statesmen and Ministers, are by
these Means become scandalously vain and imprudent; and
we may bless the Precaution, I say, at the same time that we
make a Jest of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Obstinacy, in carrying on these
Designs, after they were so render'd ridiculous.</p>
            <p>To justifie this Argument, let us return to the first Scheme;
let us examine the first Prospects upon which they were form'd,
the Foundation upon which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the House of
<hi>Austria</hi> united, and upon which the Treaty of <hi>Vienna</hi> was
made; and in doing this, we shall not perhaps find the <hi>Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niards</hi>
such weak People as they seem to be now: We shall
find, that 'tis rather their obstinate persisting in their Pursuit of
a blasted Undertaking that renders them ridiculous, than any
Absurdity or incongruous Acting in the first Scheme, or in
the Foundation those Schemes were built upon.</p>
            <p>Had the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (close in their Councils, and pru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dent
in their Conduct) kept their Affairs within the Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pass
of their own Cabinet, as they formerly used to do, and
secured the Secret in their own Breasts; Had they been so far
the Masters of their own Schemes, as to have secur'd the Sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ports
and Supplies they wanted, so that they could neither
have been kept from a Squadron by blocking up <hi>Revel,</hi> or
from the Galeons by blocking up <hi>Porto-Belo</hi>;</p>
            <p>Had they first receiv'd the Support of fifteen Men of War,
which is said to be the Number they expected from the <hi>Cza<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rina,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="13"/>
and the Supply of forty Millions of Pieces of Eight
from <hi>Porto-Belo</hi>; had they brought in the King of <hi>Sardinia,</hi>
and the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the
King of <gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 word" rend="content: _____ ">
                  <desc>blank</desc>
               </gap> and several other Princes and Powers into
the <hi>Vienna</hi> Treaty, as I make no doubt they at first ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pected,
and as they indeed at first reported;</p>
            <p>Had they brought his most Christian Majesty, and the <hi>States-General</hi>
to a Neutrality, as they say they have obtain'd of the
King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and as I doubt
not they earnestly endeavour'd with the two first:</p>
            <p>In a word, had all these Points been gain'd, and had they
met with none of the other Disappointments already men<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion'd,
I most readily grant they had form'd a Body of Power
truly terrible and formidable to the Protestant Interest; and
we had had more Reason (much more Reason) to be alarm'd,
and indeed frighted with the Apprehensions of what might
have been the Consequence of these things, than I hope we
have had yet, or are like to have now.</p>
            <p>Not but even with all those I should still say, and hope it
would appear, that the Naval Strength of <hi>Great Britain</hi>
might, under Providence, have been our Protection against
them all.</p>
            <p>But they have been disappointed in almost every Part. Even
the <hi>Venetians</hi> themselves, tho' a State under infinite Obliga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi>
ever since the Battel of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> yet so ill have they ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nag'd,
that we do not find they have been able to bring that
wise People to espouse their Cause, or so much as to pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mise
a Neutrality, or to act as Auxiliars, by Land or by
Sea.</p>
            <p>This Consideration however may serve to give us the use<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful
Reflection mention'd above; (<hi>viz.</hi>) How Just have been the
Cautions, and how Prudent have been the Measures taken on
this Side, (be it by who you will) to dive into these Secrets,
to detect these Contrivances! and, which is still more, how
Successful, happily Successful the Discovery! How many
Ways has it been advantageous, and particularly how useful,
in having given time for the Preparations of the <hi>Hanover</hi>
Allies; nay, for the forming the Treaty it self; and in having
opened the Eyes of other Powers, and bringing Them into
it, who seem'd doubtful whether they should accede or no!</p>
            <p>Again; Of what Use has the preventing those things been
to us! that from such a formidable Appearance, from such a
deep-laid Design, that was capable of being made thus ter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rible,
they should be brought to so despicable, and truly con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>contemptible
<pb n="10" facs="14"/>
a Figure, that 'tis hardly reasonable to talk of
them at the same Time, or hardly think of them in the same
Class, or under the same Rank.</p>
            <p>Had not his Majesty's penetrating Councils evidently
reach'd to the Bottom of all their Designs, gotten the Know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge
of their Schemes, and div'd into the Depth of all their
most considerable Projects, None of all these preventive Mea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sures
had been taken, none of these preventive Medicines had
been made use of; the several mischievous Things which they
had concluded on, had not been calmly countermin'd and
unhing'd, or the Contrivers of them been so effectually de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tected
and disappointed, as now they are.</p>
            <p>I am far therefore from saying, or suggesting, that the De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>signs
and Schemes of those Powers had not been capable of
great Attempts; that the Naval Power of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Muscovy</hi>
join'd, might not have been sufficient to have brought the Preten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der
upon the Stage in some Part or other, or at least to have given
him some Expectations, and have put him, and his easily deluded
Party, in hopes of great things to be done for him that Way:
Or that the numerous Armies of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> and the King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> united, with such Allies too as are mentioned, might
not have been able to have given us great Uneasiness, and to
have even endanger'd the Safety of all the Protestant Interests of
<hi>Europe,</hi> as well as of these united Kingdoms of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As then I grant the Danger to have been <hi>thus Great,</hi> had they
gone on uninterrupted; I must allow also, that the Discovery
having been thus happy, it behoves us to keep the Hold that
is gain'd, to preserve the Advantages of the Discovery, to
keep the separated Powers in the same state of Separation; to
keep up the engag'd Powers to their Engagements, and by all
lawful means to preserve the Consederacy of the several Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
that are thus confederated; to cultivate the Union that
they are now brought to, and if possible to encrease it; This I
think is the only way to preserve our Religion and Liberties,
our Superiority of Power, and also our Commerce, in the
Condition it stands in at this Time.</p>
            <p>Heav'ns be prais'd! the Snare is laid open; the Enchant<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
is broken; the Plot for the cementing the Powers pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed
is discovered: No Application can be too Great, no
Charge or Expence ought to be spar'd to keep it where it is:
and therefore all that his Majesty has recommended to the
Two Houses of Parliament, for their engaging themselves
vigorously in their own Defence, is of sufficient Weight
on that Side: Nor can any one object that the utmost
Application ought not to be used, to render all those At<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tempts
<pb n="11" facs="15"/>
as Abortive, as I think they are now become Ridi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culous.</p>
            <p>To
do this, the proper Steps are taken indeed; the Money is
lock'd up, and the Ships are lock'd in; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are
disappointed, and nothing remains but so to double and redou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble
the same Efforts, as to make those Lockings-up more ef<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fectual,
and to take from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> all Hopes of
removing those Obstructions.</p>
            <p>I am told, while these Sheets were writing, that I write too
much with an Air of Contempt, when I mention the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Affairs; as if a Squadron of Ships at <hi>Porto-Belo</hi> could effectu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ally
stop the whole Channel of Silver, and that not a Ship could
escape us, that nothing could pass from <hi>America</hi> to old <hi>Spain</hi>
without our Leave; and that we are as sure of intercepting
all the Ships that shall stir out, as if we had them in Tow.</p>
            <p>But the Objector is mistaken: I no where suggest that the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> shall be able to bring no Money home, that we
shall stop it all, so that nothing shall go by us: But I may ven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture
to say, the <hi>British</hi> Squadrons, if well posted, and if the
Commanders do their Duty, will so narrowly watch the <hi>Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niards,</hi>
that they must run great Hazards, if they attempt to
come away with any great Quantity; and that such Hazards,
as I am perswaded the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will not think fit to venture
their Treasure upon it.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may not be possible so effectually to shut up
all the Ports which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> possess on the Coast of <hi>Ame<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rica,</hi>
or so effectually to ply <hi>off</hi> and <hi>on</hi> upon all the Coast of
Old <hi>Spain,</hi> as that no Ship, not one Ship, shall be able to slip
out on the one hand, or find its way in on the other, without
falling into our Hands, or into some of the Hands of those that
would be willing to snap and lay hold on them; and I could
fruitfully employ some Pages here to show how and which
way such things might probably be done, and might more
probably be prevented.</p>
            <p>But as, in the first place, our Governors do not seem to
want Directions for the preventing it; so, on the other hand,
I am not <hi>Spaniards</hi> enough to show the Enemy, if they stood
in more need of it than they do, how to defeat the Measures
taken by <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to meet with and surprise them.</p>
            <p>But to go on. I may grant, that it is not probable the
Confederate Fleets or Squadrons, however Vigilant, or how
diligently soever they may guard the Coast, and spread the
Seas, either on one side or the other, should ever be able to sur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prise
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> so effectually, that not one Ship should be
able to come safe in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="16"/>
The Sea is a wide Place, and it must be very well spread
to secure every Ship, and lie upon every Point of the Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pass,
so that nothing should be able to go by: We see here
that notwithstanding Admiral <hi>Hosier</hi>'s Squadron on the Coast
of the <hi>Isthmus,</hi> and notwithstanding Admiral <hi>Hopson</hi> is crui<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sing
off of the Southward <hi>Cape</hi>; yet Fame tells us, that three
or four Ships have found their way into the Ports of <hi>Spain</hi>;
and coming by such different Courses as they have done, it is
not at all strange that they should: It is true, we are told they
bring no Silver, at least, none that we know of; and had
they been all deeply loaden with Silver, it might have been
the same thing, and no Body to blame neither.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, we must have exceeding bad Luck in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed,
and such as we have no reason to expect, considering
the Numbers of our Ships, and the Vigilance and expert Know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge
of our Seamen, if they shou'd go all safe, and none of
them shou'd fall into our Hands; in which Case I must add,
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Treasure comes in such good round Lumps,
and such merry Sums together, that if it shou'd be but <hi>now
and then</hi> that a Galeon shou'd fall into our Hands, it would
make the Fortune of the War go smilingly forward on our
Side; a few such Prizes might make good a Summer's Ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vice,
and help the Government to carry on the War.</p>
            <p>How often do we find the Loading of but one Ship amount
to four, five or six Millions of Pieces of Eight; and if we
shou'd chance to make such a Ship or two find their way up
to <hi>Woolwich</hi> in a Year, or to' deliver her Loading at <hi>Tower<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wharf,</hi>
it would go a great way towards carrying on the War,
and would be a much better way of raising Money, than four
Shillings in the Pound upon Land.</p>
            <p>This very Consideration will no doubt exceedingly weigh
with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in that particular Case, <hi>viz.</hi> as to venturing
out with their Silver; I mean not the Loss only to themselves,
tho' that would be very considerable; (and the Discourage<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
and Damage to them in case of such a Loss, is not easily
describ'd:) But the Encouragement it wou'd be to their Ene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mies.
The Loss to themselves would be inexpressibly great;
especially as they have no other Source of Wealth, no other
Fund of Treasure; all the Produce of their own Dominions
is able to do little for them, compar'd to this; and if either the
Galeons are kept entirely back, or shou'd miscarry in coming
forward, and fall into the Hands of the <hi>Hanover</hi> Allies, we
may, without affronting the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> say they will be but in
a sorry Condition to carry on the War, and to support their
new-bought Friends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="17"/>
But that is not all: The Triumph of their Enemies over them,
shou'd the Money fall into the Hands of the <hi>Hanover</hi> Allies,
would be infinitely a greater Mortification to <hi>Spain,</hi> as well
to their Pride as their Power, than the Loss of the Money;
for this wou'd be enabling the said Allies to carry on a War
against <hi>Spain</hi> at the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Expence; and this I make no questi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
they shall do, though they shou'd not take the Treasure at
Sea at all. But of that by it self.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we need not fear but we shall catch some
by the way, though it may not come all to Hand: As I said
above, we must have very bad Luck indeed if none of their
Ships fall in our way; and if any are taken, they are general<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly
worth bringing home.</p>
            <p>The Probability of this is one of the Reasons on which it
has been so openly said, that <hi>England</hi> may Gain by a War
with <hi>France,</hi> but never Loses by a War with <hi>Spain</hi>; of which
we shall have room to say more from a particular Enquiry into
our <hi>English</hi> History, where (unless upon taking a <hi>Spanish
Flota,</hi> a <hi>Vigo</hi> Account shou'd be given of it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) where
much shou'd be lost, and but little gain'd,) we might find large
Sums have been brought into <hi>England,</hi> taken from the <hi>Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niards</hi>
on all Occasions of a War; as particularly at the ta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>king
of <hi>Cadiz</hi> by the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> when it was said
that besides the publick Gain upon redeeming the City,
and other Articles; all the Officers and Soldiers got not e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nough
only, but enough to make them rich. But of this a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gain
in its Place.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, though the Prizes we might take should
be but few, yet 'tis not unlikely we may have some Share of
Booty in such a War, as well private as publick; such as may
amount to another Disappointment to <hi>Spain,</hi> and that, such a
Disappointment as <hi>Spain</hi> will not easily recover, and of which
they may have time enough to repent. And this brings me most
naturally to the chief Design of this Work, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantages
<hi>Spain</hi> is likely to make of this War which they are
so forward to engage in: or, to speak plain, the Advantages
the <hi>Hanover</hi> Allies are likely to make of it. In our Enquiry
after which, it may be determin'd by the most ordinary Judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,
whether I have pass'd a wrong Censure in saying that
the Conduct of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> is absurd and ridiculous, or no.</p>

            <p>THE Necessity of a War has been spoken to. The Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duct

make that Necessity evident. <hi>Let the</hi> Spaniards <hi>go on,</hi> (as the

<hi>God send them a good Deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How backward have the <hi>Hanover</hi> Allies been to quarrel?
How have they been so far from seeking Occasions, that
they have even refus'd to take Occasion when offer'd?</p>
            <p>How reluctant have the <hi>British</hi> Court been in drawing
the Sword? how willing to prevent the feeble Enemy from
blust'ring with theirs?</p>
            <p>What Pacific Measures have they all along pursu'd? what
Opportunities of offending have they pass'd over? nay, what
needful Defendings have they seem'd to omit? Let us see a
little into the Nature of all these things.</p>
            <p>Whether has the Backwardness of the Allies to a War been
occasion'd by their Fear of the formidable Power of the Ene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>my?
or, Has it been from a full Persuasion that the Enemy
having no Advantages in view from the War could not be
in earnest, in all or in any thing they have said or done about
it, <hi>or at least would remain so but a very little while</hi>?</p>
            <p>As nothing they have said about War has been rational,
so nothing they have done towards a War hitherto seems to
have been founded in Reason.</p>
            <p>No Man fights meerly because he Hates, but because he
Hopes. Defensive War is entred into by Force and Necessity,
but it is too with Hopes of being able to defend, able to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pell
the Force they fear.</p>
            <p>But Offensive War is founded on a firm Belief of Victory
and Hope of Conquest; it can stand upon no other Bottom;
and therefore in old Times, entring into War was usually call'd
an Act <hi>of Faith,</hi> rather than <hi>of Hope,</hi> being an Opinion, nay a
Confidence, of Success; either trusting <hi>in Heaven</hi> for it from
the Justice of the Cause, or in themselves from the Strength
of their Arms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="19"/>
But here's a War to be undertaken, with neither Faith in
Heaven, or Hope on Earth: Neither a View of Defending,
or Hope of Offending. How the Heroes of <hi>Spain</hi> will come
off with the Credit of their Understanding, That we see no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing
of; <hi>Time must discover it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since then we cannot see any Gain the <hi>Spaniards</hi> can make
of the War, nor any Loss we can sustain by it; let us see
what are like to be the Consequences of it, one way or other.
1. If the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are not like to Gain, let us enquire, What
they are like to Lose by it; for War is a Game in which the
Parties seldom draw Stakes, they generally gain much, or
lose much. 2. Since the Allies cannot (with any manner of
Reason) apprehend much Loss by the War, let us see what
Gain may be made by it <hi>on their Side.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Learned in Politicks have an ancient Way of Talk<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
(as old as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) about <hi>England</hi>'s making War,
which (with a little Amendment) reads thus: ENGLAND
<hi>may Gain by a War with</hi> France, <hi>but never Loses by a War with</hi>
SPAIN.</p>
            <p>'Tis my stated Opinion (speaking without National Preju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dice)
that <hi>England</hi> is so far from being in Danger by a War
with <hi>Spain,</hi> that it would be no Loss to us if we never had
any Peace with them; and I believe we have much more to say
for a continued War with <hi>Spain,</hi> than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have for
a continued War with the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis plain (as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves say) they have car<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ried
on the War in <hi>Africk,</hi> these Eighty Years past, without
Fighting, and a Commerce these Hundred Years, without Tra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ding.
The <hi>Moors</hi> have indeed besieged <hi>Ceuta</hi> (after their way)
for above Forty Years; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> say, that by the
Commissary's Account of Ammunition, the Garrison of <hi>Ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diz</hi>
have spent more Powder at the Puntals there in Salutes,
than the Garrison of <hi>Ceuta</hi> have spent in Defending themselves,
during all the Siege; the late particular Expedition of the Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quis
<hi>de Lede</hi> excepted, which was but short.</p>
            <p>This Resolution of <hi>Spain,</hi> never to enter into any Treaty
with the <hi>Moors,</hi> has been derived from one or both of these
two following simple Causes: 1. A religious, rigid Separation,
and fiery Zeal against <hi>Paganism,</hi> and against <hi>Mahomet</hi>; re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>solving
that the true Catholick Church should have no Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce,
no Peace, no Communication with the Enemies of
<hi>Christ</hi>; the same futious Zeal which they have likewise car<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ried
on against the <hi>Jews.</hi> Or, 2. and which I take to be the
truer and more rational Account of it, A haughty Insolence,
founded on the cruel Animosity of that War, which for so
<pb n="16" facs="20"/>
many Years was carried on against the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> 'till
their utter Extirpation; in which War they gave no Quarter,
took no Prisoners, not would admit even the Remains of
those People (tho' willing to become their Subjects) so much
as to live among them.</p>
            <p>Unhappy Pride! How many Nations, as well as private
People, has it struck blind, and cover'd their Eyes from their
own Felicities? The <hi>Spaniards</hi> could carry on no Trade in
the World more to their own Advantage, than that with the
<hi>Moors of Africa,</hi> and yet they won't trade with them, either
from a Civil Pride, that they will only make Slaves of them,
or from a Religious Pride, that they will not converse with
Infidels.</p>
            <p>Trade knows no Religions, no Sects, no Parties, no Divi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions.
We may ('tis hoped) be as zealous to hate God's Ene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mies,
as the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; and yet we trade with the <hi>Turks,</hi>
               <hi>Jews, Mahometans, Moors,</hi> or Pagan <hi>Negroes</hi>; and deal with
the Idolaters of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Malabar,</hi> as well as with the Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive
Savages and <hi>Cannibals</hi> of <hi>Virginia</hi> and the <hi>Carribees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There's no Idolatry in Commerce; if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject
the gainful Trade of <hi>Africa,</hi> on Pretence of Sanctity and
Religion, Is that a Religious Separation? I say, No: 'Tis not
because they are Wiser or Better, but because they are <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
that is to say, eaten up with Pride, Self-Opinion and Haughti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness.</p>
            <p>That
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might trade with the <hi>Moors</hi> to great
Advantage, is evident, in that the little Trade they have to
<hi>Africa</hi> (and which they may be said to have with the Place,
not with the People) is very much to their Gain, and would
be much more so, if they extended it as they might do. But
they trade with the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Merchants residing in
<hi>Africa,</hi> not with the <hi>Moors</hi>; and rather buy the Goods they
demand there, at second and third Hand, than take them di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rectly
of the <hi>Moors</hi>; so they give away their Profit of the
Trade to the <hi>European</hi> Nations, to gratify the Aversion they
have to the People.</p>
            <p>It is an undoubted Maxim in Trade, <hi>That we ought to Trade
with every Nation, and with every People that we can get Mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney
by.</hi> This the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are so far from pursuing, that they
will not deal with the <hi>Moors,</hi> even for the Things which in
Commerce they may be said to be in Distress for, only because
they won't deal with them.</p>
            <p>In the utmost Distress which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are sometimes
in for want of Corn, how do they chuse to send to <hi>Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land,</hi>
to <hi>Holland,</hi> to the <hi>Levant,</hi> or indeed any where for Corn,
<pb n="17" facs="21"/>
rather than to <hi>Africa,</hi> rather than deal with the <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
tho' the <hi>Barbary</hi> Coast sometimes has a great Plenty, and
tho' they give two Dollars <hi>per</hi> Bushel for the Corn, which
they could buy there for <hi>3s.</hi> or thereabouts, and sometimes
for much less.</p>
            <p>In their rejecting now the Manufactures of <hi>Europe,</hi> how
easy would it be to supply themselves with a Quantity of
Wool from <hi>Barbary,</hi> which, with a small Application, would
mix and work up with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Wool, and make all the
several Manufactures of <hi>England</hi> to Perfection, and to the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>finite
Advantage of <hi>Spain</hi> it self: But, forsooth, they must
not Buy or Sell with the <hi>Mahometans</hi> and Enemies of Christ;
tho' Himself gave them a quite different Example, accepting
of a Draught of cold Water from the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> with whom
the <hi>Jews</hi> (<hi>Spaniard-like</hi>) had no Dealings.</p>
            <p>But (contrary to the Beneficent, Humble, and Gracious Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ample
of Christ himself) the proud <hi>Spaniards</hi> (pretending Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ligion)
throw away their Commerce, scorn the Blessings of
an advantageous Trade, and rather maintain a constant unre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>conciled
National Feud, a foolish, faint, and unactive War;
refusing to trade with the <hi>Moors,</hi> and carrying on neither
Peace or War.</p>
            <p>As this Case stands with <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Barbary</hi> Shore, the
Former is infinitely to blame, and may be said to act ridiculously,
because, as above (speaking in the Language of Merchants) e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very
Body should be Traded with that you can gain by. No
Nation willingly interrupt their own Commerce, or refuse to
let their Subjects trade with such other Nations as they can
gain by. For a Trading Nation to Prohibit the Importation
of such Goods as they want, is like Prohibiting the bringing in
Corn in a Famine, or Prohibiting Arms and Ammunition
in a War. When the War was hottest between <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King prohibited almost all the rest of
our <hi>English</hi> Goods, forbidding, upon the severest Penalties,
the bringing any of those Goods into any Part of his Domi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nions,
it was observable however that they always excepted
<hi>Wool, Leather,</hi> and <hi>Lead</hi>; these were never Prohibited; the
Reason was plain, they had none, or but very little of their
own, and very much wanted them all; nor could they be sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plyed
(at least not sufficiently) from any other Place.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Spaniards</hi> act by none of these Prudentials, for
they refuse to Trade with the <hi>Moors,</hi> or Merchants of <hi>Africa,</hi>
though they might gain very considerably by it. The <hi>Africans</hi>
have Corn, Copper, Wax, Wool, all which the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
extremely want, and yet will not buy, because (forsooth) they
<pb n="18" facs="22"/>
don't like the <hi>Moors</hi> worshipping <hi>Mahomet</hi>; as if Religion
had any thing to do with Commerce, and as if the Bread
made of <hi>African</hi> Corn, would infect their People with Ido<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>latry.</p>
            <p>Now
I alledge, and insist upon it, That in a constant
State of War between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the Case would
be quite otherwise, for here would be War without Prohibi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion;
as in their Management with the <hi>Moors,</hi> they have Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hibition
without War. I explain my self thus:</p>
            <p>As we Trade with <hi>Spain,</hi> the State of Things lies so much
to the Advantage of <hi>Spain,</hi> that tho' the most violent War
that it is possible to imagine was to be carried on between
the Nations, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (that is to say, the Merchants)
would endeavour with the utmost Art to carry on the
Trade, notwithstanding the strictest Prohibitions: The Reason
is plain;</p>
            <p>They would Trade, because they gain by the Trade; the
Trade to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> takes off the Growth and Produce,
which they are ruin'd if they do not Sell, and supplies them
with Necessaries which they are ruin'd if they cannot Buy:
In a word, they have no Commerce without us; their whole
Export is stagnated; their Fruits (their Wines, and their Oyl)
would rot upon the Trees, and not be worth gathering; their
Lands lye uncultivated, and no Hands be employ'd; the Poor
would starve, and the Rich be beggar'd and undone: In short,
we buy nothing of <hi>Spain,</hi> but what we can very well be with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out,
and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> take nothing of us, but what they ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tremely
want.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, take the Alternative in the Commerce;
what the <hi>English</hi> buy in <hi>Spain,</hi> as it is the Growth and Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duce
of the Country, 'tis essential to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to have
those Goods taken off their Hands, and by the <hi>English</hi> too in
particular; the Reason is, because if the <hi>English</hi> do not take
them off, no other Nation can do it. <hi>For Example</hi>:</p>
            <p>The Growth and Product of <hi>Spain</hi> consists (so far as it re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gards
Trade) of Wines, that is to say, <hi>Sherry, Alicant, Tent,</hi>
               <hi>Mountain-Malaga</hi>; <hi>Galitia</hi> and <hi>Viana</hi> Reds; <hi>Barcelona</hi> and
<hi>Bene Carlo</hi> Reds, and <hi>Canary</hi> Whites; <hi>Barcelonian</hi> Brandy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
also Fruits, such as <hi>Malaga</hi> and <hi>Alicant</hi> Raisins, Oranges,
Limons, Almonds: besides <hi>Spanish</hi> Wool, <hi>Spanish</hi> Iron, and
lastly, Oil and Soap.</p>
            <p>These Things being the Growth of <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> buy
in very great Quantities; if they are not bought off, <hi>Spain,</hi> as
to the Trade of it, is ruin'd and undone: whereas if <hi>England</hi>
bought none of those Goods from <hi>Spain,</hi> they could either
<pb n="19" facs="23"/>
do without them (for neither Wine, or Brandy, or Raisins,
or Oranges, or Lemons, are so necessary to Life, or to Trade,
as that we cannot, as to the most of them, live without them)
or as to Trade, have them somewhere else.</p>
            <p>So that upon the whole, there is no absolute Necessity on
our Side, to have the Growth of <hi>Spain</hi>; but there is a Necessi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty
on the Side of <hi>Spain</hi> to be Traded with, so as to have their
Goods taken off.</p>
            <p>It is true, the taking off the <hi>British</hi> Manufacture by the <hi>Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niards,</hi>
is very much the Advantage of <hi>Great Britain</hi>; but all
that is Advantageous is not Necessary: We are able to sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sist
in Trade, without the Profits of our Manufactures, bet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter
than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are able to subsist in Life, without the
Use of them. Nor is that all; for let the King of <hi>Spain</hi> pass
what Negatives and Prohibitions he pleases, the Necessity of
those Manufactures will make their own Way, and the Peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple
must wear them, or wear nothing at all, for they have no
equivalent Manufacture to place in the room of them; and if
they have them not from <hi>England,</hi> they will have them from
<hi>Portugal,</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> or from other Places, as has been the
Case in all the Wars which have happened between <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Spain,</hi> in which Commerce has been Prohibited.</p>
            <p>But the Weight does not lye in this Part. The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
may Prohibit Trade with <hi>England</hi> when they please, they will
punish themselves infinitely more than <hi>England.</hi> But take the
Trade of <hi>America</hi> into the Consideration, and truly there let
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have a Care what they do: Let them take heed,
lest instead of Prohibiting their People Trading with us, that
is, with <hi>England</hi>; I say, let them take heed that we (<hi>England</hi>)
do not Prohibit their Trade with one another, and among
themselves.</p>
            <p>By Prohibiting the Trade among themselves, and with one
another, I mean (for it requires Explanation) that it is in the
Power of <hi>England</hi> (in consequence of this War, and by the
Means of it) entirely to Interrupt, nay, to Stop the Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce
between <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Old Spain</hi>: And thus I am come
to my Text, namely, to enquire into what the Allies may gain by
this War: How it may be carried on by the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Bri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tish</hi>
Nation, in such a Manner, as that Old <hi>Spain</hi> should ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver
more have any Commerce with <hi>America</hi>; that is to say, not
<hi>Exclusively,</hi> that they should no more call it their own Trade,
but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America</hi> shall be entirely set free, as to
Trade; shall be Independent of Old <hi>Spain</hi>; receive no Laws
or Limitations from them; but be at full Liberty to Trade
with all the World, if they please; or if we please, rather;
<pb n="20" facs="24"/>
for it would be meet to insist upon some Limitation on our
Side too.</p>
            <p>Nor do I concern the Civil Government of <hi>New Spain,</hi> in
any Part of this Provision; <hi>England</hi> (or <hi>Great-Britain</hi>) seeks
no Conquests; all they covet is to establish Peace, and extend
Trade, and this we seem to have fairly before us in the ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proaching
War. If the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cannot see the Fate that at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tends
them in it (as it seems to me they do not) they must go
on, and venture the Consequences; the thing is plain to me,
they run the Hazard of losing all the Sovereignty of their
Trade in <hi>America,</hi> by a War.</p>
            <p>They may keep the Sovereignty of the Country, if they
please, or if they can; that is, if the Natives will submit to it:
but they would soon have no Commerce to it, no Communi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cation
with it, other than in common with the rest of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, I say, <hi>England</hi> will have it in their Power to limit
and restrain; that is, it shall be in the Power of <hi>England</hi> to
take off all the Restraints and Limitations of Trade, which
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have imposed, and do now impose upon the <hi>A<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mericans,</hi>
and upon their own People there, and lay the Trade
open to the whole World; holding the Hands of the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Government so, that they should have no Power to impose a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny
Terms of Commerce upon them in <hi>America,</hi> any more.</p>
            <p>This is explaining my self fully, as to the General Head of
Commerce; and as that Commerce is now Stated by the <hi>Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nish</hi>
Government, between their Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> and
Old <hi>Spain,</hi> or indeed all the rest of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is observable, that the State of the Trade between Old
and New <hi>Spain,</hi> stands thus: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> having Planted
<hi>Mexico,</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> and all the vast Country between, in the
Nature of a Colony; conquered, or extirpated the Natives,
and taken Possession of the Country as their own; in con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sequence
of this Right, they give Laws of Commerce to
the Inhabitants, as well Natives, as <hi>Spaniards</hi> settled there;
these Laws (like our Act of Navigation) are made up briefly
thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Spanish</hi> Colonies in <hi>America</hi> should drive
no Trade, or in any manner Correspond or Negotiate with
any Nation of <hi>Europe,</hi> Directly, or Indirectly, but by the
Licentiate, or Allowance of the <hi>Consulade</hi> at <hi>Seville,</hi> that is
to say, the Chamber of the <hi>Contractration</hi> at <hi>Seville,</hi> and by
their Order; and in such <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships, and no other, as shall
be Licensed in the same <hi>Consulade,</hi> or Council of Trade:
which, by the way, is call'd a Royal <hi>Council of Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce,</hi>
and so it is the License of the King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="25"/>
This <hi>Council of Commerce</hi> not only limits what Ships
shall go out, but the Persons who shall be allowed to go over
in those Ships, and all the Cargoes or Quantities of Goods
that they shall carry with them, and the Returns made for them;
which are all Registred in their Books: They have also other
particular Powers and Limitations, which the <hi>Spanish</hi> Trade
is bound to submit to; but I am now upon Generals only, I shall
come farther into the Particulars presently.</p>
            <p>As <hi>America</hi> is to Old <hi>Spain</hi> what we properly call a con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quer'd
Country, so they (even the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that are settled
there) are Govern'd in an Arbitrary Way, as a conquered
Nation, and that notwithstanding their being Subjects of
Old <hi>Spain.</hi> Under the weight of this Arbitrary Government,
they submit to this among the rest, That no Ships are allowed
to come into any of their Ports from any Place in the World,
except from Old <hi>Spain,</hi> or by <hi>Assiento</hi> from Old <hi>Spain,</hi> as a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bove,
or some Place or other limited in the first Establishment
of Old <hi>Spain</hi>; that is to say, from <hi>Guinea,</hi> or any Part of the
Coast of <hi>Africa,</hi> they may come loaden by the said <hi>Assien<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to</hi>
with <hi>Negroes,</hi> and with them only.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Canary</hi> Islands they may go so far as the <hi>Havana,</hi>
carrying no other Goods but Wines and Pipe-staves, the
Growth of that Island; and even of that, the Quantity is li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mited,
as well as the Ships.</p>
            <p>Thus the whole <hi>Spanish</hi> Interest is brought under one Head
of Universal Commerce, and is call'd the Trade of New
<hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>America</hi>; and is strictly confined, limited, and re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>strained
to Old <hi>Spain</hi> in particular, as is mentioned above;
and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in Old <hi>Spain,</hi>
or New <hi>Spain,</hi> have no Commerce, or Liberty of Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce
one with another, but by the License of their Govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Now
there remains a Question or two fit for the Govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
of Old <hi>Spain</hi> to answer, rather than an <hi>English</hi> Author;
but which if they cannot answer to their own Satisfaction, it
will be yet harder for them to answer another Grand Que<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stion
which follows it. The first Questions are,<list>
                  <item>1. Are the People of New <hi>Spain</hi> (whether Natives, that is
<hi>Indians,</hi> or natural <hi>Spaniards</hi>) compleatly easy and satisfied
with those Limitations? And would they not shake them off
if it lay in their Power?</item>
                  <item>2. Are the Government and People of Old <hi>Spain</hi> able to
keep fast those Bolts and Bars by which the Trade is limited,
and prevent the People of New <hi>Spain</hi> trading with the <hi>Eu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ropeans,</hi>
in case of a War?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="26"/>
Then the Grand Question follows, <hi>viz.</hi> How are the <hi>Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niards</hi>
sure, that if the Inhabitants of <hi>America</hi> shall at any
time come into a free Trade with <hi>Europe,</hi> by the Means of a
War, they will ever be brought to quit that Commerce again,
having tasted the Sweets of it, especially if they in Old <hi>Spain</hi>
cannot force them to it?</p>
            <p>These Questions, rightly inquir'd into, will let the <hi>Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niards</hi>
see (if their Eyes are not closed) upon what preca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rious
Terms and Conditions their Tenure of the <hi>American</hi>
Trade stands, and how soon they may irrecoverably lose it,
if they put the Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> upon a Necessity of Hum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bling
their Insolence by a War. I shall speak more particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larly
to it in its Place.</p>

            <head type="sub">The State of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Trade in <hi>America.</hi> How tho'

            <p>IN almost all the Treaties which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have made
with the rest of the Powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> whether Treaties
of Peace, or of Commerce, they have always (from a Sense

Guarrantee their <hi>American</hi> Commerce, by Negative Clauses;

of this Article; 'tis enough that it is particularly Stipulated in
<pb n="23" facs="27"/>
the several Treaties between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and confirm'd
by subsequent Treaties since that of 1670: Which I men<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
here, not to enquire how well those Treaties have been
observ'd, either on one Side or other; (tho' it may not be im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proper
to speak of that also in its Place) but I mention it here,
I say, to let it be seen how sensible <hi>Spain</hi> has always been of
its own Weakness and Inability to preserve that Commerce,
notwithstanding all the Right they may claim to it, without the
voluntary Consent of the <hi>European</hi> Powers stipulating to yield
and give it up, as above.</p>
            <p>It is not thus with our Possessions in <hi>America</hi>; the <hi>English,</hi>
and even the <hi>French</hi> also, have indeed the same exclusive
Right to the sole Trade of their own Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> as
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> claim to these of New <hi>Spain</hi>; and they have
Laws likewise respectively enacted, such as the Act of Navi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gation
in particular, binding their Subjects to such particular
Restraints and Limitations of Commerce, as are proper to
secure the Property and Sovereignty of those Trades to the
respective Powers whose Subjects they are.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> secure in their own Strength,
and always believing themselves able to support and defend
their own Right, have trusted to that Strength for their
Defence; not at all seeking the Guarantee or Protection of
any other Powers, for the Security of their Trade.</p>
            <p>The first Inference I draw from these Premises, is, that a
War breaking out, supposing that Part to be certain, and es<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pecially
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> becoming Aggressors, and beginning that
War, the Powers with whom such a War is begun are then
evidently discharg'd from all the former Obligations of
those Treaties; their Subjects become from that Moment free
from all the stipulated Engagements and Restraints relating to
that Trade; our Ships may then as freely trade to the Ports of
New <hi>Spain,</hi> as they may to any other Part of the World:
I mean freely, with respect to any Restraint to be laid upon
them from their own Respective Sovereigns; as to the <hi>Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niards,</hi>
they must do as well as they can; if their Ships of
War attack our Merchants, that's allowed to be but fair, and
we must bear it as well as we can; but if their People will
come off to our Ships or Sloops, and buy or sell, that can
be no Breach on our Side; for the War is begun already, and
all Obligations to limit that Commerce ceases.</p>
            <p>The Argument is Short, and to the Purpose; the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
may indeed punish their own <hi>American</hi> Subjects as they please,
and treat them as Traytors for entring into this Commerce,
as it is contraband and prohibited by their own Laws, which
Laws are binding to their own Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="28"/>
But the Allies are, by vertue of the War mutually declar'd
against <hi>Spain,</hi> and by <hi>Spain</hi> against them, effectually, and <hi>ipso
Facto,</hi> discharg'd from all Limitations of former Treaties for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bidding
this Commerce: And I take the more Notice of it, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause
'tis to be hoped the said Allies, especially the Powers
of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and the <hi>States-General,</hi> will consider very
well of it, at any subsequent Treaty, before they consent again
to limit their own Subjects from a Commerce, which is so
many ways advantageous to them.</p>
            <p>What Reason have trading Nations to tye themselves down
to the arbitrary Laws of Commerce, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
may think fit tyrannically to impose upon their own People?
'Tis enough that they refuse to admit any of the Protestant
Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> so much as to set foot among them,
much less to trade and live among them; a Liberty which we
no where deny to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> I say, 'tis enough to be thus
excluded from residing among them; but if their own People,
<hi>at whatever Hazard,</hi> are content to trade with us, I cannot
see why we should pay so much Veneration to their Govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,
and their Arbitrary Laws, as to tye down the Mer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chants
from a fair Correspondence and Commerce together.</p>
            <p>Let Trade take its Course; let Exchange of Goods and
Money take its due Course, and be uninterrupted on all Sides;
let the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Ally'd Powers come to a good Un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derstanding,
as soon as our Government pleases; let them
fight and agree as his Majesty thinks fit; let the Merchants be
at Liberty to extend the <hi>British</hi> Commerce with their utmost
Skill; this need be no Interruption to a Peace; for what has
the peaceable Merchant to do with War and Government?</p>
            <p>It is a strange fit of religious Strictness, which the <hi>Spani<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ards</hi>
think good to practise by the Power of their <hi>right bloody</hi>
Inquisition; (<hi>viz.</hi>) that they will suffer no Strangers whatso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever,
unless <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, so much as to set a foot in
New <hi>Spain,</hi> much less to live among them; and if any <hi>En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>glishman</hi>
or <hi>Dutchman</hi> attempt to live among them, if they
are discover'd, they are condemned to the Mines, and must
go to work at <hi>Potest</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, so cruel are they, and so unmerciful, that if an <hi>Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lish</hi>
Ship should come upon their Coast, in the greatest Di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stress;
whether in Distress by Storm, and so wanting perhaps
Masts or Sails, Anchors or Cable, or Carpenters; or in Di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stress
for Provisions, and are wanting Fresh-water, Bread, and
other Provisions; in none of these Extremities will they (as
I have been inform'd) give them Relief, tho' they are by ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>press
Treaties oblig'd to do it: A Piece of Inhumanity, which
<pb n="25" facs="29"/>
I do not find the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Pagans</hi> are arriv'd to, in any of
the known Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>But these Catholick Christians on the other hand, will,
even in these Cases of Distress, which all other Christian
Nations consider, use all possible Stratagems to get the Ship
into their Hands; in which case the Cargo and Ship is consis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cated,
and the poor Men, tho' no way offending, are perhaps made
Slaves, and sent to the Mines without Redemption. Which, by
the way, (not to say any thing of the particular Cruelty
with which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> treat their Slaves, and which few
of them are able to survive many Years) is a degree beyond
what is practis'd, either at <hi>Algier</hi> or <hi>Salle, Tunis</hi> or <hi>Tripoli,</hi>
or by any the <hi>Moors</hi> of the <hi>Barbary</hi> Coast.</p>
            <p>I need go no farther for the Proof of these Things, than
the Authentick Relations of those of our own Country, who have
been upon the Spot, and who have partly suffered under
those Barbarities, and partly been Eye-witnesses to the Suffer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings
of others, and to the particular Method by which the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> render themselves so odious to the rest of the
Christian World for Cruelty and Injustice.</p>
            <p>That no Nation but the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> at least no Christian or
<hi>Mohometan</hi> Nation that I have read of, do this but the <hi>Spani<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ards,</hi>
I think I may appeal for the Proof of, to the general
Practice of the <hi>English, Dutch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> in like Cases, and
in the same Country.</p>
            <p>It is true, that neither of these Nations permit any other
Nations to trade in their respective Colonies: Reasons
of Trade, the Interests of Nations, and the Property of Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce
demands it, that it should be so; that the Trade of the
particular Colony may be reserv'd carefully, separately and
distinctly, to the Use and Benefit of the respective Nation to
which it of Right belongs.</p>
            <p>But in any of the said Colonies, if a Ship belonging to
another Nation is manifestly driven into the Port or Har<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bour
by stress of Weather, or is in Distress for Fresh-water,
or Provisions, the Government will allow them Shelter, and
will allow them to take Fresh-water, and purchase Provisions
for their Voyage; and this notwithstanding the strictest Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hibitions
of Commerece: according to the express Scripture-Law;
<hi>If thine Enemy be hungry give him Bread to eat, and
if he be thirsty give him Water to drink.</hi> Prov. xxv. 21. For
all Ships of another Nation are, in the Language of Trade,
and in the Sense of those Laws of Navigation, <hi>a kind of
Enemy</hi>; as to Commerce, I mean, tho' otherwise in full Amity;
and even if they were in Confederacy it would be the same.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="30"/>
It is true, if the Ship so distress'd shall transgress the Law,
and break in upon the Hospitality which they meet with,
and shall clandestinely and privately offer to trade with the
Inhabitants, shall <hi>break Bulk</hi> as they call it, and sell any Part
of her Cargo, other than shall be allow'd by the Government
of the Place, for the Payment of such Provisions as they
are allow'd to buy, in such case they are liable to be stopp'd,
feiz'd upon, and the whole Ship and Goods confiscated; and
this is no Wrong done to them, because they are the Offen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders,
and know before-hand the Consequence of such a
Trespass, if it was discover'd.</p>
            <p>Yet even in this Case, tho' the Ship and Goods are con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fiscated,
yet the poor Men are not made Slaves; on the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trary,
they are let go, and may shift for themselves; and are
oftentimes reliev'd and treated with Humanity; as may be
prov'd by very many Examples, even upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
themselves.</p>
            <p>Again: If a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or a Boat full of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> should
come to any of the <hi>English</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Colonies, and land
there, <hi>so be it,</hi> that they offer to bring no Goods to land
there, against the Constitution of the Commerce mention'd a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bove,
they are admitted to come on Shore, may land, and go
freely up and down, take themselves a Lodging, may trade as
Merchants, or dwell as Strangers; submitting only to all
the particular Laws of Commerce, which other People sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mit
to; nor will they meet with any Molestation or Obstru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ction;
while, on the contrary, the bare coming on Shore a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mong
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in any of their <hi>American</hi> Colonies, is
Death, or perpetual Slavery, which, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> order
it, is worse than Death: For, without injuring the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
as they are but indifferent Servants, when Servitude is their
Lot; so they are the worst Masters in the World, at least
among either Christians or <hi>Turks,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then being the State of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Colonies, and of
the Commerce, and it being (as is said) conceded to by the
<hi>European</hi> Nations, by sundry Treaties of Peace and Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce;
hence it follows, that if any of the Subjects of the
said <hi>European</hi> Nations, tempted by the extraordinary Gain of
a private Commerce with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> do either lie <hi>off</hi> and
<hi>on</hi> (as they call it) upon the Coast, with Sloops and Ships,
and so trade in the Night with the <hi>Spanish Perioguas</hi> and <hi>Ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>noes</hi>
which come off to them; as the <hi>English</hi> of <hi>Jamaica</hi> and
the <hi>Dutch</hi> of <hi>Curacao</hi> frequently do; or do land in the Bay
of <hi>Campeache,</hi> and cut Log-wood, as the <hi>English</hi> from <hi>Jamaica</hi>
and <hi>New-England</hi> have always done; or trade by Force up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
<pb n="27" facs="31"/>
the Coast of <hi>Chili</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> have done since
their late License during the Time of War;</p>
            <p>If, I say, in these Cases, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> happen to fall upon
them, and take them, burn or sink their Ships, and use the
Men after their usual <hi>Spanish</hi> Severity, tho' it be too inhu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mane
even to mention, yet the several Nations to which they
belong do not usually make this any Matter of Complaint, or
reclaim the Ships or Men as if injuriously taken, the Trade it
self being contraband; an Example of which we have lately
had in some <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships taken on the Coast of <hi>Chartagena</hi> and
<hi>Saint Martha,</hi> or thereabouts, by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Cruizers, who
they call <hi>Garde de Costa's,</hi> or Guardships,</p>
            <p>Not but that those <hi>Carde de Costa's,</hi> as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call them,
commit several Depredations and almost Pyracies in taking
Ships, which are not Traders or trading; and this the <hi>English</hi>
complain of at this Time, and that I believe with good Cause.
But that by the way.</p>
            <p>In General, it is true, that this Right of an exclusive Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce,
as it was at first assum'd by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as a Proper<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty,
so it is conceded to them by the Assent of their Neighbour
Nations, and agreed to by Treaty; the very obtaining of which
Treaty is a tacit Acknowledgment that they are not able to
maintain the exclusive Commerce by their own Power; nor
able either to restrain their own People, or keep the Ships of o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
Nations from their Coast; and this is the Reason of
my entring thus far into the Case of the Limitations of the
Commerce, which otherwise would not be to the purpose, in
the Case before me.</p>
            <p>But to bring it down directly to the Case in hand. With a War,
(in which War, as it is evident, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves are Ag<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gressors)
all these Limitations and Reserves of Commerce
cease at once; the Trade is laid open, and it is fair working
not only to break in upon their Trade by all such Methods as
we find practicable, but to make such Gaps and Openings in
it, as it shall never be in the Power of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to
close and make up again, no not by a Treaty of Peace.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> (who, in Breach of those very Trea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties,
by which their exclusive Trade was conceded to them,
have unjustly attempted to open the Trade to a Nation ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>presly
shut out,) may find themselves left naked of the just
Defence which those former Treaties always were to them,
and so may never be able to recover the exclusive Commerce of
the <hi>Spanish West-Indies,</hi> which has been of such infinite Advan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tage
to their whole Nation, or to call the Trade their Own
any more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="32"/>
Nor would it be any Injustice to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> especially
as (I say) they are the Aggressors in this War; for if during
the past Ages those <hi>European</hi> Nations, now ally'd against <hi>Spain,</hi>
were less opulent and less powerful in Trade, and which is above
all the rest, were less united in Interests (trading Interests I
mean) than they may be now; and were perhaps willing to
keep Measures with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which might in some
things be to their Disadvantage, rather than to let them be
laid too low, or perhaps rather than another shou'd reap the sepa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rate
Advantage of it, as was the Case in the late War, when
<hi>France</hi> obtain'd an Admission into the Trade to the <hi>Spanish Ame<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rica</hi>:
I say, tho' in those Times these Concessions might be
made to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and their Pretensions to an exclusive
Trade were so far confirm'd, it may not be always so.</p>
            <p>If this has been the Case, it was the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Business to have
preserved the Advantages which that divided Situation of the
Affairs and Interests of <hi>Europe</hi> gave them, and to have culti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vated
that Friendship which alone was the Safety of their Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce;
and not by such precipitate Councils as these to open
the Door of that Commerce to a People no way in condition
to carry it on, or to protect the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in it, and pretend
(I might say, foolishly pretend) to shut those out who are able to
let themselves in, and even to dispossess <hi>Spain</hi> it self, not of
the Trade only, but of the very Country too, whenever they
please.</p>
            <p>These are the Advantages which I mean, when I speak of
the Probable Consequences of this War; and this is that which
I call going to the Bottom of things. A full Enquiry into
which will open the Eyes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and let us see farther per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps
than ever before, whether I have wrong'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
in saying they know not what they are doing; that their
Measures are absurd and ridiculous: in a Word, if I had said
they were mad, (that is to say their Ministers and Managers,
whoever they are; I say, if I had concluded them mad, or
next door to it;) it had been, in my Opinion, the kindest thing
I could have said of them.</p>
            <p>To have said, they had taken these Steps with their Eyes
open, with their Reason in its full Exercise, with their Poli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticks
free from Distraction, must have been to have sug<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gested
worse things of them than I am willing to charge
them with, and to have intimated, that they were a Set of
Men in a Plot or Conspiracy to betray their Master, and ruin
their Country.</p>
            <p>But be it which of the two you please, it seems to me that
<hi>Spain</hi> may have an Occasion to look back with some Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proach
<pb n="29" facs="33"/>
upon its late Politicks, in Leaguing with a Prince so
very lately their Enemy, and so ill able to be their Friend; a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gainst
two Powers, <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> so very able
to ruin them, and which should have been the two last Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
in the World that <hi>Spain</hi> ought to have differ'd with;
and out of which Quarrel they will not find it so easy to de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liver
themselves, as perhaps they imagine; that is to say, with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out
deep Wounds in their Constitution, especially as to
Trade. And this is what I meant, when I said, as the Clerks
(<hi>Culprit</hi>) do to the Prisoner, who they know will be cast up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
his Tryal, <hi>God send you a good Deliverance</hi>; intimating at
the same time, that 'tis not at all likely.</p>

Contrary to the meaner Principles upon which Princes too

            </q>
            <p>This seems then to be the State of the approaching War.
<hi>Great-Britain</hi> acts the Part of the World's Protector. The King,
linking the Nations in a strong Confederacy, opposes the aggres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sing
Disturbers with such an early and superior Hand, that they
find themselves disabled in the very Infancy of their Undertaking.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> (obstinate and opiniatre) beginning at
the wrong End of their Work, break out into a War,
with so little Prospect of Success, that the World looks on
with Surprize, to see them act so as their Friends can have
no Hope, and their Enemies no Fear, from the Event of the
Undertaking.</p>
            <p>A Town impregnable, even by its Situation, and made
more so by the Addition of terrible Fortifications; open to
the Sea, and their Enemies Masters of the Bay, able to relieve
it as often as they please: What strange, unaccountable Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ginnings
are these: <hi>Spain</hi> ought to remember their Ancestors
ill Conduct at the Siege of <hi>Ostend,</hi> which on the single
Article of its being easily reliev'd by Sea, <hi>held out a Siege</hi> of
<pb n="31" facs="35"/>
three Years and four Months, and cost the <hi>Spaniards</hi> 66000
Men to conquer; whereas being not to be reliev'd by Sea,
the late Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi> took it in twelve Days.</p>
            <p>This Town, with all the Advantages of Situation and For<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tification,
has in it a numerous Garrison of old Veteran Sol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diers,
commanded by experienc'd Officers, furnished with all
things needful for a vigorous Defence, and covered with a
strong Squadron of twelve large capital Men of War, such as
no twenty Ships that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> may get together will
dare to engage.</p>
            <p>To attack this Place, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> whole Infantry are a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bout
20000 at the most, who (if I may speak without boast<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing)
are no more able to attack the Town, to any pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose,
than twenty Men would be to take the Tower of
<hi>London.</hi>

            <p>If the King of <hi>Spain</hi> fails in this Enterprize, 'tis very likely
he ruins the Infantry who are before it; and tho' his Kingdoms
are indeed very large, yet we all know, that it is not the ea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>siest
thing in the World to raise a new Army in <hi>Spain</hi>; 'tis
not like <hi>Germany,</hi> which (as one says, travelling thro' it) is
an inexhaustible Store-house for Men, and those Men all
born Soldiers.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Spain</hi> it is quite a different Case: not but that the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> are very good Troops, when well paid, well
cloath'd, disciplin'd, and led abroad from Home; but <hi>Spain</hi> is
more fruitful of any thing than Men: there are so many go a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>broad,
and so very few stay at home; so many turn Priests,
and must not fight; are poor, dejected, and cannot fight;
or are <hi>Lazy Dons</hi> among the Gentry, and will not fight, that
it is the hardest thing in the World to raise an Army in <hi>Spain,</hi>
at least with Expedition.</p>
            <p>Thus stands their Affair at home, and in this unhappy Po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sture
they are beginning the War; a Posture that I think they
are the first People that ever began a War in before.</p>
            <p>As soon as they strike a Stroke at <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> they ought to
expect all the Allies to declare against, and fall upon them;
<hi>France</hi> in the first Place, we may suppose will be expected
upon their Frontiers with two Armies, one in <hi>Navarr,</hi> and
the other in <hi>Rousillion</hi>; and in that Figure we shall soon see
how they will go on.</p>
            <p>Let us now take a View of the Situation of their Affairs
as to Trade, and particularly as to that Part of their Commerce
of which I have spoken so much, <hi>viz.</hi> the Trade of New
<hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="36"/>
While the <hi>British</hi> Squadron remains on the Coasts of <hi>A<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merica,</hi>
suppose in the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> or upon the Coasts
of <hi>Porto-Belo</hi> and <hi>Carthagena,</hi> either the <hi>Spaniards</hi> must fight
that Fleet, or otherwise remove it, or there's an end put to
their Commerce on that Side, all at once.</p>
            <p>It is objected, that a <hi>British</hi> Squadron may indeed inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rupt
the Commerce in this or that particular Place, but that
this will not effectually ruin the <hi>Spanish</hi> Trade. The Coast of
<hi>America</hi> (as possess'd by the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) is a large Place, 'tis
extended in a vast Length, from the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> or the
North-most Part of the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and in the Lati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tude
of 24 to 25 Degrees to the Coast of <hi>Surinam,</hi> and even
to the Month of the Gulph of <hi>Paria,</hi> and the lsle of <hi>Trinida<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>do,</hi>
and farther, to the Latitude of five Degrees: So that
here is a Length of 1000 Miles, or thereabouts, in a Line
North and South, besides reckoning the Depth of the Bay,
and the Indentings of the Coast of <hi>Yacatan,</hi> the Bay of <hi>Cam<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>peachy,</hi>
the Gulph of <hi>Honduras, Darien,</hi> and others, which
make the Coast above 2500 Miles in Length; of all which I
shall speak again in the next Chapter.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, to give the Objection its utmost Stress,
they add, that the Heat of the Climate, the Unhealthiness of
the particular Places where the Station of such Ships must be,
and the want of Provisions, are such, as that no <hi>European</hi>
Fleet can bear to be constantly station'd in those Seas.</p>
            <p>That as well at <hi>La Vera Cruz,</hi> as at <hi>Porto-Belo,</hi> which
are the two Centres of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Commerce, the Air is so
unhealthy by reason of the excessive Heats, that even the <hi>Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niards</hi>
themselves cannot dwell there, and only come at the
particular times of Trade, when the Ships from Old <hi>Spain</hi> ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rive,
when they buy their Goods, deliver their Money, finish
their Dispatches and Letters to <hi>Europe,</hi> and return again, the
former to the great City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and the latter to <hi>Panama,</hi>
and thence to <hi>Lima,</hi> and the other Ports on the Coast of <hi>Pe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ru</hi>
and <hi>Chili</hi> in the <hi>South-Seas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this is evident at this time, for that the Galeons being
(as it were) besieged, or block'd up by the <hi>English</hi> Squadron,
their Men presently grow sickly, and dye a-pace; nor perhaps
are the Men in the Squadron it self quite free, tho' being bet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter
furnish'd with Provisions than the <hi>Spaniards, for the Coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try
yields little or nothing there-abouts</hi>; I say, the <hi>British</hi> Sai<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lors
being better furnished, and better taken care of, and bet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter
fed, the Men are by consequence better able to bear the
Inconvenience of the Season: yet the Place is allowed to be
such as admits no long Stay.</p>

That the <hi>Scots,</hi> in their Settlement at <hi>Darien,</hi> which is but
a little South from <hi>Porto-Belo,</hi> found by sad Experience,
that there was no bearing the Situation; tho' the <hi>Scots</hi> are as
hardy a People, and as able to bear the Extremities of Wea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther,
as most Nations in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am the more willing to give the utmost Length to these
seeming Objections, because when they shall be fully and un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>answerably
removed, they will leave the less to say by a Set
of People who deal in Misrepresentations and Discourage<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments,
as a particular Traffick of their own; and calculated
for a particular Cause, which wanting some Cordials, knows
not where to find or make any better.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Coast of <hi>America</hi> (as now possess'd by the
<hi>Spaniards</hi>) is exceeding large, as is described; and that the
great Gulph of <hi>Mexico</hi> is not to be block'd up by a Squadron
of Ships; the several Ports for Trade being so remote one
from another, and that in the whole the Coast may lie exten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ded
above 2000 Miles.</p>
            <p>It is likewise true, that the Ports of <hi>La Vera Cruz</hi> and <hi>Porto
Belo,</hi> which are at present the Centre of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce
in those Parts, are unhealthy dangerous Climates, the
Shores destitute of Provisions, the Heats excessive, airless, and
not refresh'd with Land Breezes, as in other Places; and that
even the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves are not able to bear the Extreams
of the intemperate Seasons, such as the Summer's Heat, and
the Winter's Rain, especially about <hi>Porto Belo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Mistake of all this lies in the Ignorance of those
that lay the Stress of this Cause, upon the posting an <hi>English</hi>
Navy or Squadron only for the Interrupting this Commerce;
whereas there is nothing more plain, than that the Ally'd
Powers are able at once, not only to Interrupt the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Commerce, but to put an entire End to it, and in a Word, break
off all settled Correspondence between the two Countries, I
mean of Old <hi>Spain</hi> and New <hi>Spain,</hi> and this without hazard<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
their Ships or Men to lye upon an unwholesome Coast,
and poison themselves with the stagnate Air of <hi>Darien</hi> or the
<hi>Bastimentos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not but that on this Occasion, the Galeons being in the
Port, it became necessary to post a Squadron, as Admiral <hi>Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sier</hi>
has been posted; to stagnate the Money, as well as give
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a Taste of the stagnate Vapours of the Place,
and to keep them where they were. If they are ill furnish'd
with Provisions, if the Country cannot supply them, if the
Stores in their Ships are not sufficient for them, they are at
home, they must take care of themselves; no doubt but by
<pb n="34" facs="39"/>
Land-Carriage, or by the great Lake of <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> which
runs eighty Leagues within the Land, and reaches within fif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>teen
Leagues of the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> they may be sufficiently fur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nished
with Provisions, at least may have some Relief in their
present Exigence; for it is very well known, that the Country
of <hi>Guatimala,</hi> bordering on that great Lake, is the most fruitful,
pleasant, and plentiful of any Part of <hi>Spanish America</hi>; or
else their own Accounts of it are very false, and they have
described it much more to their own Advantage, than they can
make out, when they find occasion to make use of it.</p>
            <p>But if it should be so, that they are distress'd, for Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>visions,
as I say above, <hi>they are at Home</hi>; they are under
no Restraints; they have no Enemies landed upon them; they
may send for Provisions where they are to be had, and may
send Expresses to the Governours of the several Countries to
supply them, and to find Means to convey them: Certainly
the Governours will not suffer the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Ships
to want Victualing, or suffer the poor Seamen to starve
upon their own Coasts, and (as may be said) at their own
Doors.</p>
            <p>But we are not speaking of an Advantage to <hi>Great Britain</hi>
only in this present depending Article of Blocking up the <hi>Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nish</hi>
Galeons, which is a thing of to-day, and, as we may say,
will be over to-morrow; is done to serve a particular Occa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion,
and will serve that Occasion most effectually; for we see
how ill able the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are to bear the Disappointment, and
what a Check it gives to their Enterprizes, how low their
Credit runs in <hi>Europe,</hi> and how even their Auxiliaries and
Confederates (as it were) stand still 'till they see from
what other Springs the promis'd Streams of Money will
flow.</p>
            <p>The Occasion therefore is abundantly served by the <hi>British</hi>
A'dmiral posting his Squadron at the Entrance of the Harbour
of <hi>Porto Belo,</hi> and hindering the Galeons from coming out,
spreading the Sea with his Cruisers, and interrupting their
Commerce; and in a Word, locking up their Money so, as
that tho' it be in their own Possession, it is yet out of their
Reach, and rendered (at least for the present) as useless to
them, as if it was in the Mines at <hi>Potost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho' it is far from being mention'd as any part of the Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantages
hinted at in my Title, and which are offer'd to the
Allies in the present War, any farther than it is an Accident
to the Beginning, and a particular Circumstance which falls
in to the Encouragement of our Friends, and the great Disap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pointment
of the Enemy; yet it must be acknowledged too,
<pb n="35" facs="40"/>
that it is a very great Advantage in its Kind; and it shows
the World, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with all the Funds of their
immense Treasure, which it may be said they are Masters of,
beyond all the Nations of <hi>Europe</hi>; yet are so unhappily situated,
that they must as it were be oblig'd to ask their Neighbours
leave to bring it home, and dare not venture abroad with it,
if but nine or ten Men of War appear upon their Coasts.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all this, and supposing this Expedition
of <hi>Porto-Belo</hi> were to be reckon'd as nothing in the present
Account of the Advantages of the War; it is manifest that
their whole <hi>West-India</hi> Commerce is in the Hands, and at the
Mercy of the Allies, in this War; that we are able to put an
End to it at once, if we think fit; and that not for the pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent
only, but for the time to come, whenever the Govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
thinks fit to enter into Measures for that Purpose.</p>
            <p>And not to pretend to lead our Leaders, or to direct them,
in whose Direction the whole Government is already
so wisely steer'd; I may venture to lay before you the Schemes
of former Times, and make some small Inferences from
them; which if our Governours please to make any Use of,
they may doubtless very much improve; and if they do not
think fit to make use of, they will, 'tis hoped, not be dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pleas'd
at any well-designing Subject (however injuriously
misrepresented) mentioning such things for their Service as
are apparently capable of answering the End if accepted, and
can be Hurtful to none if rejected.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be said, that it is a discovering the Weakness
of the Enemy to themselves, and putting them upon securing
themselves where they lie open, since the Enemy are far from
being ignorant of the Disadvantage they lie under; they are
not so insensible of the weak Part, and have been sensible of it
many Years ago, but find there is no Possibility of preventing
the Consequences, but by being Masters at Sea; which is an
Article that never was but once their Chance, and is never
likely to happen to them again; at least it will not in this War,
whatever it may do in After-times.</p>
            <p>If some things offer in <hi>this War,</hi> which have not offer'd be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore,
at least not to be so practicable in any former War;
and if wiser Heads than mine have not yet seen them, or
rather not look'd into them, so much as perhaps they may see
reason to do hereafter; I hope it will be no Offence to give
any Lights, however unworthy and ill-esteem'd the Person,
who so officiously offers them for the publick Service, and
however sinking under the Weight of unjust Calumny his
Opinion may be slighted, yet he may boldly say, his Reasons
<pb n="36" facs="41"/>
shall not be confuted, nor any Scheme he lays down be
justly objected against by the most envious, either on one Side or
other. As to their being made use of, or not made use of, that
is an Affair by it self, and which at present it becomes him to
say nothing about, unless it is made his Duty.</p>

the <hi>Spaniards</hi>: The Reasons and Occasion of the War
are known, History is full of them, and I have no room for

            <p>In that War, <hi>France</hi> was a Confederate <hi>as now,</hi> and their

In calling up this short piece of History, I desire my Rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders
to keep their Eyes strictly upon the exact Parallel of
Times and Circumstances, leaving the Persons quite out of
the Question, and to stand and fall as their Fate has long ago
directed; and let it be <hi>Oliver,</hi> or <hi>Oliver's Master,</hi> the‚Äîit
matters not here, as the great <hi>Andrew Marvel</hi> said of him.<q>
                  <l>Tho' his Government did a Tyrant resemble,</l>
                  <l>He made <hi>England</hi> Great, and her Enemies Tremble.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>His Measures at Home are nothing to me, nor much indeed to
any of us, now they are over. Heaven suffer'd him to over<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn
things, and then Heaven over-turn'd things again; and
having visited the Nation for their Crimes, visited their Af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>flictors
afterwards, scourg'd the Scourgers, and restor'd the
Government. Just as in ancient Times he delivered up his
People to the <hi>Assyrian,</hi> and then restor'd his People again,
and destroyed their Destroyers.</p>
            <p>But I am talking not of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Conduct at home, or
his Measures with his Governours, but his Measures with
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and with them only.</p>
            <p>It was about the Year 1655, when the War with <hi>Spain</hi>
continuing, after several other Attempts, the Council of War
received some Proposals laid before them by the Govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment's
Order, for an Expedition to the <hi>Spanish West-Indies</hi>;
(and as I had it not from History, but by a very Authentick,
tho' Verbal Relation, from a Member of the very Council of
War, to whom it was referr'd) a Descent was propos'd
to be made upon the Continent of New <hi>Spain</hi>; This was
in order to seize some Strength there, keep the Possession of
it, fortifie and place a Garrison in it, to be defended after<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards
against all the Power of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> so by that means
to extend themselves Gradually into the Country, plant and
cultivate, still fortifying as they should go on, 'till at length they
might establish a Colony there, and so share with the <hi>Spani<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ards</hi>
the Possession of <hi>America</hi>; and perhaps lying between the
two great Empires which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> possess, <hi>viz.</hi> North and
South <hi>America,</hi> or as in particular they may be call'd, <hi>Mexico</hi>
and <hi>Peru,</hi> cut off the Communication, and possess the Shores
of both Seas, that is to say, the Ports of <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi>
(which is much the same as <hi>Porto Belo</hi>) and <hi>Panama.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this Proposal, it was suppos'd, a Door would be immediate<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly
open'd to a Commerce with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> that a
Trade would be carried on to infinite Advantage, a vast Expence
of the Woollen Manufacture follow, and a return in Specie
<pb n="38" facs="43"/>
be immediately and directly made to <hi>England</hi>; without tra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ding
about by old <hi>Spain,</hi> and under the Limitations and Restricti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as it always was before; and that in
particular, while the War continued, very great Sums would
frequently fall into the Hands of the <hi>English,</hi> by keeping a
certain Number of Ships of War always cruising in those
Seas; and having the Port of such Place as should be con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quer'd
to retreat into, refit, revictual, and shelter themselves
upon all Occasions.</p>
            <p>The Offer was specious, the Adventure bold, and the Suc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cess
promising: But upon farther and mature Deliberation,
tho' the Enterprise was accepted and undertaken in the Gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral,
yet the Measures were chang'd; the Place expected to
be attack'd was rejected, and a new Scheme (as some said, of
his own) was appointed for the Expendition, and that was to
attack the <hi>Havana,</hi> the principal Port, and the chief Strength
of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America</hi>; at least it was, and is still a
Place of the greatest Importance to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> of any in
all their <hi>American</hi> Dominions, as shall appear presently;
The Reasons given for this Alteration of Counsels were such,
as presently made an Impression upon All that were consulted
about it, and the new Undertaking was unauimously resolv'd
on.</p>
            <p>In order to carry on an Enterprise of such Importance, a
Fleet and an Army was prepar'd, and that with all the Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pedition
and Secrecy, that such a Design call'd for: Nor 'till
the Troops were ready to Embark, was it so much as guess'd
at whither they were design'd.</p>
            <p>However the jealous <hi>Spaniards,</hi> made afraid from the
meer Importance of the Place, rather than by any certain
Knowledge of the Design, sent away some Ships of War,
with Stores of Ammunition and Supply of Troops for the
Garrisons of the <hi>Havana,</hi> and of <hi>Chartagena,</hi> as the two most
significant Places they possess'd in all their <hi>American</hi> Domi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nions,
at least on that Side; and these Ships arriv'd before the
<hi>English,</hi> some considerable time.</p>
            <p>The Design was at last made known: only to amuse the
<hi>Spaniards, Carthagena</hi> was given out as the Place intended to
be attack'd: The Squauron sail'd, the Troops about 8 or
9000 Men, and commanded by the fam'd Colonels <hi>Penn</hi> and
<hi>Venables.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The History of the Voyage is but short in it self, and I shall
make it shorter still; the Design upon the <hi>Havana</hi> miscarry'd,
principally by the Disagreement in Councils among the Offi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cers;
they were mistaken in every thing, landed in a wrong</p>

Place, (<hi>viz.</hi>) at <hi>Hispaniola</hi>; the Men were harrass'd and
fatigued, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by that encourag'd; they were
repuls'd in two or three Places, and at length they gave
over the Enterprise, laying the Blame one upon another re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciprocally,
as in all humane Disappointments 'tis very fre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quent

            <p>Failing in this Enterprize they reimbark'd their Troops;

Place, entred the Port, landed the Army; and being made
wise by their Misfortunes, and resolving not to be beaten,
unless cut in pieces, they went on with more united Coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cils,
and a better Agreement than before; by which means,
and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being not well provided for their Defence,
they took the Island, and, to shorten the Story, <hi>Jamaica</hi> has
been <hi>English</hi> ever since.</p>
            <p>It is not to be wondred at if the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> after this narrow
Escape, went to work with the Fortifications of the <hi>Havana,</hi>
and made it very strong; adding a strong Castle at the North
Part of the Town it self, and adding several Batteries at the
Entrance, whereof one under the Castle <hi>El Morro</hi> has a particular
Battery of twelve exceeding long Brass Cannon, which they
call the Twelve Apostles, and which carry, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
may be believ'd, a fifty-six Pound Ball.</p>
            <p>Since this, and even while they were alarm'd with the
coming of a <hi>French</hi> Squadron into those Seas, in the late
War under Monsieur <hi>Pointy,</hi> when they took <hi>Chartagena,</hi>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> apprehending the Design was against the <hi>Ha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vana,</hi>
they caused the whole City to be accurately fortified,
and a Fort and a Cittadel to be re-built; by which the Town
as well as the Port has obtain'd the Name of a very strong
Place, tho' far from being what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretend to say
of it, Invincible. But if it really were so at this time, or if
it was five-fold stronger than it is, it is of no Value or Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>portance
in the Scheme I am now to lay down, nor shall it
be of any Use to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Case before me, any more
than the Strength of any other Place; for what signifies its
Strength, when it is not to be attack'd?</p>
            <p>It is not the Fortifications upon the Shore that will Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port
any thing in this War; the Superiority by Sea is the
<pb n="40" facs="46"/>
thing we lay the whole Weight upon, and being Masters of
the Sea is that which the Sum of Affairs depends upon.</p>
            <p>However 'tis necessary a little to state the Importance of this
Port of the <hi>Havana,</hi> in as brief Terms as I can, because this
was the Reason why <hi>Oliver</hi> and his Council pitch'd upon it
to make their Attack. By the Import of it, I mean, the Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port
of it to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as they are now possest of it, and
as it would have been to the <hi>English,</hi> if <hi>Oliver</hi>'s General had
happen'd to take it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Havana</hi> is the best Port without Dispute in all the
<hi>Spanish West-Indies</hi>; it is situate on the North Side of the
Iste of <hi>Cuba,</hi> opposite to the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> in the Latitude
of twenty three Degrees North.</p>
            <p>The Gulph of <hi>Florida</hi> being the only practicable Out-let or
Passage from the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> by which all the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Ships make their Return from <hi>America,</hi> and by which they
enter into Ocean, which they therefore call <hi>Disemboguing</hi>;
I say, the Gulph being the only Practicable Way, all the <hi>Ga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>leons</hi>
from <hi>Porto-Belo,</hi> and the other Ships called the <hi>Flota,</hi>
from <hi>La Vera Craz,</hi> come first to the <hi>Havana</hi> in their Passage
home, and there being in Safety from either Seas or Enemies (for
it is a Port as safe from Winds and Storms, as from Enemies)
they wait 'till they meet from all Parts, and, as they call it,
make up their Fleet.</p>
            <p>N. B. There is another Way between <hi>Cuba</hi> and <hi>Hispaniola,</hi>
which the Seamen call the <hi>Windward Passage,</hi> which the
Ships from <hi>Jamaica</hi> sometimes venture thorough. But
'tis hazardous and difficult, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> never make
use of it, especially with their Fleet.</p>
            <p>N. B. It should also have been observ'd, that the Fleets
from old <hi>Spain,</hi> make this Port of the <hi>Havana</hi> be the
first Place of their Arrival, when they are outward bound,
and coming so far in a Body; they then separate as their Or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders
direct: the Ships for the South go away to <hi>Porto<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>Belo,</hi>
and those to the West go to <hi>La Vera Cruz</hi>; the
Men of War attending them, or not, as they see Occa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion,
and as Inteiligence of things directs.</p>
            <p>So that both ways, whether out or home, the <hi>Havana</hi> is the
only Place of Safety, where the Plate Fleet rendezvous, and
where they are cover'd from all Dangers; nor wou'd the
Voyage be easily made without such a <hi>Halfway-Port</hi> to stop
in, to recruit, to take in Refreshments, Provisious, and especially
Fresh-water; after so long a Run, as it is from <hi>Cadiz</hi>
thither, in which they have no Place to touch at for-Refresh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,
except it be the <hi>Canary-Islands,</hi> where their Stay is but
<pb n="41" facs="47"/>
very short, the Road being not at all safe, either from Wind or
Weather, or Enemies, even the <hi>Turkish</hi> Rovers not excepted.</p>
            <p>Having thus given you a full Account of the Import of this
Place to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> I have only this to add; That in the
propos'd Advantages to us for cutting off the <hi>Spanish</hi> Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce,
and totally intercepting their Correspondence with one
another, which is the Scheme to be proposed, This mighty
Port, this well-fortified City, and this excellent Harbour, shall
be of no Signification or Importance one way or other; it
shall neither be worth any thing to us to take, or to the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
to keep: Allowing <hi>England</hi> to have only the Superiority of naval
Strength, and to be Masters of the Sea, which I think I may
venture to say is not to be doubted, and all the rest shall fall
in of Course; the <hi>Havana</hi> shall be as useless to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
as <hi>Majorca</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> (comparatively speaking)
nor shall it be able, or the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by its help be able, to pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vent
our Interrupting their Commerce, and in short, taking it
wholly into our own Hands.</p>
            <p>The Case is Thus:</p>
            <p>There is on the same Island of <hi>Cuba,</hi> and on the same North-Side of
it, open to the same grand Passage of the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> another
Port or Harbour, call'd the Harbour or Gulph of <hi>Honda</hi>; it is about
nine Leagues to the Westward of the <hi>Havana,</hi> and upon the very
same Coast.</p>
            <p>The Conveniences of this Port (among many others) are some in
particular which relate to the Subject in Hand, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That it is a convenient Place to form a Settlement upon, and to
fortifie, so as with little Expence to make it unapproachable by Land,
and consequently not to be interrupted by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That it commands a fruitful, and plentiful, and healthy Country,
where not only all manner of Provisions may be had, but where such
easy and secure Planting would follow, as not <hi>Jamaica</hi> it self would
go beyond it, as well for Trade, as supply of Inhabitants.</item>
                  <item>3. But that which is above all the rest, the Situation is such by
Sea, that not a Ship, much less a Fleet of Ships, can go in or out,
to or from the <hi>Havana,</hi> from or to the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> or the
Coast of <hi>Carthagena, Porto-Belo,</hi> &amp;c. but they must pass by this Port,
and even in sight of the Men of War riding here; so that <hi>England</hi> has
no more to do than to post a Squadron of Ships in this Port, ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>king
it their Station, and keeping some of them cruising upon the
Coast of the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> as they see Occasion; and let any one that
understands the Situation of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Commerce, tell us how they
will carry it on without our Leave, and which Way they will get out
of the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> or out of the Gulph of <hi>Honduras,</hi> or (to use
their own Language) how they will <hi>Disembogus,</hi> that is, get into the
Ocean, wihtout (as I say) asking us Leave.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>If this is their Case (to make the just Inference from Things as I
go) will any Man say I was too arrogant in saying the <hi>Spaniards</hi> seem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed
<pb n="42" facs="48"/>
not to know what they were doing, when they begin a Quarrel
with <hi>England,</hi> that their Proceedings were absurd, and ridiculons,
and that they seemed to be little off from Distraction?</p>
            <p>The farther entering into this Scheme of Management, for the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terrupting
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Commerce, requires more Room than can be al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowed
to any thing from so mean a Pen. But if any Writer, or Wri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter's
Master, can raise one Objection against it, that cannot with unan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swerable
Force be refuted, I would be glad to see it.</p>
            <p>Let the greatest Friend to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Interest, or the greatest Ene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>my
to the Author of this, tell me, if they can, which way the Flo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ta's
from <hi>La Vera Cruz</hi> shall get out into the Ocean, which way the
<hi>Galeons</hi> shall beat it up against a Leeward Tide (as the Seamen call it)
from <hi>Porto-Belo,</hi> and not come under the command of this Port, or
that of <hi>Jamaica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a Passage already mentioned, which sometimes our Ships
from <hi>Jamaica</hi> do make use of, which is therefore called the <hi>Wind<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward
Passage,</hi> and which runs from the East Point of <hi>Jamaica,</hi>
North-West, and then fleering North, goes between the Islands of
<hi>Cuba</hi> and <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> and passing among innumerable Islands, Sands,
Shoals, Rocks and other Dangers, leaves the Gulph of <hi>Florida</hi> on
the Larboard Side, and goes out or disembogues into the Ocean, to
the North-East of all the <hi>Bahama</hi> Islands; and it is true, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
may (that is to say, now and then a Ship may) make their Escape this
Way.</p>
            <p>But I refer it to the Judgment of the skilful Mariner, whether
this is a practicable Way for the whole Trade; and if it were so, whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
then the Island of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> which is already <hi>British,</hi> would not
be of the same use for that Course, as the Bay of <hi>Honda</hi> would be
for the other.</p>
            <p>I am no Projector, nor am I laying the thing down as a Proposal, at
least not here; but I think it is plain (at least to me) that a <hi>British</hi> Squadron
posted in this Bay, may when you please put an end to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce
in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> in such a manner, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could
never carry on any considerable Trade there again: Always supposing
what we have reason to hope will ever be the Case, namely, that the
<hi>British</hi> Fleet shall be Masters of the Sea.</p>
            <p>It may be pretended, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> may coast along the South
Side of that they call the <hi>North Seas,</hi> that is to say, under the North,
Share of the South <hi>America,</hi> the Coast of <hi>St. Marta, Venezcula,</hi> or the
<hi>Carata's</hi>; and so to <hi>Bosco del Drago,</hi> the Gulph of <hi>Paria,</hi> and the Isle
<hi>De Trimidada</hi>; and so going away East, get into the Ocean that way,
and come home with the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Fleets from the <hi>Brasils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this, Eke what was said before of the <hi>Windward Passage,</hi> is no
more than like a City not entirely invested, or that tho' besieged, may
have some such secret Passages, as that now and then a single Messen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ger
may escape in or out, to carry a Letter, or bring particular Intelli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gence,
but which signifies nothing at all towards its Relief, much less
towards raising the Stage, and opening a Communication.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="49"/>
Having thus stated the Case of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in case of a War, and
on supposition of the <hi>British</hi> Superiority at Sea, how their Commerce
with <hi>Europe</hi> shall be interrupted and broken off, and how they shall be
no more able to trade, no not with their own Subjects, but by Leave
from his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majesty, and his Allies: The Inference from
hence is as natural, and as plain, as that mentioned above; <hi>viz.</hi> No
Man need to ask what are our Advantages by a War with <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know some room lyes here for a Question, thus: Suppose you
should thus Interrupt their Commerce, what immediate Benefit or
Advantage would that be to us? seeing tho' they cannot trade so freely
with one another, they may hinder the Commerce of their own Sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jects
with the Subjects of others; and so, tho' the Interruption of the
Trade be a Loss to them, it will be no Gain to us.</p>
            <p>I State this Question, not because it is a Question that any one who
understands the Nature of the Commerce of New <hi>Spain</hi> will ask, but
because there are some People that will ask more Questions in half an
Hour, than‚Äî<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and because some are (as <hi>Solomon</hi> says) <hi>Wiser in their
own Conceit, than those that can render a Reason</hi>: The Reasons to be gi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven
in answer to such Questions, if any should be Weak enough to ask
them, are resolved into not Argument but Demonstration.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of New <hi>Spain</hi> cannot trade with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of Old
<hi>Spain,</hi> Experience tells us they will trade with any Body: If their own
Ships cannot come at them, to bring the Merchandize of <hi>Europe</hi> to
them, 'tis evident they must have those Merchandizes, and they will
seek to be supply'd with them where they can.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves know this too well; the Marquis <hi>de Puzz<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter" rend="content:‚Ä¢">
                     <desc>illegible</desc>
                  </gap>
Bueno,</hi> in his late Memorial, complains of this as one of the Effects of
Admiral <hi>Hosier</hi>'s Squadron lying at the <hi>Bestimento's,</hi> viz. that it covers and
protects what he calls the Contraband Trade, to the Prejudice of their
Commerce.</p>
            <p>Let any one grant me that taking Post, or Stationing a Squadron at
the Bay of <hi>Honda,</hi> shall command the Commerce of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi>
as I think it evidently appears it would, I will answer for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
that they will grant it shall lay open their Trade Wholly to the Allies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> rich and at case, abound in Money, and have
Plenty of all manner of Provisions, Wine excepted. They have the
most delicious Fruits; they have a Profusion of Sugars for Preserving,
which they greatly delight in; the finest Sweet meats and Confections in
the World being to be had there, in the greatest Plenty; they have the
<hi>Cocoa</hi> in such Plenty, that their Chocolate (which is their ordinary Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>past)
costs them very little. They have Flesh, and Fowl and Fish in a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bundance,
infinitely more than they can consume. And as for Mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney,
their Houses are fill'd with Plate, and their Merchants Ware-houses
piled up to the Ceilings with Chests of Silver Coin.</p>
            <p>But with all this Affluence they have no Clothes; they have neither
Linnen or Woollen, Silk or Hair of their own; I mean manufactured,
and of their own making; they have indeed some Cotton, and some
Wool, and the <hi>Indians,</hi> or Natives, do in some remote Places make
some ordinary things for their own Cloathing, chiefly of Cotton, and
some course <hi>peruvian</hi> Wool.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="50"/>
But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (like the <hi>Lord-Danes</hi> formerly in <hi>England,</hi> from
whole Pride and Laziness an Idle Fellow was afterwards call'd a <hi>Lurdan</hi>)
are too proud to stoop to any thing called Work, so that they have no
Merchandize, and consequently no Cloth, except what they receive
from <hi>Europe</hi>; and some <hi>East-India</hi> Goods, such as Callicoes, and wrought
Silks of <hi>China</hi> from the <hi>Philipine</hi> Islands, by the way of <hi>Acapulco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Supply of Manufactures is (generally speaking) the Loading of
the Galeons, including some Wines, and Oyl, and Fruit of the Growth
of Old <hi>Spain</hi>; and these Loadings chiefly consist of the Woollen Manu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>facture
of <hi>England,</hi> the Silks of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Linnen of <hi>Hol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Supply has sometimes been Interrupted by a War, as was in
particular the Case in the first War with <hi>France,</hi> when the Galeons were
stopped for two or three Years; then it was the oddest thing in the
World, to see how shabby and ragged the <hi>Spaniards</hi> appeared, with their
Pockets full of Gold, their Tables cover'd with Plate, and their Ware-houses
(as above) heap'd up with Silver. And the Author of this speaks
of particular Knowledge, that under one of these Disappointments a
<hi>Spanish</hi> Merchant came on board a trading Sloop, on the Coast of
St. <hi>Martha,</hi> in a <hi>Periagua,</hi> and bought as many Goods at several times
as he paid 19000 Pieces of Eight for, and had himself not a Pair of
Stockings on his Legs, and the rest of his Cloaths worn into such Rags,
as an <hi>Englishman</hi> with but 50<hi>s.</hi> in the World would scorn to be seen in.</p>
            <p>He acknowledged that they had Money enough, but no Cloths; that
every thing bore such a Price as tempted them that were Merchants to
sell till they were almost naked. He brought 5000 Pieces of Eight with
him the first time, and looking over the whole Ship's Cargo, bought as
much as came to 19000, (the Sum above-mention'd) stay'd in the Sloop
all the next Day, when they stood off to Sea to be out of Sight, and
went on Shore with his Goods the next Night; returning again
the Night after with more Money; and so constantly, 'till he had
brought all his Money, and then sent three other Merchants, who
bought all the rest of the Cargo.</p>
            <p>If this Trade was carry'd on thus, when at the extremest Hazard;
what would it be when, under the Protection of the Men of War, the
Ships and Sloops should come boldly to their Shores, and the Buyers be
under no Restraint. Necessity obliging them to consive at one another
on Shore, and no <hi>Guard de Costia's</hi> to take Cognisance at Sea?</p>
            <p>Nay, what would it be when the Bay of <hi>Honda</hi> should be a free Fair,
and that all the <hi>Spanish</hi> Vessels that thought fit to come thither, should
trade under the Protection of the Place, and be safe going and coming,
under shelter of the cruising Men of War?</p>
            <p>Will any Man say that the Trade will not be wholly our own, that is
to say, the Allies? for the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Curacao</hi> and <hi>Surinam,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi>
at <hi>Martinico,</hi> would have their Share in the same Commerce; and any
one may answer for it, the Advantage would be such, that we should
never be concern'd, tho' there was never to be any more Peace with the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> either on this Side of the World, or on the other.</p>
