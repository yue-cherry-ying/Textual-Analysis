            <l>LONG has been serv'd from this our motley Stage,</l>
            <l>Repasts for various tastes—from youth to age—</l>
            <l>To lively Miss, escap'd from Sshool and toil,</l>
            <l>Our sports have oft bestow'd the infant smile,</l>
            <l>While the rude boy, from Westminster or Eton,</l>
            <l>Who <hi>"spies,"</hi> and <hi>"quizzes"</hi> one, where'er they meet one.</l>
            <l>For them, our brilliant Ballets drawn from Greece,</l>
            <l>Restore their Greek—without a rod a piece.</l>
            <l>While tricks and tumbling honest John employ,</l>
            <l>Who drinks his punch aloft, and screams with joy.</l>
            <l>The wife is all for music, shakes and thrilling,</l>
            <l>Old maids, from soft humanity, love killing:</l>
            <l>Each has his taste: for married life may say,</l>
            <l>Not oft' two persons think in the same way.</l>
            <l>Our Bard, long known to you, this night makes up,</l>
            <l>Of various beverage—a kind of <hi>cup;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Of Music, Pantomime, and graver scenes,</l>
            <l>Perhaps a dash of terror intervenes;</l>
            <l>Should not all these sufficient change supply,</l>
            <l>If you condemn—there will be—<hi>Tragedy.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But, Britons, while a neighbouring nation's crimes,</l>
            <l>Have spread war wide, and made these—"Iron Times."</l>
            <l>Greet <hi>you,</hi> the moral virtues of <hi>the STAGE,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Which haply may amend an erring age:</l>
            <l>That Arts and Sciences may take their place,</l>
            <l>That the domestic ties may have their grace,</l>
            <l>The rights of sweet humanity be known,</l>
            <l>And freedom fixed by law, reign like your own?</l>

                  <speaker>Valoury.</speaker>
                  <p>—Holloa! Damsels! Stop a little, and I'll ease you of your wares, I'll warrant you. Well, thank Heaven, we're arrived in a chearful country at last. <stage>looking about</stage> Bless me! What a charming air! And what a charming appetite it gives one! I have scarcely swallowed any thing but dust for these three weeks, but here ends our tedious journey—Yonder is the city of Messina, and hard by resides the man my master is in search of—Why my master has left Savoy, to seek this interview with poor dead Julia's jealous husband, I am yet to learn—Oh! Here he comes.</p>
               </sp>
               <stage>Enter <hi>CARLOS.</hi>
               </stage>

                  <p>Yes, Signor Carlos, and to lose my appetite I hope; for the one is as irksome a com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>panion as the other.</p>

                  <speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
                  <p>Would my distrestes could be as easily removed as yours—The shade of my departed Julia haunts me at every turn, and her injured memory calls aloud for vengeance.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Valoury.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah! Sir, if grief or resentment could restore her to life, I'd starve myself into a passion with pleasure; but as that is impossible, might I advise you, Signor, I should recommend a tem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perate meal or two, before we proceed any fur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>Temperate! Valoury, can anguish in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>supportable be temperate! Listen to the story of my heart—That Julia, the hapless wife of the im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perious Count Montoni, whom thou saw'st interr'd at Palermo—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Valoury.</speaker>
                  <p>And a melancholy sight it was, Sig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nor Carlos—I remember I was just sitting down to an excellent barbacue, smoking hot, when the procession passed the window; but so it is, when<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever a man is upon the point of being happy, some cursed thing or other always interferes to chill his prospects.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
                  <p>Think, Valoury, of an attachment begun almost in childhood, and improved with growing years; when love's soft wishes were sanc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tioned by reason, and dear expectation nourished by consenting friends.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Valoury.</speaker>
                  <p>What then was the cause of your los<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing her?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
                  <p>Her father's avarice and ambition. This proud, indignant Lord, the Count Montoni, with large possessions, and extended power, was
<pb n="8" facs="9"/>
captivated with my Julia's blooming charms, and, do I live to repeat it, tore her from me in the mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment when she was to have been mine for ever.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Valoury.</speaker>
                  <p>But how came the Lady to consent?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
                  <p>There thou hast touched the cord of anguish in my breast; <hi>that</hi> drove me from my native home, to seek in solitude a calm, which, alas, Valoury, thy master's heart can never more experience; <hi>that</hi> brings me back again on the wings of rage, and vengeance, to demand atone<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment for wrongs too great to be endured.</p>
                  <stage>With great energy.</stage>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Valoury.</speaker>
                  <p>Bless me, Sir! Has any thing hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pened lately?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; from the amiable Constantia, the only surviving sister of my hapless love, I learn by papers found since her decease, that the most infernal arts were put in practice by the Count and his adherents, to bend the timid fair one to their cruel purpose.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Valoury.</speaker>
                  <p>Mercy on me! My hair stands on end. They hinted too at Palermo, that the Lady's death was sudden and extraordinary.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
                  <p>By basest forgery she was induced to believe I had already been wedded to another.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Valoury.</speaker>
                  <p>To another indeed! As if Gentlemen of your prudent turn of mind, did not think one wife at a time quite sufficient.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
                  <p>But the hour of retribution is at hand; meanwhile bear this letter to Constantia—Her father, old Fractioso, is one of the Chief Magi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>strates in the city. I would on no account that he should hear of my return; therefore be careful to deliver it into her own hands.</p>

                  <p>Well done, Cloddy! Thee didsn't lay thy snares last night for nothing—By the dickens, here's as pretty a bunch of preserved property as any justice would wish to see at his table; and a

pretty round sum it will bring me, when I ha' got it safe housed—for our old rich citizens do so like a tit-bit, especially when it is prohibited—and why should they not? They call me a poacher— mayhap, so I be—what then—so be other people. Its my belief as how its a pretty general trade.</p>

                  <p>So, my poor friend, after the father had generously locked you into his daughter's apart<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment—he cooly turned you neck and heels out of his own street door.</p>

                  <p>Faith, something very like it; or, not<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>withstanding my attachment to your person, my love for another person's person, would have made me a truant to friendship.</p>

                  <p>Impossible is it, that a man should prefer being safe in a warm house, playing bo-peep with the bright eyes of his mistress, to scampering across a cold country for a game at pistols with his friend's rival?</p>

                  <speaker>Hilario.</speaker>

friendship will, I trust, never be forgotten—you certainly stand second—that is, after the ladies, in my account—but I myself, am at the top of the page, and you know its the fashion now, to take care of number <hi>One.</hi>

                  <p>I am sorry for it. How much kinder the old greybeard is to me—as he totters round me with a grin, I whip his scythe from his hand, and cut off my sorrows in the middle.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hilario.</speaker>
                  <p>My dear friend, take comfort—let us return to the city—these desolate old ruins don't seem to promise much entertainment— they've made me grave already.</p>

                  <speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
                  <p>To me the world is all a void—Julia! my once destined Julia's lost for ever!
<stage>As they go out, a bell tolls in the Castle.</stage>
Whence came that dismal sound?</p>

                  <speaker>Hilario.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Carlos.</speaker>

               <stage> An old room, hung with antique, tattered tape<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stry—two doors exactly alike in the back scene, covered with the same tapestry—A window over them, the stage to be a little darken'd.</stage>

                  <p>At length, my friend, the hour of retri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bution comes; and love insulted, claims its sacri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fice—the time, the place, occasion—all conspire, while secrecy secures revenge.</p>

                  <speaker>Count.</speaker>
                  <p>Impossible! 'tis now too late—Is not this favour'd rival come to vaunt his valour? Shall we restore the idol of his panting heart, and be ourselves, the victims of his triumph?</p>

                  <p>Yet, spite of the rage which fires an injur'd husband's breast, resisted pity will at times intrude—fear too, appals, and dread remorse— the very figures fashion'd in these antient hang<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings, with ghastly eye-ball seem to frown upon us.</p>

                  <p>Weak imagery of the brain, which quick decision must efface—trust me, my Lord, we have little leisure to deliberate.</p>

                  <p>Not an hour ago, waiting, as is my duty, for your Lordship's presence; a deep ton'd

bell, fixed unknown to me, in the interior of the Castle, was on a sudden by our mourner sounded.</p>

                  <speaker>Bernardo.</speaker>
                  <p>At first I thought 'twas fancy; but being repeated, I flew to trace the cause, and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stant cut the rope.</p>

                  <p>Soon after, the outward gates were by rude hands attempted to be forced.</p>

                  <speaker>Bernardo.</speaker>
                  <p>With speed I mounted to the turret, and descried some strangers in close conference.</p>

                  <speaker>Bernardo.</speaker>
                  <p>The day declining, prevented more discovery—The sportsmen returning from the field forced them to retire.</p>

                  <speaker>Count.</speaker>
                  <p>Who could they be? No matter—ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prehension will but prompt our purpose—her doom's inevitable—but then—the remains.</p>

and give it manly resolution—hush! was not that a sigh, a deepened sigh? How soon the last must follow, let me seize this solitary interval to take one final look, silent, unobserved—alas! the dim light that glooms around, scarce shews the dismal path.</p>

                  <p>In truth, Hilario, it is somewhat sur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prising, after the extraordinary occurrences with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out the walls of this old castle, we should as yet be able to make no discoveries within; a solemn silence seems to reign around, and nothing, save the hollow murmur of the wind, strikes on the listening ear.</p>

                  <p>You shall hear—but come a little further from that cursed cavern; you know, after having trampt about these diabolical apartments for half an hour together, we agreed to separate at the end of a long gallery, and took different routs.</p>

                  <speaker>Carlos.</speaker>
                  <p>We did so—and the distant glimmer of light from this lanthorn, which I found standing on the pavement, led me to the dismal recess where we again met—but proceed—</p>

               <stage>—The ramparts of <hi>MESSINA,</hi> with a view of the quay and harbour, where a vessel is seen at anchor, with sails bent—on one side near the front, the gates of the city, with a centry box.</stage>
               <stage>The <hi>CENTINEL</hi> discovered on duty—A porter passes towards the quay, with a large chest.</stage>

                  <p>Gad! its a raw morning—I wish they'd come and relieve guard—there goes ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther heavy load—I have seen old Signor Fractio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>so's servants busied these two hours, in conveying things on board that vessel—I wonder what it can mean? But its no affair of mine—when the old begin to move off, there's more room for the young to move on, that's my comfort.</p>
               </sp>
               <stage>Enter six soldiers—<hi>HILARIO</hi> as one, in uniform, with large mustachios.</stage>

                  <p>Peace, you ungrateful varlet—was'nt it at your own request, and thro' the interest of good Montauban, that your punishment of being a galley-slave for life, was remitted, on condition of your serving as a soldier? and now would you still grumble?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hilario.</speaker>

                  <p>Now don't I cut a pretty figure, whiskered up to the eyes like a turk, and loaded with arms like a baggage waggon—If I stay, I shall be flogged for not knowing my duty. Suppose I run away—no, I'll be <hi>shot</hi> if I do—I know the worst on't—to submit like my betters in office, to be cut up a little—here's an habita<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion for the future son-in-law to a Grandee! no furniture—no state apartments! <stage>examines centry box.</stage> However, here's a good lock and key to the premises, and they pay no taxes—but shall I never see my brave friend, Carlos again, nor embrace my divine Constantia?—no—no more salutes for me, but with a drawn sword, or a musquet—ah! poor, poor Hilario!</p>

                  <p>Yes, and an honest fellow too;—for when so be, I sees mischief going forward, that I've no hand in, I always tries to prevent it.</p>

                  <p>Yes, you have no hand in it, and therefore tries to prevent it.</p>

                  <speaker>Cloddy.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes;—now do you see that vessel down in the harbour—it belongs to that old piece of totteration, Fractioso—he that is the Vice-le<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gate.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hilario.</speaker>
                  <p>Rota, Scrota, and so forth. I know him—well, what is he going to do with that vessel?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cloddy.</speaker>
                  <p>I'll tell you—he has gotten a house in the remote part of the country, among the moun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tains on the sea-coast—and he is going to take his daughter there, and all his plate, and his jewels, and every thing he can carry away.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hilario.</speaker>
                  <p>What can be his motive for that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cloddy.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, they says he don't like the Count Montoni, her husband, as well as he was used, and they have had words together, and I suppose he thinks, if he doesn't secure the property himself, the Count will do it for him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hilario.</speaker>
                  <p>Likely enough—but hasn't he another daughter?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cloddy.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; but she has no husband to make any claims, and to take care that she never shall, he has sent her to a convent.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hilario.</speaker>
                  <p>To a convent, has he?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cloddy.</speaker>
                  <p>Sure enough—to keep her out of the way of a most mischevous fellow, one Hilario—do you know him? he's the wickedest dog—</p>

                  <speaker>Hilario.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, that he is—I know him as well as I do myself—but see here's the old man coming.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cloddy.</speaker>
                  <p>There he is, an old rogue—leading his daughter to be banished—od rabbit it—sister can know nothing of this flight;—I doubt she ha' been off her listening, or she'd raise the whole city with her clack—how a' name o'fortune has he made Madam Julia consent to go? But she's a sweet lady, that's the truth on't, and as tractable as a staunch pointer.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hilario.</speaker>
                  <p>Cant you contrive to assist the lady? I dare say you're full as clever as you're honest.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cloddy.</speaker>
                  <p>I tell you what, centinel—I wou'd do any thing to serve her, because why, when I acci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dentally tumbled down once, and killed a large co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vey of partridges, she interfered with her father, and saved me from a dangerous sore-throat <stage>shews his meaning with his hand</stage> oh, you old hard heart<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed bit of justice!</p>

                  <p>It don't signify talking—you must go and you shall go—and I will have you go—I tell you again, between the mad Count, and the cun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ning Carlos, I don't think my life is worth a year's purchase.</p>

                  <speaker>Julia.</speaker>
                  <p>Had Carlos been so inconsiderate, as to entertain improper hopes, the letter you have just now obliged me to write to him, must have extin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guished them all—Oh Sir! why did I write but to oblige my father—where do I wish to live and die, but under his protecting roof?

                  <p>Your sister is safe enough in a clois<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter—she has no husband to frighten her poor fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther—don't you remember how fierce the Count look'd, at our last interview! he knit his brows and said "Ough! I will have my wife"—then you cried—" no——no" then he replied, "blood and oons! I will have her dowry" then I too, cried "no no"—so, I'm determined to hide both you and the property, where they will be safe from a furious husband, and an artful lover.</p>

                  <p>Yes, and I'll consider my distressed self—I should not be surprized if they were to try to lock me up likewise in an old castle—therefore dispatch—come on board while there is nobody to interrupt—nay, no demurring—who knows but that dog Hilario, may have made his escape, and be now at hand to outwit me!</p>

                  <p>Only a figurative expression, as we, authors term it.

Her lover hid amongst piles of old rubbish, and her father lock'd up in a watch-box—Carlos!

            <head>EPILOGUE.</head>
            <stage>Spoken by Mrs. MATTOCKS.</stage>
            <l>LOVE'S influence drawn from scenes of former years,</l>
            <l>Why not pourtray it as it now appears.</l>
            <l>Annette no more—the Italian confidante,</l>
            <l>Suppose me now an old French gouvernante,</l>
            <l>With coaxing cringe my pupil's heart to charm,</l>
            <l>Discoursing fond and freely—arm in arm.</l>
            <l>She in the bloom of life, and height of taste,</l>
            <l>A yard of feather, and an inch of waist;</l>
            <l>Waist did I say? I meant to mend my phrase,</l>
            <l>The spot which was the summit of the stays;</l>
            <l>"Young Charles," she sighs—no—the old Peer, his brother,</l>
            <l>"I love the one—then, marry with the other—</l>
            <l>"His withered hands, so terrible to touch,</l>
            <l>"But then the Coronet upon his crutch—</l>
            <l>"Delightful thought! That puts an end to sorrow,</l>
            <l>"I'll have him, if papa consent, to-morrowi</l>
            <l>What glomwing love must spring from such a channel!</l>
            <l>They can't be cold, who're always wrap'd in flannel.</l>
            <l>Turn we to courtship in a different strain:</l>
            <l>An ancient Venus, and a youthful swain.</l>
            <l>The Fair, if won, a mine of wealth would prove,</l>
            <l>The hero, poor in every thing but love,</l>
            <l>A crumplin she, head shrunk between her shoulders,</l>
            <l>Mount on her back, attracting all beholders;</l>
            <l>With Koscius<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">
                  <desc>illegible</desc>
               </gap>o cap, and zone to bind,</l>
            <l>The neck before, the prominence behind,</l>
            <l>Her tiny person, and her cumb'rous pack</l>
            <l>Look like a drum girt round a drummer's back—</l>
            <l>The six foot stripling, firm in every joint,</l>
            <l>Whose button'd trowsers brush the elbows point,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="92"/>Whose muslin foldings all his chin enclose,</l>
            <l>Meeting the pondrous hat that veils his nose;</l>
            <l>With mouth scarce visible, you'd think our beau,</l>
            <l>The man in armour at my Lord Mayor's show</l>
            <l>"Marry me, ma'am, he cries, and take your swing,</l>
            <l>"Dam'me, I love you dearly—that's the thing:</l>
            <l>"Who can such charming accents disapprove?</l>
            <l>"My heart's too tender—I was form'd for love—</l>
            <l>The little Lady all on tiptoe stands—</l>
            <l>He stoops—she springs—and so they join their hands.</l>
            <l>If such of modern love the blissful state,</l>
            <l>Who would not choose the love that's out of date?</l>
            <l>Some bright exceptions, still we trust then are,</l>
            <l>Th' auspicious nuptials of the Royal Pair,</l>
            <l>May bring old fashion'd feelings into vogue,</l>
            <l>And shame the satire of our Epilogue,</l>
            <l>Long may they live, with fond delight to prove,</l>
            <l>Life's sweetest joys, flow from connubial love.</l>
