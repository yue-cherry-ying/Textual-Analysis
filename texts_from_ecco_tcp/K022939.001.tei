            <p>MR. POPE, in his last illness, amused himself, amidst the care of his higher concerns, in preparing a corrected and complete Edition of his Writings<note place="bottom" n="a">
                  <q rend="inline">—"I own the late encroachments upon my con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stitution make me willing to see the end of all further care about me or my works. I would rest for the one in a full resignation of my Being to be disposed of by the Father of all Mercy; and for the other (though indeed a trifle, yet a trifle may be some ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ample) I would commit them to the candour of a sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sible and reflecting judge, rather than to the malice of every short-sighted and malevolent critic, or inad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vertent and censorious Reader. And no hand can set them in so good a light, &amp;c." <bibl>Let. <hi>cxx.</hi> to Mr. W.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </note>; and, with his usual delicacy, was even so<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>licitous to prevent any share of the offence they might occasion, from falling on the Friend whom he had engaged to give them to the Public<note place="bottom" n="b">
                  <q rend="inline">—"I also give and bequeath to the said Mr. War<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>burton, the property of all such of my Works already printed as he hath written or shall write Commenta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ries or Notes upon, and which I have not otherwise disposed of or alienated; and as he shall publish WITHOUT FUTURE ALTERATIONS."—<bibl>His last Will and Testament.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="11"/>
In discharge of this trust, the Public has here a complete Edition of his Works; ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ecuted in such a manner, as, I am persuad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, would have been to his satisfaction.</p>
            <p>The Editor hath not, for the sake of profit, suffered the Author's Name to be made cheap by a <hi>Subscription;</hi> nor his Works to be defrauded of their due Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nours by a vulgar or inelegant Impression; nor his memory to be disgraced by any pieces unworthy of his talents or virtue. On the contrary, he hath, at a very great expense, ornamented this Edition with all the advantages which the best Artists in Paper, Printing, and Sculpture could be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stow upon it.</p>
            <p>If the Public hath waited longer than the deference due to it should have suf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fered, it was owing to a reason which the Editor need not make a secret. It was his regard to the family-interests of his de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceased Friend. Mr. Pope, at his death, left large impressions of several parts of his Works, unsold; the property of which was adjudged to belong to his Execu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tors; and the Editor was willing they should have time to dispose of them to the
<pb n="v" facs="12"/>
best advantage, before the publication of this Edition (which hath been long pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pared) should put a stop to the sale.</p>
            <p>But it may be proper to be a little more particular concerning the superiority of this Edition above all the preceding; so far as Mr. Pope himself was concerned. What the Editor hath done, the Reader must collect for himself.</p>
            <p>The FIRST Volume, and the original poems in the SECOND, are here printed from a copy corrected throughout by the Author himself, even to the very preface: Which, with several additional notes in his own hand, he delivered to the Editor a little before his death. The Juvenile translations, in the other part of the SE<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>COND Volume, it was never his inten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion to bring into this Edition of his Works, on account of the levity of some, the freedom of others, and the little im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>portance of any. But these being the pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perty of other men, the Editor had it not in his power to follow the Author's in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tention.</p>
            <p>The THIRD Volume, all but the <hi>Essay on Man</hi> (which, together with the <hi>Essay</hi>
               <pb n="vi" facs="13"/>
               <hi>on Criticism,</hi> The Author, a little before his death, had corrected and published in Quarto, as a specimen of his projected Edi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion) was printed by him in his last ill<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness (but never published) in the manner it is now given. The disposition of the <hi>Epi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stle on the Characters of Men</hi> is quite al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tered; <hi>that</hi> on the <hi>Characters of Women,</hi> much enlarged; and the <hi>Epistles on Riches and Taste</hi> corrected and improved. To these advantages of the THIRD Volume, must be added a great number of fine verses taken from the Author's Manuscript-copies of these poems, communicated by him for this purpose to the Editor. These, when he first published the poems to which they belong, he thought proper, for va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rious reasons, to omit. Some from the Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nuscript-copy of the <hi>Essay on Man,</hi> which tended to discredit <hi>fate,</hi> and to recom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mend the <hi>moral government</hi> of God, had, by the Editor's advice, been restored to their places in the last Edition of that Poem. The rest, together with others of the like sort from his Manuscript-copy of the other <hi>Ethic Epistles,</hi> are here inserted
<pb n="vii" facs="14"/>
at the bottom of the page, under the title of <hi>Variations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The FOURTH Volume contains the <hi>Sa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tires;</hi> with their <hi>Prologue,</hi> the <hi>Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot;</hi> and <hi>Epilogue,</hi> the two poems intitled MDCCXXXVIII. The <hi>Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>logue</hi> and <hi>Epilogue</hi> are here given with the like advantages as the <hi>Ethic Epistles</hi> in the foregoing Volume, that is to say, with the <hi>Variations,</hi> or additional verses from the Author's Manuscripts. The <hi>Epi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>logue</hi> to the <hi>Satires</hi> is likewise inriched with many and large notes now first printed from the Author's own Manuscript.</p>
            <p>The FIFTH Volume contains a correcter and completer Edition of the <hi>Dunciad</hi> than hath been hitherto published; of which, at present I have only this further to add, That it was at my request he laid the plan of a fourth Book. I often told him, It was pity so fine a poem should re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>main disgraced by the meanness of its sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject, the most <hi>insignificant</hi> of all Dunces, bad Rymers and malevolent Cavillers: That he ought to raise and enoble it by pointing his Satire against the most <hi>per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nicious</hi> of all, Minute-philosophers and
<pb n="viii" facs="15"/>
Free-thinkers. I imagined, too, it was for the interests of Religion to have it known, that so great a Genius had a due abhorrence of these pests of Virtue and Society. He came readily into my opinion; but, at the same time, told me it would create him many Enemies. He was not mistaken. For tho' the terror of his pen kept them for some time in re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spect, yet on his death they rose with un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>restrained fury in numerous Coffee-house tales, and Grub-street libels. The plan of this admirable Satire was artfully contrived to shew, that the follies and defects of a fashionable EDUCATION naturally led to, and necessarily ended in, FREE-THINK<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ING; with design to point out the only remedy adequate to so fatal an evil. It was to advance the same ends of virtue and religion, that the Editor prevailed on him to alter every thing in his <hi>moral writings</hi> that might be suspected of hav<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the least glance towards <hi>Fate</hi> or NA<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>TURALISM; and to add what was proper to convince the world, that he was warm<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly on the side of <hi>moral Government</hi> and a <hi>revealed Will.</hi> And it would be injustice
<pb n="ix" facs="16"/>
to his memory not to declare that he em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>braced these occasions with the most un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>feigned pleasure.</p>
            <p>The SIXTH Volume consists of Mr. Pope's miscellaneous pieces in verse and prose. Amongst the <hi>Verse</hi> several fine poems make now their first appearance in his Works. And of the <hi>Prose,</hi> all that is good, and nothing but what is exquisitely so, will be found in this Edition.</p>
            <p>The SEVENTH, EIGHTH, and NINTH Volumes consist entirely of his <hi>Letters.</hi> The more valuable, as they are the only true models which we, or perhaps any of our neighbours have, of <hi>familiar Epistles.</hi> This collection is now made more com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plete by the addition of several new pieces. Yet, excepting a short explanatory letter to Col. M. and the <hi>Letters</hi> to Mr. A. and Mr. W. (the latter of which are given to shew the Editor's inducements, and the engagements he was under, to intend the care of this Edition) excepting these, I say, the rest are all here published from the Author's own printed tho' not pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lished, copies delivered to the Editor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="17"/>
On the whole, the Advantages of this Edition, above the preceding, are these, That it is the first complete collection which has ever been made of his ori<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ginal Writings; That all his principal poems, of early or later date, are here given to the public with his last corrections and improvements; That a great num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber of his verses are here first printed from the Manuscript-copies of his principal poems of later date; That many new notes of the Author's are here added to his Poems; and lastly, that several pieces, both in prose and verse, make now their first appearance before the Public.</p>
            <p>The Author's life deserves a just Vo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lume; and the Editor intends to give it. For to have been one of the first Poets in the world is but his second praise. He was in a higher Class. He was one of the <hi>noblest works of God.</hi> He was an <hi>honest Man</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="a">
                  <q>
                     <l>" A wit's a feather, and a chief's a rod,</l>
                     <l>" An honest Man's the noblest work of God.</l>
                  </q>
               </note>. A Man, who alone possessed more real virtue than, in very corrupt times, needing a Satirist like him, will sometimes fall to the share of multitudes.
<pb n="xi" facs="18"/>
In this history of his life<note place="bottom" n="b">It will be printed in the same form with this and every future edition of his works, so as to make a part of them.</note>, will be con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tained a large account of his <hi>writ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings;</hi> a critique on the nature, force, and extent of his <hi>genius,</hi> exemplified from these writings; and a vindication of his <hi>moral character</hi> exemplified by his more distinguished virtues; his filial piety, his disinterested friendships, his reverence for the constitution of his country, his love and admiration of VIRTUE, and, (what was the necessary effect) his hatred and contempt of VICE, his extensive cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity to the indigent, his warm benevo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lence to mankind, his supreme veneration of the Deity, and, above all, his sincere belief of Revelation. Nor shall his faults be concealed. It is not for the interests of his Virtues that they should. Nor indeed could they be concealed if we were so minded, for they <hi>shine</hi> thro' his Virtues; no man being more a dupe to the specious appearances of Virtue in others. In a word I mean not to be his Panegyrist, but his Historian. And may I, when Envy
<pb n="xii" facs="19"/>
and Calumny take the same advantage of my absence (for, while I live, I will freely trust it to my <hi>Life</hi> to confute them) may I find a Friend as careful of my honest fame as I have been of His! Together with his Works, he hath bequeathed me his DUNCES. So that as the property is transferred, I could wish they would now let his memory alone. The veil which Death draws over the Good is so sacred, that to throw dirt upon the Shrine scan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dalizes even Barbarians. And though Rome permitted her Slaves to calumniate her best Citizens on the day of Triumph, yet the same petulancy at their Funeral would have been rewarded with execra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion and a gibbet.</p>

               <head>PREFACE.</head>
               <p>I Am inclined to think that both the writers of books, and the readers of them, are gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rally not a little unreasonable in their expectations. The first seem to fancy that the world must ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prove whatever they produce, and the latter to imagine that authors are obliged to please them at any rate. Methinks, as on the one hand, no single man is born with a right of controuling the opi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nions of all the rest; so on the other, the world has no title to demand, that the whole care and time of any particular person should be sacrificed to its entertainment. Therefore I cannot but be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lieve that writers and readers are under equal ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ligations, for as much fame, or pleasure, as each affords the other.</p>
               <p>Every one acknowledges, it would be a wild notion to expect perfection in any work of man: and yet one would think the contrary was taken for granted, by the judgment commonly past up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on Poems. A Critic supposes he has done his part, if he proves a writer to have failed in an expres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion, or erred in any particular point: and can it then be wondered at, if the Poets in general seem resolved not to own themselves in any error? For
<pb n="ii" facs="23"/>
as long as one side will make no allowances, the other will be brought to no acknowledgements<note place="bottom" n="a">In the former editions it was thus—<hi>For as long as one side despises a well meant endeavour, the other will not be satisfied with a moderate approbation.</hi>—But the Author altered it, as these words were rather a consequence from the conclusion he would draw, than the conclusion itself, which he has now in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serted.</note>.</p>
               <p>I am afraid this extreme zeal on both sides is ill-placed; Poetry and Criticism being by no means the universal concern of the world, but only the affair of idle men who write in their clo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sets, and of idle men who read there.</p>
               <p>Yet sure upon the whole, a bad Author de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serves better usage than a bad Critic: for a Writer's endeavour, for the most part, is to please his Readers, and he fails merely through the misfor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tune of an ill judgment; but such a Critic's is to put them out of humor; a design he could ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver go upon without both that and an ill temper.</p>
               <p>I think a good deal may be said to extenuate the fault of bad Poets. What we call a Genius, is hard to be distinguished by a man himself, from a strong inclination: and if his genius be ever so great, he cannot at first discover it any other way, than by giving way to that prevalent propensity which renders him the more liable to be mistaken. The only method he has, is to make the experi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment by writing, and appealing to the judgment of others: now if he happens to write ill (which is certainly no sin in itself) he is immediately made
<pb n="iii" facs="24"/>
an object of ridicule. I wish we had the huma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity to reflect that even the worst authors might, in their endeavour to please us, deserve something at our hands. We have no cause to quarrel with them but for their obstinacy in persisting to write; and this too may admit of alleviating circumstances. Their particular friends may be either ignorant, or insincere; and the rest of the world in general is too well bred to shock them with a truth, which generally their Booksellers are the first that inform them of. This happens not till they have spent too much of their time, to apply to any profession which might better fit their talents; and till such talents as they have are so far discredited as to be but of small service to them. For (what is the hardest case imaginable) the reputation of a man generally depends upon the first steps he makes in the world, and people will establish their opinion of us, from what we do at that season when we have least judgment to direct us.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, a good Poet no sooner com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>municates his works with the same desire of in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formation, but it is imagined he is a vain young creature given up to the ambition of fame; when perhaps the poor man is all the while trembling with the fear of being ridiculous. If he is made to hope he may please the world, he falls under very unlucky circumstances: for, from the mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment he prints, he must expect to hear no more truth, than if he were a Prince, or a Beauty. If

he has not very good sense (and indeed there are twenty men of wit, for one man of sense) his living thus in a course of flattery may put him in no small danger of becoming a Coxcomb: if he has, he will consequently have so much diffidence as not to reap any great satisfaction from his praise; since, if it be given to his face, it can scarce be di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stinguished from flattery, and if in his absence, it is hard to be certain of it. Were he sure to be commended by the best and most knowing, he is as sure of being envied by the worst and most ig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>norant, which are the majority; for it is with a fine Genius as with a fine fashion, all those are dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pleased at it who are not able to follow it: and it is to be feared that esteem will seldom do any man so much good, as ill-will does him harm. Then there is a third class of people who make the largest part of mankind, those of ordinary or indifferent capacities; and these (to a man) will hate, or suspect him: a hundred honest Gentle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>men will dread him as a Wit, and a hundred in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nocent Women as a Satirist. In a word, what<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever be his fate in Poetry, it is ten to one but he must give up all the reasonable aims of life for it. There are indeed some advantages accruing from a Genius to Poetry, and they are all I can think of: the agreeable power of self-amusement when a man is idle or alone; the privilege of being admitted into the best company; and the free<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom of saying as many careless things as other
<pb n="v" facs="28"/>
people, without being so severely remarked up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on.</p>
               <p>I believe, if any one, early in his life, should contemplate the dangerous fate of authors, he would scarce be of their number on any consider<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ation. The life of a Wit is a warfare upon earth; and the present spirit of the learned world is such, that to attempt to serve it (any way) one must have the constancy of a martyr, and a resolution to suffer for its sake. I could wish people would believe what I am pretty certain they will not, that I have been much less concerned about Fame than I durst declare till this occasion, when me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thinks I should find more credit than I could here<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tofore: since my writings have had their fate already, and it is too late to think of prepossessing the reader in their favour. I would plead it as some merit in me, that the world has never been prepared for these Trifles by Prefaces, byassed by recommendations, dazled with the names of great Patrons, wheedled with fine reasons and pretences, or troubled with excuses. I confess it was want of consideration that made me an author; I writ because it amused me; I corrected because it was as pleasant to me to correct as to write; and I pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lished because I was told I might please such as it was a credit to please. To what degree I have done this, I am really ignorant; I had too much fondness for my productions to judge of them at first, and too much judgment to be pleased with
<pb n="vi" facs="29"/>
them at last. But I have reason to think they can have no reputation which will continue long, or which deserves to do so: for they have always fallen short not only of what I read of others, but even of my own Ideas of Poetry.</p>
               <p>If any one should imagine I am not in earnest, I desire him to reflect, that the Ancients (to say the least of them) had as much Genius as we: and that to take more pains, and employ more time, cannot fail to produce more complete pieces. They constantly apply'd themselves not only to that art, but to that single branch of an art, to which their talent was most powerfully bent; and it was the business of their lives to correct and finish their works for posterity. If we can pretend to have used the same industry, let us expect the same im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mortality: Tho' if we took the same care, we should still lie under a farther misfortune: they writ in languages that became universal and ever<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lasting, while ours are extremely limited both in extent and in duration. A mighty foundation for our pride! when the utmost we can hope, is but to be read in one Island, and to be thrown aside at the end of one Age.</p>
               <p>All that is left us is to recommend our produc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions by the imitation of the Ancients: and it will be found true, that, in every age, the highest cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racter for sense and learning has been obtain'd by those who have been most indebted to them. For, to say truth, whatever is very good sense, must
<pb n="vii" facs="30"/>
have been common sense in all times; and what we call Learning, is but the knowledge of the sense of our predecessors. Therefore they who say our thoughts are not our own, because they resemble the Ancients, may as well say our faces are not our own, because they are like our Fathers: And indeed it is very unreasonable, that people should expect us to be Scholars, and yet be angry to find us so.</p>
               <p>I fairly confess that I have serv'd myself all I could by reading; that I made use of the judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment of authors dead and living; that I omitted no means in my power to be inform'd of my er<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rors, both by my friends and enemies: But the true reason these pieces are not more correct, is owing to the consideration how short a time they, and I, have to live: One may be ashamed to consume half one's days in bringing sense and rhyme together; and what Critic can be so unrea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sonable, as not to leave a man time enough for any more serious employment, or more agreeable amuse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment?</p>
               <p>The only plea I shall use for the favour of the public, is, that I have as great a respect for it, as most authors have for themselves; and that I have sacrificed much of my own self-love for its sake, in preventing not only many mean things from seeing the light, but many which I thought tolerable. I would not be like those Authors, who forgive them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves some particular lines for the sake of a whole
<pb n="viii" facs="31"/>
Poem, and <hi>vice versa</hi> a whole Poem for the sake of some particular lines. I believe no one qualifica<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion is so likely to make a good writer, as the power of rejecting his own thoughts; and it must be this (if any thing) that can give me a chance to be one. For what I have published, I can only hope to be pardon'd; but for what I have burn'd, I deserve to be prais'd. On this account the world is under some obligation to me, and owes me the justice in return, to look upon no verses as mine that are not inserted in this collection. And per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps nothing could make it worth my while to own what are really so, but to avoid the imputa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of so many dull and immoral things, as partly by malice, and partly by ignorance, have been a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scribed to me. I must farther acquit myself of the presumption of having lent my name to recom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mend any Miscellanies, or Works of other men; a thing I never thought becoming a person who has hardly credit enough to answer for his own.</p>
               <p>In this office of collecting my pieces, I am al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>together uncertain, whether to look upon myself as a man building a monument, or burying the dead.</p>
               <p>If Time shall make it the former, may these Poems (as long as they last) remain as a testimony, that their Author never made his talents subservi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ent to the mean and unworthy ends of Party or Self-interest; the gratification of public prejudices, or private passions; the flattery of the undeserv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing,
<pb n="ix" facs="32"/>
or the insult of the unfortunate. If I have written well, let it be consider'd that 'tis what no man can do without good sense, a quality that not only renders one capable of being a good writer, but a good man. And if I have made any ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quisition in the opinion of any one under the no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of the former, let it be continued to me under no other title than that of the latter.</p>
               <p>But if this publication be only a more solemn funeral of my Remains, I desire it may be known that I die in charity, and in my senses; without any murmurs against the justice of this age, or any mad appeals to posterity. I declare I shall think the world in the right, and quietly submit to every truth which time shall discover to the prejudice of these writings; not so much as wishing so irrational a thing, as that every body should be deceived merely for my credit. However, I desire it may then be considered, That there are very few things in this collection which were not written under the age of five and twenty: so that my youth may be made (as it never fails to be in Executions) a case of compassion. That I was never so concerned about my works as to vindicate them in print, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lieving, if any thing was good, it would defend it<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self, and what was bad could never be defended. That I used no artifice to raise or continue a repu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tation, depreciated no dead author I was obliged to, bribed no living one with unjust praise, insulted no adversary with ill language; or when I could
<pb n="x" facs="33"/>
not attack a Rival's works, encouraged reports against his Morals. To conclude, if this volume perish, let it serve as a warning to the Critics, not to take too much pains for the future to destroy such things as will die of themselves; and a <hi>Me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mento mori</hi> to some of my vain contemporaries the Poets, to teach them that, when real merit is want<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, it avails nothing to have been encouraged by the great, commended by the eminent, and fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>voured by the public in general.</p>

I'll therefore make this Pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>face a general confession of all my thoughts of my own Poetry, resolving with the same freedom to
<pb n="xi" facs="34"/>
expose myself, as it is in the power of any other to expose them. In the first place I thank God and nature, that I was born with a love to poetry; for nothing more conduces to fill up all the inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vals of our time, or, if rightly used, to make the whole course of life entertaining: <hi>Cantantes licet usque (minus via laedet.)</hi> 'Tis a vast happiness to possess the pleasures of the head, the only plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sures in which a man is sufficient to himself, and the only part of him which, to his satisfaction, he can employ all day long. The Muses are <hi>amicae omnium horarum;</hi> and, like our gay acquaintance, the best company in the world as long as one ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pects no real service from them. I confess there was a time when I was in love with myself, and my first productions were the children of self love upon innocence. I had made an Epic Poem, and Panegyrics on all the Princes in Europe, and thought myself the greatest genius that ever was. I can't but regret those delightful visions of my childhood, which, like the fine colours we see when our eyes are shut, are vanished for ever. Many tryals and sad experience have so undeceived me by degrees, that I am utterly at a loss at what rate to value myself. As for fame I shall be glad of any I can get, and not repine at any I miss; and as for vanity, I have enough to keep me from hang<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing myself, or even from wishing those hanged who would take it away. It was this that made me write. The sense of my faults made me cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rect;

besides that it was as pleasant to me to cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rect as to write.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At p.</hi> vii. <hi>l.</hi> 9. In the first place I own that I have used my best endeavours to the finishing these pieces. That I made what advantage I could of the judgment of authors dead and living; and that I omitted no means in my power to be informed of my errors by my friends and by my enemies. And that I expect no favour on account of my youth, business, want of health, or any such idle excuses. But the true reason they are not yet more correct is owing to the consideration how short a time they and I have to live. A man that can ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pect but sixty years may be ashamed to employ thirty in measuring syllables and bringing sense and rhime together. We spend our youth in pursuit of riches or fame, in hopes to enjoy them when we are old; and when we are old, we find it is too late to enjoy any thing. I therefore hope the Wits will pardon me, if I reserve some of my time to save my soul; and that <hi>some</hi> wise men will be of my opinion, even if I should think a part of it better spent in the enjoyments of life than in pleasing the critics.</p>

               <p>THERE are not, I believe, a greater num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber of any sort of verses than of those which are called Pastorals; nor a smaller, than of those which are truly so. It therefore seems necessary to give some account of this kind of Poem, and it is my design to comprize in this short paper the substance of those numerous dissertations the Critics have made on the subject, without omitting any of their rules in my own favour. You will also find some points reconciled, about which they seem to differ, and a few remarks, which, I think, have escaped their observation.</p>
               <p>The original of Poetry is ascribed to that Age which succeeded the creation of the world: and as the keeping of flocks seems to have been the first employment of mankind, the most ancient sort of poetry was probably <hi>pastoral</hi>

                  </note>. It is natural to
<pb n="38" facs="63"/>
imagine, that the leisure of those ancient shepherds admitting and inviting some diversion, none was so proper to that solitary and sedentary life as sing<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing; and that in their songs they took occasion to celebrate their own felicity. From hence a Poem was invented, and afterwards improved to a per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect image of that happy time; which by giving us an esteem for the virtues of a former age, might recommend them to the present. And since the life of shepherds was attended with more tran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quillity than any other rural employment, the Poets chose to introduce their Persons, from whom it received the name of Pastoral.</p>
               <p>A Pastoral is an imitation of the action of a shepherd, or one considered under that character. The form of this imitation is dramatic, or narra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive, or mixed of both<note place="bottom" n="c">

                  </note>; the fable simple, the manners not too polite nor too rustic: the thoughts are plain, yet admit a little quickness and passion, but that short and flowing: the expression humble, yet as pure as the language will afford; neat, but not florid; easy, and yet lively. In short, the fable, manners, thoughts, and expressions are full of the greatest simplicity in nature.</p>
               <p>The complete character of this poem consists in simplicity<note place="bottom" n="d">
                     <bibl>Rapin de Carm. Past. p. 2.</bibl> 
                     <bibl>P.</bibl>
                  </note>, brevity, and delicacy; the two first of which render an eclogue natural, and the last delightful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="64"/>
If we would copy Nature, it may be useful to take this Idea along with us, that Pastoral is an image of what they call the golden age. So that we are not to describe our shepherds as shep<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>herds at this day really are, but as they may be conceived then to have been; when the best of men followed the employment. To carry this resemblance yet farther, it would not be amiss to give these shepherds some skill in astronomy, as far as it may be useful to that sort of life. And an air of piety to the Gods should shine through the Poem, which so visibly appears in all the works of antiquity: and it ought to preserve some relish of the old way of writing; the connection should be loose, the narrations and descriptions short<note place="bottom" n="e">
                     <bibl>Rapin, Reflex. sur l'Art Poet. d'Arist. p. 2. Refl. xxvii.</bibl> 
                     <bibl>P.</bibl>
                  </note>, and the periods concise. Yet it is not sufficient, that the sentences only be brief, the whole Eclogue should be so too. For we cannot suppose Poetry in those days to have been the business of men, but their
recreation at vacant hours.</p>
               <p>But with a respect to the present age, nothing more conduces to make these composures natural, than when some Knowledge in rural affairs is dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>covered<note place="bottom" n="f">

                  </note>. This may be made to appear rather done by chance than on design, and sometimes is best shewn by inference; lest by too much study to seem natural, we destroy that easy simplicity from whence arises the delight. For what is in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>viting
<pb n="40" facs="65"/>
in this sort of poetry proceeds not so much from the Idea of that business, as of the tranquil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lity of a country life.</p>
               <p>We must therefore use some illusion to render a Pastoral delightful; and this consists in exposing the best side only of a shepherd's life, and in con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cealing its miseries<note place="bottom" n="g">

                     <bibl>P.</bibl>
                  </note>. Nor is it enough to introduce shepherds discoursing together in a natural way; but a regard must be had to the subject; that it contain some particular beauty in itself, and that it be different in every Eclogue. Besides, in each of them a designed scene or prospect is to be pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sented to our view, which should likewise have its variety<note place="bottom" n="h">See the forementioned Preface. <bibl>P.</bibl>
                  </note>. This variety is obtained in a great de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gree by frequent comparisons, drawn from the most agreeable objects of the country; by inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rogations to things inanimate; by beautiful di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gressions, but those short; sometimes by insisting a little on circumstances; and lastly, by elegant turns on the words, which render the numbers extremely sweet and pleasing. As for the num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bers themselves, though they are properly of the heroic measure, they should be the smoothest, the most easy and flowing imaginable.</p>
               <p>It is by rules like these that we ought to judge of Pastoral. And since the instructions given for any art are to be delivered as that art is in perfec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, they must of necessity be derived from those
<pb n="41" facs="66"/>
in whom it is acknowledged so to be. It is there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore from the practice of Theocritus and Virgil (the only undisputed authors of Pastoral) that the Cri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tics have drawn the foregoing notions concerning it.</p>
               <p>Theocritus excels all others in nature and sim<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plicity. The subjects of his Idyllia are purely pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>storal; but he is not so exact in his persons, hav<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing introduced reapers <note place="bottom" n="i">
                     <bibl>ΘΕΡΙΣΤΑΙ <hi>Idyl.</hi> x. and ΑΛΙΕΙΣ Idyl. xxi.</bibl> 
                     <bibl>P.</bibl>
                  </note> and fishermen as well as shepherds. He is apt to be too long in his descri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ptions, of which that of the Cup in the first pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>storal is a remarkable instance. In the manners he seems a little defective, for his swains are sometimes abusive and immodest, and perhaps too much in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clining to rusticity; for instance, in his fourth and fifth Idyllia. But 'tis enough that all others learnt their excellencies from him, and that his Dialect alone has a secret charm in it, which no other could ever attain.</p>
               <p>Virgil, who copies Theocritus, refines upon his original: and in all points where judgment is principally concerned, he is much superior to his master. Though some of his subjects are not pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>storal in themselves, but only seem to be such; they have a wonderful variety in them, which the Greek was a stranger to<note place="bottom" n="k">

                  </note>. He exceeds him in regularity and brevity, and falls short of him in
<pb n="42" facs="67"/>
nothing but simplicity and propriety of style; the first of which perhaps was the fault of his age, and the last of his language.</p>
               <p>Among the moderns, their success has been greatest who have most endeavoured to make these ancients their pattern. The most considerable Ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nius appears in the famous Tasso, and our Spen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ser. Tasso in his Aminta has as far excelled all the Pastoral writers, as in his Gierusalemme he has out-done the Epic poets of his country. But as this piece seems to have been the original of a new sort of poem, the Pastoral Comedy, in Italy, it cannot so well be considered as a copy of the an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cients. Spenser's Calendar, in Mr. Dryden's opi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nion, is the most complete work of this kind which any nation has produced ever since the time of Virgil<note place="bottom" n="1">
                     <bibl>Dedication to Virg. Ecl.</bibl> 
                     <bibl>P.</bibl>
                  </note>. Not but that he may be thought imper<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect in some few points. His Eclogues are some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>what too long, if we compare them with the an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cients. He is sometimes too allegorical, and treats of matters of religion in a pastoral style, as Mantuan had done before him. He has employed the Lyric measure, which is contrary to the prac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tice of the old Poets. His Stanza is not still the same, nor always well chosen. This last may be the reason his expression is sometimes not concise enough: for the Tetrastic has obliged him to ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tend his sense to the length of four lines, which
<pb n="43" facs="68"/>
would have been more closely confined in the Couplet.</p>
               <p>In the manners, thoughts, and characters, he comes near to Theocritus himself; tho', notwith<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>standing all the care he has taken, he is certainly inferior in his Dialect: For the Doric had its beau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty and propriety in the Time of Theocritus; it was used in part of Greece, and frequent in the mouths of many of the greatest persons: whereas the old English and country phrases of Spenser were either entirely obsolete, or spoken only by people of the lowest condition. As there is a difference betwixt simplicity and rusticity, so the expression of sim<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple thoughts should be plain, but not clownish. The addition he has made of a Calendar to his Eclogues, is very beautiful; since by this, besides the general moral of innocence and simplicity, which is common to other authors of Pastoral, he has one peculiar to himself; he compares human Life to the several Seasons, and at once exposes to his readers a view of the great and little worlds, in their various changes and aspects. Yet the scru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pulous division of his Pastorals into Months, has obliged him either to repeat the same description, in other words, for three months together; or, when it was exhausted before, entirely to omit it: whence it comes to pass that some of his Eclogues (as the sixth, eighth, and tenth for example) have nothing but their Titles to distinguish them. The reason is evident, because the year has not that va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riety
<pb n="44" facs="69"/>
in it to furnish every month with a particular description, as it may every season.</p>
               <p>Of the following Eclogues I shall only say, that these four comprehend all the subjects which the Critics upon Theocritus and Virgil will allow to be fit for pastoral: That they have as much va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riety of description, in respect of the several sea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sons, as Spenser's: that in order to add to this variety, the several times of the day are observ'd, the rural employments in each season or time of day, and the rural scenes or places proper to such employments; not without some regard to the se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veral ages of man, and the different passions pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>per to each age.</p>
               <p>But after all, if they have any merit, it is to be attributed to some good old Authors, whose works as I had leisure to study, so I hope I have not want<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed care to imitate.</p>

Granville</hi> afterwards Lord <hi>Lansdown,</hi> Sir <hi>William Trumbal,</hi> Dr. <hi>Garth,</hi> Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> Lord <hi>Somers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mainwaring,</hi> and others. All these gave our Author the greatest encouragement, and par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticularly Mr. <hi>Walsh</hi> (whom Mr. Dryden, in his Postscript to Vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gil, calls the best critic of his age.) <q rend="inline">"The Author (says he) seems to have a particular genius for this kind of Poetry, and a judgment that much exceeds his years. He has taken very
<pb n="46" facs="71"/>
very freely from the Ancients. But what he has mixed of his own with theirs is no way inferior to what he has taken from them. It is not flattery at all to say that Virgil had written nothing so good at his Age. His Preface is very judicious and learned."</q> 
                     <hi>Letter to Mr. Wycherley, Ap.</hi> 1705. The Lord Lansdown about the same time, mentioning the youth of our Poet, says (in a printed Letter of the Character of Mr. Wy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cherley) <q rend="inline">"that if he goes on as he has begun in the Pastoral way, as Virgil first tried his strength, we may hope to see English Poety vie with the Roman,"</q> etc. Notwithstanding the ear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly time of their production, the Author esteemed these as the most correct in the versification, and musical in the numbers, of all his works. The reason for his labouring them into so much softness, was, doubtless, that this sort of poetry derives almost its whole beauty from a natural ease of thought and smoothness of verse; whereas that of most other kinds consists in the strength and fulness of both. In a letter of his to Mr. <hi>Walsh</hi> about this time we find an enumeration of several Niceties in Versification, which perhaps have never been strictly observed in any <hi>English</hi> poem, except in these Pastorals. They were not printed till 1709. <bibl>P.</bibl>

               <p>IN reading several passages of the Prophet Isaiah, which foretell the coming of Christ and the felicities attending it, I could not but observe a remarkable pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity between many of the thoughts, and those in the Pollio of Virgil. This will not seem surprising, when we reflect, that the Eclogue was taken from a Sibylline prophecy on the same subject. One may judge that Virgil did not copy it line by line, but selected such ideas as best agreed with the nature of pastoral poetry, and disposed them in that manner which served most to beautify his piece. I have endeavoured the same in this imitation of him, though without admitting any thing of my own; since it was written with this parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cular view, that the reader, by comparing the several thoughts, might see how far the images and descrip<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions of the Prophet are superior to those of the Poet. But as I fear I have prejudiced them by my management, I shall subjoin the passages of Isaiah, and those of Virgil, under the same disadvantage of a literal translation. <bibl>P.</bibl>

                     <hi>An Essay</hi>]</q> The Poem is in one book, but divided into three principals parts or members. The first [to ℣ 201.] gives rules for the <hi>Study of the Art of Criticism:</hi> the second [from thence to ℣ 560.] exposes the <hi>Causes of wrong Judgment;</hi> and the third [from thence to the end] prescribes the <hi>Morals of the Critic.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order to a right understanding of this poem, it will be ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessary to observe, that tho' it be intitled simply <hi>an Essay on Criticism,</hi> yet several of the precepts relate equally to the good <hi>writing</hi> as well as to the true <hi>judging</hi> of a poem. This is so far from violating the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Subject, that it rounds and com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pleats it: or from disordering the regularity of the <hi>Form,</hi> that it produces the highest beauty which can arise out of method, as will appear by the following considerations: 1. It was impossi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble to give a full and exact idea of the <hi>Art of poetical Criticism,</hi> without considering, at the same time, the <hi>Art of Poetry;</hi> so far as Poetry is an <hi>Art.</hi> These therefore being closely connect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed in nature, the Author has with much judgment reciprocally
<pb n="138" facs="160"/>
interwoven the precepts of both thro' his whole poem. 2. As all the rules of the ancient Critics were taken from Poets who copied nature, this is another reason why every Poet should be a Critic: Therefore, as the subject is <hi>poetical Criticism,</hi> it is fre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently addressed to the <hi>critical Poet.</hi> And 3dly, the Art of Criticism is as necessarily, and much more usefully exercised in <hi>writing</hi> than in <hi>judging.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Readers have been misled by the modesty of the <hi>Title:</hi> which only promises an Art of <hi>Criticism,</hi> in a treatise, and that a compleat one, of the Art both of <hi>Criticism</hi> and <hi>Poetry.</hi> This, and the not attending to the considerations offered above, per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps was what misled a very candid writer, after having given this Piece all the praises on the side of genius and poetry which his true taste could not resuse it, to say, that <hi>the observations fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low one another like those in</hi> Horace's Art of Poetry, <hi>without that methodical regularity which would have been requisite in a prose writer.</hi> Spec. No 235. I do not see how <hi>method</hi> can hurt any one grace of Poetry; or what prerogative there is in verse to to dispense with <hi>regularity.</hi> The remark is false in every part of it. Mr. Pope's <hi>Essay on Criticism,</hi> the Reader will soon see, is a regular piece: And a very learned Critic has lately shewn, that <hi>Horace</hi> had the same attention to method in his <hi>Art of Poetry.</hi>

                     <hi>'Tis with our judgments, etc.</hi>]</q> The author having
<pb n="139" facs="161"/>
shewn us the expediency of his subject, the Art of <hi>Criticism,</hi> next inquires [from ℣ 8 to 15] into the necessary <hi>Qualities</hi> of a <hi>true Critic:</hi> And observes first, that JUDGMENT, simply and alone, is not sufficient to constitute this character, because <hi>Judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,</hi> like the <hi>artificial measures of Time,</hi> goes different, and yet each relies upon his own. The reason is conclusive; and the similitude extremely just. For <hi>Judgment,</hi> when alone, is always regulated, or at least much inflenced by custom, fashion, and habit; and never certain and constant but when sounded upon TASTE: which is the same in the <hi>Critic,</hi> as GENIUS in the <hi>Poet:</hi> both are derived from Heaven, and like the Sun (the <hi>natural measure of Time)</hi> always constant and equal.</p>
               <p>Nor need we wonder that Judgment alone will not make a Critic in poetry, when we see that it will not make a Poet. And on examination we shall find, that <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Taste</hi> are but one and the same faculty, differently exerting itself under different names, in the two prosessions of <hi>Poet</hi> and <hi>Critic.</hi> For the Art of Poetry consists in <hi>selecting,</hi> out of all those images which present themselves to the fancy, such of them as are truly poetical: And the Art of Criticism in judiciously discerning, and fully relishing what it finds so selected. 'Tis the same opera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of the mind in both cases, and consequently, exerted by the same faculty. All the difference is, that in the Poet this fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culty is eminently joined with a <hi>bright imagination,</hi> and <hi>exten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sive comprehension,</hi> which provide stores for the selection, and can form that selection, by proportioned parts, into a regular whole: In the Critic, with a <hi>solid judgment</hi> and <hi>accurate discern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment;</hi> which penetrate into the causes of an excellence, and can shew that excellence in all its variety of lights. <hi>Longinus</hi> had <hi>taste</hi> in an eminent degree; so this, which is indeed common to all true Critics, our Author makes his distinguishing character,

occasioning those disorders before objected to it. He owns, that the <hi>seeds</hi> of <hi>Judgment</hi> are indeed sown in the minds of most men, but by ill culture, as it springs up, it generally runs wild: either on the one hand, by <hi>false knowledge</hi> which pedants call <hi>Philo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>logy;</hi> or by <hi>false reasoning</hi> which Philosophers call <hi>School-learn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing:</hi> Or on the other, by <hi>false wit</hi> which is not regulated by <hi>sense;</hi> or by <hi>false politeness</hi> which is solely regulated by the <hi>fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shion.</hi> Both these sorts, who have their Judgments thus doubly

various depravations, the several sorts of <hi>bad Critics,</hi> and ranked them into two general Classes; as the first sort, namely the men spoiled by <hi>false learning,</hi> are but few in comparison of the other, and likewise come less within his main view (which is <hi>poetical Criticism)</hi> but keep groveling at the bottom amongst <hi>words</hi> and <hi>letters,</hi> he thought it here sufficient just to have mentioned them, proposing to do them right elsewhere.

                     <hi>But you who seek, etc.</hi>]</q> Our author having thus far, by way of INTRODUCTION, explained the nature, use, and abuse of <hi>Criticism,</hi> in a figurative description of the qua<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lities and characters of <hi>Critics,</hi> proceeds now to deliver the pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cepts of the Art. The first of which, from ℣ 47 to 68. is, that he who sets up for a Critic should previously examine his own strength, and see how far he is qualified for the exercise of his profession. He puts him in a way to make this discovery, in that admirable direction given ℣ 51.<q>AND MARK THAT POINT WHERE SENSE AND DULNESS MEET.</q> He had shewn above, that <hi>Judgment,</hi> without <hi>Taste</hi> or <hi>Genius,</hi> is equally incapable of making a Critic or a Poet: In whatsoever subject then the Critic's <hi>Taste</hi> no longer accompanies his <hi>Judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,</hi> there he may be assured he is going out of his depth. This our author finely calls,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>that point where sense and dulness meet.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
And immediately adds the REASON of his precept; the Author of Nature having so constituted the mental faculties, that one of them can never excel but at the expence of another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="167"/>
From this state and ordination of the mental faculties, and the influence and effects they have one on another, our Poet draws this CONSEQUENCE, that no one genius can excell in more than one Art or Science. The <hi>consequence</hi> shews the <hi>necessity</hi> of the precept, just as the <hi>premisses,</hi> from which it is drawn, shew the <hi>reasonableness</hi> of it.</p>

VER. 68. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>First follow Nature, etc</hi>]</q> The Critic observing the directions here given, and finding himself qualified for his office, is shewn next <hi>how</hi> to exercise it. And as he was to attend to <hi>Nature</hi> for a <hi>Call,</hi> so he is first and principally to follow her when <hi>called.</hi> And here again in this, as in the foregoing pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cept, the poet [from ℣ 67 to 88.] shews both the <hi>fitness</hi> and the <hi>necessity</hi> of it. It's <hi>fitness,</hi> 1. Because Nature is the <hi>source</hi> of poetic Art; that Art being only a representation of Nature, who is its great exemplar and original. 2. Because Nature is the <hi>end</hi> of Art; the design of poetry being to convey the knowledge of
<pb n="147" facs="169"/>
Nature in the most agreeable manner. 3. Because Nature is the <hi>test</hi> of Art, as she is unerring, constant, and still the same. Hence the poet observes, that as Nature is the <hi>source,</hi> she con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veys <hi>life</hi> to Art: As she is the <hi>end,</hi> she conveys <hi>force</hi> to it, for the <hi>force</hi> of any thing arises from its being directed to its <hi>end:</hi> And, as she is the <hi>test,</hi> she conveys <hi>beauty</hi> to it, for every thing acquires <hi>beauty</hi> by its being reduced to its true <hi>standard.</hi> Such is the sense of those two important lines,
<q>
                     <l>Life, force, <hi>and</hi> beauty <hi>must to all impart,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>At once the</hi> source, <hi>and</hi> end, <hi>and</hi> test <hi>of Art.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
We now come to the <hi>necessity</hi> of the Precept. The two great constituent qualities of a <hi>Composition,</hi> as such, are <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Wit:</hi> But neither of these attains perfection, 'till the first be <hi>hid,</hi> and the other judiciously <hi>restrained;</hi> which is only then when <hi>Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture</hi> is exactly followed; for then Art never makes a parade, nor can Wit commit an extravagance. Art, while it <hi>adheres</hi> to Nature, and has so large a <hi>fund</hi> in the resources which Nature supplies, disposes every thing with so much <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>simplicity,</hi> that we see nothing but those natural images it works with, while itself stands unobserv'd behind: But when Art <hi>leaves</hi> Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture, deluded either by the bold extravagance of Fancy, or the quaint odnesses of Fashion, she is then obliged at every step to come forward, in a painful or pompous ostentation, in order to cover, to soften, or to regulate the shocking disproportion of <hi>unnatural</hi> images. In the <hi>first</hi> case, the poet compares Art to the Soul within, informing a beauteous Body; but we general<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly find it, in the <hi>last,</hi> only like the outward Habit, bolstering up, by the Taylor's skill, the defects of a mis-shapen one.—As to
<pb n="148" facs="170"/>
                  <hi>Wit,</hi> it might perhaps be imagined that this needed only <hi>Judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment</hi> to govern it: But, as he well observes,
<q>
                     <l>Wit <hi>and</hi> Judgment <hi>often are at strife,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Tho' meant each other's aid, like Man and Wife.</hi>

                  </q>
They want therefore some friendly Mediator or Reconciler, which is <hi>Nature:</hi> And in attending to her, the Judgment will learn where to comply with the charms of Wit, and the Wit how to obey the sage directions of Judgment.</p>

<pb n="149" facs="171"/>
lest this should be thought to draw the Critic from the founda<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion where he had before fixed him, he previously observes [from ℣ 87 to 92] that those <hi>Rules of Art,</hi> which he is now about to recommend to his study, were not invented by the Imagina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, but discovered in the book of Nature: And that, there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore, tho' they may seem to restrain <hi>Nature</hi> by <hi>Laws,</hi> yet, as they are laws of her own making, the Critic is still properly in the very liberty of Nature.

<pb n="150" facs="172"/>
illustrate the beauties of the best Writers, in order to excite others to an emulation of their excellence. From the admiration which these Ideas raise in him, the poet is naturally brought back to reflect on the degeneracy of modern Criticism: And as the restoring the Art to its original integrity and splendor is the great purpose of his poem, he first takes notice of those, who seem not to understand that <hi>Nature</hi> is exhaustless, that <hi>new mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dels</hi> of good writing may be produced in every age, and con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sequently <hi>new rules</hi> may be formed from these models in the same manner as the old Critics formed theirs, from the writings of the ancient Poets: but these men wanting art and ability to form these <hi>new rules,</hi> are content to receive, and file up for use, the <hi>old ones</hi> of <hi>Aristotle, Quintilian, Longinus, Horace, etc.</hi> with the same vanity and boldness that Apothecaries practise with their Doctors bills: And thus rashly applying them to <hi>new Originals</hi> (cases which they did not hit) it was no more in their power than their inclination to imitate the candid practice of the <hi>An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cients,</hi> when

                     <hi>Of all the causes, etc.</hi>]</q> The first cause of wrong Judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment is PRIDE. He judiciously begins with it, [from ℣ 200 to 215] as on other accounts, so on this, that it is the very thing which gives modern Criticism its character; whose com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plexion is <hi>abuse</hi> and <hi>censure.</hi> He calls it the vice of <hi>Fools;</hi> by whom are not meant those to whom Nature has given no Judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment (for he is here speaking of what misleads the Judgment) but those in whom education and study has made no improve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment; as appears from the happy similitude of an <hi>ill-nourish'd</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="184"/>
                  <hi>body;</hi> where the same words which express the <hi>cause,</hi> expres. likewise the <hi>nature</hi> of pride:
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>For as in bodies, thus in souls, we find,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>What wants in blood and spirits, swell'd with wind.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
'Tis the business of reason, he tells us, to dispel the <hi>cloud</hi> which pride throws over the mind: But the mischief is, that the rays of reason, diverted by self-love, sometimes <hi>gild</hi> this <hi>cloud,</hi> instead of <hi>dissipating</hi> it. So that the Judgment, by false lights reflected back upon itself, is still apt to be a little dazzled, and to mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>take its object. He therefore advises to call in still more helps:
<q>
                     <l>Trust not yourself; <hi>but your defects to know,</hi>
                     </l>

                  </q>
Both the <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>conclusion</hi> of this precept are remarkable. The question is of the means to subdue Pride: He directs the Critic to begin with a <hi>distrust of himself;</hi> and this is <hi>Modesty,</hi> the <hi>first</hi> mortification of Pride: And then to seek the assistance of others, and <hi>make use even of an Enemy;</hi> and this is <hi>Humility,</hi> the <hi>last</hi> mortification of Pride: For when a man can once bring himself to submit to profit by an enemy, he has either already quite subdued his Vanity, or is in a fair way of so doing.</p>

               <p>He exposes the folly of judging by parts very artfully, not by a direct description of that sort of Critic, but of his opposite, <hi>a perfect Judge, etc.</hi> Nor is the elegance of this conversion in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferior to the art of it; for as, in <hi>poetic style,</hi> one word or figure is still put for another, in order to catch new lights from dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent images, and to reflect them back upon the subject in hand; so, in <hi>poetic matter,</hi> one person or thing may be advan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tageously employed for another, with the same elegance of re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>presentation. It is observable that our Author makes it almost the necessary consequence of judging <hi>by parts,</hi> to find fault: And this not without much discernment: For the several <hi>parts</hi> of a compleat <hi>Whole,</hi> when <hi>seen only singly,</hi> and <hi>known only indepen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dently,</hi>
                  <pb n="166" facs="188"/>
must always have the appearance of irregularity; often, of deformity: Because the Poet's design being to <hi>create</hi> a result<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ive beauty from the artful assemblage of several various <hi>parts</hi> into one natural <hi>whole;</hi> those parts must be fashioned with re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard to their mutual relations in the stations they occupy in that whole, from whence, the beauty required is to arise: But that <hi>regard</hi> will occasion so unreducible a form in each part, when <hi>considered singly,</hi> as to present a very mis-shapen appearance.</p>

Now as this is a plausible pretence for their inconstancy; and our author has himself afterwards laid down the like thought, in a <hi>precept</hi> for a remedy against obstinacy and pride, where he says, ℣ 570.

he has been careful, by the turn of the expression in this place, to shew the difference. For <hi>Time,</hi> considered only as <hi>duration,</hi> vitiates as frequently as it improves: Therefore to expect wis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom as the necessary attendant of <hi>length of years,</hi> unrelated to <hi>long experience,</hi> is vain and delusive. This he illustrates by a remarkable example; where we see <hi>Time,</hi> instead of becoming <hi>wiser,</hi> destroying <hi>good letters,</hi> to substitute <hi>school divinity</hi> in their place.—The <hi>genius</hi> of which kind of learning; the <hi>character</hi> of its professors; and the <hi>sate,</hi> which, sooner or later, always at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tends whatsoever is wrong or false, the poet sums up in those four lines;

<pb n="190" facs="212"/>
to <hi>enjoy their existence</hi> early. He compares the life of <hi>modern Wit,</hi> and of the <hi>ancient,</hi> which survives in an universal language, to the difference between the Patriarchal age and our own: And observes, that while the ancient writings live for ever, as it were in brass and marble, the modern are but like <hi>Paintings,</hi> which, of how masterly a hand soever, have no sooner gained their requisite perfection by the incorporating, softening, and ripening of their tints, which they do in a very few years, but they begin to fade and die away. 3. Lastly, our author shews, that the Critic ought to do this service <hi>out of regard to the Poet;</hi> when he considers the slender dowry the Muse brings along with her: In <hi>youth</hi> 'tis only a short lived vanity; and in <hi>maturer years</hi> an accession of care and labour, in proportion to the weight of Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>putation to be sustained, and of the increase of Envy to be oppo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sed: And concludes his reasoning therefore on this head, with that pathetic and insinuating address to the Critic, from 508 to 524.<q>

But if the four critical humour must needs have vent, he points to its right object; and shews [from ℣ 526 to 556.] how it may be usefully and innocently diverted. This is very observable; for our author makes spleen and disdain the characteristic of the <hi>false Critic,</hi> and yet here supposes them inherent in the <hi>true.</hi> But it is done with judgment, and a knowledge of nature. For as bitterness and acerbity in un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ripe fruits of the best kind are the foundation and capacity of that high spirit, race, and flavour which we find in them, when perfectly concocted by the heat and influence of the Sun; and which, without those qualities, would often gain no more by that influence than only a <hi>mellow insipidity:</hi> so spleen and disdain in the true Critic, improved by long study and experience, ripen into an exactness of Judgment and an elegance of Taste: But, lying in the false Critic remote from
<pb n="194" facs="216"/>
the influence of good letters, continue in all their first offensive harshness and astringency. The Poet therefore shews how, af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter the exaltation of these qualities into their state of perfection, the very <hi>Dregs</hi> (which, tho' precipitated, may possibly, on some occasions, rise and ferment even in a <hi>noble mind)</hi> may be use<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fully employed in branding OBSCENITY and IMPIETY. Of these he explains the rise and progress, in a beautiful picture of the different genius's of the reigns of <hi>Charles</hi> II. and <hi>William</hi> III. the former of which gave course to the most <hi>profligate luxury;</hi> the latter to a <hi>licentious impiety.</hi> These are the criminals the poet assigns over to the caustic hand of the Critic, but concludes however, from ℣ 556 to 561. with this necessary admonition, to take care not to be misled into unjust censure; either on the one hand, by a pharisaical <hi>niceness,</hi> or on the other by a con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sciousness of guilt. And thus the <hi>second division</hi> of his Essay ends: The judicious conduct of <hi>which</hi> is worthy our observa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion.

It is a tradition preserved by Servius, that Virgil began with writing a poem of the Alban and Roman affairs; which he found above his years, and descended first to imitate Theocritus on rural subjects, and afterwards to copy Homer in Heroic poetry. <bibl>P.</bibl>

               <p>IT will be in vain to deny that I have some regard for this piece, since I dedicate it to You. Yet you may bear me witness, it was intended only to divert a few young Ladies, who have good sense and good hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mour enough to laugh not only at their sex's little un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guarded follies, but at their own. But as it was com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>municated with the air of a Secret, it soon found its way into the world. An imperfect copy having been offer'd to a Bookseller, you had the good-nature for my sake to consent to the publication of one more correct: This I was forc'd to, before I had executed half my de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sign, for the Machinery was entirely wanting to com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pleat it.</p>
               <p>The Machinery, Madam, is a term invented by the Critics, to signify that part which the Deities, Angels, or Daemons are made to act in a Poem: For the an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cient Poets are in one respect like many modern Ladies: let an action be never so trivial in itself, they always make it appear of the utmost importance. These Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chines I determin'd to raise on a very new and odd foun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dation, the Rosicrucian doctrine of Spirits.</p>
               <p>I know how disagreeable it is to make use of hard words before a Lady; but 'tis so much the concern of a Poet to have his works understood, and particularly by your Sex, that you must give me leave to explain two or three difficult terms.</p>
               <p>The Rosicrucians are a people I must bring you ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quainted with. The best account I know of them is in
<pb n="216" facs="236"/>
a French book call'd <hi>Le Comte de Gabalis,</hi> which both in its title and size is so like a Novel, that many of the Fair Sex have read it for one by mistake. According to these Gentlemen, the four Elements are inhabited by Spirits, which they call Sylphs, Gnomes, Nymphs, and Salamanders. The Gnomes or Daemons of Earth de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>light in mischief; but the Sylphs, whose habitation is in the Air, are the best-condition'd creatures imagina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble. For they say, any mortals may enjoy the most in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timate familiarities with these gentle Spirits, upon a con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dition very easy to all true Adepts, an inviolate preser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vation of Chastity.</p>
               <p>As to the following Canto's, all the passages of them are as fabulous, as the Vision at the beginning, or the Transformation at the end; (except the loss of your Hair, which I always mention with reverence.) The Human persons are as fictitious as the Airy ones; and the character of Belinda, as it is now manag'd, resem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bles you in nothing but in Beauty.</p>
               <p>If this Poem had as many Graces as there are in your Person, or in your Mind, yet I could never hope it should pass thro' the world half so Uncensur'd as You have done. But let its fortune be what it will, mine is happy enough, to have given me this occasion of as<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>suring you that I am, with the truest esteem,</p>

                           <p>It appears, by this Motto, that the following Poem was written or published at the Lady's request. But there are some further circumstances not unworthy relating. Mr. Caryl (a Gentleman who was Secretary to Queen Mary, wife of James II. whose fortunes he followed into France, Author of the Co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>medy of <hi>Sir Solomon Single,</hi> and of several translations in Dry<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>den's Miscellanies) originally proposed the subject to him in a view of putting an end, by this piece of ridicule, to a quarrel that was risen between two noble Families, those of Lord Petre and of Mrs. Fermor, on the trifling occasion of his having cut off a lock of her hair. The Author sent it to the Lady, with whom he was acquainted; and she took it so well as to give about co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pies of it. That first sketch, (we learn from one of his Letters) was written in less than a fortnight, in 1711. in two Canto's only, and it was so printed; first, in a Miscellany of Bern. Lin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tot's, without the name of the Author. But it was received so well that he made it more considerable the next year by the addition of the machinery of the Sylphs, and extended it to five Canto's. We shall give the reader the pleasure of seeing in what manner these additions were inserted, so as to seem not to be added, but to grow out of the Poem. See Notes, Cant.

                           <hi>Her Guardian Sylph</hi>]</q> When Mr. Pope had pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jected to give this Poem its present form, he was obliged to find it with its Machinery. For as the subject of the Epic Poem consists of two parts, the <hi>metaphysical</hi> and the <hi>civil;</hi> so this mock epic, which is of the satiric kind, and receives its grace from a ludicrous imitation of the other's pomp and solemnity, was to have the same division of the subject. And, as the <hi>civil</hi> part is intenti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>onally debased by the choice of an insignificant action: so should the <hi>metaphysical,</hi> by the use of some very extravagant system. A rule, which tho' neither Boileau nor Garth have been careful enough to attend to, our Author's good sense would not suffer him to overlook. And that sort of Machinery which his judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment taught him was only fit for his use, his admirable inven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion supplied. There was but one System in all nature which was to his purpose, the <hi>Rosicrucian Philosophy;</hi> and this, by the well directed effort of his imagination, he presently seized upon. The fanatic Alchemists, in their search after the great secret, had invented a <hi>means</hi> altogether proportioned to their <hi>end.</hi> It was a kind of Theological-Philosophy, made up of almost equal mix<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tures of Pagan Platonism, Christian Quietism, and the Jewish Cabbala; a composition enough to fright Reason from human commerce. This general system, he tells us, he took as he found it in a little French tract called, <hi>Le Comte de Gabalis.</hi> This book is written in Dialogue, and is a delicate and very ingeni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous
<pb n="220" facs="241"/>
piece of raillery of the Abbe Villiers, upon that invisible sect, of which the stories that went about at that time, made a great deal of noise at Paris. But, as in this satirical Dialogue, Mr. P. found several whimsies, of a very high mysterious kind, told of the nature of these elementary beings, which were very unfit to come into the machinery of such a sort of poem, he has with great judgment omitted them; and in their stead, made use of the Legendary stories of Guardian Angels, and the Nursery Tales of the Fairies; which he has artfully accommodated to the rest of the <hi>Rosicrucian System.</hi> And to this, (unless we will be so uncharitable to believe he intended to give a needless scandal) we must suppose he referred, in these two lines,
<q>
                           <l>
                              <hi>If e'er one Vision touch'd thy infant thought,</hi>
                           </l>
                           <l>
                              <hi>Of all the</hi> nurse, <hi>and all the</hi> priest <hi>have taught.</hi>
                           </l>
                        </q>
Thus, by the most beautiful invention imaginable, he has con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trived, that, as in the serious Epic. the popular belief supports the Machinery; so, in his mock Epic, the Machinery should be contrived to dismount philosophic pride and arrogance.</p>

            <head>ELEGY To the MEMORY of an UNFORTUNATE LADY<note place="bottom" n="*">See
the Duke of Buckingham's verses to a Lady designing to retire into a
Monastery compared with Mr. Pope's Letters to several Ladies, p. 206. She
seems to be the same person whose unfortunate death is the subject of
this poem.

               <l>Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade?</l>
               <l>'Tis she!—but why that bleeding bosom gor'd,</l>
               <l>Why dimly gleams the visionary sword?</l>
               <l n="5">Oh ever beauteous, ever friendly! tell,</l>
               <l>Is it, in heav'n, a crime to love too well?</l>
               <l>To bear too tender, or too firm a heart,</l>
               <l>To act a Lover's or a Roman's part?</l>
               <l>Is there no bright reversion in the sky,</l>

abodes;</l>
               <l>The glorious fault of Angels and of Gods:</l>
               <l n="15">Thence to their images on earth it flows,</l>
               <l>And in the breasts of Kings and Heroes glows.</l>
               <l>Most souls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age,</l>
               <l>Dull sullen pris'ners in the body's cage:</l>
               <l>Dim lights of life, that burn a length of years</l>
               <l n="20">Useless, unseen, as lamps in sepulchres;</l>

               <l>From these perhaps (ere nature bade her die)</l>

               <l>See on these ruby lips the trembling breath,</l>
               <l>These cheeks, now fading at the blast of death;</l>
               <l>Cold is that breast which warm'd the world before,</l>
               <l>And those love-darting eyes must roll no more.</l>
               <l n="35">Thus, if Eternal justice rules the ball,</l>
               <l>Thus shall your wives, and thus your children fall:</l>

               <l>And frequent herses shall besiege your gates.</l>
               <l>There passengers shall stand, and pointing say,</l>
               <l n="40">(While the long fun'rals blacken all the way)</l>
               <l>Lo these were they, whose souls the Furies steel'd,</l>
               <l>And curs'd with hearts unknowing how to yield.</l>
               <l>Thus unlamented pass the proud away,</l>
               <l>The gaze of fools, and pageant of a day!</l>
               <l>So perish all, whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>TO wake the soul by tender strokes of art,</l>
                  <l>To raise the genius, and to mend the heart;</l>
                  <l>To make mankind, in conscious virtue bold,</l>
                  <l>Live o'er each scene, and be what they behold:</l>
                  <l n="5">For this the Tragic Muse first trod the stage,</l>
                  <l>Commanding tears to stream thro' ev'ry age;</l>
                  <l>Tyrants no more their savage nature kept,</l>
                  <l>And foes to virtue wonder'd how they wept.</l>
                  <l>Our author shuns by vulgar springs to move</l>
                  <l n="10">The hero's glory, or the virgin's love;</l>
                  <l>In pitying Love, we but our weakness show,</l>
                  <l>And wild Ambition well deserves its woe.</l>

                  <l>And calls forth Roman drops from British eyes.</l>

                  <l>What Plato thought, and godlike Cato was:</l>
                  <l>No common object to your sight displays,</l>

                  <l>A brave man struggling in the storms of fate,</l>
                  <l>And greatly falling with a falling state.</l>
                  <l>While Cato gives his little Senate laws,</l>

                  <l>The spoils of nations, and the pomp of wars,</l>
                  <l>Ignobly vain and impotently great,</l>
                  <l n="30">Show'd Rome her Cato's figure drawn in state;</l>
                  <l>As her dead Father's rev'rend image past,</l>

eye;</l>
                  <l>The World's great Victor pass'd unheeded by;</l>
