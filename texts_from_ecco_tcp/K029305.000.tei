            <p>SOME copies of spurious impressions of the Cozeners and the Maid of Bath, having been printed and circulated before the application to the Court of Chancery for an Injunction, it has been thought advisable, in vindication of the property of the Editor, as well as in justice to the deceased Author, imme<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diately to commit to the press genuine editions of the two dramatick pieces above-mentioned, together with THIS COMEDY, which had been also without authority advertised for publication.</p>
            <p>On inspection of the spurious impressions, it appears, that all the errors of careless and igno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rant transcribers are there religiously preserved; and all the additions and improvements, made by the facetious Writer, are omitted. Many instances of this will occur on perusal of those Comedies, and particularly the Cozeners; in which, besides the restoration of several passages always spoken on the stage, the Reader will find a whole scene, at the end of the First Act, and
<pb n="vi" facs="4"/>
another, still more entertaining and popular, at the beginning of the Third; both which were wholly wanting in the spurious Impressions.</p>
            <p>Unauthorized publications are not only always detrimental to private property, but commonly prove injurious to the publick: For the copies, being obtained by clandestine and indirect means, are, for the most part, as has happened in the present instance, incorrect and imperfect.</p>

               <speaker>Sir Thomas.</speaker>
               <p>WHY, the woman is mad! these curs'd news-paper patriots have shatter'd her brains! nothing less than a senator of seven years standing can conceive what she means.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Sir Thomas, my conversation is neither deficient in order, precision, or dignity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>Dignity! and what occasion for dignity in tne common concerns of my house? why the deuce can't you converse like the rest of the world? If you want money to pay off my bills, you move me for further supplies; if I turn away a
<pb n="2" facs="7"/>
servant, you condemn me for so often changing my ministry; and because I lock up my daugh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter, to prevent her eloping with the paltry clerk of a pitiful trader, it is forsooth an invasion of the Bill of Rights, and a mortal stab to the great Charter of Liberty.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>As Serjeant Second'em said in the debate on the corn-bill, <q>Then why don't you chuse better ground, brother, and learn to enlarge your bottom a little? Consider, you must draw the line of liberty somewhere; for if these rights belong</q>‚Äî</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>Mercy on us!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>But indeed, my dear brother, you are got quite out of your depth: Woman, I tell you, is a microcosm, and rightly to rule her requires as great talents, as to govern a state. And what says the Aphorism of Cardinal Polignac? <q>If you would not have a person deceive you, be careful not to let him know you mistrust him!</q> and so of your daughter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>Mrs. Margaret Maxwell, bestow your advice where it is wanted! Out of my depth? a likely story indeed, that I, who am fix'd here in a national trust, appointed guardian of the Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lish interest at the court of Madrid, should not know how to manage a girl!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>And pray, Mr. Consul, what informa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
<pb n="3" facs="8"/>
will your station afford you? I don't deny your knowledge in export and import, nor doubt your skill in the difference between wet and dry goods; you may weigh with exactness the bal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lance of trade, or explain the true spirit of a treaty of commerce; the surface, the mere skimmings of the political pot!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>Mighty well!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>But had you, with me, traced things to their original source; had you discover'd all social subordination to arise from original compact; had you read Machiavel, Montesquieu, Locke, Bacon, Hobbes, Harrington, Hume; had you studied the political testaments of Alberoni and Cardinal Richlieu‚Äî</p>

               <p>Had you analiz'd the Pragmatic Sanc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, and the family-compact; had you toil'd thro' the laborious page of the Vinerian professor, or esti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mated the prevailing manners with the Vicar of Newcastle; in a word, had you read Amicus upon Taxation, and Inimicus upon Representa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, you would have known‚Äî</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>That, in spite of the frippery French Salick laws, woman is a free agent, a noun substantive entity, and, when treated with con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fidence‚Äî‚Äî</p>

               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>Why, perhaps, she may not abuse it: But still, my sage sister, it is but a <hi>perhaps</hi>; now my method is certain, infallible; by confining her, I can't be deceiv'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>And pray, Sir, what right have you to confine her? look in your Puffendorff! tho' born in Spain, she is a native of England; her birth-right is liberty‚Äîa better patrimonial estate than any of your despotic countries could give her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>Zooks, you would tire the patience of Job! Pray answer me this; is Harriet my daughter?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>What then? for that inestimable blessing she is not beholden to you; nor can you, tho' a father, with reason, justice, or law, take it from her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Margaret, you forget where you are! This, child, is the town of Madrid; you are amongst a sage, steady people, who know and revere the natural rights of a parent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>Natural rights! Can a right to tyran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nize be founded in nature?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>Look'ee, Margaret! you are but losing your time; for unless you can prevail on Count Wall, or the president of Castille, to grant you a Habeas, why Harriet shall stay where she is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, ay, you know where you are; but,
<pb n="5" facs="10"/>
if my niece will take my advice, the justice that is denied to her here, she will instantly seek for elsewhere.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>Elsewhere? hark you, sister! is it thus you answer my purpose in bringing you hither? I hop'd to have my daughter's principles form'd by your prudence; her conduct directed by your ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perience and wisdom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>The preliminary is categorically true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>Then why don't you abide by the treaty?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; you have given me powerful motives!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Tho.</speaker>
               <p>But another word, madam! as I don't chuse that Harriet should imbibe any more of your romantic republican notions, I shall take it as a great favour if you would prepare to quit this country with the first opportunity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Marg.</speaker>
               <p>You need not have remonstrated; a peti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion would have answered your purpose: I did in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tend to withdraw, and without taking leave; nor will I reside on a spot where the great charter of my sex is hourly invaded! No, Sir Thomas, I shall re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn to the land of liberty! but there expect to have your despotic dealings properly and publickly handled.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Inv.</speaker>
               <p>Banish your fears, and let us look forward, my love.</p>

               <p>Nay, I have gone too far to retreat. Well, Sir, what is next to be done?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Inv.</speaker>
               <p>The Spaniards are naturally generous; perhaps, upon hearing our story, the owner of the house may lend his assistance. This, I sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose, is the Laboratory, and this door leads to the shop.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Why, my pretty Miss, what risque do you run? your affairs can hardly be changed for the worse.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Har.</speaker>

               <p>Believe me, Miss, as matters stand, we can be of mutual use: Your lover may deliver me from prison, and I can prevent you both from go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing into confinement.</p>

               <p>Do, madam! I am a Devil of honour. Besides, you have but a little time to consider; in less than five minutes, you will have the Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sul and all his crew in the house.</p>

               <p>I am not surpriz'd, Miss, that you are a little shock'd at my figure: I could have assum'd a much more agreeable form; but as we are to be a little better acquainted, I thought it best to quit all disguise and pretence; therefore, madam, you see me just as I am.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Har.</speaker>
               <p>Really, Sir, I can hardly say what I ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pected to see.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Devil.</speaker>
               <p>I own it is a puzzling question; at least, if the world does us justice in the contradictory qualities they are pleas'd to afford us.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Devil.</speaker>
               <p>Why, for all their superlative epithets, you cannot but see how much men are beholden to us; by our means it is that you measure the extent both of your virtues and vices.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Devil.</speaker>
               <p>As thus: In describing your friends, or your foes, they are <hi>devilish</hi> rich, <hi>devilish</hi> poor, <hi>devilish</hi> ugly, <hi>devilish</hi> handsome; now and then, indeed, to vary the mode of conversing, you make a little free with our condition and country, as, <hi>hellish</hi> dull, <hi>damn'd</hi> clever, <hi>hellish</hi> cold; Psha! how <hi>damn'd</hi> hot it is!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Inv.</speaker>
               <p>True, Sir; but I consider this as a rhetori<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cal figure, a manner of speaking devis'd and practis'd by dulness, to conceal the lack of ideas, and the want of expressions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Devil.</speaker>
               <p>Partly that, I confess: Not but there is some truth in the case; for at different times we

have the power, and do assume the various forms, you assign us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Inv.</speaker>
               <p>We? I observe you always make use of the plural; is that, Sir, by way of distinction, or, is your family pretty large and extensive?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Devil.</speaker>
               <p>Multitudinous as the sands on the beach, or the moats in a sun-beam: How the deuce else do you think we could do all the business below? Why, there's scarce an individual amongst you, at least of any rank or importance, but has five or six of us in his train.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Devil.</speaker>
               <p>The Daemon of Power and I had long laid siege to a subject, the man a grandee; I was then a popular spirit, and wore the mask of a patriot; at different times, we possessed him by turns; but, in the midst of a violent struggle (by which means I got lame on this leg, and ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tained the nick-name of the Devil Upon Sticks), the Daemon of Vanity, a low under-strapper amongst us, held over his head a circle of gold, with five knobs on the top, and, <hi>whew!</hi> flew away with our prize in an instant.</p>

               <p>The law had laid hold of an old friend of his, for being too positive as to a matter of fact; evidence, evasion, protraction, pleas, every art, was employed to acquit him, that the most consummate skill could suggest; but all to no purpose.</p>

               <speaker>Devil.</speaker>
               <p>A legal loop-hole, that the lawyers leave open for a rogue now and then to creep through, that the game mayn't be wholly de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stroyed.</p>

               <p>Not at all. Why, Sir, when matters grew desperate, and the case was given over for lost, little Belzy starts up in the form of an able practitioner, and humbly conceived, that his client could not be convicted upon that indictment; forasmuch as therein he was charg'd with forswearing himself NOW; whereas it clearly appeared, by the evidence, that he had only forsworn himself THEN: If, indeed, he had been indicted generally, for committing perjury <hi>now</hi> AND <hi>then,</hi> proofs might be produced of any perjury he may have committed; whereas, by limiting the point of time to the <hi>now,</hi> no proofs could be admitted as to the <hi>then</hi>: So that, with submission, he humbly conceived, his client was clearly absolved, and his character as fair and as spotless as a babe that's just born, and immaculate as a sheet of white paper.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>And with what arms are we to defend it? where are our cannon? We have mortars indeed, but then they are fit to hold nothing but pestles; and, as to our small arms, of what use can they be in a siege? they are made, you know, to attack only the rear.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Come, come, Mr. Julep, you make too light of these matters: To have the lawful descendants from Galen, the throne of Esculapius, overturned by a parcel of Goths!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Peace, Apozem, or treat your betters with proper respect! What, numskull, do you think all physicians are blockheads, who have not washed their hands in the Cam or the Isis?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but I hope you will allow that a university-doctor‚Äî</p>

               <p>May, for aught you know, be a dunce. Besides, fool, what have we to do with degrees? The doctor that doses best is the best doctor for us. You talk of the College; there are some of their names, I am sure, that I never desire to see on my file.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed!</p>

               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed? no, indeed. Why, there's Dr. Diet, that makes such a dust: He had a person of fashion, a patient of mine, under his care t'other day; as fine a slow fever! I was in hopes of half making my fortune‚Äî</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; I love a slow fever. Was it nervous?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Ay; with a lovely dejection of spirits.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>That was delightful, indeed! I look upon the nerves and the bile to be the two best friends we have to our back.‚ÄîWell, pray, and how did it answer?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all; the scoundrel let him slip through my hands for a song; only a paltry six pounds and a crown.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Shameful!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Infamous! and yet, forsooth, he was one of your College. Well, now to shew you the difference in men; but the very week after, Dr. Linctus, from Leyden, run me up a bill of thirty odd pounds, for only attending Alderman Soakpot six days in a surfeit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, that was doing of business.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Ah! that's a sweet pretty practitioner, Apozem: We must all do our utmost to push him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Without doubt. But, notwithstand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing all that you say, Mr. Julep, there are some of the gentlemen of the College, that I know‚Äî</p>

               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Ah! as fine fellows as ever fingered a pulse; not one of the trade will deny it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>But, amongst all now, old Nat Night<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shade is the man for my money.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; Nat, Nat has merit, I own; but, pox take him! he is so devilish quick: To be sure, he has a very pretty fluent pen whilst it lasts; but then he makes such dispatch, that one has hardly time to send in two dozen of draughts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; the doctor drives on, to be sure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Drives on! If I am at all free in the house when old Nightshade is sent for, as a pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>paratory dose I always recommend an attorney.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>An attorney? for what?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>To make the patient's will, before he swallows the doctor's prescription.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>That is prudent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; I generally afterwards get the thanks of the family.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>What, Mr. Julep, for the attorney, or the physician? ha, ha!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Ha, ha! you are arch, little Apozem; quite a wag, I profess.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Why, you know, brother Julep, these are subjects upon which one can hardly be serious.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>True, true; but then you should never laugh loud in the street: We may indulge, indeed, a kind of simpering smile to our patients, as we
<pb n="32" facs="37"/>
drive by in our chariots; but then there is a decency, not to say dignity, that becomes the publick dem√©anour of us, who belong to the faculty.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>True. And yet there are times when one can hardly forbear: Why, t'other day now I had like to have burst: I was following a fune<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral into St. George's‚Äîa sweet pretty burying; velvet pall, hatband and gloves; and, indeed, the widow was quite handsome in all things; paid my bill the next week, without sconcing off six<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pence, though they were thought to have lived hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pily together‚Äîbut, as I was a-saying, as we were entering the church, who should stand in the porch but Kit Cabbage the taylor, with a new pair of breeches under his arm: The sly rogue made me a bow, <q rend="inline">"Servant, master Apozem!" says he; "what, you are carrying home your work too, I see."</q> Did you ever hear such a dog?</p>

               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, ay; let them, let them‚ÄîBut, is not that Dr. Squib that is crossing the way?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Apozem.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; you may see it is Squib, by his shuffle. What, I suppose now he is scouring away for the College.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>

               <speaker>Julep.</speaker>
               <p>No? Lord help you! he is too much taken up with the national illness, to attend to particular ails: Why, he would quit the best patient in town, to hunt after a political secret; and would rather have a whisper from a great man in the Court of Requests, than five hundred pounds for attending him in a chronical case.</p>

               <p>That's well! Mind your business, and go on but as you begin, and I foresee your fortune is made: Come, who knows but in a little time, if you are a good boy, you may get yourself committed to Newgate.</p>

               <p>Why, I don't know, master; the neigh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bours were frightful, and would not consent; otherwise, by this time, 'tis my belief, men, women, and children, I might have occupied twenty thou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sand at least.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Devil.</speaker>
               <p>Upon my word!‚ÄîBut, you say a dozen years, master Last: As you have practised phy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sic without permission so long, what makes you now think of getting a licence?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Why, it is all along with one Lotion, a pottercarrier, that lives in a little town hard by we; he is grown old and lascivious, I think, and threatens to present me at size, if so be I practize any longer.</p>

               <speaker>Last.</speaker>
               <p>Right, master; you have guessed the matter at once. So I was telling my tale to Sawney M'Gregor, who comes now and then to our town with his pack; God, he advised me to get made a doctor at once, and send for a diplummy from Scotland.</p>

               <p>True. But my master Tyth'em tells me, that I can get it done for pretty near the same price here in London; so, I had rather, d'ye see, lay out my money at home, than transport it to foreign parts, as we say; because why, master, I thinks there has too much already gone that road.</p>

               <p>I tell you, Dr. Fingerfee‚ÄîI am sorry, d'ye see, to differ from so old a practitioner; but I don't like your prescription at all, at all: For what signifies a palliative regiment, with such a rotten constitution?

            <sp>
               <speaker>Osas.</speaker>
               <p>Dr. Osasafras, at your humble service.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Osas.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I have the honour to be a native of Ireland.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sligo.</speaker>
               <p>Osasafras? that's a name of no note; he is not a Milesian, I am sure. The family, I suppose, came over t'other day with Strongbow, not above seven or eight hundred years ago; or perhaps a descendant from one of Oliver's drummers.‚Äî'Pon my conscience, doctor, I should hardly belave you were Irish.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Osas.</speaker>
               <p>What, Sir, d'ye doubt my veracity?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sligo.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all, my dear doctor; it is not for that: But, between me and yourself, you have lived a long time in this town.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Osas.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sligo.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sligo.</speaker>
               <p>Very well, my dear doctor: Then, putting that and t'other together, my notion of the upshot is, that if so be you are a native of Ireland, upon my conscience, you must have been born there very young.</p>

               <p>Right. Those yellow flies give the tinge to the skin, and undoubtedly cause the disease: And, now, for the cure! I administer to every patient the two-and-fiftieth part of a scruple of the ovaria or eggs of the spider; these are thrown by the digestive powers into the secretory, there separated from the alimentory, and then preci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pitated into the circulatory; where finding a pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>per nidus, or nest, they quit their torpid state, and vivify, and, upon vivification, discerning

               <p>Nothing better: Believe me, the ab<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>solute direction of the persons and purses of a large congregation, however low their conditions and callings, is by no means a contemptible object. I, for my own part, can say, what the Conqueror of Persia said to the Cynic; <q>If I was not Alexander, I would be Diogenes:</q> So, if I was not the Devil, I would chuse to be a Methodist Preacher.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Devil.</speaker>
               <p>Simony, Sir, is a new kind of canon, devised by these upstart fanatics, that makes it sinful not to abuse the confidence, and piously plunder the little property, of an indigent man and his family.</p>

               <p>A most noble piece of casuistical cookery, and exceeds even the sons of Ignatius! But this honour I must beg to decline.</p>

               <p>What think you then of trying the stage? You are a couple of good theatrical figures; but how are your talents? can you sing?</p>

               <p>I can't boast of much skill, Sir; but Miss Harriet got great reputation in Spain.</p>

               <p>Oh, Mr. Invoice!‚ÄîMy father, Sir, as we seldom went out, established a domestic kind of drama, and made us perform some little musical pieces, that were occasionally sent us from England.</p>

               <p>Exceedingly well! You have nothing to do now, but to offer yourselves to one of the houses.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Inv.</speaker>
               <p>And which, Sir, would you recommend?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Devil.</speaker>
               <p>Take your choice; for I can serve you in neither.</p>

               <speaker>Inv.</speaker>
               <p>No? I thought, Sir, you told me just now, that the several arts of the drama were under your direction.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Devil.</speaker>
               <p>So they were formerly; but now they are directed by the Genius of Insipidity: He has entered into partnership with the managers of both houses, and they have set up a kind of circulating library, for the vending of dialogue novels. I dare not go near the new house, for the Daemon of Power, who gave me this lame<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, has possessed the pates, and sown discord among the mock monarchs there; and what one receives, the other rejects. And as to the other house, the manager has great merit himself, with skill to discern, and candor to allow it in others; but I can be of no use in making your bargain, for in that he would be too many for the cunningest Devil amongst us.</p>

               <p>By all means: And you may do it this instant; he opens to-night, and will be glad of your assistance. I'll drop you down at the door; and must then take my leave for some time. <hi>Allons!</hi> but don't tremble; you have nothing to fear: The public will treat you with kindness; at least, if they shew but half the indulgence to you, that they have upon all occasions shewn to that Manager.</p>
