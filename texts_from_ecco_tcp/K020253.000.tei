         <p>HAVING received from a worthy Friend in the country, for whom I have the greatest esteem, a printed paper, which had been sent him by Dr. Kennicott, intituled, <q>A Cata<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>logue of the <hi>Sacred Vessels</hi> restored by <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and of the <hi>Chief Jews</hi> who re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turned at first from the Captivity, to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gether with the Names of the return<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing <hi>Families,</hi> and the <hi>Number</hi> of the Persons at that Time in each Family; disposed in such a manner, as to shew
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>most clearly the great corruption of <hi>Proper Names</hi> and <hi>Numbers</hi> in the pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent Text of the Old-Testament;</q> and being desired to return the said paper when I had perused it, I thought I could not handsomely do so without sending my opinion of it at the same time. The nature of the subject is indeed so foreign to my own business and way of life, that I should scarcely have presumed to med<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dle with it, had not a point of good man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ners to this Gentleman first of all induced me to do so; but afterwards, when I had considered Dr. Kennicott's manner of ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pressing himself in the title of this cata<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>logue, I thought myself obliged, through a desire of vindicating the Holy Scrip<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tures, to apply as closely to the examina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of this charge against them, as my small share of leisure would permit; be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing apprehensise that this paper might cause such prejudices against the integrity of the Text of the Old-Testament, as the
<pb n="5" facs="4"/>learned Author himself, perhaps, never conceived, and would be sorry to have occasioned by his catalogue.</p>
         <p>The Letter to my friend, which was the result of this examination, was at my desire shewn to Dr. Kennicott; but the arguments therein had not sufficient weight to convince him, that some apo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>logy was necessary to be made to his friends, to prevent their misinterpreting his real design in the said catalogue, and to remove all appearance of his having charged <q>
               <hi>the present Text of the Old-Tes<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tament</hi>
            </q> with more faults than it really deserves. Not being able however to lay aside my own apprehensions of the ill ef<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fects which might possibly be occasioned by this catalogue, I have therefore ven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tured to print some of my remarks upon it, lest any person, not having leisure to examine it sufficiently, should be led to conceive, that all the differences in
<pb n="6" facs="5"/>names and numbers, found therein, are really corruptions <q>
               <hi>in the present Text of the Old-Testament.</hi>
            </q>
         </p>
         <p>In the first part of the Catalogue the Doctor has compared Ezra's account of the sacred vessels with the account given of the same in the Book of Esdras; and, as if he had <hi>clearly shewn</hi> thereby some great corruptions, he has affixed the fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowing motto to his quotations; viz. <q>non potest verum asseri, quod
<note place="bottom" n="1">
                  <p>(1) In the letter, which I sent to my friend on this subject, I endeavoured to shew, that a disagreement in numbers, when the accounts of historians are compa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>red, is not a sufficient authority to justify a charge of corruption; and I supposed an example of two histori<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ans giving an account of the number of slain in a battle; the one that 1000 men were killed, and the other that no less than 2000 were lost in the same battle; and I observed, that, if the account is true of 2000 being killed, the other account cannot be called a contradic<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion to it, because a less number is mentioned there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>in; and this I thought sufficient to exemplify, that a smaller number, when given <hi>without an absolute limita<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,</hi> is no contradiction to a greater number. But it has been objected to this example, that it is <hi>by no means parallel to the case in question, because the numbers of slain in battle in large armies, as given by Historians,</hi> are, from the nature <hi>of the thing, hardly ever to be depended upon; where<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>as, when an inventory of goods is given, it is reasonably sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed to be exact to an unit, because it easily may be so.</hi> I will therefore mention another example, not liable to the same objection, and more proper to be inserted in these remarks because it is quoted by Dr. <hi>Kennicott,</hi> (see page 532 of his 1st dissertation,) viz. <q>
                        <hi>In</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> iv. 26. <hi>we read that Solomon had</hi> 40,000 <hi>stalls for horses, but in</hi> 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> ix. 25. <hi>only</hi> 4,000.</q> This Dr. <hi>Kennicott</hi> men<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions as one of the instances of <hi>mistakes</hi> which <q>
                        <hi>are most easilyaccounted for, by admitting the addition, omission, or transposition of a cypher:</hi>
                     </q> and the Doctor's favourite Author, Father <hi>Houbigant,</hi> thinks to remove all difficul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty from the same by altering the Text in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> iv. 26. from <gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
                        <desc>foreign</desc>
                     </gap> to <gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
                        <desc>foreign</desc>
                     </gap> viz. from 40,000 to 4,000.</p>
                  <p>But the ingenious Author of a small MS. book, lent me by a worthy and learned friend, (to whom I have great obligation on this, as well as many other ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>counts,) makes it appear very plainly, that the opinions of <hi>Bochart</hi> and <hi>Lud. Capellus</hi> (who think the word <gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
                        <desc>foreign</desc>
                     </gap> instead of 40 should be translated 4) would cause greater difficulties than what are at present found in the Text; for, says he, <q>let this Rabbinical use of plural ordinal numbers be what they please; yet in the Scripture Style they are never taken singular<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly, and this I affirm after having examined some hundreds of places, where they are either joined with appellatives, persons, or things, or greater numbers, as an hundred or thousand: and so these <hi>Hebrew</hi> words <gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
                           <desc>foreign</desc>
                        </gap> signify 40,000 be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>yond exception in all other Texts they are found in; and so the LXX. turn them here, and <hi>Josephus</hi> pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serves the same high number.</q> He then proceeds to shew the great probability (<q>
                        <hi>from the Riches and Gran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deur of Solomon,</hi> and the more terrible execution a <hi>Quadriga</hi> would make than a <hi>Biga,</hi>
                     </q>) that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Chariots were drawn by 4 horses; which opinion he supports by a variety of quotations and learned argu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments; and afterwards observes, that, as <hi>Solomon</hi> had 1400 Chariots, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> x. 26. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> i. 14.) the number of horses, allowing 4 to each chariot, would require 5600 Stalls, besides the Stalls necessary for the 12,000 single Troop Horses; which numbers will oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>casion great difficulties if we suppose that <hi>Solomon</hi> had only 4000 Stalls. He also observes, that (besides the Stalls necessary for <hi>Solomon</hi>'s standing forces) standings were necessary for horses presented to him by foreign Princes, as also for Baggage Mules and Dromedaries, which must be very numerous, not only for the carriage of provisions, tents, and other warlike necessaries both for horse and foot, but also for water, in the vast sandy wild of Arabia Deserta as far as Euphrates. Moreover, he observes, that as Solomon trafficked by his mer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chants with horses brought out of Egypt, furnishing the Kings of Syria and the Hittites; <q>
                        <hi>so this running trade might occasion these stalls to be so numerous, not on<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly serving the purposes of war, but of traffick.</hi>
                     </q> Many more reasons are given by the same Author, which are confirmed by a great variety of learned quotations and authorities; but, I trust, that those few I have men<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tioned are quite sufficient to prove that Father <hi>Houbi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gant</hi> has been much too hasty in altering the Sacred Text from 40,000 to 4000, and that he has thereby loaded it with a real difficulty, when he might have avoided the imaginary one, by admitting a very rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sonable and fair solution, which has been approved of by a great variety of learned commentators; I mean that of construing the word <gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
                        <desc>foreign</desc>
                     </gap> (not Stalls, but) Stables; which intirely removes all the difficulty: for, supposing each Stable capable of containing 10 Horses, you very easily account for the number of 40,000 Stalls: and this opinion is approved of by Abarbinel, Junius, and Tremellius, Bp. Patrick, Sir Walter Raleigh, Mons. Martin, and a great variety of other Commen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tators.</p>
                  <p>Some have indeed supposed, that the chariot Horses, spoken of in the parallel passage in 2d Chronicles ix. 25. were but 4000, which King Solomon kept at or near Jerusalem for his constant guard, and that the other speaks of those which were dispersed throughout his whole kingdom.</p>
                  <p>But what is most material to my purpose is observed by the author of the little treatise above-mentioned; viz. <q>
                        <hi>the diversity between these two relations</hi> (viz. in 1 Kings iv. 26, and 2 Chron. ix. 25.) amounts to 36,000; but, if the first account is proved true,</q> (which he most clearly has done,) <q>
                        <hi>the second must be so too, as the less is included in the greater number.</hi>
                     </q> Now this is the very conclusion that I drew from my former example, (viz. of the two historians giving dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent accounts of the number of men slain in a battle,) which was objected to: and this is another reason for my having quoted this example of Solomon's Horses; and I have the more pleasure in doing so, because it is not liable to the same objection as the former, for the numbers therein may as <hi>reasonably be supposed to be exact to a unit</hi> as the account of any <hi>other inventory</hi> whatever, because it easily might have been so: we find likewise that the difficulty therein may reasonably be accounted for without the supposition of a <hi>mistake,</hi> or the necessity of having recourse to Father Houbigant's dangerous and unwarrantable expedient of altering the text.</p>
               </note> ita diversum est.</q>
         </p>
         <p>
            <pb n="7" facs="6"/>But this account of Esdras is not <q>ita diversum</q> as to amount to a contra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diction
<pb n="8" facs="7"/>of the other, and therefore the doctor's motto is not at all applicable.
<pb n="9" facs="8"/>For <hi>Ezra</hi> might at one time make particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lar mention of such Vessels only as were
<pb n="10" facs="9"/>perhaps
<note place="bottom" n="2">
               <p>(2) A very apt and ingenious objection has been made to this argument, and communicated to the writer of these Remarks; who hopes that the worthy and learned Author will excuse his inserting it here at length, as the omission of it in this place might per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps be deemed an injustice to the subject in question. The Objection was as follows; <q>That Ezra did not mean to mention particularly the chief vessels only, and then to include the rest in the general round Sum 5400, is evident from hence, that he does do this be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore he comes to make up the Sum 5400; for he throws together all the Vessels, not before specified, under the article <hi>other Vessels,</hi> and into the general round Sum 1000: and this round Sum 1000, added to the particular Sums before specified, ought, in common sense, to make the Sum total; which here it does not do.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But, notwithstanding the seeming propriety of this objection, yet, while there is any reasonable way left of accounting for a difficulty, we ought to be very cau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tious of supposing a corruption; not from any idea of the <hi>absolute Integrity</hi> of the Hebrew Text, but because many very learned and experienced persons have led themselves and others into errors by esteeming some difficult passages to be corrupt, when the truth and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tegrity of the same might have been very sufficiently vindicated.</p>
               <p>In the present case, though I have not met with any thing, which, in my opinion, ought to be adopted as the only true interpretation, yet I think that one of the solutions given by Bp. Patrick is so far reasonable, that it removes the absolute necessity of supposing a corrup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>It is said, in</hi> 2 Chron. xxxvi. 18. <hi>Nebu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chadnezzar carried away all the vessels both great and small. Now, in the account that is here given, the larger vessels only, which were of greater bigness and price, are mentioned.</hi>
                  </q> (Among which are also reckoned the 1000 other Vessels; which <hi>round Sum</hi> was not inten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ded to make up the gross, but only to include all the other <hi>great</hi> or <hi>larger Vessels,</hi> the species of which were not particularized, as Josephus testifies
<note place="bottom" n="*">And other <hi>great</hi> Vessels a thousand.</note>, <q>

                     </gap>.</q>) <q>
                     <hi>But the gross Sum compre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hends all, both great and small, and amounts to the num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber</hi> 5400.</q>

            </note> chiefly used, or were most remarkable, and might mean to include
<pb n="11" facs="10"/>all the rest in the <hi>general round</hi> Sum of 5400; and yet might afterwards think
<pb n="12" facs="11"/>proper to write a more circumstantial history, setting down the <hi>exact</hi> number of each kind of vessel, together with the <hi>particular</hi> amount or total of the whole.</p>
         <p>In <hi>Josephus</hi> the <gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
               <desc>foreign</desc>
            </gap>. (30) and the <gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
               <desc>foreign</desc>
            </gap>. (30) correspond very well with the chargers of gold and basons of gold, mentioned by <hi>Ezra.</hi> As to the other numbers, they all differ, as well from the account in <hi>Ezra,</hi> as from that in <hi>Esdras,</hi> except the 1000 other vessels; and the addition of the whole amounts to no more than 5210‚Äî yet, as he has not himself given a total number, he cannot be said to contradict either of the others. Now, as not one of the articles in the <hi>Heb.</hi> account of <hi>Ezra</hi> exceeds the numbers of those in <hi>Esdras,</hi> there can be no contradiction therein, because each number may be
<pb n="13" facs="12"/>included in the corresponding number in <hi>Esdras.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>And farther; if the number of each article in <hi>Ezra</hi> had been exactly the same with those in <hi>Esdras,</hi> the <hi>Sum To<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tal</hi> 5400 would have appeared more like a mistake; but, as they amount to no more than 2499, it is plain that the writer did not mean to enumerate every single vessel; because he afterwards gives a <hi>round</hi> Sum Total of <hi>even Hundreds,</hi> viz. 5400, which is more frequent in Histo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rians than exact and particular sums: therefore a person must be very little ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quainted with History, who supposes that this is a contradiction to the Sum Total in <hi>Esdras,</hi> because <hi>the odd number</hi> 69 is omitted
<note place="bottom" n="3">(3) This numerical exactness in the Account of Es<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dras, which is wanting in the Hebrew Account, has occasioned a supposition that the latter, by some means or other, has undergone some alteration. But it must be observed that some ancient copies of the book of Es<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dras have been <hi>equally exact</hi> in making the Sum total the amount of the several sorts of vessels to a unit, not<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>withstanding that the particulars are very different, and that the Sum total exceeds the common reading by 391 vessels. The old Latin Bibles, from which the present Vulgate was taken, have the reading just mentioned, which was probably translated from MSS. as ancient as those from which the present Greek Text of Esdras was taken: and the same reading is found in Tindal's old English Bible, printed in 1549. Therefore this numerical exactness is not a sufficient proof of the au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thenticity of the book of Esdras in this place; so that if the Heb. of Ezra was to be corrected by it to the same numerical exactness, and if <hi>such other</hi> corrections as have been proposed were to take place in the Text of the Old-Testament, I am apt to think that our Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly Bible itself would soon, by too many, be esteemed as little better than apocryphal.</note>.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="14" facs="13"/>As to the difference of the names by which the Vessels are called, (however unlike they appear in the <hi>English</hi> Tran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>slation,) yet whoever is acquainted with the original Text must know that they correspond sufficiently; except indeed the <hi>Heb.</hi> word, which is translated <hi>knives;</hi> and that is capable of being construed several different ways, but there is not
<pb n="15" facs="14"/>the least reason to suppose that it has been corrupted.</p>
         <p>The next thing that I have to observe is, that Dr. <hi>K.</hi> has been particularly un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fortunate in fixing upon this part of the sacred History as a proof of <hi>the great cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ruption of the proper names and numbers in the present Text of the Old-Testament.</hi> First,</p>
         <p>Because it was the custom of the <hi>Ba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bylonians</hi> to give new Names to their cap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tives; so that it was very common a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mong the <hi>Jewish</hi> Captives to be called by two names: of this the Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> gives sufficient proof; and therefore this difference is of the less consequence, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause two different names may mean the same person.</p>
         <p>And, Secondly, because these three Books all agree in the sum total of per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sons;
<pb n="16" facs="15"/>
            <note place="bottom" n="4">
               <p>(4) This agreement of the three Books in the sum total of Persons has occasioned a supposition, <q>that the Catalogue in all three was originally the same; and that all three are now imperfect in some of the parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culars, since the particulars in none of them now amount to the sum 42,360, which is said to be the sum of each.</q> But there is no proof that the list, which Nehemiah found, was exactly the same with that from which Ezra copied; for many different ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>counts might have been taken by the Persons appoint<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed to number the people, even under the same title of <hi>the Children of the Province that went up out of Captivity,</hi> &amp;c. and though they might find it very easy to agree in the sum total, <hi>even to a unit,</hi> by reckoning the peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple, promiscuously, by fifties, hundreds, or thousands, (in which method the want of pedigrees would cause no difficulty,) yet in taking the numbers of the families se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parately they might be very liable to differ, on account of the difficulty of ascertaining the legitimacy of some particular persons in many of the said Families.</p>
               <p>It must be observed too, that not one of the three lists mentions the number of Priests, who were rejected for want of proper Registers, though the names of their fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>milies are the very last in each list, just preceding the Sum total; so that there is no doubt but that they are included therein notwithstanding: therefore, as the consent of all three informs us, beyond contradiction, of the real Sum total, so the want of the number of these Priests <hi>in all three lists</hi> seems <hi>as clearly</hi> to prove that the particular numbers in each were <hi>not intended</hi> to make up exactly the said Sum total; because it must otherwise seem very unaccountable, that <hi>all these three Lists,</hi> as well as <hi>all the ancient versions, which have been made from them,</hi> should happen to be corrupted <hi>in the same identical place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Kennicott seemed to be aware of this objection, when he first <hi>published</hi> his Catalogue of names in his second Dissertation, page 508, &amp;c. for he has there omitted these three last names, which have no num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bers specified, though he has thought fit to add them to his second Edition in the printed sheet; because he must have been convinced, that they ought to be in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cluded in the Sum total, notwithstanding the triple evidence of these Lists, that <hi>no number ought to be added to the same;</hi> and, consequently, that the exact number 42,360 was never intended to be made appear from the addition of the particular Sums in any of these Lists.</p>
            </note>; viz. 42,360; and yet none of their accounts amount to that sum by
<pb n="17" facs="16"/>
            <hi>upwards of</hi> 8000: so that were the names and numbers, which are particularized in each book, much more different than they really are, they could not with jus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tice be accused of contradiction; because there is sufficient room left <hi>in any</hi> of these histories for the mention of <hi>many different Families,</hi> which might have been omit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted by the others.</p>
         <p>Now those who content themselves with the Doctor's Catalogue, without farther examination, may indeed ima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gine, that he has shewn them <hi>most clear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly</hi>
            <pb n="18" facs="17"/>some great corruptions of proper names, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because he has <q>
               <hi>disposed them in such a manner</hi>
            </q> as to compare the name <hi>Bezai</hi> in <hi>Ezra</hi> with <hi>Hashum</hi> in <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> and again, <hi>Jorah</hi> in <hi>Ezra</hi> with <hi>Bezai</hi> in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> which should have been placed in the line above; also <hi>Hashum</hi> in <hi>Ezra</hi> (which should have been placed two lines higher) with <hi>Hariph</hi> in <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> Likewise he has placed <hi>Lod</hi> opposite to <hi>Jericho, Hadid</hi> to <hi>Lod, Ono</hi> to <hi>Hadid,</hi> and <hi>Jericho</hi> to <hi>Ono,</hi> each in a wrong line. So that he must either allow this to be a great mistake, or else that these names are <hi>"disposed in such a manner"</hi> as to prove nothing at all of what he pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tends
<note place="bottom" n="5">(5) By way of excuse for Dr. Kennicott, it has been urged, that the names are taken in the order in which they stand in each writer, to shew how the order of the original Catalogue has been disturbed, and that he did not intend to compare those names, which are mani<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>festly different, as if meant for the same person: but as no sufficient evidence has ever yet been produced, that the order of the names has really been disturbed, in any of the Lists, from what it was when written by the Authors of each; and as I have, in a former note, shewn a probability, that the Catalogue in all three Lists <hi>was not originally exactly the same;</hi> and as this seems to be proved by these very variations in the or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der of the names; therefore I think that the Doctor's <hi>manner of disposing</hi> the names cannot with justice be de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fended.</note>.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="19" facs="18"/>At the head of the names the Doctor has placed a Title, <hi>viz. "The Twelve Chief Men,"</hi> by which people may un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>warily be led to suppose that the chief men were confined to the limited num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber of Twelve; but the Scriptures make no mention of a limited number of Chief Men
<note place="bottom" n="6">(6) Dr. Kennicott nevertheless informs us, in page 508, (Second Dissertation,) that the <hi>twelve Chiefs</hi> re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>presented the <hi>twelve Tribes.</hi>
            </note>, but only of names: therefore it is not an inconsistency in the account of <hi>Ezra</hi> to mention only Eleven names. On this account, likewise, the difference in the names is of less consequence, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause it is not easy to prove that different persons were not intended to have been
<pb n="20" facs="19"/>expressed thereby: on the other hand, it may be as difficult to prove that they were; though there is some appearance of a proof in one instance; <hi>viz.</hi> the names <hi>Reelius</hi> and <hi>Roimus</hi> in <hi>Esdras</hi> (if we consider the <hi>Greek</hi> manner of ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pressing <hi>Hebrew</hi> names) will answer very well to <hi>Reelaiah</hi> (<gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
               <desc>foreign</desc>
            </gap>) in <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Raamiah</hi> (<gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
               <desc>foreign</desc>
            </gap>) in <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> which last names Dr. K. has compared together as supposing them to have been originally the same, though the similar names just mentioned in <hi>Esdras</hi> give us great reason to believe the contrary.</p>
         <p>But, before I leave Dr. Kennicott's twelve Chief Men, I will endeavour to clear up another difficulty, and will now take his side of the question to prove, that he has done right in comparing <hi>Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hum</hi> in Ezra with <hi>Nehum</hi> in Nehemiah as the name of one man, notwithstand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the great difference between them in
<pb n="21" facs="20"/>sound, which may at first sight seem to favour my suggestion about different per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sons; and I shall have the more pleasure in doing this, because at the same time I shall <hi>shew most clearly</hi> that neither the one nor the other is corrupted. Now every person, who is tolerably acquainted with the Chaldee and Syriac tongues, must know, that N (<gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
               <desc>foreign</desc>
            </gap>) is frequently changed for R (<gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
               <desc>foreign</desc>
            </gap>) in words derived from the Hebrew, and therefore it is much more easy to believe that Nehemiah, like a Babylonian, wrote <gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
               <desc>foreign</desc>
            </gap> for <gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
               <desc>foreign</desc>
            </gap> (<hi>Nehum</hi> for <hi>Rehum</hi>) than to sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose that either of the words has been since corrupted.</p>
         <p>Whatever difference there may be be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween Ezra and Nehemiah in numbers, (which are of less consequence, as both of them fall so far short of the total,) yet the difference in names is very imma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terial, though Dr. Kennicott has <q>
               <hi>dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed
<pb n="22" facs="21"/>them in such a manner</hi>
            </q> as to make it seem very considerable.</p>
         <p>There is but <hi>one name</hi> (viz. Hariph) in all this <hi>long list of Families,</hi> mentioned by Nehemiah, which has any material difference from those mentioned by Ezra, and there are <hi>but four names</hi> in Ezra, viz. <hi>Jorah, Magbish, Hagab,</hi> and <hi>Asnah,</hi> which are not found in Nehemiah; therefore as there are no names in Ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hemiah to compare with these last, ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cepting the single name <hi>Hariph,</hi> it is im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>possible for Dr. K. to prove <hi>any corrup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of names in the Hebrew text through<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out this whole list of families.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Perhaps the Doctor may imagine, that the difference of names in the Apocry<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phal Greek book of Esdras is a sufficient proof against the integrity of the Hebrew text of the other two; otherwise he must allow, that his Catalogue proves very
<pb n="23" facs="22"/>little in this article of names. But, sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posing that these differences were real contradictions, (which they are not,) the suspicion of corruption must of course fall on the book of
<note place="bottom" n="7">(7) See Dr. Kennicott's second Dissertation on the State of the Hebrew Text, pages 506 and 507, where he intirely gives up the authority of the Book of Es<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dras: so that its testimony ought to have but very little weight (especially with Dr. K. himself) in correcting the Text.</note> Esdras. First, Because the two best Greek copies of this same book (viz. the Vatican and Alexandrian copies) differ very much from each other both in the names and numbers.</p>
         <p>Secondly, Because it is not of equal au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thority with the others, being apocry<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phal, and therefore not received into the canon of the Scriptures.</p>
         <p>And, Thirdly, Because two evidences against one, though they were all to be of equal authority, would undoubtedly gain the cause in this critical trial.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="24" facs="23"/>But I will now endeavour to shew that even the apocryphal Book of Esdras is not so widely different from the others as the Doctor has made them appear in his Ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>talogue; and of this I hope the few ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>amples that follow will be a sufficient proof.</p>

         <p>This is not less injustice than if a judge were to condemn a prisoner merely from the report given of him by others, with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out permitting him to appear before him to answer for himself.</p>
         <p>My proofs of the Doctor's having mere<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly copied the English Version, I shall take out of the book of Esdras: because with that (I suppose) he meant to cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rect the Hebrew Text.</p>
         <p>Verse 13. He has taken the name <hi>Sadas,</hi> and the number 3222 only from the English version; for in the Alexan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>drian
<pb n="29" facs="28"/>copy it is <gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
               <desc>foreign</desc>
            </gap> (near to the He<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brew <hi>Azgad</hi>) 3622; and <gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
               <desc>foreign</desc>
            </gap> 2322 in the Vatican copy: so that he trifles with the originals if he thinks in this manner to shew their corruptions.</p>
         <p>Verse 14. He has placed the number 667 to Adonicam as in the English Ver<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion of Esdras, whereas the Vatican copy reads 637, and the Alexandrian 647.</p>
         <p>Verse 16. <hi>Ananias</hi> is called <gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
               <desc>foreign</desc>
            </gap> and <gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
               <desc>foreign</desc>
            </gap> in the original Greek.</p>
         <p>
            <hi>Meterus</hi> is expressed by <gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
               <desc>foreign</desc>
            </gap> in the original Greek.</p>
         <p>Verse 25. <hi>Phasseron</hi> in the English Version and the Doctor's catalogue has the number 1047, but in the Vatican copy it has 2047, and in the Alexandri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>an 2247. <hi>Carme</hi> as in the English Ver<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion 1017, whereas the Vatican copy has only 217, and the Alexandrian 2017.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="30" facs="29"/>Verse 37. <hi>Ladan,</hi> as in the English, which is <gap rend="content:„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ">
               <desc>foreign</desc>
            </gap> in the original.</p>
         <p>Lastly, the number of servants, 7347, is plainly a mistake copied from the Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lish Version; for the original Greek, as well as the Syriac Version of the same, is agreeable to the Hebrew 7337.</p>
         <p>Now as many of the seeming differ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ences (which the reader, as Dr. Ken<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nicott supposes in page 507, 2d Disser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tation, will view with surprize) are not to be found in the original, but are oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>casioned by the Doctor's copying merely from the English Version; as many other differences in names are caused only by the changing of letters, according to the common Chaldaean mode of expressing Hebrew words, and therefore are not liable to the charge of corruption; and as the most material differences between Ezra and Nehemiah are made by the Doc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tor's having placed the names in the or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der
<pb n="31" facs="30"/>in which they stand in each writer, which has caused him to compare names manifestly different, as if meant for the same person; so I must conclude (all these things considered) that not only the disposition of names, but the whole per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formance is intirely unfair, because the Doctor's motto leaves no room for allow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ances to be made for whatever may have occasioned the several seeming differences, but condemns them indiscriminately with a bold insinuation of falsehood, viz. <hi>Non potest verum asseri quod ita diversum est.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The Doctor in his printed Sheet has indeed placed this motto close by the side of his quotation from the apocryphal Book of <hi>Esdras,</hi> but it is plain that he intended thereby to censure the differ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ences in the whole catalogue, because he prefixed the same unjust motto to his <hi>first publication</hi> of the Catalogue in his 2d Dissertation, p. 508.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="32" facs="31"/>I call this motto unjust, not only be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause it is there applied indiscriminately to a quotation from two canonical Books of the Old-Testament, but because St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s authority is quoted for it, as if he had applied the same words, for the same purpose, to the Book of <hi>Ezra,</hi> though it appears very plainly by St. <hi>Je<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rome</hi>'s preface to the said Book, that he was speaking only of differences in the various copies of <hi>the Greek Version,</hi> when he made use of those words.</p>
         <p>But notwithstanding the many faults, which I have found in the writings of this Gentleman, yet I have a much bet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter opinion of him, than to suppose, that he will ever endeavour to evade my cen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure of his Catalogue, by alledging that he did not mean by it to shew the corrup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions of the original Text, but only of the common <hi>English</hi> Translation, which he has here copied word for word; and
<pb n="33" facs="32"/>that he meant the <hi>English</hi> Translation where he has mentioned <hi>the present Text of the Old Testament.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I say, notwithstanding the improbabi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lity that there is of the Doctor's ever seeking such an evasion, yet he must ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cuse me if I endeavour to guard against any sort of shifting-off from the point whatsoever.</p>
         <p>Therefore I must observe, that the Text of any author cannot mean <hi>a Tran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>slation,</hi> especially when a person is speak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing of corruptions in it; for the Corrup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of any Text must mean some wilful or accidental alteration from the original copy of the Author.</p>
         <p>No Person therefore, speaking concern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the corruption in a Translation of any Book, may say that they are corruptions of the <hi>present Text</hi> of the said book; be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause
<pb n="34" facs="33"/>at the same time perhaps the real and original text contains none of those faults which he complains of.</p>
         <p>So that, should the Doctor have really only meant to expose some defects, which he might imagine he had discovered in the <hi>English</hi> Version, (though I cannot think that he intended any such thing by this Catalogue,) yet it must appear to the Eyes of all those who know him, and his pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent undertaking, as if these unjust cen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sures were levelled at the Original Text itself.</p>
         <p>There are many other things, I believe, which might be alledged against this Ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>talogue, but I shall only beg leave to trouble the reader with two more.</p>
         <p>Though there might be many <hi>Jewish</hi> Families called after the names of places, as <hi>Bethlehem, Ramah, Jericho,</hi> &amp;c. yet
<pb n="35" facs="34"/>perhaps Dr. <hi>K.</hi> may have difficulty to prove that any <hi>Jewish</hi> Families were called <hi>Tel-melah, Telharsa, Cherub,</hi> and <hi>Addan,</hi> (<hi>Immer</hi> the next name being indeed an exception,) although he has placed them in his list of families under the running Title of <hi>"The Children of."</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Now, if he had attended to the context, even of the <hi>English</hi> Translation, he might have understood, that these were really the names of places, and not of families; for we are there informed, that the Families, afterwards mentioned, <q>which <hi>went up from</hi>
            </q> 
            <hi>the said places,</hi> 
            <q>sought their register among those that were rec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>koned by genealogy, but they were not found.</q>
         </p>
         <p>Another mistake he has likewise made in comparing <hi>Cherub</hi> and <hi>Addan,</hi> the names of <hi>places</hi> in <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> with <hi>Charaathalar</hi> and <hi>Aalar,</hi> the names
<pb n="36" facs="35"/>
            <hi>of men</hi> mentioned by <hi>Esdras;</hi> though the context plainly shews that there were no other than what I say.</p>
         <p>I will not however insist on these two last articles, because I presume that I have before sufficiently proved, that this Cata<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>logue <hi>does</hi> 
            <q>
               <hi>not shew most clearly the great corruption of proper names and numbers in the present Text of the Old-Testament.</hi>
            </q>
         </p>
         <p>Now, lest my censure of this catalogue should seem to strike obliquely at Dr. Kennicott's present undertaking of col<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lating the Heb. MSS. which has been honoured with the subscriptions of so many great and learned persons; I think it necessary, for my own sake, as well as in justice to Dr. Kennicott, to declare, that I think his collation of Hebrew MSS. a very laudable and use<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful undertaking; and that there cannot be the least objection to his new Edi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
<pb n="37" facs="36"/>of the Heb. Bible, if printed ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cording to the proposals offered by him in the year 1760; viz. (<q>
               <hi>not with a new Text,</hi> but) <hi>from one of the best Edi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions already published,</hi>
            </q> having the various readings inserted at the bottom of every page.</p>
