            <l>That TRUTH, who seldom loves to stray,</l>
            <l>Wander'd, so authors grave report,</l>
            <l>Along the park, and strol'd to court.</l>
            <l>That very day mal a propos,</l>
            <l>But things sometimes will happen so,</l>
            <l>Her rival FALSHOOD thither came,</l>
            <l>Who little thought to meet the dame;</l>
            <l>Together there they press'd along,</l>
            <l>And mingled in the motley throng,</l>
            <l>There, as they never cou'd agree,</l>
            <l>They jostled for precedency;</l>
            <l>Quarrel'd like other female foes,</l>
            <l>While bitt'rest taunts alternate rose.</l>
            <l>"Madam, quoth FALSHOOD, why so rude▪</l>
            <l>"I wonder you will here intrude;</l>
            <l>"It wou'd be look'd on full as well,</l>

For surely a more aukward mien</l>
            <l>"Or simpler look was never seen;</l>

            <l>THUS as she spoke they chanc'd to spy</l>
            <l>The graceful B—D passing by:</l>
            <l>TRUTH view'd her fav'rite with delight;</l>
            <l>She saw and kindled at the sight:</l>

            <l>THUS spake fair TRUTH, with conscious pride;</l>

         <lg>
            <l>"THE danger's great, the task is hard,</l>
            <l>"But conquest is my sure reward.</l>
            <l>"If I can get my tale believ'd,</l>
            <l>"And thou confess the world deceiv'd,</l>

            <l>THIS said, away the goddess flew,</l>
            <l>And summon'd all th' infernal crew;</l>
            <l>ENVY, with looks of deadliest hate,</l>
            <l>And RANCOUR eager for debate,</l>
            <l>ILL-NATURE curst, SUSPICION sly,</l>
            <l>And gaping fond CREDULITY,</l>
            <l>And CALUMNY with iron lungs,</l>
            <l>And SLANDER with a thousand tongues.</l>

            <l>In dreadful amity combin'd.</l>
            <l>B—D <hi>is false,</hi> SUSPICION cry'd;</l>
            <l>B—D <hi>is false,</hi> the crowd reply'd;</l>
            <l>Quick ran the tale in whispers round,</l>
            <l>And babbling eccho caught the sound;</l>
            <l>The world was glad to be deceived,</l>
