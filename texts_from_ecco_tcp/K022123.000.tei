            <p>Of the General Principles of MORALS.</p>
            <p>DISPUTES with Persons, pertinaciously
obstinate in their Principles, are, of all
others, the most irksome; except, per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps,
those with Persons, who really do not believe
at all the Opinion they defend, but engage in the
Controversy, from Affectation, from a Spirit of Op<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position,
or from a Desire of showing Wit and Inge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nuity,
superior to the rest of Mankind. The same
blind Adherence to their own Arguments is to be ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cepted
in both; the same Contempt of their Antago<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nists;
and the same passionate Vehemence, in inforc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
Sophistry and Falshood. And as reasoning is
not the Source, whence either Disputant derives his
Tenets; 'tis in vain to expect, that any Logic, which
speaks not to the Affections, will ever engage him to
embrace sounder Principles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="6"/>
THOSE who have refused the Reality of moral
Distinctions, may be ranked in the latter Class, a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mongst
the disingenuous Disputants; nor is it con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceivable,
that any human Creature could ever seri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ously
believe, that all Characters and Actions were
alike entitled to the Affection and Regard of every
one. The Difference, which Nature has plac'd be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>twixt
one Man and another, is so wide, and this
Difference is still so much farther widened, by Educa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
Example, and Habit, that, where the opposite
Extremes come at once under our Apprehension,
there is no Scepticism so scrupulous, and scarce any
Assurance so determin'd, as absolutely to deny all
Distinction betwixt them. Let a Man's Insensibility
be ever so great, he must often be touch'd with the
Images of RIGHT and WRONG; and let his
Prejudices be ever so obstinate, he must observe, that
others are susceptible of like Impressions. The only
Way, therefore, of converting an Antagonist of this
Kind, is to leave him to himself. For, finding that
No-body keeps up the Controversy with him, 'tis
probable he will, at last, of himself, from mere
Weariness, come over to the Side of common Sense
and Reason.</p>
            <p>THERE has been a Controversy started of late,
much better worth Examination, concerning the
<pb n="3" facs="7"/>
general Foundation of MORALS, whether they
are derived from REASON or from SENTI<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>MENT;
whether we attain the Knowledge of
them by a Chain of Argument and Deduction, or by
an immediate Feeling and finer internal Sense; whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther,
like all sound Judgment of Truth and Falshood,
they should be the same in every rational intelligent
Being; or whether, like the Perception of Beauty
and Deformity, they are founded entirely on the par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticular
Fabric and Constitution of the human Species.</p>
            <p>THE antient Philosophers, tho' they often affirm,
that Virtue is nothing but Conformity to Reason, yet,
in general, seem to consider Morals as deriving their
Existence from Taste and Sentiment. On the other
Hand, our modern Enquirers, tho' they also talk
much of the Beauty of Virtue, and Deformity of
Vice, yet have commonly endeavoured to account
for these Distinctions by metaphysical Reasonings,
and by Deductions from the most abstract Principles
of human Understanding. Such Confusion reign'd
in these Subjects, that an Opposition of the greatest
Consequence could prevail betwixt one System and
another, and even in the Parts almost of each indivi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dual
System; and yet No-body, till very lately, was
ever sensible of it. The elegant and sublime Lord
<hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> who first gave Occasion to remark this
Distinction, and who, in general, adher'd to the
<pb n="4" facs="8"/>
Principles of the Antients, is not, himself, entirely
free from the same Confusion.</p>
            <p>IT must be acknowledged, that both Sides of the
Question are susceptible of specious Arguments.
Moral Distinctions, it may be said, are discernible by
pure <hi>Reason:</hi> Else, whence the many Disputes, that
reign, in common Life, as well as in Philosophy,
with regard to this Subject: The long Chain of Proofs
often adduc'd on both Sides; the Examples cited, the
Authorities appeal'd to, the Analogies employ'd, the
Fallacies detected, the Inferences drawn, and the se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veral
Conclusions adjusted to their proper Principles.
Truth is disputable; not, Taste: What exists in the
Nature of Things is the Standard of our Judgment;
what each Man feels within himself is the Standard
of Sentiment. Propositions in Geometry may be
prov'd, Systems in Physics may be controverted;
but the Harmony of Verse, the Tenderness of Passion,
the Brilliancy of Wit must give immediate Pleasure.
No Man reasons concerning another's Beauty; but
frequently concerning the Justice or Injustice of his
Actions. In every Trial of Criminals, their first Ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject
is to disprove the Facts alledged, and deny the
Actions imputed to them: The second to prove, that
even if these Actions were real, they might be justified,
as innocent and lawful. 'Tis confessedly by Deduc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
of the Understanding, that the first Point is as<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>certain'd:
<pb n="5" facs="9"/>
How can we suppose, that a different Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culty
of the Mind is employ'd in fixing the other?</p>
            <p>ON the other Hand, those, who would resolve all
moral Determinations into <hi>Sentiment,</hi> may endeavour
to show, that 'tis impossible for Reason ever to draw
Conclusions of this Nature. To Virtue, say they,
it belongs to be <hi>amiable,</hi> and Vice <hi>odious.</hi> This forms
their very Nature or Essence. But can Reason or Ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gumentation
distribute these different Epithets to any
Subjects, and pronounce <hi>a priori,</hi> that this must pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duce
Love, and that Hatred? Or what other Rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son
can we ever assign for these Affections, but the
original Fabric and Formation of the human Mind,
which is naturally adapted to receive them?</p>
            <p>THE End of all moral Speculations is to teach us
our Duty; and by proper Representations of the De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formity
of Vice and Beauty of Virtue, beget cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>respondent
Habits, and engage us to avoid the one,
and embrace the other. But is this ever to be ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pected
from Inferences and Conclusions of the Un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derstanding,
which, of themselves, have no Hold of
the Affections, nor set the active Powers of Men in
Motion and Employment? They discover Truth;
but where the Truths they discover are indifferent,
and beget no Desire or Aversion, they can have no
Influence on Conduct and Behaviour. What is ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nourable,
<pb n="6" facs="10"/>
what is fair, what is becoming, what is
noble, what is generous, takes Possession of the Heart,
and animates us to embrace and to maintain it. What
is intelligible, what is evident, what is probable,
what is true, procures only the cool Assent of the Un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derstanding;
and gratifying a speculative Curiosity,
puts an end to our Researches.</p>
            <p>EXTINGUISH all the warm Feelings and Preposses<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions
in favour of Virtue, and all Disgust or Aversion
against Vice: Render Men totally indifferent towards
these Distinctions; and Morality is no longer a prac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tical
Study, nor has any Tendency to regulate our
Lives and Actions.</p>
            <p>THESE Arguments on both Sides (and many more
might be adduc'd) are so plausible, that I am apt to
suspect they may, both of them, be solid and satis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>factory,
and that <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Sentiment</hi> concur in al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most
all moral Determinations and Conclusions.
The final Sentence, 'tis probable, which pronounces
Characters and Actions amiable or odious, praise<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>worthy
or blameable; that which stamps on them
the Mark of Honour or Infamy, Approbation or
Censure; that which renders Morality an active Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciple,
and constitutes Virtue our Happiness, and Vice
our Misery: 'Tis probable, I say, that this final
Sentence depends on some internal Sense or Feeling,
<pb n="7" facs="11"/>
which Nature has made universal to the whole
Species. For what else can have an Influence of this
Nature? But, in order to pave the Way for such a
Sentiment, and give Men a proper Discernment of
its Object, 'tis often necessary, we find, that much
Reasoning should precede, that nice Distinctions
he made, just Conclusions drawn, distant Comparisons
form'd, accurate Relations examin'd, and general
Facts fix'd and ascertain'd. Some Species of Beauty,
especially the natural Kinds, on their first Appear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance,
command our Affection, and Approbation;
and where they fail of this Effect, 'tis impossible for
any Reasoning to redress their Influence, or adapt
them better to our Taste and Sentiment. But in many
Orders of Beauty, particularly those of the finer
Arts, 'tis requisite to employ much Reasoning, in
order to feel the proper Sentiment; and a false Relish
may frequently be corrected by Argument and Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>flection.
There are just Grounds to conclude, that
moral Beauty partakes much of this latter Species,
and demands the Assistance of our intellectual Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culties,
in order to give it a suitable Influence on the
human Mind.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' this Question, concerning the general
Principle of Morals, be extremely curious and im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>portant;
'tis needless for us, at present, to employ
farther Care in our Enquiries concerning it. For if
we can be so happy, in the Course of this Enquiry,
<pb n="8" facs="12"/>
as to fix the just Origin of Morals, 'twill then easily
appear how far Sentiment or Reason enters into all
Determinations of this Nature<note place="bottom" n="*">See Appendix First.</note>. Mean while, it
will scarce be possible for us, 'ere this Controversy is
fully decided, to proceed in that accurate Manner,
requir'd in the Sciences; by beginning with exact
Definitions of VIRTUE and VICE, which are
the Objects of our present Enquiry. But we shall do
what may justly be esteem'd as satisfactory. We shall
consider the Matter as an Object of Experience.
We shall call <hi>every Quality or Action of the Mind,</hi> vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tuous,
<hi>which is attended with the general Approbation
of Mankind:</hi> And we shall denominate vicious, <hi>every
Quality, which is the Object of general Blame or Cen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure.</hi>
These Qualities we shall endeavour to collect;
and after examining, on both Sides, the several
Circumstances, in which they agree, 'tis hop'd we
may, at last, reach the Foundation of Ethics, and
find those universal Principles, from which all moral
Blame or Approbation is ultimately derived. As
this is a Question of Fact, not of abstract Science,
we can only expect Success, by following this expe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rimental
Method, and deducing general Maxims from
a Comparison of particular Instances. The other
scientifical Method; where a general abstract Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciple
is first establish'd, and is afterwards branch'd
<pb n="9" facs="13"/>
out into a Variety of Inferences and Conclusions,
may be more perfect in itself, but suits less the Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perfection
of human Nature, and is a common
Source of Illusion and Mistake, in this as well as in
other Subjects. Men are now cured of their Passion
for Hypotheses and Systems in natural Philosophy,
and will hearken to no Arguments but those deriv'd
from Experience. 'Tis full Time they should begin
a like Reformation in all moral Disquisitions; and
reject every System of Ethics, however subtile or in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>genious,
that is not founded on Fact and Observa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion.</p>

               <head>PART I.</head>
               <p>THERE is a Principle, suppos'd to prevail a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mongst
many, which is utterly incompatible
with all Virtue or moral Sentiment; and as it can
proceed from nothing but the most deprav'd Dispo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sition,
so in its Turn it tends still farther to foster and
encourage that Depravity. This Principle is, that
all <hi>Benevolence</hi> is mere Hypocrisy, Friendship a Cheat,
Public Spirit a Farce, Fidelity a Snare to procure
Trust and Confidence; and while all of us, at the
Bottom, pursue only our private Interest, we wear
these fair Disguises, in order to put others off their
Guard, and expose them the more to our Wiles and
Machinations. What Heart one must be possess'd
of, who professes such Principles, and who feels no
internal Sentiment to belye so pernicious a Theory,
'tis easy to imagine: And also, what Degree of Af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fection
and Benevolence he can bear to a Species,
<pb n="12" facs="15"/>
whom he represents under such odious Colours, and
supposes so little susceptible of Gratitude or any Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn
of Affection. Or if we will not ascribe these
Principles altogether to a corrupted Heart, we must,
at least, account for them from the most careless and
precipitate Examination. Superficial Reasoners,
indeed, observing many false Pretences amongst
Mankind, and feeling, perhaps, no very strong Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>straint
in their own Disposition, might draw a general
and a hasty Conclusion, that all is equally corrupted,
and that Men, different from all other Animals, and
indeed from all other Species of Existence, admit of
no Degrees of Good or Bad, but are, in every In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stance,
the same Creatures, under different Disguises
and Appearances.</p>
               <p>THERE is another Principle, somewhat resembling,
the former; which has been much insisted on by
Philosophers, and has been the Foundation of many
a fair System; that whatever Affection one may feel,
or imagine he feels for others, no Passion is, or can
be disinterested; that the most generous Friendship,
however sincere, is a Modification of Self-love; and,
that even unknown to Ourselves, we seek only our
Gratification, while we appear the most deeply en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gag'd
in Schemes for the Liberty and Happiness of
Mankind. By a Turn of Imagination, by a Refine<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
of Reflection, by an Enthusiasin of Passion,
<pb n="13" facs="16"/>
we seem to take Part in the Interests of others, and
imagine Ourselves divested of all selfish Views and
Considerations: But at the Bottom, the most generous
Patriot and most niggardly Miser, the bravest Hero
and most abject Coward, have, in every Action, an
equal Regard to their own Happiness and Welfare.</p>
               <p>WHOEVER concludes, from the seeming Tendency
of this Opinion, that those, who make Profession of
it, cannot possibly feel the true Sentiments of Bene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>volence,
or have any Regard for genuine Virtue, will
often find himself, in Practice, very much mistaken.
Probity and Honour were no Strangers to <hi>Epicurus</hi>
and his Sect. <hi>Atticus</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> seem to have en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>joy'd
from Nature, and cultivated by Reflection, as
generous and friendly Dispositions as any Disciple of
the austerer Schools. And amongst the Moderns,
<hi>Hobbes</hi> and <hi>Locke,</hi> who maintain'd the selfish System
of Morals, liv'd most irreproachable Lives; tho' the
former lay not under any Restraints of Religion,
which might supply the Defects of his Philosophy.</p>
               <p>AN <hi>Epicurean</hi> or a <hi>Hobbist</hi> readily allows, that there
is such a Thing as Friendship in the World, without
Hypocrisy or Disguise; tho' he may attempt, by a
philosophical Chymistry, to resolve the Elements of
this Passion, if I may so speak, into those of another,
and explain every Affection to be Self-love, twisted
<pb n="14" facs="17"/>
and moulded into a Variety of Shapes and Appear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ances.
But as the same Turn of Imagination pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vails
not in every Man, nor gives the same Direction
to the original Passion; this is sufficient, even ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cording
to the selfish System, to make the widest Dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ference
in human Characters, and denominate one
Man virtuous and humane, another vicious and
meanly interested. I esteem the Man, whose Self<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>love,
by whatever Means, is so directed as to give
him a Concern for others, and render him serviceable
to Society: As I hate or despise him, who has no
Regard to any Thing beyond his own pitiful Gratifi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cations
and Enjoyments. In vain would you suggest,
that these Characters, tho' seemingly opposite, are,
at the Bottom, the same, and that a very inconsider<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able
Turn of Imagination forms the whole Difference
betwixt them. Each Character, notwithstanding
these inconsiderable Differences, appears to me, in
Practice, pretty durable and untransmutable. And
I find not, in this, more than in other Subjects, that
the natural Sentiments, arising from the general Ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pearances
of Things, are easily destroy'd by resin'd
Reflections concerning the minute Origin of these
Appearances. Does not the lively, cheerful Colour
of a Countenance inspire me with Complacency and
Pleasure; even tho' I learn from Philosophy, that all
Difference of Complexion arises from the most mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nute
<pb n="15" facs="18"/>
Differences of Thickness, in the most minute
Parts of the Skin; by which Differences one Super<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficies
is qualify'd to reflect one of the original Colours
of Light, and absorb the others?</p>
               <p>BUT tho' the Question, concerning the universal
or partial Selfishness of Man, be not so material, as
is usually imagin'd, to Morality and Practice, it is
certainly of great Consequence in the speculative
Science of human Nature, and is a proper Object of
Curiosity and Enquiry. It may not, therefore, be
improper, in this Place, to bestow a few Reflections
upon it<note place="bottom" n="*">Benevolence naturally divides into two Kinds, the <hi>general</hi> and <hi>particular.</hi> The first is, where we have no Friendship or Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nexion or Esteem for the Person, but feel only a general Sympathy with him or a Compassion for his Pains, and a Congratulation with his Pleasures. The other Species of Benevolence is founded on an Opinion of Virtue, on Services done us, or on some particular Cornexions. Both these Sentiments must be allow'd real in human Nature; but whether they will resolve into some nice Considerations of Self-love, is a Question more curious than important. The for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mer Sentiment, <hi>viz.</hi> that of general Benevolence or Humanity or Sympathy, we shall have Occasion frequently to treat of in the Course of these Essays; and I assume it as real, from general Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perience, without any other Proof.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE most obvious Objection to the selfish Hypo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thesis,
is, that being contrary to common Feeling and
our most unprejudic'd Notions and Opinions; there
<pb n="16" facs="19"/>
is requir'd the highest Stretch of Philosophy to esta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blish
so extraordinary a Paradox. To the most care<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>less
Observer, there appear to be such Dispositions as
Benevolence and Generosity; such Affections as
Love, Friendship, Compassion, Gratitude. These
Sentiments have their Causes, Effects, Objects, and
Operations, markt by common Language and Obser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vation,
and plainly distinguish'd from the selfish Pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions.
And as this is the obvious Appearance of
Things, it must be admitted; till some Hypothesis be
discover'd, which, by penetrating deeper into human
Nature, may prove the former Affections to be No<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing
but Modifications of the latter. All Attempts
of this Kind have hitherto prov'd fruitless, and seem
to have proceeded entirely from that Love of <hi>Simpli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>city,</hi>
which has been the Source of much false Rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>soning
in Philosophy. I shall not here enter into any
Detail on the present Subject. Many able Philoso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phers
have shown the Insufficiency of these Systems.
And I shall take for granted what, I believe, the
smallest Reflection will make evident to every impar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tial
Enquirer.</p>
               <p>BUT the Nature of the Subject furnishes the strong<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>est
Presumption, that no better System will ever, for
the future, be invented, to account for the Origin of
the benevolent from the selfish Affections, and reduce
all the various Emotions of the human Mind to a per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect
<pb n="17" facs="20"/>
Simplicity and Uniformity. The Case is not the
same in this Species of Philosophy as in Physics.
Many an Hypothesis in Nature, contrary to first Ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pearances,
has been found, on more accurate Scru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tiny,
solid and satisfactory. Instances of this Kind
are so frequent, that a judicious, as well as witty Phi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>losopher
<note place="bottom" n="*">Monsr. <hi>Fontenelle.</hi>
                  </note> has ventur'd to affirm, if there be more
than one Way, in which any Phaenomenon may be
produc'd, that there is a general Presumption for its
arising from the Causes, which are the least obvious
and familiar. But the Presumption always lies on the
other Side, in all Enquiries concerning the Origin of
our Passions, and the internal Operations of the hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man
Mind. The simplest and most obvious Cause,
that can there be assign'd for any Phaenomenon, is
probably the true one. When a Philosopher, in the
Explication of his System, is oblig'd to have Recourse
to some very intricate and refin'd Reflections, and to
suppose them essential to the Production of any Pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion
or Emotion, we have Reason to be extremely on
our Guard against so fallacious an Hypothesis. The
Affections are not susceptible of any Impression from
the Refinements of Reason or Imagination; and 'tis
always found, that a vigorous Exertion of the latter
Faculties, from the narrow Capacity of the human
Mind, destroys all Energy and Activity in the former.
<pb n="18" facs="21"/>
Our predominant Motive or Intention is, indeed,
frequently conceal'd from Ourselves, when it is
mingled and confounded with others, which the
Mind, from Vanity or Self-conceit, is desirous of
supposing of greater Force and Influence: But there
is no Instance, that a Concealment of this Nature
has ever arisen from the Abstruseness and Intricacy
of the Motive. A Man, who has lost a Friend and
Patron, may flatter himself, that all his Grief arises
from generous Sentiments, without any Mixture of
narrow or interested Considerations: But a Man, who
grieves for a valuable Friend, that needed his Patron<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>age
and Protection; how can we suppose, that his
passionate Tenderness arises from some metaphysical
Regards to a Self-interest, which has no Foundation
or Reality? We may as well imagine, that minute
Wheels and Springs, like those of a Watch, give
Motion to a loaded Waggon, as account for the
Origin of Passion from such abstruse Reflections.</p>
               <p>ANIMALS are found susceptible of Kindness, both
to their own Species and to ours; nor is there, in
this Case, the least Suspicion of Disguise or Artifice.
Shall we account for all <hi>their</hi> Sentiments too, from
refin'd Deductions of Self-interest? Or if we ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mit
a disinterested Benevolence in the inferior Species,
by what Rule of Analogy can we refuse it in the Su<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perior?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="22"/>
LOVE betwixt the Sexes begets a Complacency
and Good-will, very distinct from the Gratification
of an Appetite. Tenderness to their Offspring, in
all sensible Beings, is commonly able alone to
counterballance the strongest Motives of Self-love,
and has no Manner of Dependance on that Affection.
What Interest can a fond Mother have in View, who
loses her Health by assiduous Attendance on her sick
Child, and afterwards languishes, and dies for Grief,
when freed, by its Death, from the Slavery of that
Attendance?</p>
               <p>Is Gratitude no Affection of the human Breast, or is
that a Word merely, without any Meaning or Reality?
Have we no Complacency or Satisfaction in one
Man's Company above another's, and no Desire of
the Welfare of our Friend, even tho' Absence or
Death should prevent us from all Participation in it?
Or what is it commonly, that gives us any Partici<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pation
in it, even while alive and present, but our
Affection and Regard to him?</p>
               <p>THESE and a thousand other Instances are Marks
of a generous Benevolence in human Nature, where
no <hi>real</hi> Interest binds us to the Object. And how an
<hi>imaginary</hi> Interest, known and avow'd for such, can
be the Origin of any Passion or Emotion, seems dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficult
<pb n="20" facs="23"/>
to explain. No satisfactory Hypothesis of this
Kind has yet been discover'd; nor is there the smallest
Probability, that the future Industry of Men will ever
be attended with more favourable Success.</p>
               <p>BUT farther, if we consider rightly of the Matter,
we shall find, that the Hypothesis, which allows of a
disinterested Benevolence, distinct from Self-love, has
really more <hi>Simplicity</hi> in it, and is more conformable
to the Analogy of Nature, than that which pretends
to resolve all Friendship and Humanity into this latter
Principle. There are bodily Wants or Appetites,
acknowledged by every one, which necessarily pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cede
all sensual Enjoyment, and carry us directly to
seek Possession of the Object. Thus, Hunger and
Thirst have eating and drinking for their End; and
from the Gratification of these primary Appetites
arises a Pleasure, which may become the Object of
another Species of Desire or Inclination, that is se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>condary
and interested. In the same Manner, there
are mental Passions, by which we are impell'd
immediately to seek particular Objects, such as
Fame or Power or Vengeance, without any Regard
to Interest; and when these Objects are attain'd, a
pleasing Enjoyment ensues, as the Consequence of our
indulg'd Affections. Nature must, by the internal
Frame and Constitution of the Mind, give an origi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nal
Propensity to Fame, 'ere we can reap any Pleasure
<pb n="21" facs="24"/>
from it, or pursue it from Motives of Self-love, and
a Desire of Happiness. If I have no Vanity, I take
no Delight in Praise: If I be void of Ambition,
Power gives no Enjoyment: If I be not angry, the
Punishment of an Adversary is totally indifferent to
me. In all these Cases, there is a Passion, which
points immediately to the Object, and constitutes it
our Good or Happiness; as there are other secon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dary
Passions, which afterwards arise, and pursue it
as a Part of our Happiness, when once it is consti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tuted
such, by our original Affections. Were there
no Appetites of any Kind, antecedent to Self-love,
that Propensity could scarce ever exert itself; because
we should, in that Case, have felt few and slender
Pains or Pleasures, and have little Misery or Happi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness,
to avoid or to pursue.</p>
               <p>Now where is the Difficulty of conceiving, that
this may likewise be the Case with Benevolence and
Friendship, and that, from the original Frame of our
Temper, we may feel a Desire of another's Happi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
or Good, which, by Means of that Affection,
becomes our own Good, and is afterwards pursued,
from the conjoin'd Motives of Benevolence and Self-enjoyment?
Who sees not that Vengeance, from
the Force alone of Passion, may be so eagerly pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sued,
as to make us knowingly neglect every Consi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deration
of Ease, Interest, or Safety; and, like
<pb n="22" facs="25"/>
some vindictive Animals, infuse our very Souls into
the Wounds we give an Enemy<note place="bottom" n="*">Animasque in vulnere ponunt. VIRG. Dom alteri noceat, soi negligens, says <hi>Scneca</hi> of Anger, De Ira. L. 1.</note>? And what a ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lignant
Philosophy must it be, that will not allow, to
Humanity and Friendship, the same Privileges, which
are indisputably granted to the darker Passions of En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mity
and Resentment? Such a Philosophy is
more like a Satyr, than a true Delineation or De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scription,
of human Nature; and may be a good
Foundation for paradoxical Wit and Raillery, but is
a very bad one for any serious Argument or Reason<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing.</p>

               <p>IT may be esteem'd, perhaps, a superfluous Task
to prove, that the benevolent or softer Affections
are VIRTUOUS; and wherever they appear,
attract the Esteem, Approbation, and Good-will of
Mankind. The Epithets <hi>sociable, good-natur'd, hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mane,
merciful, grateful, friendly, generous, beneficent,</hi>
are known in all Languages, and universally express
the highest Merit, which <hi>human Nature</hi> is capable of
attaining: Where these amiable Qualities are at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tended
with Birth and Power and eminent Abilities,
and display themselves in the good Government or
<pb n="23" facs="26"/>
useful Instruction of Mankind, they seem even to
raise the Possessors of them above the Rank of <hi>human
Nature,</hi> and approach them, in some Measure, to the
Divine. Exalted Capacity, undaunted Courage,
prosperous Success; these may only expose a Hero
or Politician to the Envy and Malignity of the Pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lic:
But as soon as the Praises are added of humane
and beneficent; when Instances are display'd of
Lenity, Tenderness, or Friendship; Envy itself is
silent, or joins the general Voice of Applause and
Acclamation.</p>
               <p>WHEN <hi>Pericles,</hi> the great <hi>Athenian</hi> Statesman and
General, was on his Death-bed, his surrounding
Friends, esteeming him now insensible, began to
indulge their Sorrow for their expiring Patron, by
enumerating his great Qualities and Successes, his
Conquests and Victories, the unusual Length of his
Administration, and his nine Trophies, erected over
the Enemies of the Republic. <hi>You forget,</hi> cries the
dying Hero, who had heard all, <hi>you forget the most
eminent of my Praises, while you dwell so much on those
vulgar Advantages, in which Fortune had a principal
Share. You have not observ'd, that no Citizen has ever

IN Men of more ordinary Talents and Capacity,
the social Virtues become, if possible, still more es<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sentially
requisite; there being nothing eminent, in
that Case, to compensate for the Want of them, or
preserve the Person from our severest Hatred, as well
as Contempt. A high Ambition, an elevated Cou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rage
is apt, says <hi>Cicero,</hi> in less perfect Characters, to
degenerate into a turbulent Ferocity. The more
social and softer Virtues are there chiefly to be re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>garded.
These are always good and amiable<note place="bottom" n="*">Cic. de Officiis, Lib. 1.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE principal Advantage, which <hi>Juvenal</hi> disco<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vers
in the extensive Capacity of the human Species,
is, that it renders our Benevolence also more exten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sive,
and gives us larger Opportunities of spreading
our kindly Influence than what are indulg'd to the
inferior Creation<note place="bottom" n="†">Sat. xv. 139, &amp; seq.</note>. It must, indeed, be confest,
that by doing Good only, can a Man truly enjoy the
Advantages of being eminent. His exalted Station,
of itself, but the more exposes him to Tempest and
Thunder. His sole Prerogative is to afford Shelter
to Inferiors, who repose themselves under his Cover
and Protection.</p>
               <p>BUT I forget, that it is not my present Business to
recommend Generosity and Benevolence, or to paint,
<pb n="25" facs="28"/>
in their true Colours, all the genuine Charms of the
social Virtues. These, indeed, sufficiently engage
every Heart, on the first Apprehension of them; and
'tis difficult to abstain from some Sally of Panegyric,
as often as they occur in Discourse or Reasoning.
But our Object here being more the speculative, than
the practical Part of Morals, 'twill suffice to remark,
what will readily, I believe, be allow'd, that no
Qualities are more entitled to the general Good-will
and Approbation of Mankind, than Beneficence and
Humanity, Friendship and Gratitude, Natural Af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fection
and Public Spirit, or whatever proceeds from
a tender Sympathy with others, and a generous
Concern for our Kind and Species. These, where<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever
they appear, seem to transfuse themselves, in a

IN all Determinations of Morality, this Circum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stance
of public Utility is ever principally in View;
and wherever Disputes arise, whether in Philosophy
or common Life, concerning the Bounds of Duty,
the Question cannot, by any Means, be decided
with greater Certainty, than by ascertaining, on any
Side, the true Interests of Mankind. If any false
Opinion, embrac'd from Appearances, has been
found to prevail; as soon as farther Experience,
and sounder Reasoning have given us juster Notions
of human Affairs; we retract our first Sentiments,
and adjust a-new the Boundaries of moral Good and
Evil.</p>
               <p>ALMS to common Beggars is naturally prais'd;
because it seems to carry Relief to the distrest

                  <hi>Tyrannicide</hi> or the Assassination of Usurpers and

Models for Imitation.</p>
               <p>LIBERATITY in Princes is regarded as a Mark of
Beneficence: But when it occurs, that the homely
Bread of the Honest and Industrious is often thereby
converted into delicious Cates for the Idle and the
Prodigal, we soon retract our heedless Praises. The
Regrets of a Prince, for having lost a Day, were

Conveniencies of Life, had long been suppos'd the
Source of every Corruption and Disorder in Go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernment,
and the immediate Cause of Faction,
Sedition, civil Wars, and the total Loss of Liberty.
It was, therefore, universally regarded as a Vice,
and was an Object of Declamation to all Satyrists
and severe Moralists. Those, who prove, or at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tempt
to prove, that such Refinements rather tend to
the Encrease of Industry, Civility, and Arts, regu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>late
a new our <hi>moral</hi> as well as <hi>political</hi> Sentiments,
<pb n="31" facs="34"/>
and represent as laudable and innocent, what had
formerly been regarded as pernicious and blame<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able.</p>
               <p>UPON the Whole, then, it seems undeniable, <hi>that</hi>
there is such a Sentiment in human Nature as dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>interested
Benevolence; <hi>that</hi> nothing can bestow
more Merit on any human Creature than the Pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>session
of it in an eminent Degree; and <hi>that</hi> a <hi>Part,</hi>
at least, of its Merit arises from its Tendency to
promote the Interests of our Species, and bestow
Happiness on human Society. We carry our View
into the salutary Consequences of such a Character
and Disposition; and whatever has so benign an In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fluence,
and forwards so desirable an End is beheld
with Complacency and Pleasure. The social Vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tues
are never regarded without their beneficial
Tendencies, nor view'd as barren and unfruitful.
The Happiness of Mankind, the Order of Society,
the Harmony of Families, the mutual Support of
Friends are always consider'd as the Result of their
gentle Dominion over the Breasts of Men.</p>
               <p>How considerable a <hi>Part</hi> of their Merit we ought

               <p>THAT JUSTICE is useful to Society, and
consequently that <hi>Part</hi> of its Merit, at least,
must arise from that Consideration; 'twould be a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>superfluous
Undertaking to prove. That public
Utility is the <hi>sole</hi> Origin of Justice, and that Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>flections
on the beneficial Consequences of this Vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tue
are the <hi>sole</hi> Foundation of its Merit; this Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position,
being more curious and important, will
better deserve our Examination and Enquiry.</p>
               <p>LET us suppose, that Nature has bestow'd on hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man
Race such profuse <hi>Abundance</hi> of all <hi>external</hi>
Conveniencies, that, without any Uncertainty in the
Event, without any Care or Industry on our Part,
every Individual finds himself fully provided of
<pb n="34" facs="36"/>
whatever his most voracious Appetites can want, or
luxurious Imagination wish or desire. His natural
Beauty, we shall suppose, surpasses all acquir'd Or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>naments:
The perpetual Clemency of the Seasons
renders useless all Cloaths or Covering: The raw
Herbage affords him the most delicious Fare; the
clear Fountain, the richest Beverage. No laborious
Occupation requir'd: No Tillage: No Navigation.
Music, Poetry, and Contemplation form his sole
Business: Conversation, Mirth, and Friendship his
sole Amusement.</p>
               <p>IT seems evident, that, in such a happy State,
every other social Virtue would flourish, and receive
a tenfold Encrease; but the cautious, jealous Virtue
of Justice would never once have been dreamt of.
For what Purpose make a Partition of Goods, where
every one has already more than enough? Why
give Rise to Property, where there cannot possibly
be any Injury? Why call this Object <hi>mine,</hi> when,
upon the Seizure of it by another, I need but stretch
out my Hand to possess myself of what is equally
valuable? Justice, in that Case, being totally
USELESS, would be an idle Ceremonial, and
could never possibly have Place amongst the Cata<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>logue
of Virtues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="37"/>
WE see, even in the present necessitous Condition
of Mankind, that, wherever any Benefit is bestow'd
by Nature in an unlimited Abundance, we leave it
always in common amongst the whole human Race,
and make no Subdivisions of Right and Property.
Water and Air, tho' the most necessary of all Ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jects,
are not challeng'd by Individuals; nor can
any one commit Injustice by the most lavish Use and
Enjoyment of these Blessings. In fertile, extensive
Countries, with few Inhabitants, Land is regarded
on the same Footing. And no Topic is so much in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sisted
on by those, who defend the Liberty of the
Seas, as the unexhausted Use of them in Navigation.
Were the Advantages, procur'd by Navigation, as
inexhaustible, these Reasoners never had had any
Adversaries to refute; nor had any Claims been ever
advanc'd of a separate, exclusive Dominion over the
Ocean.</p>
               <p>IT may happen in some Countries, at some Pe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riods,
that there be establish'd a Property in Water,
none in Land<note place="bottom" n="*">

Quantities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="38"/>
AGAIN; suppose, that, tho' the Necessities of hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man
Race continue the same as at present, yet the
Mind is so enlarg'd, and so replete with Friendship
and Generosity, that every Man has the utmost Ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derness
for every Man, and feels no more Concern
for his own Interest than for that of his Fellow: It
seems evident, that the USE of Justice would, in
this Case, be suspended by such an extensive Bene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>volence,
nor would the Divisions and Barriers of
Property and Obligation have ever been thought of.
Why should I bind another, by a Deed or Promise,
to do me any Good-office, when I know he is be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore-hand
prompted, by the strongest Inclination,
to seek my Happiness, and would, of himself, per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>form
the desir'd Service; except the Hurt, he there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>by
receives, be greater than the Benefit accruing to
me: In which Case, he knows, that, from my in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nate
Humanity and Friendship, I should be the first
to oppose myself to his imprudent Generosity?
Why raise Land-marks betwixt my Neighbour's
Field and mine, when my Heart has made no Divi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion
betwixt our Interests; but shares all his Joys and
Sorrows with equal Force and Vivacity as if origi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nally
my own? Every Man, upon this Supposition,
being a Second-self to another, would trust all his
Interests to the Discretion of every Man, without
Jealousy, without Partition, without Distinction.
<pb n="37" facs="39"/>
And the whole Race of Mankind would form only
one Family; where all lay in common, and was
us'd, freely, without Regard to Property; but cau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tiously
too, with as entire Regard to the Necessities
of each Individual, as if our own Interests were most
intimately concern'd.</p>
               <p>IN the present Disposition of the human Heart,
'twould, perhaps, be difficult to find compleat In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stances
of such enlarg'd Affections; but still we may
observe, that the Case of Families approaches to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards
it; and the stronger is the mutual Benevolence
amongst the Individuals, the nearer it approaches;
till all Distinction of Property be, in a great
Measure, lost and confounded amongst them. Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>twixt
marry'd Persons, the Cement of Friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship
is by the Laws suppos'd so strong as to
abolish all Division of Possessions; and has often,
in Reality, the Force ascribed to it. And 'tis
observable, that, during the Ardour of new En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thusiasms,
where every Principle is inflam'd into
Extravagance, the Community of Goods has fre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently
been attempted; and nothing but Experience
of its Inconveniencies, from the returning or dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guis'd
Selfishness of Men, could make the imprudent
Fanatics adopt a-new the Ideas of Justice and of se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parate
Property. So true is it, that that Virtue de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rives
<pb n="38" facs="40"/>
its Existence altogether from its necessary <hi>Use</hi> to
the Intercourse and Society of Mankind.</p>
               <p>To make this Truth more evident, let us reverse
the foregoing Suppositions; and carrying every
Thing to the opposite Extreme, consider what would
be the Effect of these new Situations. Suppose a
Society to fall into such Want of all common Ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessaries,
that the utmost Frugality and Industry can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not
preserve the greatest Number from perishing,
and the whole from extreme Sufferance: It will
readily, I believe, be admitted, that the strict Laws
of Justice are suspended, in such a pressing Emer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gence,
and give Place to the stronger Motives of
Necessity and Self-preservation. Is it any Crime,
after a Shipwreck, to seize whatever Means or In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>strument
of Safety one can lay hold of, without Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard
to former Limitations of Property? Or if a
City besieg'd were starving with Hunger; can we
imagine, that Men will see any Means of Life be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore
them, and perish, from a scrupulous Regard to
what, in other Situations, would be the Rules of
Equity and Justice? The USE and TENDENCY
of that Virtue is to procure Happiness and Security,
by preserving Order in Society: But where the So<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciety
is ready to perish from extreme Necessity, no
greater Evil can be dreaded from Violence and In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>

                     <desc>illegible</desc>
                  </gap>ustice;
and every Man may now provide for himself,
<pb n="39" facs="41"/>
by all Means, which Prudence can dictate, or Hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manity
permit. The Public, even in less urgent Ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessities,
open Granaries, without the Consent of
Proprietors; as justly supposing, that the Authority
of Magistracy may, consistent with Equity, extend
so far: But were any Number of Men to assemble,
without the Tye of Laws or civil Jurisdiction;
would an equal Partition of Bread in a Famine,
even without the Proprietor's Consent, be regarded
as criminal or injurious?</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE also, that it should be a virtuous Man's
Fate to fall into the Society of Ruffians, remote
from the Protection of Laws and Government;
what Conduct must he embrace in that melancholy
Situation? He sees such a desperate Rapaciousness
prevail; such a Disregard to Equity, such Contempt
of Order, such stupid Blindness to future Conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quences,
as must immediately have the most tragical
Conclusion, and must terminate in Destruction to
the greater Number, and in a total Dissolution of
Society to the rest. He, mean while, can have no
other Expedient, than to arm himself, to whom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever
the Sword he seizes, or the Buckler may be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>long:
Make Provision of all Means of Defence and
Security: And his particular Regard to Justice being
no longer of USE to his own Safety or that of
others, he must consult alone the Dictates of Self-preservation,
<pb n="40" facs="42"/>
without Concern for those, who no
longer merit his Care and Attention.</p>
               <p>WHEN any Man, even in political Society, renders
himself, by his Crimes, obnoxious to the Public, he
is punish'd by the Laws in his Goods and Person;
that is, the ordinary Rules of Justice are, with Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard
to him, suspended for a Moment, and it be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>comes
equitable to inflict on him, for the <hi>Benefit</hi> of
Society, what, otherwise, he could not suffer with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out
Wrong or Injury.</p>
               <p>THE Rage and Violence of public War; what
is it but a Suspension of Justice amongst the warring.
Parties, who perceive, that that Virtue is now no
longer of any <hi>Use</hi> or <hi>Advantage</hi> to them? The Laws
of War, which then succeed to those of Equity and
Justice, are Rules calculated for the <hi>Advantage</hi> and
<hi>Utility</hi> of that particular State, in which Men are now
plac'd. And were a civiliz'd Nation engag'd with
Barbarians, who observ'd no Rules even of War;
the former must also suspend their Observance of
them, where they no longer serve to any Purpose;
and must render every Action or Rencounter as
bloody and pernicious as possible to the first Ag<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gressors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="43"/>
THUS the Rules of Equity or Justice depend en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tirely
on the particular State and Condition, in
which Men are plac'd, and owe their Origin and
Existence to that UTILITY, which results to
the Public from their strict and regular Observance.
Reverse, in any considerable Circumstance, the Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dition
of Men: Produce extreme Abundance or
extreme Necessity: Implant in the human Breast
perfect Moderation and Humanity, or perfect Rapa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciousness
and Malice: By rendering Justice totally
<hi>useless,</hi> you thereby totally destroy its Essence, and
suspend its Obligation upon Mankind.</p>
               <p>THE common Situation of Society is a Medium
amidst all these Extremes. We are naturally par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tial
to Ourselves, and to our Friends; but are ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pable
of learning the Advantage, resulting from a
more equal Conduct. Few Enjoyments are given
us from the open and liberal Hand of Nature; but
by Art, Labour, and Industry, we can extract them
in great Abundance. Hence the Ideas of Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perty
become necessary in all civil Society: Hence
Justice derives its Usefulness to the Public: And
hence alone arises its Merit and moral Obligation.</p>
               <p>THESE Conclusions are so natural and obvious,
that they have not escap'd even the Poets, in their
<pb n="42" facs="44"/>
Descriptions of the Felicity, attending the Golden
Age or the Reign of <hi>Saturn.</hi> The Seasons, in that
first Period of Nature, were so temperate, if we
credit these agreeable Fictions, that there was no
Necessity for Men to provide themselves with Cloaths
and Houses, as a Security against the Violence of
Heat and Cold: The Rivers flow'd with Wine and
Milk: The Oaks yielded Honey; and Nature
spontaneously produc'd her greatest Delicacies. Nor
were these the chief Advantages of that happy Age.
The Storms and Tempests were not alone remov'd
from Nature; but those more furious Tempests were
unknown to human Breasts, which now cause such
Uproar, and engender such Confusion. Avarice,
Ambition, Cruelty, Selfishness were never heard of:
Cordial Affection, Compassion, Sympathy were the
only Movements, with which the Mind was yet ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quainted.
Even the punctilious Distinction of <hi>Mine</hi>
and <hi>Thine</hi> was banish'd from amongst that happy
Race of Mortals, and carry'd with it the very No<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
of Property and Obligation, Justice and In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>justice.</p>
               <p>THIS <hi>poetical</hi> Fiction of the <hi>Golden Age</hi> is, in some
Respects, of a Piece with the <hi>philosophical</hi> Fiction
of the <hi>State of Nature;</hi> only that the former is re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>presented
as the most charming and most peaceable
Condition, that can possibly be imagin'd; whereas the
<pb n="43" facs="45"/>
latter is pointed out as a State of mutual War and
Violence, attended with the most extreme Necessity.
On the first Origin of Mankind, as we are told, their
Ignorance and savage Nature were so prevalent,
that they could give no mutual Trust, but must each
depend upon himself, and his own Force or Cunning
for Protection and Security. No Law was heard of:
No Rule of Justice known: No Distinction of Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perty
regarded: Power was the only Measure of
Right; and a perpetual War of All against All was
the Result of their untam'd Selfishness and Barba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity<note place="bottom" n="*">This Fiction of a State of Nature, as a State of War, was not first started by Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> as is commonly imagin'd. <hi>Plato.</hi> endeavours to refute an Hypothesis very like it in the 2d, 3d and 4th Books de Republica. <hi>Cicero,</hi> on the contrary, supposes it certain and universally acknowledged in the following beautiful Passage, which is the only Authority I shall cite for these Reason<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings: Not imitating in this the Example of <hi>Puffendorf,</hi> nor even that of <hi>Grotius,</hi> who think a Verse from <hi>Ovid</hi> or <hi>Plautus</hi> or <hi>Pe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tronius</hi> a necessary Warrant for every moral Truth; or the Exam<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple of Mr. <hi>Woolaston,</hi> who has constant Recourse to <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi> Authors for the same Purpose. <hi>Quis enim vestrûm, judices, ignorat, ita naturam rerum tulisse, ut quodam tempore homines, nondum neque naturali, neque civili jure descripto, fusi per agros, ac dispersi vagarentur, tantumque haberent quantum manu ac viri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bus, per caedem ac vulnera, aut eripere, aut retinere potuissent?

                  <pb n="44" facs="46"/>
WHETHER such a Condition of human Nature
could ever exist, or if it did, could continue so long
as to merit the Appellation of a <hi>State,</hi> may justly be
doubted. Men are necessarily born in a Family-society,
at least; and are train'd up by their Parents
to some Rule of Conduct and Behaviour. But this
must be admitted, that if such a State of mutual
War and Violence was ever real, the Suspension of
all Laws of Justice, from their absolute Inutility, is
a necessary and infallible Consequence.</p>
               <p>THE more we vary our Views of human Life,
and the newer and more unusual the Lights are, in
which we survey it, the more shall we be convinc'd,
that the Origin here assign'd for the Virtue of Justice
is real and satisfactory.</p>
               <p>WERE there a Species of Creatures, intermingied
with Men, which, tho' rational, were possest of such
<pb n="45" facs="47"/>
inferior Strength, both of Body and Mind, that
they were incapable of all Resistance, and could
never, upon the highest Provocation, make us feel
the Effects of their Resentment; the necessary Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sequence,
I think, is, that we should be bound, by
the Laws of Humanity, to give gentle Usage to
these Creatures, but should not, properly speaking,
lie under any Restraint of Justice with Regard to
them, nor could they possess any Right or Property,
exclusive of such arbitrary Lords. Our Intercourse
with them could not be call'd Society, which sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poses
a Degree of Equality; but absolute Command
on the one Side, and servile Obedience on the other.
Whatever we covet, they must instantly resign: Our
Permission is the only Tenure, by which they hold
their Possessions: Our Compassion and Kindness the
only Check, by which they curb our lawless Will:
And as no Inconvenience ever results from the Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ercise
of a Power, so firmly establish'd in Nature,
the Restraints of Justice and Property, being totally
<hi>useless,</hi> would never have Place, in so unequal a Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>federacy.</p>
               <p>THIS is plainly the Situation of Men with regard
to Animals; and how far these may be said to pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sess
Reason, I leave it to others to determine. The
great Superiority of civiliz'd <hi>Europeans</hi> above bar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>barous
<hi>Indians,</hi> tempted us to imagine ourselves on
<pb n="46" facs="48"/>
the same Footing with regard to them, and made us
throw off all Restraints of Justice, and even of Hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manity,
in our Treatment of them. In many Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions,
the female Sex are reduc'd to like Slavery,
and are render'd incapable of all Property, in Op<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position
to their lordly Masters. But tho' the Males,
when united, have, in all Countries, brute Force
sufficient to maintain this severe Tyranny; yet such
are the Insinuation, Address, and Charms of their
fair Companions, that they are commonly able to
break the Confederacy, and share with the superior
Sex in all the Rights and Privileges of Society.</p>
               <p>WERE the human Species so fram'd by Nature as
that each Individual possest within himself every
Faculty, requisite both for his own Preservation and
for the Propagation of his Kind: Were all Society
and Intercourse cut off betwixt Man and Man, by the
primary Intention of the supreme Creator: It seems
evident, that so solitary a Being would be as much
incapable of Justice, as of social Discourse and
Conversation. Where mutual Regards and For<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bearance
serve no Manner of Purpose, they would
never direct the Conduct of any reasonable Man.
The headlong Course of the Passions would be
check'd by no Reflection on future Consequences.
And as each Man is here suppos'd to love himself
alone, and to depend only on himself and his own
<pb n="47" facs="49"/>
Activity for Safety and Happiness, he would, on
every Occasion, to the utmost of his Power, chal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lenge
the Preference above every other Being, to
whom he is not bound by any Ties, either of Nature
or of Interest.</p>
               <p>BUT suppose the Conjunction of the Sexes to be
establish'd in Nature, a Family immediately arises;
and particular Rules being found requisite for its
Subsistance, these are immediately embrac'd; tho'
without comprehending the rest of Mankind within
their Prescriptions. Suppose, that several Families
unite together into one Society, which is totally dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>join'd
from all others, the Rules, which preserve
Peace and Order, enlarge themselves to the utmost
Extent of that Society; but, being entirely useless,
lose their Force when carry'd one Step farther. But
again suppose, that several distinct Societies main<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain
a Kind of Entercourse for mutual Convenience
and Advantage, the Boundaries of Justice still grow
larger and larger, in Proportion to the Largeness of
Men's Views, and the Force of their mutual Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nexions.
History, Experience, Reason sufficiently
instruct us in this natural Progress of human Senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments,
and the gradual Encrease of our Regards to
Property and Justice in Proportion as we become
acquainted with the extensive <hi>Utility</hi> of that Virtue.</p>

               <p>IF we examine all the <hi>particular</hi> Laws, by which
Justice is directed, and Property determin'd; we
shall still be presented with the same Conclusion.
The Good of Mankind is the only Object of all
these Laws and Regulations. Not only 'tis requisite,
for the Peace and Interest of Society, that Men's
Possessions should be separated; but the Rules,
which we follow in making the Separation, are such
as can best be contriv'd to serve farther the Interests
of Society.</p>
               <p>WE shall suppose, that a Creature, possest of
Reason, but unacquainted with human Nature, de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liberates
with himself what RULES of Justice or
Property would best promote public Interest, and
establish Peace and Security amongst Mankind:
His most obvious Thought would be, to assign the
largest Possessions to the most extensive Virtue, and
give every one the Power of doing Good, propor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion'd
to his Inclination. In a perfect Theocracy,
where a Being, infinitely intelligent, governs by par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticular
Volitions, this Rule would certainly have
Place, and might serve the wisest Purposes: But
were Mankind to execute such a Law; (so great is
the Uncertainty of Merit, both from its natural Ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scurity,
<pb n="49" facs="51"/>
and from the Self-conceit of each Indivi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dual)
that no determinate Rule of Conduct would
ever result from it; and the total Dissolution of So<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciety
must be the immediate Consequence. Fanatics
may suppose, <hi>that Dominion is founded in Grace,</hi> and
<hi>that Saints alone inherit the Earth;</hi> but the civil
Magistrate very justly puts these sublime Theorists
on the same Footing with common Robbers, and
teaches them, by the severest Discipline, that a Rule,
which, in Speculation, may seem the most advanta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>geous
to Society, may yet be found, in Practice, to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tally
pernicious and destructive.</p>
               <p>THAT there were <hi>religious</hi> Fanatics of this kind in
<hi>England,</hi> during the civil Wars, we learn from
History; tho' 'tis probable, that the obvious <hi>Ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dency</hi>
of these Principles excited such Horrour in
Mankind, as soon oblig'd the dangerous Enthusiasts
to renounce, or at least conceal their Tenets. Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps,
the <hi>Levellers,</hi> who claim'd an equal Distribu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
of Property, were a Kind of <hi>political</hi> Fanatics,
which arose from the religious Species, and more
openly avow'd their Pretensions, as carrying a more
plausible Appearance, of being practicable, as well
as useful to human Society.</p>
               <p>IT must, indeed, be confest, that Nature is so
liberal to Mankind, that were all her Presents equally
<pb n="50" facs="52"/>
divided amongst the Species, and improv'd by Art
and Industry, every Individual would enjoy all the
Necessaries, and even most of the Comforts of Life;
nor would ever be liable to any Ills, but such as
might accidentally arise from the sickly Frame and
Constitution of his Body. It must also be confest,
that, wherever we depart from this Equality, we
rob the Poor of more Satisfaction than we add to
the Rich, and that the slight Gratification of a fri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>volous
Vanity, in one Individual, frequently costs
more than Bread to many Families, and even Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vinces.
It may appear withal, that the Rule of
Equality, as it would be highly <hi>useful,</hi> is not altoge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
<hi>impracticable;</hi> but has taken Place, at least, in
an imperfect Degree, in some Republics; particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larly,
that of <hi>Sparta;</hi> where it was attended, as 'tis
said, with the most beneficial Consequences. Not
to mention, that the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Laws, so frequently
claim'd in <hi>Rome,</hi> and carry'd to Execution in many
<hi>Greek</hi> Cities, proceeded, all of them, from a general
Idea of the Utility of this Principle.</p>
               <p>But Historians, and even common Sense, may in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>form
us, that, however specious these Ideas of <hi>per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect</hi>
Equality may seem, they are really, at the Bot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tom,
<hi>impracticable;</hi> and were they not so, would be
extremely <hi>pernicious</hi> to human Society. Render the
Possessions of Men ever so equal, their different De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>grees
<pb n="51" facs="53"/>
of Art, Care, and Industry will immediately
break that Equality. Or if you check these Virtues,
you reduce Society to the extremest Indigence; and
instead of preventing Want and Beggary in a few,
render it unavoidable to the whole Community.
The most rigorous Inquisition too, is requisite to
watch every Inequality on its first Appearance; and
the most severe Jurisdiction, to punish and redress it.
But besides, that so much Authority must soon de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>generate
into Tyranny, and be exerted with great
Partialities; who can possibly be possest of it, in
such a Situation as is here suppos'd? Perfect Equa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lity
of Possessions, destroying all Subordination,
weakens extremely the Authority of Magistracy, and
must reduce all Power nearly to a Level, as well as
Property.</p>
               <p>WE may conclude, therefore, that, in order to
establish Laws for the Regulation of Property, we
must be acquainted with the Nature and Situation
of Man, must reject Appearances, which may be
false, tho' specious, and must search for those Rules,
which are, on the whole, most <hi>useful,</hi> and <hi>beneficial,</hi>
Vulgar Sense and slight Experience are sufficient for
this Purpose; where Men give not way to too selfish
Avidity, or too extensive Enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="54"/>
WHO sees not, for Instance, that whatever is pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duc'd
or improv'd by a Man's Art or Industry ought,
for ever, to be secur'd to him, in order to give En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>couragement
to such <hi>useful</hi> Habits and Accomplish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments?
That the Property ought also to descend to
Children and Relations, for the same <hi>useful</hi> Purpose?
That it may be alienated by Consent, in order to be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>get
that Commerce and Intercourse, which is so <hi>be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neficial</hi>
to human Society? And that all Contracts
and Promises ought carefully to be fulfill'd, in order
to secure mutual Trust and Confidence, by which
the general <hi>Interest</hi> of Mankind is so much pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>moted?</p>
               <p>EXAMINE the Writers on the Laws of Nature;
and you will always find, that, whatever Principles
they set out with, they are sure to terminate here at
last, and to assign, as the ultimate Reason for every
Rule they establish, the Convenience and Necessities
of Mankind. A Concession thus extorted, in Op<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position
to Systems, has more Authority, than if it
had been made, in Prosecution of them.</p>
               <p>WHAT other Reason, indeed, could Writers ever
give, why this must be <hi>mine</hi> and that <hi>yours;</hi> since
uninstructed Nature, surely, never made any such
Distinction? These Objects are, of themselves,
<pb n="53" facs="55"/>
foreign to us; they are totally disjoin'd and separate;
and nothing but the general Interests of Society can
form the Connection.</p>
               <p>SOMETIMES, the Interests of Society may require
a Rule of Justice in a particular Case; but may no<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">
                     <desc>illegible</desc>
                  </gap>
determine any particular Rule, amongst several,
which are all equally beneficial. In that Case, the
slightest <hi>Analogies</hi> are laid hold of, in order to pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vent
that Indifference and Ambiguity, which would
be the Source of perpetual Quarrels and Dissentions.
Thus Possession alone, and first Possession, is suppos'd
to convey Property, where no-body else has any
precedent Claim and Pretension. Many of the
Reasonings of Lawyers are of this analogical Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture,
and depend on very slight Connexions of the
Imagination.</p>
               <p>Is it ever scrupled, in extraordinary Cases, to vio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>late
all Regard to the private Property of Individuals,
and sacrifice to public Interest a Distinction, which
had been establish'd for the Sake of that Interest?
The Safety of the People is the supreme Law: All
other particular Laws are subordinate to it, and de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pendant
on it: And if, in the <hi>common</hi> Course of
Things, they be followed and regarded; 'tis only
because the public Safety and Interest, <hi>commonly</hi> de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mand
so equal and impartial an Administration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="56"/>
SOMETIMES both <hi>Utility</hi> and <hi>Analogy</hi> fail, and leave
the Laws of Justice in total Uncertainty. Thus,
'tis highly requisite, that Prescription or long Pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>session
should convey Property; but what Number
of Days or Months or Years should be sufficient for
that Purpose, 'tis impossible for Reason alone to de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>termine.
<hi>Civil Laws</hi> here supply the Place of the
natural <hi>Code,</hi> and assign different Terms for Prescrip<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
according to the different <hi>Utilities,</hi> propos'd
by the Legislator. Bills of Exchange and promissory
Notes, by the Laws of most Countries, prescribe
sooner than Bonds and Mortgages, and Contracts of
a more formal Nature.</p>
               <p>IN general we may observe, that all Questions of
Property are subordinate to the Authority of civil
Laws, which extend, restrain, modify, and alter
the Rules of natural Justice, according to the par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticular
<hi>Convenience</hi> of each Community. The Laws
have, or ought to have, a constant Reference to the
Constitution of Government, the Manners, the Cli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mate,
the Religion, the Commerce, the Situation of
each Society. A late Author of great Genius, as
well as extensive Learning, has prosecuted this Sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject
at large, and has establish'd, from these Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciples,
the best System of political Knowledge, that,
<pb n="55" facs="57"/>
perhaps, has ever yet been communicated to the
World<note place="bottom" n="*">
                     <p>The Author of <hi>L'Esprit des Loix.</hi> This illustrious Writer, however, sets out with a different Theory, and supposes all Right to be founded on certain <hi>Rapports</hi> or Relations; which is a System, that, in my Opinion, never will reconcile with true Philosophy. Father <hi>Malebranche,</hi> as far as I can learn, was the first, that started this abstract Theory of Morals, which was afterwards adopted by Dr. <hi>Clarke</hi> and others; and as it excludes all Sentiment, and pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tends to found every Thing on Reason, it has not wanted Followers in this philosophic Age. See <hi>Essay</hi> 1. and <hi>Appendix</hi> 1. With 1 gard to Justice, the Virtue here treated of, the Inference against this Theory seems short and conclusive. Property is allow'd to be de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pendant on civil Laws: Civil Laws are allow'd to have no Object but the Interest of Society: This therefore must be allow'd to be the sole Foundation of Property and Justice. Not to mention, that our Obligation itself to obey the Magistrate and his Laws is founded on nothing but the Interests of Society.</p>
                     <p>If the Ideas of Justice, sometimes, do not follow the Dispositi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons of civil Law; we shall find, that these Cases, instead of Ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jections, are Confirmations of the Theory deliver'd above. Where a civil Law is so perverse as to cross all the Interests of Society, it loses all its Authority, and Men judge by the Ideas of natural Justice, which are conformable to those Interests. Sometimes also civil Laws, for useful Purposes, require a Ceremony or Form; and where that is wanting, their Decrees run contrary to the usual Tenor of Justice; but one, who takes Advantage of such Chicanes, is not regarded as an honest Man. Thus, the Interests of Society require, that Contracts be fulfill'd; and there is not a more mate<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rial Article either of natural or civil Justice: But the Omission of a trifling Circumstance will often, by Law, invalidate a Contract, <hi>in foro humano,</hi> but not <hi>in foro conscientiae,</hi> as Divines express them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves. In these Cases, the Magistrate is suppos'd only to with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>draw his Power of enforcing the Right, not to have alter'd the Right. Where his Intention extends to the Right, and is con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formable to the Interests of Society; it never fails to alter the Right; a clear Proof of the Origin of Justice and of Property, as assign'd above.</p>

                  <hi>WHAT is a Man's Property?</hi> Any Thing,
which it is lawful for him and for him alone, to use.
<hi>But what Rule have we, by which we can distinguish
these Objects?</hi> Here we must have Recourse to
Statutes, Customs, Precedents, Analogies, and a
hundred other Circumstances; some of which are
constant and inflexible, some variable and arbitrary.
But the ultimate Point, in which they all professedly
terminate, is, the Interest and Happiness of human
Society. Where this enters not into Consideration,
nothing can appear more whimsical, unnatural, and
even superstitious than all or most of the Laws of
Justice and of Property.</p>
               <p>THOSE, who ridicule vulgar Superstitions, and ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose
the Folly of particular Regards to Meats, Days,
Places, Postures, Apparel, have an easy Task; while
they consider all the Qualities and Relations of the
Objects, and discover no adequate Cause for that
Affection or Antipathy, Veneration or Horrour,
which have so mighty an Influence over a con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>siderable
Part of Mankind. A <hi>Syrian</hi> would have
starv'd rather than taste Pigeon; an <hi>Egyptian</hi> would
<pb n="57" facs="59"/>
not have approach'd Bacon: But if these Species of
Food be examin'd by the Senses of Sight, Smell or
Taste, or scrutiniz'd by the Sciences of Chymistry,
Medicine, or Physics; no Difference is ever found
betwixt them and any other Species, nor can that
precise Circumstance be pitch'd on, which may afford
a just Foundation for the religious Passion. A Fowl
on Thursday is lawful Food; on Friday, abominable:
Eggs in this House, and in this Diocese are per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mitted
during Lent; a hundred Paces farther, to eat
them is a damnable Sin. This Earth or Building▪
yesterday, was prophane; to-day, by the muttering
of certain Words, it has become holy and sacred.
Such Reflections, as these, in the Mouth of a Philo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sopher,
one may safely say, are too obvious to have
any Influence; because they must always, to every
Man, occur at first Sight; and where they prevail
not, of themselves, they are surely obstructed by
Education, Prejudice and Passion, not by Ignorance
or Mistake.</p>
               <p>IT may appear, to a careless View; or rather, a
too abstracted Reflection; that there enters a like
Superstition into all the Regards of Justice; and that,
if a Man subjects its Objects, or what we call Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perty,
to the same Scrutiny of Sense and Science, he
will not, by the most accurate Enquiry, find
any Foundation for the Difference made by moral
<pb n="58" facs="60"/>
Sentiment. I may lawfully nourish myself from this
Tree; but the Fruit of another of the same Species,
ten Paces off, 'tis criminal for me to touch. Had I
wore this Apparel an Hour ago, I had merited the
severest Punishment; but a Man, by pronouncing a
few magical Syllables, has now render'd it fit for my
Use and Service. Were this House plac'd in the
neighbouring Territory, it had been immoral for me
to dwell in it; but being built on this Side the River,
it is subject to a different municipal Law, and I incur
no Blame or Censure. The same Species of Reason<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing,
it may be thought, which so successfully exposes
Superstition, is also applicable to Justice; nor is it
possible, in the one Case more than in the other, to
point out, in the Object, that precise Quality or Cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstance,
which is the Foundation of the Sentiment.</p>
               <p>BUT there is this material Difference betwixt
<hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> that the former is frivolous,
useless, and burthensome; the latter is absolutely re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quisite
to the Well-being of Mankind and Existence
of Society. When we abstract from this Circum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stance
(for 'tis too apparent ever to be overlookt) it
must be confest, that all Regards to Right and Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perty,
seem entirely without Foundation, as much as
the grossest and most vulgar Superstition. Were the
Interests of Society no way concern'd, 'tis as unin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>telligible,
why another's articulating certain Sounds,
<pb n="59" facs="61"/>
implying Consent, should change the Nature of my
Actions with regard to a particular Object, as why
the reciting of a Liturgy by a Priest, in a certain
Habit and Posture, should dedicate a Heap of Brick
and Timber, and render it, thenceforth and for ever,
sacred<note place="bottom" n="*">'Tis evident, that the Will or Consent alone never transfers Property, nor causes the Obligation of a Promise (for the same Reasoning extends to both) but the will must be exprest by Words or Signs, in order to impose a Tye upon any Man. The Expression, being once brought in as subservient to the Will, soon becomes the principal Part of the Promise; nor will a Man be less bound by his Word, tho' he secretly give a different Direction to his Intention, and with hold the Assent of his Mind. But tho' the Expression makes, on most Occasions, the whole of the Promise, yet it does not always so; and one, who should make use of any Expression, of which he knows not the Meaning, and which he uses without any Sense of the Consequences, would not certainly be bound by it. Nay, tho' he know its Meaning, yet if he uses it in Jest only, and with such Signs as show evidently, he has no serious Intention of binding himself, he would not lie under any Obligation of Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formance; but 'tis necessary, that the Words be a perfect Expres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion of the Will, without any contrary Signs. Nay, even this we must not carry so far as to imagine, that one, whom, by our Quickness of Understanding, we conjecture, from certain Signs, to have an Intention of deceiving us, is not bound by his Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pression or verbal Promise, if we accept of it; but must limit this Conclusion to those Cases, where the Signs are of a different Nature from those of Deceit. All those Contradictions are easily accounted for, if Justice arises entirely from its Usefulness to Society; but will never be explain'd on any other Hypothesis.</note>

THESE Reflections are far from weakening the Ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ligations

THUS we seem, upon the Whole, to have attain'd
a Knowledge of the Force of that Principle here in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sisted
on, and can determine what Degree of Esteem
or moral Approbation may result from Reflections on
public Interest and Utility. The Necessity of Justice
to the Support of Society is the SOLE Foundation
of that Virtue; and since no moral Excellence is
more highly esteem'd, we may conclude, that this
Circumstance of Usefulness has, in general, the
strongest Energy, and most entire Command over our
Sentiments. It must, therefore, be the Source of a
considerable Part of the Merit, ascrib'd to Humanity,
Benevolence, Friendship, public Spirit, and other
social Virtues of that Stamp; as it is the SOLE
Source of the moral Approbation pay'd to Fidelity,
Justice, Veracity, Integrity, and those other estimable

            <p>Of POLITICAL SOCIETY.</p>
            <p>HAD every Man sufficient <hi>Sagacity</hi> to perceive,
at all Times, the strong Interest, which binds
him to the Observance of Justice and Equity, and
<hi>Strength of Mind</hi> sufficient to persevere in a steady
Adherence to a general and a distant Interest, in Op<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position
to the Allurements of present Pleasure and
Advantage: There had never, in that Case, been
any such Thing as Government or political Society,
but each Man following his natural Liberty, had
liv'd in entire Peace and Harmony with all others.
What Need of positive Laws, where natural Justice
is, of itself, a sufficient Restraint? Why create
Magistrates, where there never arises any Disorder
or Iniquity? Why abridge our native Freedom,
when, in every Instance, the utmost Exertion of it is
found innocent and beneficial? 'Tis evident, that, if
Government were totally useless, it never could have
Place, and that the SOLE Foundation of the
<pb n="4" facs="65"/>
Duty of ALLEGIANCE is the <hi>Advantage</hi>
which it procures to Society, by preserving Peace and
Order amongst Mankind.</p>
            <p>WHEN a Number of political Societies are erected,
and maintain a great Entercourse together; a new Set
of Rules are immediately discover'd to be <hi>useful</hi> in
that particular Situation; and accordingly take place,
under the Title of LAWS of NATIONS.
Of this Kind are, the Sacredness of the Persons of
Ambassadors, abstaining from poison'd Arms, Quar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter
in War, with others of that Kind; which are
plainly calculated for the <hi>Advantage</hi> of States and
Kingdoms, in their Entercourse with each other.</p>
            <p>THE Rules of Justice, such as prevail amongst
Individuals, are not altogether suspended amongst
political Societies. All Princes pretend a Regard to
the Rights of others; and some, no doubt, without
Hypocrisy. Alliances and Treaties are every Day
made betwixt independent States, which would only
be so much Waste of Parchment, if they were not
found, by Experience, to have <hi>some</hi> Influence and
Authority. But here is the Difference betwixt King<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doms
and Individuals. Human Nature cannot, by
any Means, subsist, without the Association of Indi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>viduals;
and that Association never could have
Place, were no Regard pay'd to the Laws of Equity
<pb n="65" facs="66"/>
and Justice. Disorder, Confusion, the War of All
against All are the necessary Consequences of such a
licentious Conduct. But Nations can flourish with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out
Entercourse. They may even subsist, in some
Degree, under a general War. The Observance of
Justice, tho' useful among them, is not guarded by
so strong a Necessity as among Individuals; and the
<hi>moral Obligation</hi> holds Proportion with the <hi>Usefulness.</hi>
All Politicians will allow, and most Philosophers,
that REASONS of STATE may, in parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cular
Emergencies, dispence with the Rules of Justice,
and invalidate any Treaty or Alliance, where the
strict Observance of it would be prejudicial, in a
considerable Degree, to either of the contracting
Parties. But nothing less than the extremest Necessity,
'tis confest, can justify Individuals in a Breach of
Promise, or an Invasion of the Properties of others.</p>
            <p>IN a confederated Commonwealth, such as the
<hi>Achaean</hi> Republic of old, or the <hi>Swiss</hi> Cantons and
United Provinces in modern Times; as the League
has here a peculiar <hi>Utility,</hi> the Conditions of Union
have a peculiar Sacredness and Authority, and a
Violation of them would be equally criminal, or
even more criminal, than any private Injury or In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>justice.</p>

THOSE who live in the same Family have so many
Opportunities of Licences of this Kind, that nothing
could preserve Purity of Manners, were Marriage
allow'd amongst the nearest Relations, or any Inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>course
of Love betwixt them ratify'd by Law and
Custom. INCEST, therefore, being <hi>pernicious</hi>

and moral Deformity, annex'd to it.</p>
            <p>WHAT is the Reason, why, by the <hi>Greek</hi> Laws,
one might marry a Half-sister by the Father, but not
by the Mother? Plainly this. The Manners of the
<hi>Greeks</hi> were so reserv'd, that a Man was never per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mitted
<pb n="68" facs="71"/>
to approach the Women's Apartment, even in
the same Family, unless where he visited his own
Mother. His Step-mother and her Children were as
much shut up from him as the Women of any other
Family, and there was as little Danger of any crimi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nal
Intercourse betwixt them: Uncles and Nieces,
for a like Reason, might marry at <hi>Athens;</hi> but neither
these nor Half-brothers and Sisters could contract that
Alliance at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Intercourse was more
open betwixt the Sexes. Public Utility is the Cause
of all these Variations.</p>
            <p>To repeat, to a Man's Prejudice, any Thing that
escap'd him in private Conversation, or to make any
such Use of his private Letters, is highly blam'd.
The free and social Intercourse of Minds must be ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tremely
checkt, where no such Rules of Fidelity are
establish'd.</p>
            <p>EVEN in repeating Stories, whence we can see no
ill Consequences to result, the giving one's Authors is
regarded as a Piece of Indiscretion, if not of Immo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rality.
These Stories, in passing from Hand to Hand,
and receiving all the usual Variations, frequently
come about to the Persons concern'd, and produce
Animosities and Quarrels among People, whose

To pry into Secrets, to open or even read the

            <p>THIS Principle is also the Foundation of most of

is commonly very laudable, and is requisite
to support Trust and good Correspondence in Society.
But in Places of general, tho' casual Concourse,
where Health and Pleasure bring People promis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cuously
together, public Conveniency has dispens'd
with this Maxim; and Custom there promotes an
unreserv'd Conversation for the Time, by indulging
the Privilege of dropping afterwards every indifferent

EVEN in Societies, that are establish'd on Principles
the most immoral, and the most destructive to the
Interests of the general Society, there are requir'd
certain Rules and Maxims, which a Species of false
Honour, as well as private Interest, engages the
Members to observe. Robbers and Pyrates, it has
often been remark'd, could not maintain their per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nicious
Confederacy, did they not establish a new
distributive Justice amongst themselves, and recall
those Laws of Equity, which they have violated
with the rest of Mankind.</p>

            <p>AMONGST Nations, where an immoral Gallantry,
if cover'd with a thin Veil of Mystery, is, in some
Degree, authoriz'd by Custom, there immediately
arise a Set of Rules, calculated for the Conveniency
of that Attachment. The famous Court or Parlia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
of Love in <hi>Provence</hi> decided formally all dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficult
Cases of this Nature.</p>
            <p>IN Societies for Play, there are Laws requir'd for
the Conduct of the Game, and these Laws are dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent
<pb n="71" facs="74"/>
in each Game. The Foundation, I own, of
such Societies is frivolous; and the Laws are, in a
great Measure, tho' not altogether, capricious and
arbitrary. So far is there a material Difference be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>twixt
them and the Rules of Justice, Fidelity and
Loyalty. The general Societies of Men are abso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lutely
requisite for the Subsistence of the Species;
and the public Conveniency, which regulates Morals,
is inviolably establish'd in the Nature of Man, and of
the World, in which he lives. The Comparison,
therefore, in these Respects, is very imperfect. We
may only learn from it the Necessity of Rules, where<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever
Men have any Intercourse with each other.</p>
            <p>THEY cannot even pass each other on the Road
without Rules. Waggoners, Coachmen, and Posti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lions
have Principles, by which they give way; and
these are chiefly founded on mutual Ease and Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venience.
Sometimes also they are arbitrary, or at
best dependant on a Kind of capricious Analogy,
like many of the Reasonings of Lawyers<note place="bottom" n="*">That the lighter Machine yields to the heavier, and in Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chines of the same Kind, that the empty yield to the loaded; this Rule is founded on Convenience. That those who are going to the Capital take place of those who are coming from it; this seems to be sounded on some Idea of the Dignity of the great City, and of the Preference of the future to the past. From like Reasons amongst Foot-walkers, the Right-hand entitles a Man to the Wall, and prevents jostling, which peaceable People find very disagreeable and inconvenient.</note>.</p>

To carry the Matter farther, we may observe, that
'tis impossible for Men so much as to murther each
other without Statutes and Maxims, and an Idea of
Justice and Honour. War has it Laws as well
as Peace; and even that sportive Kind of War carried
on amongst Wrestlers, Boxers, Cudgel-players,

               <p>IT seems so natural a Thought to ascribe to their
Utility the Praise which we bestow on the social
Virtues, that one would expect to meet with this
Principle every-where in moral Writers, as the chief
Foundation of their Reasoning and Inquiry. In
common Life, we may observe, that the Circumstance
of Utility is always appeal'd to; nor is it suppos'd,
that a greater Elogy can be given to any Man, than
to display his Usefulness to the Public, and enumerate
the Services he has perform'd to Mankind and Society.
What Praise, even of an inanimate Form, if the
Regularity and Elegance of its Parts destroy not its
Fitness for any useful Purpose! And how satis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>factory
an Apology for any Disproportion of seeming
Deformity, if we can show the Necessity of that
<pb n="74" facs="77"/>
particular Construction for the Use intended! A
Ship appears infinitely more beautiful to an Artist,
or one moderately skill'd in Navigation; where its
Prow is wide and swelling beyond its Poop, than if it
were fram'd with a precise geometrical Regularity,
in Contradiction to all the Laws of Mechanics. A
Building, whose Doors and Windows were exact
Squares, would hurt the Eye by that very Proportion;
as ill adapted to the human Figure, for whose Service
the Fabric was intended What Wonder then, that
a Man, whose Habits and Conduct are hurtful to
Society, and dangerous or pernicious to every one,
that has an Intercourse with him, should, on that
Account, be an Object of Disapprobation, and com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>municate
to every Spectator the strongest Sentiments
of Disgust and Hatred<note place="bottom" n="*">
                     <p>We ought not to imagine, because an inanimate Object may be useful as well as a Man, that therefore it ought also, according to this System, to merit the Appellation of <hi>virtuous.</hi> The Sentiments, excited by Utility, are, in the two Cases, very different; and the one is mixt with Affection, Esteem, Appro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not the other. In like Manner, an inanimate Object may have good Colour and Proportions as well as a human Figure. But can we ever be in Love with the former? There are a numerous Set of Passions and Sentiments, of which think<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing rational Beings are, by the original Constitution of Nature, the only proper Objects: And tho' the very same Qualities be transferr'd to an insensible, inanimate Being, they will not excite the same Sentiments. The beneficial Qualities of Herbs and Mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nerals are, indeed, sometimes call'd their <hi>Virtues;</hi> but this is an Effect of the Caprice of Language, which ought not to be regarded in Reasoning. For tho' there be a Species of Approba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, attending even inanimate Objects, when beneficial, yet this Sentiment is so weak, and so different from what is directed to beneficent Magistrates or Statesmen, that they ought not to be rank'd under the same Class or Appellation.</p>
                     <p>A very small Variation of the Object, even where the same Qualities are preserv'd, will destroy a Sentiment. Thus; the same Beauty, transferr'd to a different Sex, excites no amorous Passion, where Nature is not extremely perverted.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="78"/>
BUT perhaps the Difficulty of accounting for these
Effects of Usefulness, or its contrary, has kept Philo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sophers
from admitting them into their Systems of
Ethics, and has induc'd them rather to employ any
other Principle, in explaining the Origin of moral
Good and Evil. But 'tis no just Reason for rejecting
any Principle, confirm'd by Experience, that we can
give no satisfactory Account of its Origin, nor are
able to resolve it into other more general Principles.
And if we would employ a little Thought on the
present Subject, we need be at no Loss to account for
the Influence of Utility, and to deduce it from Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciples,
the most known and avow'd in human Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="79"/>
FROM the apparent Usefulness of the social Virtues,
it has readily been inferr'd by Sceptics, both antient
and modern, that all moral Distinctions arise from
Education, and were, at first, invented, and after<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards
encourag'd, by the Arts of Politicians, in order
to render Men tractable, and subdue their natural
Ferocity and Selfishness, which incapacitated them
for Society. This Principle, indeed, of Precept and
Education must be so far own'd to have a powerful
Influence, that it may frequently encrease or dimi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nish,
beyond their natural Standard, the Sentiments
of Approbation or Dislike; and may even, in par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticular
Instances, create, without any natural Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciple,
a new Sentiment of this Kind; as is evident
in all superstitious Practices and Observances: But
that <hi>all</hi> moral Affection or Dislike arises from this
Origin will never surely be allow'd by any judicious
Enquirer. Had Nature made no such Distinction,
founded on the original Frame and Constitution of
the Mind, the Words, <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>shameful, lovely</hi>
and <hi>odious, noble</hi> and <hi>despicable,</hi> never had had place
in any Language; nor could Politicians, had they
invented these Terms, ever have been able to render
them intelligible, or make them convey any Idea to
the Audience. So that nothing can be more super<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficial
than this Paradox of the Sceptics; and 'twere
well, if, in the abstruser Studies of Logics and Me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>taphysics,
<pb n="77" facs="80"/>
we could as easily get rid of the Cavils of
that Sect, as in the more practical and intelligible
Sciences of Politics and Morals.</p>
               <p>THE social Virtues must, therefore, be allow'd to
have a natural Beauty and Amiableness, which, at
first, antecedent to all Precept or Education, recom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mends
them to the Esteem of uninstructed Mankind,
and engages their Affections. And as the Utility of
these Virtues is the chief Circumstance, whence they
derive their Merit, it follows, that the End, which
they have a Tendency to promote, must be some
way agreeable to us, and take hold of some natural
Affection. It must please, either from Considerations
of Self-interest, or from more generous Motives and
Regards.</p>
               <p>IT has often been asserted, that, as every Man has
a strong Connexion with Society, and perceives the
Impossibility of his solitary Subsistence, he becomes,
on that Account, favourable to all those Habits or
Principles, which promote Order in Society, and en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure
to him the quiet Possession of so inestimable a
Blessing. As much as we value our own Happiness
and Welfare, as much must we value the Practice of
Justice and Humanity, by which alone the social
Confederacy can be maintain'd, and every Man reap
the Fruits of mutual Protection and Assistance.</p>

THIS Deduction of Morals from Self-love or a
Regard to private Interest, is a very obvious Thought,
and has not arisen altogether from the wanton Sallies
and sportive Assaults of the Sceptics. To mention
no others, <hi>Polybius,</hi> one of the gravest, and most
judicious, as well as most moral Writers of Antiquity,
has assign'd this selfish Origin to all our Sentiments of
Virtue.<note place="bottom" n="*">Undutifulness to Parents, is disapprov'd of by Mankind, <gap rend="content:〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉">

his Authority on the present Subject very consider<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able;
yet this is not an Affair to be decided by Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thority;
and the Voice of Nature and Experience
seems plainly to oppose the selfish Theory.</p>
               <p>WE frequently bestow Praises on virtuous Actions,
perform'd in very distant Ages and remote Countries;
where the utmost Subtilty of Imagination would not
discover any Appearance of Self-interest, or find any
<pb n="79" facs="82"/>
Connexion of our present Happiness and Security
with Events so widely separated from us.</p>
               <p>A generous, a brave, a noble Deed, perform'd by
an Adversary, commands our Approbation; while
in its Consequences it may be acknowledged preju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dicial
to our particular Interests.</p>
               <p>WHERE private Advantage concurs with general
Affection for Virtue, we readily perceive and avow
the Mixture of these distinct Sentiments, which have
a very different Feeling and Influence on the Mind.
We praise, perhaps, with more Alacrity, where the
generous, humane Action contributes to our particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lar
Interest: But the Topics of Praise we insist on
are very wide of this Circumstance. And we may
attempt to bring over others to our Sentiments, with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out
endeavouring to convince them, that they reap
any Advantage from the Actions, which we recom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mend
to their Approbation and Applause.</p>
               <p>FRAME the Model of a praise-worthy Character,
consisting of all the most amiable moral Virtues:
Give Instances, in which these display themselves,
after an eminent and extraordinary Manner: You
readily engage the Esteem and Approbation of all
your Audience, who never so much as enquir'd in
what Age and Country the Person liv'd, who possest

these noble Qualities: A Circumstance, however,
of all others, the most material to Self-love, or a
Concern for our own individual Happiness.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>WHAT is that to me?</hi> There are few Occasions,
when this Question is not pertinent: And had it that

'Tis but a weak Subterfuge, when press'd by these
Facts and Arguments, to say, that we transport our<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves,
by the Force of Imagination, into distant
Ages and Countries, and consider the Advantage,
which we should have reapt from these Characters,
had we been Contemporaries, and had any Commerce
with the Persons. 'Tis not conceivable, how a <hi>real</hi>
Sentiment or Passion can ever arise from a known
<hi>imaginary</hi> Interest; especially when our <hi>real</hi> Interest
is still kept in View, and is often acknowledg'd to
be entirely distinct from the imaginary, and even
sometimes opposite to it.</p>
               <p>A Man, brought to the Brink of a Precipice,
cannot look down without trembling; and the Sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timent
of <hi>imaginary</hi> Danger actuates him, in Oppo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sition
to the Opinion and Belief of <hi>real</hi> Safety. But
the Imagination is here assisted by the Presence of a
striking Object; and yet prevails not, except it be
also aided by Novelty, and the unusual Appearance
of the Object. Custom soon reconciles us to Heights
and Precipices, and wears off these false and delusive
Terrors. The Reverse is observable in the Estimates
we form of Characters and Manners; and the more
we habituate ourselves to an accurate Scrutiny of
the moral Species, the more delicate Feeling do we
acquire of the most minute Distinctions betwixt Vice
<pb n="82" facs="85"/>
and Virtue. Such frequent Occasion, indeed, have
we, in common Life, to pronounce all Kinds of
moral Determinations, that no Object of this Kind
can be new or unusual to us; nor could any <hi>false</hi>
Views or Prepossessions maintain their Ground against
an Experience, so common and familiar. Experi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence
and Custom being chiefly what form the As<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sociations

               <p>BUT notwithstanding this frequent Confusion of
Interests, 'tis easy to attain what natural Philoso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phers,
after my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> have affected to call
<pb n="84" facs="87"/>
the <hi>Experimentum crucis,</hi> or that Experiment, which
points out the Way we should follow, in any Doubt
or Ambiguity. We have found Instances, wherein
private Interest was separate from public; wherein
it was even contrary: And yet we observ'd the
moral Sentiment to continue, notwithstanding this
Disjunction of Interests. And wherever these distinct
Interests sensibly concur'd, we always found a sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sible
Encrease of the Sentiment, and a more warm
Affection to Virtue, and Detestation of Vice, or what
we properly call, <hi>Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Revenge.</hi> Compell'd
by these Instances, we must renounce the Theory,
which accounts for every moral Sentiment by the
Principle of Self-love. We must adopt a more pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lic
Affection, and allow, that the Interests of Society
are not, even on their own Account, altogether indif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent
to us. Usefulness is only a Tendency to a cer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain
End; and 'tis a Contradiction in Terms, that any
Thing pleases as Means to an End, where the End
itself does no way affect us. If therefore Usefulness
be a Source of moral Sentiment, and if this Useful<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
be not always consider'd with a Reference to
Self; it follows, that every Thing, which contri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>butes
to the Happiness of Society, recommends it<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self
directly to our Approbation and Good-will.
Here is a Principle, which accounts, in great Part,
for the Origin of Morality: And what need we seek
<pb n="85" facs="88"/>
for abstruse and remote Systems, when there occurs
one so obvious and natural<note place="bottom" n="*">'Tis needless to push our Researches so far as to ask, why we have Humanity or a Fellow-feeling with others. 'Tis suffi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cient, that this is experienc'd to be a Principle in human Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture. We must stop somewhere in our Examination of Causes; and there are, in every Science, some general Principles, beyond which we cannot hope to find any Principle more general. No Man is absolutely indifferent to the Happiness and Misery of others. The first has a natural Tendency to give Pleasure; the second, Pain. This every one may find in himself. It is not probable, that these Principles can be resolv'd into Principles more simple and universal, whatever Attempts may have been made to that Purpose. But if it were possible, it belongs not to the present Subject; and we may here safely consider these Principles as original: Happy, if we can render all the Consequences suffi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciently plain and perspicuous.</note>?</p>
               <p>HAVE we any Difficulty to comprehend the Force
of Humanity and Benevolence? Or to conceive,
that the very Aspect of Happiness, Joy, Prosperity,
gives Pleasure; that of Pain, Sufferance, Sorrow,
communicates Uneasiness? The human Countenance,
says <hi>Horace</hi>
                  <note place="bottom" n="†">
                     <l>Uti ridentibus arrident, ita flentibus adflent</l>
                     <l>Humani vultus. HOR.</l>
                  </note>, borrows Smiles or Tears from the
human Countenance. Reduce a Person to Solitude,
and he loses all Enjoyment, except merely of the
speculative Kind; and that because the Movements
of his Heart are not forwarded by correspondent
<pb n="86" facs="89"/>
Movements in his Fellow-creatures. The Signs of
Sorrow and Mourning, tho' arbitrary, affect us with
Melancholy; but the natural Symptoms, Tears,
and Cries, and Groans, never fail to infuse Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>passion
and Uneasiness. And if the Effects of Misery
touch us in so lively a Manner; can we be suppos'd
altogether insensible or indifferent towards its Causes;
when a malicious or treacherous Character and Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haviour
is presented to us?</p>
               <p>WE enter, I shall suppose, into a convenient,
warm, well-contriv'd Apartment: We necessarily
receive a Pleasure from its very Survey; because it
presents us with the pleasing Ideas of Ease, Satis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>faction,
and Enjoyment. The hospitable, good<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>humour'd,
humane Landlord appears. This Cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stance
surely must embellish the whole; nor can we
easily forbear reflecting, with Pleasure, on the Satis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>faction
and Enjoyment, which results to every one
from his Intercourse and Good-offices.</p>
               <p>HIS whole Family, by the Freedom, Ease,
Confidence, and calm Satisfaction, diffus'd over
their Countenances, sufficiently express their Hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piness.
I have a pleasing Sympathy in the Prospect
of so much Joy, and can never consider the Source
of it, without the most agreeable Emotions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="90"/>
HE tells me, that an oppressive and powerful
Neighbour had attempted to dispossess him of his
Inheritance, and had long disturb'd all his innocent
and social Enjoyments. I feel an immediate Indig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nation
arise in me against such Violence and Injury.</p>
               <p>BUT 'tis no Wonder, he adds, that a private
Wrong should proceed from a Man, who had en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>slav'd
Provinces, depopulated Cities, and made the
Field and Scaffold stream with human Blood. I am
struck with Horror at the Prospect of so much
Misery and am actuated by the strongest Antipathy
against its Author.</p>
               <p>IN general, 'tis certain, that wherever we go,
whatever we reflect on or converse about; every
Thing still presents us with the View of human Hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piness
or Misery, and excites in our Breasts a sym<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pathetic
Movement of Pleasure or Uneasiness. In
our serious Occupations, in our careless Amusements,
this Principle still exerts its active Energy.</p>
               <p>A MAN, who enters the Theatre, is immediately
struck with the View of so great a Multitude, par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticipating
of one common Amusement; and expe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riences,
from their very Aspect, a superior Sensibi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lity
<pb n="88" facs="91"/>
or Disposition of being affected with every Sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timent,
which he shares with his Fellow-creatures.</p>
               <p>HE observes the Actors to be animated by the
Appearance of a full Audience; and rais'd to a
Degree of Enthusiasm, which they cannot command
in any solitary or calm Moment.</p>
               <p>EVERY Movement of the Theatre, by a skillful
Poet, is communicated, as it were by Magic, to the
Spectators, who weep, tremble, resent, rejoice, and
are enflam'd with all the Variety of Passions, which
actuate the several Personages of the Drama.</p>
               <p>WHERE any Event crosses our Wishes, and inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rupts
the Happiness of the favourite Personages, we
feel a sensible Anxiety and Concern. But where
their Sufferings proceed from the Treachery, Cruelty
or Tyranny of an Enemy, our Breasts are affected
with the liveliest Resentment against the Author of
these Calamities.</p>
               <p>'TIS here esteem'd contrary to the Rules of Art
to represent any Thing cool and indifferent. A
distant Friend, or a Confident, who has no immedi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ate
Interest in the Catastrophe, ought, if possible, to
be avoided by the Poet; as communicating a like
<pb n="89" facs="92"/>
Indifference to the Audience, and checking the
Progress of the Passions.</p>
               <p>No Species of Poetry is more entertaining than
<hi>Pastoral;</hi> and every one is sensible, that the chief
Source of its Pleasure arises from those Images of a
gentle and tender Tranquillity, which it represents
in its Personages, and of which it communicates a
like Sentiment to the Readers. <hi>Sannazarius,</hi> who
transfer'd the Scene to the Sea-shore, tho' he pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sented
the most magnificent Object in Nature, is
confest to have err'd in his Choice. The Idea of
Toil, Labour, and Danger, suffer'd by the Fisher<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>men,
is painful, by an unavoidable Sympathy, which
attends every Conception of human Happiness or
Misery.</p>
               <p>WHEN I was twenty, says a <hi>French</hi> Poet, <hi>Ovid</hi>
was my Choice: Now I am forty, I declare for
<hi>Horace.</hi> We enter, to be sure, more readily into
Sentiments, that resemble those we feel every Mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment:
But no Passion, when well represented, can
be altogether indifferent to us; because there is
none, of which every Man has not within him, at
least, the Seeds and first Principles. 'Tis the Busi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
of Poetry to approach every Object by lively
Imagery and Description, and make it look like
Truth and Reality: A certain Proof, that wherever
<pb n="90" facs="93"/>
that Reality is found, our Minds are dispos'd to be
strongly affected by it.</p>
               <p>ANY recent Event or Piece of News, by which
the Fortunes of States, Provinces or many Indivi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duals,
are affected, is extremely interesting even to
those whose Welfare is not immediately engag'd.
Such Intelligence is propagated with Celerity, heard
with Avidity, and enquir'd into with Attention and
Concern. The Interests of Society appear, on this
Occasion, to be, in some Degree, the Interests of
each Individual. The Imagination is sure to be af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fected;
tho' the Passions excited may not always be
so strong and steady as to have great Influence on the
Conduct and Behaviour.</p>
               <p>THE Perusal of a History seems a calm Entertain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment;
but would be no Entertainment at all, did
not our Hearts beat with correspondent Movements
to those described by the Historian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Guicciardin</hi> support with Difficulty
our Attention, while the former describes the trivial
Rencounters of the small Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> and the
latter the harmless Wars of <hi>Pisa.</hi> The few Persons
interested, and the small Interest fill not the Imagi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nation,
and engage not the Affections. The deep

and Anxiety.</p>
               <p>THE indifferent, uninteresting Stile of <hi>Suetonius,</hi>
equally with the masterly Pencil of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> may
convince us of the cruel Depravity of <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Ti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berius:</hi>
But what a Difference of Sentiment! While
the former coldly relates the Facts; and the latter
sets before our Eyes the venerable Figures of a
<hi>Soranus</hi> and a <hi>Thrasea,</hi> intrepid in their Fate, and
only mov'd by the melting Sorrows of their Friends
and Kindred. What Sympathy then touches every
human Heart! What Indignation against the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>human
Tyrant, whose causeless Fear or unprovok'd
Malice, gave rise to such detestable Barbarity!</p>
               <p>IF we bring these Subjects nearer: If we remove
all Suspicion of Fiction and Deceit: What powerful
Concern is excited, and how much superior, in
many Instances, to the narrow Attachments of Self-love
and private Interest! Popular Sedition, Party
Zeal, a devoted Obedience to factious Leaders;
these are some of the most visible, tho' less laudable
Effects of this social Sympathy in human Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="95"/>
THE Frivolousness of the Subject too, we may
observe, is not able to detach us entirely from what
carries an Image of human Sentiment and Affection.</p>
               <p>WHEN a Person stutters, and pronounces with
Difficulty, we even sympathize with this trivial Un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>easiness,
and suffer for him. And 'tis a Rule in
Criticism, that every Combination of Syllables or
Letters, which gives Pain to the Organs of Speech
in the Recital, appears also, from a Species of Sym<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pathy,
harsh and disagreeable to the Ear. Nay,
when we run over a Book with our Eye, we are
sensible of such unharmonious Composition; be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause
we still imagine, that a Person recites it to us,
and suffers from the Pronunciation of these jarring
Sounds. So delicate is our Sympathy!</p>
               <p>EASY and unconstrain'd Postures and Motions
are always beautiful: An Air of Health and Vigour
is agreeable: Cloaths, that warm, without burthen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing

Limbs, are well-fashion'd. In every Judgment of
Beauty, the Sentiments are Feelings of the Persons

What Wonder, then, if we can pronounce
no Sentence concerning the Characters and Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duct
of Men without considering the Tendencies of
their Actions, and the Happiness or Misery, which
thence arises to Society? What Association of
Ideas would ever operate, were that Principle here

When the Interests of one Country interfere with those of another, we estimate the Merits of a Statesman by the Good or Ill, which re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sults to his own country from his Measures and Councils, without Regard to the Prejudice he brings on its Enemies and Rivals. His Fellow-citizens are the Objects, which lie nearest the Eye, while we determine his Character. And as Nature has implanted in every one a superior Affection to his own Country, we never ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pect any Regard to distant nations, where the smallest Competition arises. Not to mention, that while every man consults the Good of his own Community, we are sensible, that the general Interest of Mankind is better promoted, than by any loose indeterminate Views to the Good of a Species, whence no beneficial Action could ever result, for want of a duly limited Object, on which they could exert themselves.</note>?</p>

IF any Man, from a cold Insensibility, or narrow
Selfishness of Temper, is unaffected with the Images
of human Happiness or Misery, he must be equally
indifferent to the Images of Vice and Virtue: As
on the other Hand, 'tis always found, that a warm
Concern for the Interests of our Species is attended
with a delicate Feeling of all moral Distinctions; a
strong Resentment of Injury done to Men; a lively
Approbation of their Welfare. In this Particular,
tho' great Superiority is observable of one Man
above another; yet none are so entirely indifferent
to the Interest of their Fellow-creatures, as to per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceive
no Distinctions of moral Good and Evil, in
consequence of the different Tendencies of Actions
and Principles. How, indeed, can we suppose it
possible of any one, who wears a human Heart,
that, if there be subjected to his Censure, one Cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racter
or System of Conduct, which is beneficial,
and another, which is pernicious, to his Species or
Community, he will not so much as give a cool
Preference to the former, or ascribe to it the smallest
Merit or Regard? Let us suppose such a Person
ever so selfish; let private Interest have ingrost ever
so much his Attention; yet in Instances, where
that is not concern'd, he must unavoidably feel <hi>some</hi>
Propensity to the Good of Mankind, and make it
an Object of Choice, if every Thing else be equal.

Would any Man, that is walking alone, tread just
as willingly on another's gouty Toes, whom he has
no Quarrel with, as on the hard Flint and Pave<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment?
There is here surely a Difference in the
Case. We surely take into Consideration the Hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piness
and Misery of others, in weighing the several
Motives of Action, and incline to the former, where
no private Regards draw us to seek our own Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>motion
or Advantage by the Injury of our Fellow-Creatures.
And if the Principles of Humanity are
capable, in many Instances, of influencing our
Actions, they must, at all Times, have <hi>some</hi> Autho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity
over our Sentiments, and give us a general Ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>probation
of what is useful to Society, and Blame
of what is dangerous or pernicious. The Degrees
of these Sentiments may be the Subject of Contro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versy,
but the Reality of their Existence, one should
think, must be admitted, in every Theory or System.</p>
               <p>A CREATURE, absolutely malicious and spiteful,
were there any such in Nature, must be worse than
indifferent to the Images of Vice and Virtue. All
his Sentiments must be inverted, and directly oppo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>site
to those, which prevail in the human Species.
Whatever contributes to the Good of Mankind, as
it crosses the constant Bent of his Wishes and De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sires,
must produce Uneasiness and Disapprobation;
and on the contrary, whatever is the Source of Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>order
<pb n="96" facs="99"/>
order and Misery in Society, must, for the same
Reason, be regarded with Pleasure and Complacency.

an infallible Consequence, that their Sentiments of
human Actions, as well as of every Thing else, must
be totally opposite; and that every Instance of
Justice and Humanity, from its necessary Tendency,
must please the one Deity, and displease the other.
All Mankind so far resemble the good Principle,
that where Interest or Revenge or Envy perverts not
our Disposition, we are always enclin'd, from our
natural Philanthropy, to give the Preference to the
Happiness of Society, and consequently to Virtue,
above its opposite. Absolute, unprovok'd, disinter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ested

We may own the Merit to be equally great,

Height, in both Cases. The Judgment here cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rects
the Inequalities of our internal Emotions and
Perceptions; in like Manner, as it preserves us from
Error, in the several Variations of Images, presented
to our external Senses. The same Object, at a
double Distance, really throws on the Eye a Picture
of but half the Bulk; and yet we imagine it ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pears
of the same Size in both Situations; because
we know, that, on our Approach to it, its Image
would expand on the Senses, and that the Difference
consists not in the Object itself, but in our Position
with regard to it. And, indeed, without such Cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rection
of Appearances, both in internal and exter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nal
Sentiment, Men could never think or talk
steadily on any Subject; while their fluctuating Si<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tuations
produce a continual Variation on Objects,

and throw them into such different and contrary
Lights and Positions<note place="bottom" n="*">
                     <p>For a like Reason, the Tendencies of Actions and Cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racters, not their real accidental Consequences, are alone re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>garded in our moral Determinations or general Judgments; tho' in our real Feeling or Sentiment, we cannot help paying greater Regard to one whose Station, join'd to Virtue, renders him really useful to Society, than to one, who exerts the social Vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tues only in good Intentions and benevolent Affections. Separat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the Character from the Fortune, by an easy and necessary Effert of Thought, we pronounce these Persons alike, and give them the same general Praise.

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>THE more we converse with Mankind, and the
greater social Entercourse we maintain, the more
will we be familiariz'd to these general Preferences
and Distinctions, without which our Conversation
and Discourse could scarcely be render'd intelligible
to each other. Every Man's Interest is peculiar to
himself, and the Aversions and Desires, which re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sult
from it, cannot be suppos'd to affect others in a
<pb n="99" facs="102"/>
like Degree. General Language, therefore, being
form'd for general Use, must be moulded on some
more general Views, and must affix the Epithets of
Praise or Blame, in Conformity to Sentiments,
which arise from the general Interests of the Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>munity.
And if these Sentiments, in most Men,
be not so strong as those, which have a Reference
to private Good; yet still they must make some
Distinction, even in Persons the most deprav'd and
selfish; and must attach the Notion of Good to a
beneficent Conduct, and of Evil to the contrary.
Sympathy, we shall allow, is much fainter than our
Concern for Ourselves, and Sympathy with Persons,
remote from us, much sainter than that with Persons,
near and contiguous; but for this very Reason,
'tis necessary for us, in our calm Judgments and
Discourse concerning the Characters of Men, to
neglect all these Differences, and render our Senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments
more public and social. Besides, that we
Ourselves often change our Situation in this Parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cular,
we every Day meet with Persons, who are in a
different Situation from us, and who could never con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verse
with us on any reasonable Terms, were we to
remain constantly in that Position and Point of View,
which is peculiar to Ourself. The Entercourse of
Sentiments, therefore, in Society and Conversation
makes us form some general, inalterable Standard,
by which we may approve or disapprove of Cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racters
<pb n="100" facs="103"/>
and Manners. And tho' the Heart takes not

Differences of Vice and Virtue, without re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard

               <p>THUS, in whatever Light we take this Subject,
the Merit, ascrib'd to the social Virtues, appears
still uniform, and arises chiefly from that Regard,
which the natural Sentiment of Benevolence engages
us to pay to the Interests of Mankind and Society.
If we consider the Principles of the human Make;
such as they appear to daily Experience and Obser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vation
<pb n="101" facs="104"/>
we must, <hi>a priori,</hi> conclude it impossible for
such a Creature as Man to be totally indifferent to
the Well or Ill-being of his Fellow-creatures, and
not readily, of himself, to pronounce, where no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing
gives him any particular Byass, that what pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>motes
their Happiness is good, what tends to their
Misery is evil, without any farther Regard or Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sideration.
Here then are the faint Rudiments, at
least, or Outlines, of a <hi>general</hi> Distinction betwixt
Actions; and in Proportion as the Humanity of the
Person is suppos'd to encrease, his Connexion to
those injur'd or benefited, and his lively Conception
of their Misery or Happiness; his consequent Cen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure
or Approbation acquires proportionable Force
and Vigour. There is no Necessity, that a generous
Action, barely mention'd in an old History or remote
Gazette, should communicate any strong Feelings of
Applause and Admiration. Virtue, plac'd at such a
Distance, is like a fixt Star, which, tho', to the Eye
of Reason, it may appear as luminous as the Sun in
his Meridian, is so infinitely remov'd, as to affect
the Senses, neither with Light nor Heat. Bring this
Virtue nearer, by our Acquaintance or Connexion
with the Persons, or even by an eloquent Narration
and Recital of the Case; our Hearts are immediately
caught, our Sympathy enliven'd, and our cool Ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>probation
converted into the warmest Sentiments of
Friendship and Regard. These seem necessary and
<pb n="102" facs="105"/>
infallible Consequences of the general Principles of
human Nature, as discover'd in common Life and
Practice.</p>
               <p>AGAIN; reverse these Views and Reasonings:
Consider the Matter <hi>a posteriori;</hi> and weighing the
Consequences, enquire, if the Merit of all social
Virtue is not deriv'd from the Feelings of Humanity,
with which it affects the Spectators. It appears to be
Matter of Fact, that the Circumstance of <hi>Utility,</hi>
in all Subjects, is a Source of Praise and Approba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion:
That it is constantly appeal'd to in all moral
Decisions concerning the Merit and Demerit of
Actions: That it is the <hi>sole</hi> Source of that high Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard
paid to Justice, Fidelity, Honour, Allegiance
and Chastity: That it is inseperable from all the
other social Virtues of Humanity, Generosity, Cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity,
Affability, Lenity, Mercy and Moderation:
And in a Word, that it is the Foundation of the
chief Part of Morals, which has a Reference to
Mankind and Society.</p>
               <p>IT appears also, in our general Approbation or
Judgment of Characters and Manners, that the use<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful
Tendency of the social Virtues moves us not by
any Regards to Self-interest, but has an Influence
much more universal and extensive. It appears,
that a Tendency to public Good, and to the pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>moting
<pb n="103" facs="106"/>
of Peace, Harmony, and Concord in So<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciety,
by affecting the benevolent Principles of our
Frame, engages us on the Side of the social Virtues.
And it appears, as an additional Confirmation, that
these Principles of Humanity and Sympathy enter
so deep into all our Sentiments, and have so power<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful
an Influence, as may enable them to excite the
strongest Censure and Applause. The present
Theory is the simple Result of all these Inferences,
each of which seems founded on uniform Experience
and Observation.</p>
               <p>WERE it doubtful, whether there was any such
Principle in our Nature as Humanity or a Concern
for others, yet when we see, in numberless Instances,
that, whatever has a Tendency to promote the In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terests
of Society, is so highly approv'd of, we ought
thence to learn the Force of the benevolent Principle;
since 'tis impossible for any Thing to please as Means
to an End, where the End itself is totally indifferent:
On the other Hand, were it doubtful, whether there
was, implanted in our Natures, any general Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciple
of moral Blame and Approbation, yet when
we see, in numberless Instances, the Influence of
Humanity, we ought thence to conclude, that 'tis
impossible, but that every Thing, which promotes
the Interests of Society, must communicate Pleasure,
and what is pernicious give Uneasiness. But when
<pb n="104" facs="107"/>
these different Reflections and Observations concur
in establishing the same Conclusion, must they not
bestow an undisputed Evidence upon it?</p>
               <p>'Tis however hop'd, that the Progress of this Ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gument
will bring a farther Confirmation of the pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent
Theory, by showing the Rise of other Senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments
of Esteem and Regard from the same or like
Principles.</p>

               <p>NOTHING is more usual, than for Philoso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phers
to encroach upon the Province of Gram<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>marians;
and to engage in Disputes of Words, while
they imagine, that they are handling Controversies
of the deepest Importance and Concern. Thus,
were we here to assert or to deny, <hi>that all laudable
Qualities of the Mind were to be consider'd as Virtues or
moral Attributes,</hi> many would imagine, that we had
enter'd upon one of the profoundest Speculations of
Ethics; tho' 'tis probable, all the while, that the
greatest Part of the Dispute would be found entirely
verbal. To avoid, therefore, all frivolous Subtilties
and Altercations, as much as possible, we shall con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tent
Ourselves with observing, <hi>first,</hi> that, in common
Life, the Sentiments of Censure or Approbation,
produc'd by mental Qualities of every Kind, are
<pb n="106" facs="109"/>
very similar; and <hi>secondly,</hi> that all antient Moralists,
(the best Models) in treating of them, make little or
no Difference amongst them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST.</hi> It seems certain, that the <hi>Sentiment</hi>
of conscious Worth, the Self-satisfaction, proceeding
from a Review of a Man's own Conduct and Cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racter;
it seems certain, I say, that this Sentiment,
which, tho' the most common of all others, has no
proper Name in our Language<note place="bottom" n="*">The Term, Pride, is commenly taken in a bad Sense; but this Sentiment seems indifferent, and may be either good or bad, according as it is well or ill founded, and according to the other Circumstances, that accompany it. The <hi>French</hi> express this Sentiment by the Term, <hi>amour propre,</hi> but as they also ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>press Self-love as well as Vanity, by the same Term, there arises thence a great Confusion in <hi>Rocbefoucault,</hi> and many of their moral Writers,</note> arises from the
Endowments of Courage and Capacity, Industry and
Ingenuity, as well as from any other mental Excel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lencies.
Who, on the other Hand, is not deeply
mortify'd with reflecting on his own Folly or Disso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>luteness,
and feels not a secret Sting or Compunction,
whenever his Memory presents any past Occurence,
where he behav'd with Stupidity or Ill-manners?
No Time can efface the cruel Ideas of a Man's own
Ill-conduct, or of Affronts, which Cowardice or
Impudence have brought upon him. They still
<pb n="107" facs="110"/>
haunt his solitary Hours, damp his most aspiring
Thoughts, and show him, even to himself, in the
most contemptible and most odious Colours imagin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able.</p>
               <p>WHAT is there too we are more anxious to conceal
from others than such Blunders, Infirmities, and
Meannesses, or more dread to have expos'd by Rail<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lery
and Satyre? And is not the chief Object of
Vanity, our Bravery or Learning, our Wit or Breed<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing,
our Eloquence or Address, our Taste or Ability?
These we display with Care, if not with Ostentation;
and commonly show more Ambition of excelling in
them, than even in the social Virtues themselves,
which are, in Reality, of such superior Excellence.
Good-nature and Honesty, especially the latter, are
so indispensibly requir'd, that, tho' the greatest Cen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure
attends any Violation of these Duties, no emi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nent
Praise follows such common Instances of them,
as seem essential to the Support of human Society.
And hence the Reason, in my Opinion, why, tho'
Men often praise so liberally the Qualities of their
Heart, they are shy of commending the Endowments
of their Head; because the latter Virtues, being sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pos'd
more rare and extraordinary, are observ'd to be
the more usual Objects of Pride and Self-conceit;
and when boasted of, beget a strong Suspicion of these
Sentiments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="111"/>
'Tis hard to tell, whether you hurt a Man's Cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racter
most by calling him a Knave or a Coward, and
whether a beasily Glutton or Drunkard be not as
odious and contemptible as a selfish, ungenerous
Miser. Give me my Choice; and I would rather,
for my own Happiness and Self-enjoyment, have a
friendly, humane Heart than possess all the other
Virtues of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> united: But I would
rather pass with the World for one endow'd with ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tensive
Genius and intrepid Courage, and should
thence expect stronger Instances of general Applause
and Admiration. The Figure a Man makes in Life,
the Reception he meets with in Company, the Esteem
paid him by his Acquaintance; all these Advantages
depend as much upon his good Sense and Judgment
as upon any other Part of his Character. Had a
Man the best Intentions in the World, and were the
farthest remov'd from all Injustice and Violence, he
would never be able to make himself be much re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>garded,
without a moderate Share, at least, of Parts
and Understanding.</p>
               <p>WHAT is it then we can here dispute about? If
Sense and Courage, Temperance and Industry,
Wit and Knowledge confessedly form a considerable
Part of <hi>personal Merit;</hi> if a Man possest of them is
both better satisfy'd with himself, and better entitled
<pb n="109" facs="112"/>
to the Good-will, Esteem, and Services of others,
than one entirely devoid of them; if, in short, the
<hi>Sentiments</hi> be similar, that arise from these Endow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments
and from the social Virtues; is there any Rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son
for being so extremely scrupulous about a <hi>Word,</hi>
or doubting whether they are entitled to the Deno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mination
of Virtue<note place="bottom" n="*">It seems to me, that in our Language, Courage, Tempe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rance, Industry, Frugality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to popular Stile, are call'd <hi>Virtues;</hi> but when a Man is said to be <hi>virtuous,</hi> or is deno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>minated a Man of Virtue, we chiefly regard his social Qualities. 'Tis needless for a moral, philosophical Discourse to enter into all these Caprices of Language, which are so variable in different Dialects, and in different Ages of the same Dialect. The <hi>Sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timents</hi> of Men, being more uniform, as well as more important, are a fitter Subject of Speculation: Tho' at the same Time, we may just observe, that wherever the social Virtues are talk'd of, 'tis plainly imploy'd, by this Distinction, that there are also other Virtues of a different Nature.</note>? It may, indeed, be pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tended, that the Sentiment of Approbation, which
those Accomplishments produce, besides its being <hi>in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferior,</hi>
is also somewhat <hi>different</hi> from that, which
attends the Virtues of Justice and Humanity. But
this seems not a sufficient Reason for ranking them
entirely under different Classes and Appellations.
The Character of <hi>Caesar</hi> and that of <hi>Cato,</hi> as drawn
by <hi>Salust,</hi> are both of them virtuous, in the strictest
Sense of the Word; but in a different Way: Nor
are the Sentiments entirely the same, which arise
from them. The one produces Love; the other,
<pb n="110" facs="113"/>
Esteem: The one is amiable; the other awful: We
could wish to meet the one Character in a Friend;
the other we should be ambitious of in Ourselves.
In like Manner the Approbation, which attends na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tural
Abilities or Temperance or Industry, may be
somewhat different from that which is paid to the
social Virtues, without making them entirely of a
different Species. And indeed, we may observe,
that the natural Abilities, no more than the other
Virtues, produce not, all of them, the same Kind of
Approbation. Good Sense and Genius beget Esteem
and Regard: Wit and Humour excite Love and Af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fection<note place="bottom" n="*">Love and Esteem are nearly the same Passion, and arise from similar Causes. The Qualities, which produce both, are such as communicate Pleasure. But where this Pleasure is severe and serious; or where its Object is great and makes a strong Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pression, or where it produces any Degree of Humility and Awe: In all these Cases, the Passion, which arises from the Pleasure, is more properly denominated Esteem than Love. Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nevolence attends both: But is connected with Love in a more eminent Degree. There seems to be still a stronger Mixture of Pride in Contempt than of Humility in Esteem; and the Reason would not be difficult to one, who study'd accurately the Passions. All these various Mixtures and Compositions and Appearances of Sentiment form a very curious Subject of Speculation, but are wide of our present Purpose. Thro'out these Essays, we always consider in general, what Qualities are a Subject of Praise or of Censure, without entering into all the minute Differences of Sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timent, which they excite. 'Tis evident, that whatever is con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>temn'd, is also dislik'd, as well as what is hated; and we here endeavour to take Objects, according to their most simple Views and Appearances. These Sciences are but too apt to appear ab<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stract to common Readers, even with all the Precautions we can take to clear them from superfluous Speculations, and bring them down to every Capacity.</note>.</p>

be allow'd, that <hi>Sentiments</hi> are every Day experienc'd
of Blame and Praise, which have Objects beyond
the Dominion of the Will or Choice, and of which
it behoves us, if not as Moralists, as speculative
Philosophers at least, to give some satisfactory Theory
and Explication.</p>
               <p>A BLEMISH, a Fault, a Vice, a Crime; these
Expressions seem to denote different Degrees of Cen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure
and Disapprobation; which are, however, all
of them, at the Bottom, pretty nearly the same Kind
of Species. The Explication of one will lead us
easily into a just Conception of the others.</p>

               <p>IT seems evident, that where a Quality or Habit
is subjected to our Examination, if it appear, in
any respect, prejudicial to the Person, possest of it,
or such as incapacitates him for Business and Action,
it is instantly blam'd, and rank'd amongst his Faults
and Imperfections. Indolence, Negligence, Want
of Order and Method, Obstinacy, Fickleness, Rash<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness,
Credulity; no one ever esteem'd these Qua<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lities,
indifferent to a Character; much less, extoll'd
them as Accomplishments or Virtues. The Preju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dice,
resulting from them, immediately strikes our
<pb n="118" facs="121"/>
Eye, and gives us the Sentiment of Pain and Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>approbation.</p>
               <p>No Qualiity, 'tis allow'd, is absolutely either
blameable or praise-worthy. 'Tis all according to
its Degrees. A due Medium, say the <hi>Peripatetics,</hi>
is the Characteristic of Virtue. But this Medium is
chiefly determin'd by Utility. A proper Celerity,
for Instance, and Dispatch in Business is commend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able.
When defective, no Progress is ever made in
the Execution of any Purpose: When excessive, it
engages us in precipitate, and ill-concerted Measures
and Enterprizes. By such Reasonings as these we
fix the proper and commendable Mediocrity in all
moral and prudential Disquisitions; and never lose
View of the Advantages, which result from any
Character or Habit.</p>
               <p>Now as these Advantages are enjoy'd by the Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son,
possest of the Character, it can never be <hi>Self-love,</hi>
which renders the Prospect of them agreeable
to us, the Spectators, and prompts our Esteem and
Approbation. No Force of Imagination can con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vert
us into another Person, and make us fancy,
that we being that Person, reap Benefit from those
valuable Qualities, which belong to him. Or if it
did, no Celerity of Imagination could immediately
transport us back, into ourselves, and make us love
and esteem the Person, as different from us. Views
<pb n="119" facs="122"/>
and Sentiments, so opposite to known Truth, and to
each other, could never have place, at the same
Time, in the same Person. All Suspicion, therefore, of
selfish Regards are here totally excluded. 'Tis a quite
different Principle, which actuates our Bosom, and
interests us in the Felicity of the Person we contem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plate.
Where his natural Talents and acquir'd Abi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lities
give us the Prospect of Elevation, Advance<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,
a Figure in Life, prosperous Success, a steady
Command over Fortune, and the Execution of great
or advantageous Undertakings; we are struck with
such agreeable Images, and feel a Complacency and
Regard immediately arise towards him. The Ideas
of Happiness, Joy, Triumph, Prosperity are con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nected
with every Circumstance of his Character,
and diffuse over our Minds a pleasing Sentiment of
Sympathy and Humanity<note place="bottom" n="*">One may venture to affirm, that there is no human Creature, to whom the Appearance of Happiness, (where Envy or Revenge has no Place) does not give Pleasure, that of Misery, Uneasiness. This seems inseperable from our Make and Constitution. But they are only the more generous Minds, that are thence prompted to seek zealously the Good of others, and to have a real Passion for their Welfare. With Men of narrow and ungenerous Spirits, this Sym<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pathy goes not beyond a slight Feeling of the Imagination, which serves only to excite Sentiments of Complacency or Censure, and make them apply to the Object either honourable or dishonourable Appellations. A griping Miser, for Instance, praises extremely <hi>Industry</hi> and <hi>Frugality,</hi> even in others, and sets them, in his Esti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mation, above all the other Virtues. He knows the Good, that results from them, and feels that Species of Happiness with a more lively Sympathy, than any other you could represent to him; tho' perhaps he would not part with a Shilling to make the Fortune of the industrious Man, whom he praises so highly.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="123"/>
LET us suppose a Person originally so fram'd as
to have no Manner of Concern for his Fellow crea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tures,
but to regard the Happiness and Misery of
all sensible Beings with greater Indifference even
than two contiguous Shades of the same Colour.
Let us suppose, if the Prosperity of Nations were
lay'd on the one hand and their Ruin on the other,
and he were desir'd to choose; that he would stand,
like the Schoolman's Ass, irresolute and undeter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>min'd,
betwixt equal Motives; or rather, like the
same Ass betwixt two Pieces of Wood or Marble,
without any Inclination or Propensity on either Side.
The Consequence, I believe, must be allow'd just,
that such a Person, being absolutely unconcern'd,
either as to the public Good of a Community or the
private Utility of others, would look on every Qua<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lity,
however pernicious, or however beneficial, to
Society or to its Possessor, with the same Indifference
as on the most common and uninteresting Object.</p>
               <p>BUT if, instead of this fancy'd Monster, we sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose
a <hi>Man</hi> to form a Judgment or Determination in
<pb n="121" facs="124"/>
the Case; there is to him a plain Foundation of
Preference, where every Thing else is equal; and
however cool his Choice may be, if his Heart be
selfish, or if the Persons interested be remote from
him; there must still be a Choice, and a Distinction
betwixt what is useful, and what is pernicious. Now
this Distinction is the same in all its Parts, with the
<hi>moral Distinction,</hi> whose Foundation has been so os<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ten,
and so much in vain, enquir'd after. The same
Endowments of the Mind, in every Circumstance,
are agreeable to the Sentiment of Morals and to that
of Humanity; the same Temper is susceptible of
high Degrees of the one Sentiment and of the other;
and the same Alteration in the Objects, by their
nearer Approach or by Connexions, enlivens the one
and the other. By all the Rules of Philosophy,
therefore, we must conclude, that these Sentiments
are originally the same; since, in each particular,
even the most minute, they are govern'd by the same
Laws, and are mov'd by the same Objects.</p>
               <p>WHY do Philosophers infer, with the greatest
Certainty, that the Moon is kept in its Orbit by the
same Force of Gravity, which makes Bodies fall
near the Surface of the Earth, but because these
Effects are, upon Computation, found similar and
equal? And must not this Argument bring equal
Conviction, in moral as in natural Disquisitions?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="125"/>
To prove, by any long Detail, that all the Qua<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lities,
useful to the Possessor, are approv'd, and the
contrary censur'd, would be superfluous. The least
Reflection, on what is every Day experienc'd in Life,
will be sufficient. We shall only mention a few In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stances,
in order to remove, if possible, all Doubt
and Hesitation.</p>
               <p>THE Quality, the most necessary for the Execution
of any useful Enterprize, is DISCRETION;
by which we carry on a safe Intercourse with others,
give due Attention to our own and to their Character,
weigh each Circumstance of the Business we under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>take,
and employ the surest and safest Means for the
Attainment of any End or Purpose. To a <hi>Cromwell,</hi>
perhaps, or a <hi>De Retz,</hi> Discretion may appear an
Alderman-like Virtue, as Dr. <hi>Swift</hi> calls it; and
being incompatible with those vast Designs, to which
their Courage and Ambition prompted them, it
might really, in them, be a Fault or Imperfection.
But in the Conduct of ordinary Life, no Virtue is
more requisite, not only to obtain Success, but to
avoid the most fatal Miscarriages and Disappoint<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments.
The greatest Parts without it, as observ'd by
an elegant Writer, may be fatal to their Owner; as
<hi>Polyphemus</hi> depriv'd of his Eye was only the more ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pos'd,
<pb n="123" facs="126"/>
on Account of his enormous Strength and
Stature.</p>
               <p>THE best Character, indeed, were it not rather too
perfect for human Nature, is that which gives no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing
to Temper of any Kind; but alternately em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ploys
Enterprize and Caution, as each is <hi>useful</hi> to the
particular Purpose intended. Such is the Excellence,
which St. <hi>Evremond</hi> ascribes to Mareschal <hi>Turenne,</hi>
who display'd every Campaign, as he grew older,
more Temerity in his military Enterprizes; and be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
now, from long Experience, perfectly acquainted
with every Incident in War, he advanc'd with
greater Firmness and Boldness, in a Road so well
known to him. <hi>Fabius,</hi> says <hi>Machiavel,</hi> was cau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tious;
<hi>Scipio</hi> enterprizing: And both succeeded,
because the Situation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Affars, during
the Command of each, was peculiarly adapted to
his Genius; but both would have fail'd, had these
Situations been inverted. He is happy, whose Cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstances
suit his Temper; but he is more excellent,
who can suit his Temper to any Circumstances.</p>
               <p>WHAT need is there to display the Praises of
INDUSTRY, and to extol its Advantages, in
the Acquisition of Power and Riches, or in raising
what we call a <hi>Fortune</hi> in the World? The Tortoise,
according to the Fable, by his Assiduity, gain'd the
<pb n="124" facs="127"/>
Race of the Hare, tho' possest of much superior
Swiftness. A Man's Time, when well husbanded,
is like a cultivated Field, of which a few Acres pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duce
more of what is useful to Life, than extensive
Provinces, even of the richest Soil, when over-run
with Weeds and Brambles.</p>
               <p>BUT all Prospect of Success in Life, or even of
tolerable Subsistence, must fail, where a reasonable
FRUGALITY is wanting. The Heap, in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stead
of encreasing, diminishes daily, and leaves its
Possessor so much more unhappy, that not having
been able to confine his Expences to a larger Reve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nue,
he will still less be able to live contentedly on a
smaller. The Souls of Men, according to <hi>Plato</hi>
                  <note place="bottom" n="*">Phaedo.</note>,
inflam'd with impure Appetites, and losing the Body,
which alone afforded Means of Satisfaction, hover
about the Earth, and haunt the Places, where their
Bodies are reposited; possest with a longing Desire
to recover the lost Organs of Sensation So may we
see worthless Prodigals, having consum'd their For<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tunes
in wild Debauches, thrusting themselves into
every plentiful Table, and every Party of Pleasure,
hated even by the vicious, and despis'd even by
Fools.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="128"/>
THE one Extreme of Frugality is <hi>Avarice,</hi> which,
as it both deprives a Man of all Use of his Riches,
and checks Hospitality and every social Enjoyment,
is justly censur'd on a double Account: <hi>Prodigality,</hi>
the other Extreme, is commonly more hurtful to a
Man himself; and each of these Extremes is blam'd
above the other, according to the Temper of the
Person who censures, and according to his greater or
less Sensibility to Pleasure, either social or sensual.</p>
               <p>ALL Men, 'tis allow'd, are equally desirous of
Happiness; but all Men are not equally successful in
the Pursuit: Of which one chief Cause is the common
Want of STRENGTH of MIND, which
might enable us to resist the Temptation of present
Ease or Pleasure, and carry us forward in the Search
of more distant Profit and Enjoyment. Our Affec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions,
on a general Prospect of their Objects, form
certain Rules of Conduct, and certain Measures of
Preference of one above another: And these De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cisions,
tho' really the Result of our calm Passions,
and Propensities, (for what else can pronounce any
Object eligible or the contrary?) are yet said, by a
natural Abuse of Terms, to be the Determinations
of pure <hi>Reason</hi> and Reflection. But when some of
these Objects approach nearer us, or acquire the Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantages
of favourable Lights and Positions, which
<pb n="126" facs="129"/>
catch the Heart or Imagination; our general Reso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lutions
are frequently confounded, a small Enjoyment
preferr'd, and lasting Shame and Sorrow entail'd
upon us. And however Poets may employ their
Wit and Eloquence, in celebrating present Pleasure,
and rejecting all distant Views to Fame, Health, or
Fortune; 'tis obvious, that this Practice is the Source
of all Dissoluteness and Debauchery, Repentance
and Misery. A Man of a strong and determin'd
Temper adheres tenaciously to his general Resolu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions,
and is neither seduc'd by the Allurements of
Pleasure, nor terrify'd by the Menaces of Pain;
but keeps still in View those distant Pursuits, by which
he, at once, ensures his Happiness and his Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour.</p>
               <p>SELF-SATISFACTION, at least in some Degree, is
an Advantage, that equally attends the FOOL
and the WISE-MAN: But 'tis the only one;
nor is there any other Circumstance in the Conduct
of Life, where they are upon an equal Footing.
Business, Books, Conversation; for all of these, a
Fool is totally incapacitated, and except condemn'd
by his Station to the coarsest Drudgery, remains a
<hi>useless</hi> Burthen upon the Earth. Accordingly, 'tis
found, that Men are infinitely jealous of their Cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racter
in this Particular; and many Instances are
seen of Profligacy and Treachery, the most avow'd,
<pb n="127" facs="130"/>
and unreserved; none of bearing patiently the Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>putation
of Ignorance and Stupidity. <hi>Dicaearchus,</hi>
the <hi>Macedonian</hi> General, who, as <hi>Polybius</hi>
                  <note place="bottom" n="*">Lib. 17. Cap. 35.</note> tells us,
openly erected one Altar to Impiety, and another to
Injustice, in order to bid Defiance to Mankind;
even he, I am well assur'd, would have started at
the Epithet of <hi>Fool,</hi> and have meditated Revenge for
so injurious an Appellation. Except the Affection of
Parents, the strongest and most indissoluble Bond in
Nature, no Connexion has Strength sufficient to sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port
the Disgust arising from this Character. Love
itself, which can subsist under Treachery, Ingrati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tude,
Malice, and Infidelity, is immediately ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinguish'd
by it, when perceiv'd and acknowledg'd;
nor are Deformity and Old-age more fatal to the Do<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>minion
of that Passion. So dreadful are the Ideas
of an utter Incapacity for any Purpose or Under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>taking,
and of continu'd Error and Misconduct in
Life!</p>
               <p>WHEN 'tis ask'd, whether a quick or a slow Ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prehension
be most valuable? Whether one, that,
at first View, penetrates far into a Subject, but can
perform nothing upon Study; or a contrary Cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racter,
which must work out every Thing by Dint of
Application? Whether a clear Head or a copious
<pb n="128" facs="131"/>
Invention? Whether a profound Genius or a sure
Judgment? In short, what Character, or peculiar
Turn of Understanding is more excellent than
another? 'Tis evident, we can answer none of
these Questions, without considering which of those
Qualities capacitates a Man best for the World, and
carries him faithest in any of his Undertakings.</p>
               <p>IF refin'd Sense and exalted Sense be not so <hi>useful</hi>
as common Sense, their Rarity, their Novelty, and
the Nobleness of their Objects make some Compen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sation,
and render them the Admiration of Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kind:
As Gold, tho' less serviceable than Iron, ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quires,
from its Scarcity, a Value, which is much
superior.</p>
               <p>THE Desects of Judgment can be supply'd by no
Art or Invention; but those of MEMORY fre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently
may, both in Business and in Study, by
Method and Industry, and by Diligence in commit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ting
every Thing to Paper; and we scarce ever hear
a short Memory given as a Reason for a Man's Want
of Success in any Undertaking. But in antient
Times, when no Man could make a Figure without
the Talent of speaking, and when the Audience
were too delicate to bear such crude, undigested
Harangues as our extemporary Orators offer to pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lic
Assemblies; the Faculty of Memory was then of
<pb n="129" facs="132"/>
the utmost Consequence, and was accordingly much
more valued than at present. Scarce any great
Genius is mention'd in Antiquity, who is not cele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brated
for this Talent; and <hi>Cicero</hi> enumerates it
amongst the other sublime Qualities of <hi>Caesar</hi> him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self<note place="bottom" n="*">Fuit in illo ingenium, ratio, memoria, literae, cura, cogi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tatio, diligentia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Phillip. 2.</note>.</p>
               <p>PARTICULAR Customs and Manners alter the Use<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fulness
of Qualities: they also alter their Merit.
Particular Situations and Accidents have, in some
Degree, the same Influence. He will always be
more esteem'd, who professes those Talents and Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>complishments,
which suit his Station and Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fession,
than the whom Fortune has misplac'd in the
Part she has assign'd him. The private or selfish
Virtues are, in this respect, more arbitrary than the
public and social. In other respects, they are, per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps,
less liable to Doubt and Controversy.</p>
               <p>IN this Kingdom, such continu'd Ostentation, of
late Years, has been display'd among Men in <hi>active</hi>
Life, with regard to <hi>public Spirit,</hi> and among those
in <hi>speculative</hi> with regard to <hi>Benevolence;</hi> and so
many false Pretensions to each have been, no doubt,
detected, that Men of the World are apt, without
<pb n="130" facs="133"/>
any bad Intention, to discover a sullen Incredulity
on the head of these moral Endowments, and even
sometimes absolutely to deny their Existence and
Reality. In like Manner, I find, that, of old, the
perpetual Cant of the <hi>Stoics</hi> and <hi>Cynics</hi> concerning
<hi>Virtue,</hi> their magnificent Professions and slender Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formances,
bred a Disgust in Mankind; and <hi>Lucian,</hi>
who, tho' licentious on the Article of Pleasure, is
yet, in other respects, a very moral Writer, cannot,
sometimes, talk of Virtue, so much boasted, with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out
betraying Symptoms of Spleen and Irony<note place="bottom" n="*">

surely, this peevish Delicacy, whence-ever it arises,
can never be carry'd so far as to make us deny the
Existence of every Species of Virtue, and all Distinc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
of Manners and Behaviour. Besides <hi>Discretion,
Caution, Enterprize, Industry, Assiduity, Fragality,
OEconomy, Good-sense, Prudence, Discernment;</hi> besides
these Virtues, I say, whose very Names force an
Avowal of their Merit, there are many others,
to which the most determin'd Sceptism cannot, for a
Moment, refuse the Tribute of Praise and Appro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bation:
<hi>Temperance, Sobriety, Patience, Constancy,
<pb n="131" facs="134"/>
Perseverance, Forethought, Considerateness, Secrecy,
Order, Insinuation, Address, Presence of Mind, Quick<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
of Conception, Facility of Expression;</hi> these and a
thousand more of the same Kind, no Man will ever
deny to be Excellencies and Endowments. As their
Merit consists in their Tendency to serve the Person,
possest of them, without any magnificent Claims of
public and social Desert, we are the less jealous of
their Pretensions, and readily admit them into the
Catalogue of Virtues. We are not sensible, that,
by this Concession, we have pav'd the Way for all
the other moral Excellencies, and cannot consistently
hesitate any longer, with regard to disinterested Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nevolence,
Patriotism, and Humanity.</p>
               <p>IT seems, indeed, certain, that first Appearances
are here, as usual, extremely deceitful, and that 'tis
more difficult, in a speculative Way, to resolve into
Self-love the Merit we ascribe to the selfish Virtues
above-mention'd, than that even of the social Virtues
of Justice and Beneficence. For this latter Purpose,
we need but say, that whatever Conduct and Beha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>viour
promotes the Good of the Community, is
lov'd, prais'd, and esteem'd by the Community, on
Account of that Utility and Interest, of which every
one partakes: And tho' this Affection and Regard
be, in Reality, Gratitude, not Self-love, yet a
Distinction, even of this obvious Nature, may not
<pb n="132" facs="135"/>
readily be made by superficial Reasoners; and there
is Room, at least, to support the Cavil and Dispute
for a Moment. But as Qualities, which tend only
to the Utility of their Possessor, without any Refer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence
to us, or to the Community, are yet esteem'd
and valu'd; by what Theory or System can we ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count
for this Sentiment from Self-love, or deduce it
from that favourite Origin? There seems here a
Necessity of confessing that the Happiness and
Misery of others are not Spectacles altogether in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>different
to us, but that the View of the former,
whether in its Causes or Effects, like Sun-shine or
the Prospect of well-cultivated Plains (to carry our
Pretensions no higher) communicates a secret Joy
and Satisfaction; the Appearance of the latter,
like a lowering Cloud or barren Landskip, throws a
melancholy Damp over the Imagination. And this
Concession being once made, the Difficulty is over;
and a natural, unforc'd Interpretation of the Phae<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nomena
of human Life will afterwards, we may
hope, prevail, amongst all speculative Enquirers.</p>

               <p>THERE is no Rule in Painting or Statuary more

A DISPOSITION or Turn of Mind, which quali<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fies
a Man to rise in the World, and advance his
Fortune, is entitled to Esteem and Regard, as has
been already explain'd. It may, therefore, naturally
be suppos'd, that the actual Possession of Riches and
Authority will have a considerable Influence over
these Sentiments.</p>
               <p>LET us examine any Hypothesis, by which we can
account for the Regard, pay'd the Rich and Power<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful:
We shall find none satisfactory but that which
derives it from the Enjoyment, communicated by the
Images of Prosperity, Happiness, Ease, Plenty,
Command, and the Gratification of every Appetite.
Self-love, for Instance, which some affect so much
to consider as the Source of every Sentiment, is
<pb n="137" facs="140"/>
plainly insufficient to this Purpose. Where no Good<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>will
or Friendship appears, 'tis difficult to conceive
on what we can found our Hope of Advantage from
the Riches of others; tho' we naturally esteem and
respect the Rich, even before they discover any
such favourable Disposition towards us.</p>
               <p>WE are affected with the same Sentiments, when
we lie so much out of the Sphere of their Activity,
that they cannot even be suppos'd to possess the
Power of serving us. A Prisoner of War, in all
civiliz'd Nations, is treated with a Regard, suited to
his Condition; and Riches, 'tis evident, go far to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards
fixing the Condition of any Person. If Birth
and Quality enter for a Share, this still affords us an
Argument to our present Purpose. For what is it
we call a Man of Birth, but one, who is descended
from a long Succession of rich and powerful An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cestors,
and who acquires our Esteem by his Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>n<gap resp="#oxf" extent="3 letters" rend="content:•••">
                     <desc>illegible</desc>
                  </gap>ion
with Persons, whom we esteem? His An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cestors,
therefore, tho' dead, are respected, in some
Measure, on Account of their Riches; and conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently,
without any Kind of Expectation.</p>
               <p>BUT not to go so far as Prisoners of War or the
Dead, to find Instances of this disinterested Regard
for Riches; we may only observe, with a little At<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tention,
those Phaenomena, that occur in common
<pb n="138" facs="141"/>
Life and Conversation. A Man, who is himself,
we shall suppose, of a competent Fortune, and of
no Profession, coming into a Company of Strangers,
naturally treats them with different Degrees of Res<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pect
and Deference, as he is inform'd of their dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent
Fortunes and Conditions; tho' 'tis impossible
he can so suddenly propose, and perhaps would not
accept of, any pecuniary Advantage from them. A
Traveller is always admitted into Company, and
meets with Civility, in Proportion as his Train and
Equipage speak him a Man of great or moderate
Fortune. In short, the different Ranks of Man are,
in a great Measure, regulated by Riches; and that
with regard to Superiors as well as Inferiors, Strangers
as well as Acquaintance.</p>
               <p>WHAT remains, therefore, but to conclude, that
as Riches are desir'd for ourself only as the Means
of gratifying our Appetites, either at present or in
some imaginary future Period; they beget Esteem
in others merely from their having that Influence.
This indeed is their very Nature or Essence: They
have a direct Reference to the Commodities, Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veniencies,
and Pleasures of Life: A Banker's Bill,
who is broke, or Gold in a desart Island, would
otherwise be full as valuable. When we approach a
Man, who is, as we say, at his Ease, we are pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sented
with the pleasing Ideas of Plenty, Satisfaction,
<pb n="139" facs="142"/>
Cleanliness, Warmth; a chearful House, elegant
Furniture, ready Service, and whatever is desirable
in Meat, Drink, or Apparel. On the contrary,
when a poor Man appears, the disagreeable Images
of Want, Penury, hard Labour, dirty Furniture,
coarse or ragged Cloaths, nauseous Meat and distaste<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful
Liquor, immediately strike our Fancy. What
else do we mean by saying the one is rich, the other
poor? And as Regard or Contempt is the natural
Consequence of these different Situations in Life;
'tis easily seen what additional Light and Evidence
this throws on our preceding Theory, with Regard
to all moral Distinctions<note place="bottom" n="*">There is something very extraordinary, and seemingly un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>accountable in the Operation of our Passions, when we consider the Fortune and Situation of others. Very often another's Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vancement and Prosperity produces Envy, which has a strong Mix<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture of Hatred, and arises chiefly from the Comparison of ourselves with the Person. At the very same Time, or at least, in very short Intervals, we may feel the Passion of Respect, which is a Species of Affection or Good-will, with a Mixture of Humility. On the other hand, the Misfortunes of our Fellows often cause Pity, which has a strong Mixture of Good-will. This Sentiment of Pity is nearly ally'd to Contempt, which is a Species of Dislike, along with a Mixture of Pride. I only point out these Phaenomena, as a Subject of Speculation to such as are curious with regard to moral Enquiries. 'Tis sufficient for the present Purpose to observe in general, that Power and Riches commonly cause Respect, Po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verty and Meanness Contempt, tho' particular Views and Incidents may sometimes raise the Passions of Envy and of Pity.</note>.</p>

A MAN, who has cur'd himself of all ridiculous
Prepossessions, and is fully, sincerely, and steddily
convinc'd, from Experience as well as Philosophy,
that the Differences of Fortune make less Difference
in Happiness than is vulgarly imagin'd; such a one
measures not out Degrees of Esteem according to the
Rent-rolls of his Acquaintance. He may, indeed,
externally pay a superior Deference to the great Lord
above the Vassal; because Riches are the most con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venient,
being the most fixt and determinate, Source
of Distinction: But his internal Sentiments are more
regulated by the personal Characters of Men, than
by the accidental and capricious Favours of For<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tune.</p>
               <p>IN most Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> Family, that is,
hereditary Riches, mark'd with Titles and Symbols
from the Sovereign, is the chief Source of Distinc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
In <hi>England,</hi> more Regard is paid to present
Opulence and Plenty. Each Practice has its Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantages
and Disadvantages. Where Birth is re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spected,
unactive spiritless Minds remain in haughty
Indolence, and dream of nothing but Pedigrees and
Genealogies: The generous and ambitious seek
Honour and Command and Reputation and Favour.
Where Riches are the chief Idol, Corruption, Ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nality,
Rapine prevail: Arts, Manufactures, Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce,
<pb n="141" facs="144"/>
Agriculture flourish. The former Prejudice,
being favourable to military Virtue, is more suited
to Monarchies. The other being the chief Spur to
Industry, agrees better with a republican Govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment.
And we accordingly find, that each of these
Forms of Government, by varying the <hi>Utility</hi> of
those Customs, has commonly a proportionable
Effect on the Sentiments of Mankind.</p>

how suddenly the Conversation was animated,
and what Sprightliness diffus'd itself over the Coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tenance,
Discourse, and Behaviour of every one,
on the Accession of a good-humour'd, lively Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>panion;
such a one, I say, will easily allow, that
CHEERFULNESS carries great Merit with
it, and naturally conciliates the Affection and Good<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>will
of Mankind. No Quality, indeed, more rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dily
communicates itself to all around; because
none has a greater Propensity to display itself, in
jovial Talk and pleasant Entertainment. The Flame
spreads thro' the whole Circle; and the most sullen
and morose are often caught by it. That the me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lancholy
<pb n="144" facs="146"/>
hate the merry, even tho' <hi>Horace</hi> says it, I
have some Difficulty to allow; because I have al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ways
observ'd, that, where the Jollity is moderate

that it dissipates the Gloom, with which
they are commonly opprest; and gives them an un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>usual
Satisfaction and Enjoyment.</p>
            <p>FROM this Influence of Cheerfulness, both to
communicate itself, and to engage Approbation, we
may perceive, that there are another Set of Virtues,
which, without any Utility or any Tendency to
farther Good, either of the Community or of the
Possessor, diffuse a Satisfaction on the Beholders,
and conciliate Friendship and Regard. Their im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mediate
Sensation, to the Person possest of them,
is agreeable: Others enter into the same Humour,
and catch the Sentiment, by a Contagion or natural
Sympathy: And as we cannot forbear loving what<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever
pleases, a kindly Emotion arises towards the
Person, who communicates so much Delight and
Satisfaction. He is a more animating Spectacle:
His Presence diffuses over us more serene Compla<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cency
and Enjoyment: Our Imagination, entering
into his Feelings and Disposition, is affected in a
more agreeable Manner, than if a melancholy, de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jected,
sullen, anxious Temper were presented to
our Notice and Observation. Hence the Affection

and Approbation, which attends the former: The

a Poynard under his Chin, to raise his Head, and
expose himself to every Contumely. What abject
Infamy! What low Humiliation! Yet even here,
says the Historian, he discover'd some Symptoms of
a Mind not altogether degenerate. To a Tribune,

            <p>WE never excuse the absolute Want of Spirit and
Dignity of Character, or a proper Sense of what is
due to one's self, in Society and the common Inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>course

of Life. This Vice constitutes what we pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perly

basest Slavery, in order to gain his Ends; fawn upon
those, who abuse him; and degrade himself by In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timacies
and Familiarities with undeserving Inferiors.
A certain Degree of generous Pride or Self-value is
so requisite, that the Absence of it in the Mind dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pleases
after the same Manner, as the Want of a
Nose, Eye, or any of the most material Features of
the Face or Members of the Body<note place="bottom" n="*">The Absence of a Virtue may often be a Vice; and that of the highest Kind; as in the Instance of Ingratitude, as well as Meanness.

An Abject<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness of Character, likewise, is disgustful and contemptible in an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>other View. Where a Man has no Sense of Value in himself, we are not likely to have any higher Estimation of him.

Towels is most esteem'd amongst them. So much
had martial Bravery, in that Nation, as well as in
many others, destroy'd the Sentiments of Humanity;
a Virtue surely much more useful and engaging.</p>
            <p>'Tis indeed observable, that, amongst all uncul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tivated
Nations, which have not, as yet, had full
Experience of the Advantages, attending Benefi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cence,
Justice, and the social Virtues, Courage is
the predominant Excellence; what is most celebrated
by Poets, recommended by Parents and Instructors,
and admir'd by the Public in general. The Ethics
<pb n="152" facs="154"/>
of <hi>Homer</hi> are, in this Particular, very different from
those of <hi>Fenelon,</hi> his elegant Imitator; and such as
are well suited to an Age, wherein one Hero, as re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>markt
by <hi>Thucydides</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Lib. 1.</note>, could ask another, without Offence, if he was a Robber or not. Such also,
very lately, was the System of Ethics, that prevail'd
in many barbarous Parts of <hi>Ireland;</hi> if we may
credit <hi>Spenser,</hi> in his judicious Account of the State
of that Kingdom<note place="bottom" n="†">It is a common Use, says he, amongst their Gentlemen's Sons, that, as soon as they are able to use their Weapons, they strait gather to themselves three or four Stragglers or Kern, with whom wandering a while up and down idly the Country, taking only Meat, he at last falleth into some bad Occasion, that shall be offer'd; which being once made known, he is thenceforth counted a Men of Worth, in whom there is Courage.</note>.</p>
            <p>OF the same Class of Virtues with Courage is that
undisturb'd, philosophical TRANQUILLITY,
superior to Pain, Sorrow, Anxiety, and each Assault
of adverse Fortune. Conscious of his own Virtue,
say the Philosophers, the Sage elevates himself above
every Accident of Life; and securely plac'd in the
Temple of Wisdom, looks down on inferior Mor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tals,
engag'd in Pursuit of Honours, Riches, Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>putation,
and each frivolous Enjoyment. These
Pretensions, no doubt, when stretch'd to the utmost,
<pb n="153" facs="155"/>
are much too magnificent for human Nature. They
carry, however, a Grandeur, with them, which
seizes the Spectator, and strikes him with Admira<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion.
And the nearer we can approach, in Practice,
to this sublime Tranquillity and Indifference (for we
must distinguish it from a stupid Insensibility) the
more secure Enjoyment shall we attain within our<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves,
and the more Greatness of Mind shall we
discover to the World. The philosophical Tran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quillity
may, indeed, be consider'd only as a Branch
of Magnanimity.</p>
            <p>WHO admires not <hi>Socrates;</hi> his perpetual Serenity
and Contentment, amidst the greatest Poverty and
domestic Vexations; his resolute Contempt of Riches,
and magnanimous Care of preserving Liberty,
while he refused all Assistance from his Friends and
Disciples, and avoided even the Dependance of an
Obligation? <hi>Epictetus</hi> had not so much as a Door to
his little House or Hovel; and therefore, soon lost
his Iron Lamp, the only Furniture he had worth
taking. But resolving to disappoint all Robbers for
the future, he supply'd its Place with an earthen
Lamp, which he very peaceably kept Possession of
ever after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="156"/>
IN Antiquity, the Heroes of Philosophy, as well
as those of War and Patriotism, have a Grandeur
and Force of Sentiment, which astonishes our nar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>row
Souls, and is rashly rejected as extravagant and
supernatural. They, in their Turn, I allow, would
have had equal Reason to consider, as romantic and
incredible, the Degree of Humanity, Clemency,
Order, Tranquillity, and other social Virtues, to
which, in the Administration of Government, we
have attain'd in modern Times, had any one been
then able to have made a fair Representation of
them. Such is the Compensation, which Nature,
or rather Education has made, in the Distribution of
Excellencies and Virtues, in these different Ages.</p>
            <p>THE Merit of BENEVOLENCE, arising from
its Utility, and its Tendency to the Good of Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kind,
has been already explain'd, and is, no doubt, the
Source of a <hi>considerable</hi> Part of that Esteem, which is
so universally pay'd it But it will also be allow'd, that
the very Softness and Tenderness of the Sentiment,
its engaging Endearments, its fond Expressions, its de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>licate
Attentions, and all that Flow of mutual Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fidence
and Regard, which enter into a warm At<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tachment
of Love and Friendship: It will be al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low'd,
I say, that these Feelings being delightful in
themselves, are necessarily communicated to the
<pb n="155" facs="157"/>
Spectators, and melt them into the same Fondness
and Delicacy. The Tears naturally start in our
Eyes on the Observation of a warm Sentiment of
this Nature: Our Breast heaves, our Heart is agitat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed,
and every humane tender Principle of our Frame,
is set in Motion, and gives us the purest and most
satisfactory Enjoyment.</p>
            <p>WHEN Poets form Descriptions of <hi>Elyzian</hi> Fields,
where the blessed Inhabitants stand in no Need of
each other's Assistance, they yet represent them, as
maintaining a constant Entercourse of Love and
Friendship, and sooth our Fancy with the pleasing
Image of these soft and gentle Passions. The Idea
of tender Tranquillity in a pastoral <hi>Arcadia</hi> is agree<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able
from a like Principle, as has been observ'd
above<note place="bottom" n="*">Sect. 5. Part 2.</note>.</p>
            <p>WHO would live amidst perpetual Wrangling, and
Scolding, and mutual Reproaches? The Rough<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
and Harshness of these Emotions disturb and
displease us: We suffer by Contagion and Sympathy;
nor can we remain indifferent Spectators, even tho'
certain, that no pernicious Consequences would ever
follow from such angry Passions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="158"/>
As a certain Proof, that the whole Merit of Bene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>volence
is not deriv'd from its Usefulness, we may
observe, that, in a kind Way of Blame, we say, a
Person is <hi>too good;</hi> when he exceeds his Part in So<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciety,
and carries his Attention for others beyond the
proper Bounds and Measure. In like Manner, we
say a Man is <hi>too high-spirited, too intrepid, too indiffer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ent
about Fortune:</hi> Reproaches, which really, at the
bottom, imply more Regard and Esteem than many
Panegyrics. Being accustom'd to rate the Merit and
Demerit of Characters chiefly by their useful or per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nicious
Tendencies, we cannot forbear applying the
Epithet of Blame, when we discover a Sentiment,
which rises to a Degree that is hurtful: But it may
happen, at the same Time, that its noble Elevation,
or its engaging Tenderness so seizes the Heart, as
rather to encrease our Friendship and Concern for
the Person<note place="bottom" n="*">Cheerfulness could starce admit of Blame from its Excess, were it not, that dissolute Mirth, without a proper Cause or Sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject, is a sure Symptom and Characteristic of Folly, and on that Account, disgustful.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE Amours and Attachments of <hi>Harry</hi> the IVth,
during the civil Wars of the League, frequently hurt
his Interest and his Cause; but all the young, at
<pb n="157" facs="159"/>
least, and amorous, who can sympathize with that
Passion, will allow, that this very Weakness (for
they will readily call it such) chiefly endears that
Hero, and interests them in his Fortunes.</p>
            <p>THE excessive Bravery and resolute Inflexibility of
<hi>Charles</hi> the XIIth ruin'd his own Country, and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fested
all his Neighbours: But have such Splendour
and Greatness in their Appearance, as strike us with
Admiration; and they might, in some Degree, be
even approv'd of, if they betray'd not sometimes too
evident Symptoms of Madness and Disorder.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Athenians</hi> pretended to the first Invention of
Agriculture and of Laws; and always valu'd them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves
extremely on the Benefit thereby procur'd to
the whole Race of Mankind. They also boasted,
and with Reason, of their warlike Enterprizes;
particularly against those innumerable Fleets and
Armies of <hi>Persians,</hi> which invaded <hi>Greece</hi> during
the Reign of <hi>Darius</hi> and of <hi>Xerxes.</hi> But tho' there
be no Comparison, in Point of Utility, betwixt these
peaceful and military Honours; yet we find, that
the Orators, who have wrote such elaborate Pane<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gyrics
on that famous City, have chiefly triumph'd in
displaying the warlike Atchievments. <hi>Lysias, Thucy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dides,
Plato</hi> and <hi>Isocrates</hi> discover, all of them, the
same Partiality: which, tho' condemn'd by calm
<pb n="158" facs="160"/>
Reason and Reflection, appears so natural in the
Mind of Man.</p>
            <p>'Tis observable, that the great Charm of Poetry
consists in lively Pictures of the sublime Passions,
Magnanimity, Courage, Disdain of Fortune; or
those of the tender Affections, Love and Friendship;
which warm the Heart, and diffuse over us similar
Sentiments and Emotions. And tho' every Kind of
Passion, even the most disagreeable, such as Grief
and Anger, are observ'd, when excited by Poetry,
to convey a Pleasure and Satisfaction, from a Me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chanism
of Nature, not easy to be explain'd: Yet
those more elevated or softer Affections have a pecu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liar
Influence, and please from more than one Cause
or Principle. Not to mention, that they alone in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terest
us in the Fortune of the Persons represented,
or communicate any Esteem and Affection for their
Character.</p>
            <p>AND can it possibly be doubted, that this Talent
itself of Poets, to move the Passions, this PA<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>THETIC
and SUBLIME of Sentiment, is a
very considerable Merit, and being enhanc'd by its
extreme Rarity, may exalt the Person possest of it,
above every Character of the Age, in which he
lives? The Prudence, Address, Steadiness, and be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nign
Government of <hi>Augustus,</hi> adorn'd with all the
<pb n="159" facs="161"/>
Splendour of his noble Birth and imperial Crown,
render him but an unequal Competitor for Fame
with <hi>Virgil,</hi> who lays nothing into the opposite Scale
but the divine Beauties of his poetical Genius.</p>
            <p>THE very Sensibility to these Beauties or a
DELICACY of Taste, is itself a Beauty in any
Character; as conveying the purest, the most dur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able,
and most innocent of all Enjoyments.</p>
            <p>THESE are some Instances of the Species of
Virtue, that are prais'd from the immediate Pleasure,
which they communicate to the Person, possest of
them. No Views of Utility or of future beneficial
Consequences enter into this Sentiment of Appro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bation;
yet is it of a similar Kind to that other
Sentiment, which arises from Views of public or
private Utility. The same social Sympathy, we may
observe, or Fellow-feeling with human Happiness or
Misery, gives Rise to both; and this Analogy in all
the Parts of the present Theory may justly be re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>garded
as a Confirmation of it.</p>

            <p>AS the mutual Shocks, in <hi>Society,</hi> and the Op<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>positions

Mankind to establish the Laws of <hi>Justice;</hi>
in order to preserve the Advantages of common As<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sistance
and Protection: in like Manner, the eternal
Contrarieties, in <hi>Company,</hi> of Men's Pride and Self-conceit
have introduc'd the Rules of GOOD-MANNERS
or POLITENESS, in order to
facilitate the Intercourse of Minds, and an un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>disturb'd
Commerce and Conversation. Amongst
<pb n="162" facs="163"/>
well-bred People, a mutual Deference is affected;
Contempt of others disguis'd: Authority conceal'd:
Attention given to each in his Turn: And an easy
Stream of Conversation maintain'd, without Vehe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mence,
without mutual Interruption, without Eager<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
for Victory, and without any Airs of Superio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity.
These Attentions and Regards are immediately
<hi>agreeable</hi> to others, abstracted from any Regard to
Utility or beneficial Tendencies: They conciliate
Affection, promote Esteem, and enhance extremely
the Merit of the Person, who regulates his Behaviour
by them.</p>
            <p>MANY of the Forms of Breeding are arbitrary
and casual: But the Thing exprest by them is still
the same. A <hi>Spaniard</hi> goes out of his own House
before his Guest, to signify, that he leaves him
Master of all. In other Countries, the Landlord
walks out last, as a common Mark of Deference and
Regard.</p>
            <p>BUT in order to render a Man perfect <hi>Good-company,</hi>
he must have WIT and INGENUITY as well as
Good-manners. What Wit is, it may not be easy to
define; but 'tis easy surely to determine, that 'tis a
Quality immediately <hi>agreeable</hi> to others, and com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>municating,
on its first Appearance, a lively Joy and
Satisfaction to every one, that has any Comprehen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion
<pb n="163" facs="164"/>
of it. The most profound Metaphysics, indeed,
might be employ'd, in explaining the various Kinds
and Species of Wit; and many Classes of it, which
are now receiv'd on the simple Testimony of Taste
and Sentiment, might, perhaps, be resolv'd into
more general Principles. But this is sufficient for
our present Purpose, that it does affect Taste and
Sentiment, and bestowing an immediate Enjoyment,
is a sure Source of Approbation and Affection.</p>
            <p>IN Countries, where Men pass all their Time in
Conversation, and Visits and Assemblies, these <hi>compa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nionable</hi>
Qualities, so to speak, are of high Estima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
and form a chief Part of personal Merit. In
Countries, where Men live a more domestic Life,
and either are employ'd in Business or amuse them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves
in a narrower Circle of Acquaintance, the
more solid Qualities are chiefly regarded. Thus, I
have observ'd, that, amongst the <hi>French,</hi> the first
Questions, with regard to a Stranger, are, <hi>Is he
polite? Has he Wit?</hi> In our own Country, the
chief Praise bestow'd is always that of a <hi>good-natur'd,
sensible Fellow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN Conversation, the lively Spirit of Dialogue is
<hi>agreeable,</hi> even to those who desire not to have any
Share of the Discourse: Hence a Teller of long
Stories or a pompous Declaimer is very little approv'd
<pb n="164" facs="165"/>
of. But most Men desire likewise their Share in the
Conversation, and regard, with a very evil Eye,
that <hi>Loquacity,</hi> which deprives them of a Right they
are naturally so jealous of.</p>
            <p>THERE are a Set of harmless <hi>Lyars,</hi> frequently to
be met with in Company, who deal much in the Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>velous
and Extraordinary. Their usual Intention is to
please and entertain; but as Men are delighted with
nothing but what they conceive to be Truth, these
People mistake extremely the Means of pleasing,
and incur universal Blame. Some Indulgence, how<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever,
to Lying or Fiction is given in <hi>humourous</hi>
Stories; because it is there agreeable and enter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>taining;
and Truth is not of any Importance.</p>
            <p>ELOQUENCE, Genius of all Kinds, even good
Sense, and sound Reasoning, when it rises to an
eminent Degree, and is employ'd upon Subjects of
any considerable Dignity and nice Discernment;
all these Qualities seem immediately agreeable, and
have a Merit distinct from their Usefulness. Rarity,
likewise, which so much enhances the Price of every
Thing, must set an additional Value on these noble
Talents of the human Mind.</p>
            <p>MODESTY may be understood in different
Senses, even abstracted from Chastity, which has
<pb n="165" facs="166"/>
been already treated of. It sometimes means that
Tenderness and Nicety of Honour, that Apprehen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion
of Blame, that Dread of Intrusion or Injury to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards
others, that <hi>Pudor,</hi> which is the proper Guar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dian
of every Kind of Virtue, and a sure Preserva<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive
against Vice and Corruption. But its most usual
Meaning is, when it is oppos'd to <hi>Impudence</hi> and <hi>Ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rogance,</hi>
and expresses a Diffidence of our own Judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,
and a due Attention and Regard to others.
In young Men chiefly, this Quality is a sure Sign of
Good-sense; and is also the certain Means of aug<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>menting
that Endowment, by preserving their Ears
open to Instruction, and making them still grasp after
new Attainments. But it has a farther Charm to
every Spectator; by flattering each Man's Vanity,
and presenting the Appearance of a docile Pupil,
who receives, with proper Attention and Respect,
every Word they utter<note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <p>Men have in general a much greater Propensity to over-value than under-value themselves; notwithstanding the Opinion of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> This makes us more jealous of the Excess on the former Side, and causes us to regard, with a particular Indulgence, all Tendency to Modesty and Self-diffidence; as esteeming the Danger less of falling into any vicious Extreme of that Nature. 'Tis thus, in Countries, where Men's Bodies are apt to exceed in Corpulency, personal Beauty is plac'd in a much greater Degree of Slenderness, than in Countries where that is the most usual Defect. Being so often struck with Instances of one Species of Deformity, Men think they can never keep at too great a Distance from it, and wish always to have a Leaning to the opposite Side. In like Manner, were the Door open'd to Self-praise, and were <hi>Montaigne</hi>'s Maxim observ'd, that one should say as frankly, <hi>I have Sense, I have Learning, I have Courage, Beauty, or Wit;</hi> as 'tis sure we often think so; were this the Case, I say, every one is sensible, that such a Flood of Impertinence would break in upon us as would render Society altogether intolerable. For this Reason Custom has establish'd it as a Rule, in common Societies, that Men should never praise themselves, and not even speak much of themselves; and 'tis only amongst intimate Friends or People of very manly Behaviour, that one is allow'd to do himself Justice. No body finds fault with <hi>Maurice,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for his Reply to one, who ask'd him whom he esteem'd the first General of the Age, <hi>The Marquis de</hi> Spinola, said he, <hi>is the second.</hi> Tho' 'tis even observable, that the Self-praise imply'd is here better imply'd, than if it had been directly express'd, without any Cover or Disguise.</p>
                  <p>He must be a very superficial Thinker, who imagines, that all Instances of mutual Deference are to be understood in earnest, and that a Man would be more esteemable for being ignorant of his own Merits and Accomplishments. A small Byass towards Modesty, even in the internal Sentiments, is favourably regarded, especially in young People; and a strong Byass is requir'd in the outward Behaviour: But this excludes not a noble Pride and Spirit, which may openly display itself in its full Extent, when one lies under Calumny or Oppression of any Kind. The gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous Contumacy of <hi>Socrates,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> calls it, has been highly celebrated in all Ages; and when join'd to the usual Modesty of his Behaviour, forms a most shining Character. <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> the <hi>A<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">

By no Means,</hi> reply'd the other. <hi>And can you then imagine,</hi> cry'd the Hero, <hi>that</hi> Iphicrates <hi>would be guilty?</hi> Quinctil. Lib. 5. Cap. 12. In short, a generous Spirit and Self-value, well founded, decently disguis'd, and courageously supported under D<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">

                     </gap>stress and Calumny, is a very great Virtue, and seems to derive its Merit from the noble Elevation of its Sentiment, or its immediate Agreeableness to its Possessor. In ordinary Characters, we approve of a Byass to Modesty, which is immediately agreeable to others. The vic<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">
                        <desc>illegible</desc>
                     </gap>ous Excess of the former Virtue, <hi>viz.</hi> Insolence or Haughti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, is immediately disagreeable to others: The Excess of the latter is so to the Possessor. Thus are the Boundaries of these Duties adjusted.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="167"/>
A DESIRE of Fame, Reputation, or a Character
with others, is so far from being blameable, that it
<pb n="167" facs="168"/>
seems inseparable from Virtue, Genius, Capacity,
and a generous or noble Disposition. An Attention,
even to trivial Matters, in order to please, is also
expected and demanded by Society; and no one is
surpriz'd, if he finds a Man in Company, to observe
a greater Elegance of Dress and more pleasant Flow
of Conversation, than when he passes his Time, at
home, and altogether with his own Family. Where<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>in,
then, consists VANITY, which is so justly
regarded as a Fault or Imperfection? It seems to
consist chiefly in such an intemperate Display of our
Advantages, Honours and Accomplishments; in
such an importunate and open Demand of Praise and
Admiration, as is offensive to others, and encroaches
too far on <hi>their</hi> secret Vanity and Ambition It is
besides a sure Symptom of the Want of true Dignity
<pb n="168" facs="169"/>
and Elevation of Mind, which is so great an Orna<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
to any Character. For why that impatient
Desire of Applause; as if you were not justly en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>titled
to it, and might not reasonably expect it would
for ever attend you? Why so anxious to inform us
of the great Company you have kept; the obliging
Things, that were said to you; the Honours, the
Distinctions you met with; as if these were not
Things of Course, and what we could readily, of
ourselves, have imagin'd, without being told of
them?</p>
            <p>DECENCY, or a proper Regard to Age, Sex,
Character and Station in the World, may be rank'd
among the Qualities, which are immediately agree<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able
to others, and which, by that Means, acquire
Praise and Approbation. An effeminate Behaviour
in a Man, a rough Manner in a Woman; these are
ugly, because unsuitable to each Character, and
different from the Qualities we expect in the Sexes.
'Tis as if a Tragedy abounded in comic Beauties,
or a Comedy in tragic. The Disproportions hurt the
Eye, and convey a disagreeable Sentiment to the
Spectators, the Source of Blame and Disapproba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion.

               <pb n="169" facs="170"/>
AMONGST the other Virtues, we may also give
CLEANLINESS a Place; since it naturally
renders us agreeable to others, and is no inconsider<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able
Source of Love and Affection. No one will
deny, that a Negligence in this Particular is a Fault;
and as Faults are nothing but smaller Vices, and this
Fault can have no other Origin than the uneasy Sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sation,
which it excites in others; we may, in this
Instance, seemingly so trivial, clearly discover the
Origin of moral Distinctions, about which the
Learned have involved themselves in such Mazes of
Perplexity and Error.</p>
            <p>BUT besides all the <hi>agreeable</hi> Qualities, the Origin
of whose Beauty we can, in some Degree, explain
and account for, there still remains something myste<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rious
and unaccountable, which conveys an imme<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diate
Satisfaction to the Spectators, but how, or
why, or for what Reason, they cannot pretend to
determine. There is a MANNER, a Grace, a
Genteelness, an I-know-not-what, which some Men
possess above others, which is very different from ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ternal
Beauty and Comeliness, and which, however,
catches our Affection almost as suddenly and power<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fully.
And tho' this <hi>Manner</hi> be chiefly talk'd of in
the Passion betwixt the Sexes, where the conceal'd
Magic is easily explain'd, yet surely much of it pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vails
<pb n="170" facs="171"/>
in all our Estimation of Characters, and forms
no inconsiderable Part of personal Merit. This Class
of Virtues, therefore, must be trusted entirely to the
blind, but sure Testimony of Taste and Sentiment;
and must be consider'd as a Part of Ethics, left by
Nature to baffle all the Pride of Philosophy, and
make her sensible of her narrow Boundaries and
slender Acquisitions.</p>
            <p>WE approve of another, because of his Wit, Po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liteness,
Modesty, Decency, or any agreeable Qua<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lity
he possesses, although he be not of our Acquain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tance,
nor has ever given us any Entertainment, by
Means of these Accomplishments. The Idea, which
we form of their Effect on his Acquaintance, has an
agreeable Influence on our Imagination, and gives us
the Sentiment of Approbation. This Principle enters
into all the Judgments, which we form concerning
Morals.</p>

               <p>IT may justly appear surprizing, that any Man,
in so late an Age, should find it requisite to
prove, by elaborate Reasonings, that VIRTUE
or PERSONAL MERIT consists altogether in
the Possession of Qualities, <hi>useful</hi> or <hi>agreeable</hi> to the
<hi>Person himself</hi> or to <hi>others.</hi> It might be expected
that this Principle would have occur'd even to the
first rude, unpractis'd Enquirers concerning Morals,
and been receiv'd, from its own Evidence, without
any Argument or Disputation. Whatever is valuable
in any Kind so naturally classes itself under the Di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vision
of <hi>useful</hi> or <hi>agreeable,</hi> the <hi>utile</hi> or the <hi>dulce,</hi>
that 'tis not easy to imagine, why we should ever
seek farther, or consider the Question as a Matter of
nice Research or Enquiry. And as every Thing
<pb n="172" facs="173"/>
useful or agreeable must possess these Qualities with
regard either to the <hi>Person himself</hi> or to <hi>others,</hi> the
compleat Delineation or Description of Merit seems
to be perform'd as naturally as a Shadow is cast by
the Sun, or an Image is reflected upon Water. If
the Ground, on which the Shadow is cast, be not
broken and uneven, nor the Surface, from which
the Image is reflected, disturb'd and confus'd, a just
Figure is immediately presented, without any Art
or Attention. And it seems a reasonable Presump<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
that Systems and Hypotheses have perverted
our natural Understanding, when a Theory, so
simple and obvious, could so long have escap'd the
most elaborate Scrutiny and Examination.</p>
               <p>BUT however the Case may have far'd with Phi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>losophy;
in common Life, these Principles are still
implicitely maintain'd; nor is any other Topic of
Praise or Blame ever recur'd to, when we employ
any Panegyric or Satyre, any Applause or Censure
of human Action and Behaviour. If we observe
Men, in every Intercourse of Business or Pleasure,
in each Conference and Conversation, we shall find
them no where, except in the Schools, at any Loss
upon this Subject. What so natural, for Instance,
as the following Dialogue? You are very happy,
we shall suppose one to say, addressing himself to
<pb n="173" facs="174"/>
another, that you have given your Daughter to <hi>Cle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>anthes:</hi>
He is a Man of Honour and Humanity.
Every one, who has any Intercourse with him, is
sure of <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>kind</hi> Treatment<note place="bottom" n="*">Qualities useful to others.</note>. I congratulate
you too, says another, on the promising Expectations
of this Son-in-law; whose assiduous Application to
the Sudy of the Laws, whose quick Penetration and
early Knowledge both of Men and Business, prog<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nosticate
the greatest Honours and Advancement<note place="bottom" n="†">Qualities useful to the Person himself.</note>.
You surprize me much, replies a third, when you
talk of <hi>Cleanthes</hi> as a Man of Business and Appli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cation.
I met him lately in a Circle of the gayest
Company, and he was the very Life and Soul of
our Conversation: So much Wit with Good-manners;
so much Gallantry without Affectation; so much in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>genious
Knowledge so genteely deliver'd, I have
never before observ'd in any one<note place="bottom" n="‡">Qualities immmediately agreeable to others.</note>. You would ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mire
him still more, says a fourth, if you knew him
more familiarly. That Cheerfulness, which you
might remark in him, is not a sudden Flash struck
out by Company: It runs thro' the whole Tenor of
his Life, and preserves a perpetual Serenity on his
Countenance, and Tranquillity in his Soul. He has
met with severe Trials, Misfortunes as well as
Dangers; and by his Greatness of Mind, was still
<pb n="174" facs="175"/>
superior to all of them<note place="bottom" n="*">Qualities immediately agreeable to the Person himself.</note>. The Image, Gentlemen,
you have here delineated of <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> cry I, is that
of accomplish'd Merit. Each of you has given a
Stroke of the Pencil to his Figure; and you have
unawares exceeded all the Pictures drawn by <hi>Gratian</hi>
or <hi>Castiglione.</hi> A Philosopher might select this Cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racter
as a Model of perfect Virtue.</p>
               <p>AND as every Quality, which is useful or agreeable
to ourselves or others, is, in common Life, admitted
under the Denomination of Virtue or personal
Merit; so no other will ever be receiv'd, where
Men judge of Things by their natural, unprejudic'd
Reason, without the delusive Glosses of Superstition
and false Religion. Celibacy, Fasting, Penances,
Mortification, Self-denial, Humility, Silence, So<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>litude
and the whole Train of monkish Virtues;
for what Reason are they every where rejected by
Men of Sense, but because they serve no Manner of
Purpose; neither advance a Man's Fortune in the
World, nor render him a more valuable Member of
Society; neither qualify him for the Entertainment
of Company, nor encrease his Power of Self-en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>joyment?
We observe, on the contrary, that they
cross all these desirable Ends; stupify the Under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>standing
and harden the Heart, obscure the Fancy
<pb n="175" facs="176"/>
and sower the Temper. We justly, therefore trans<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fer
them to the opposite Column, and place them in
the Catalogue of Vices; nor has any Superstition
Force sufficient, amongst Men of the World, to
pervert entirely these natural Sentiments. A gloomy,
hair-brain'd Enthusiast, after his Death, may have
Place in the Calendar; but will scarce ever be ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mitted,
when alive, into Intimacy and Society, ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cept
by those who are as delirious and dismal as
himself.</p>
               <p>IT seems a Happiness in the present Theory, that
it enters not into that vulgar Dispute concerning the
<hi>Degrees</hi> of Benevolence or Self-love, which prevail
in human Nature; a Dispute, which is never likely
to have any Issue, both because Men, who have
taken Party, are not easily convinc'd, and because
the Phaenomena, which can be produc'd on either
Side, are so dispers'd, so uncertain, and subject to so
many Interpretations, that 'tis scarce possible accu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rately
to compare them, or draw from them any de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terminate
Inference or Conclusion. 'Tis sufficient
for our present Purpose, if it be allow'd, what surely,
without the greatest Absurdity, cannot be disputed,
that there is some Benevolence, however small, in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fus'd
into our Bosom; some Spark of Friendship for
human Kind; some Particle of the Dove, kneaded
into our Frame, along with the Elements of the
<pb n="176" facs="177"/>
Wolf and Serpent. Let these generous Sentiments
be suppos'd ever so weak; let them be hardly suf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficient
to move even a Hand or Finger of our Body;
they must still direct the Determinations of our Mind,
and where every Thing else is equal, produce a cool
Preference of what is useful and serviceable to Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kind,
above what is pernicious and dangerous. A
<hi>moral Distinction,</hi> therefore, immediately arises; a
general Sentiment of Blame and Approbation; a
Tendency, however faint, to the Objects of the one,
and a proportionable Aversion to those of the other.
Nor will those Reasoners, who so earnestly maintain
the predominant Selfishness of human Kind, be any
way scandaliz'd at hearing of the weak Sentiments
of Virtue, implanted in our Nature. On the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trary,
they are found as ready to maintain the one
Tenet as the other; and their Spirit of Satyre, (for
such it appears, rather than of Corruption) naturally
gives Rise to both Opinions; which have, indeed,
a great, and almost indissoluble Connexion together.</p>
               <p>AVARICE, Ambition, Vanity, and all Passions,
vulgarly, tho' improperly, compriz'd under the De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nomination
of <hi>Self-love,</hi> are here excluded from our
Theory concerning the Origin of Morals, not be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause
they are too weak, but because they have not
a proper Direction, for that Purpose. The Notion
of Morals implies some Sentiment, common to all
<pb n="177" facs="178"/>
Mankind, which recommends the same Object to
general Approbation, and makes every Man, or
most Men, agree in the same Opinion or Decision
concerning it. It also implies some Sentiment, so
universal and comprehensive as to extend to all Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kind,
and render the Actions and Conduct, even of
Persons the most remote, an Object of Censure or
Applause, according as they agree or disagree with
that Rule of Right, which is establish'd. These two
requisite Circumstances belong alone to the Senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
of Humanity here insisted on. The other
Passions produce, in every Breast, many strong Sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timents
of Desire and Aversion, Affection and
Hatred; but these neither are felt so much in com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon,
nor are so comprehensive, as to be the Foun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dation
of any general System and establish'd Theory
of Blame or Approbation.</p>
               <p>WHEN a Man denominates another his <hi>Enemy,</hi> his
<hi>Rival,</hi> his <hi>Antagonist,</hi> his <hi>Adversary,</hi> he is understood
to speak the Language of Self-love, and to express
Sentiments, peculiar to himself, and arising from his
particular Circumstances and Situation: But when
he bestows on any Man the Epithets of <hi>vicious</hi> or
<hi>odious</hi> or <hi>deprav'd,</hi> he then speaks another Language,
and expresses Sentiments, in which he expects all his
Audience are to concur with him. He must here,
therefore, depart from his private and particular
<pb n="178" facs="179"/>
Situation, and must choose a Point of View, com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon
to him with others: He must move some uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versal
Principle of the human Frame, and touch a
String, to which all Mankind have an Accord and
Symphony. If he means, therefore, to express,
that this Man possesses Qualities, whose Tendency is
pernicious to Society, he has chosen this common
Point in View, and has touch'd the Principle of Hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manity,
in which every Man, in some Degree,
concurs. While the human Heart is compounded of
the same Elements as at present, it will never be al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>together
indifferent to the Good of Mankind, nor
entirely unaffected with the Tendencies of Characters
and Manners. And tho' this Affection of Humanity
may not generally be esteem'd so strong, as Ambition
or Vanity, yet, being common to all Men, it can
alone be the Foundation of Morals, or of any ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neral
System of Conduct and Behaviour. One Man's
Ambition is not another's Ambition; nor will the
same Event or Object satisfy both: But the Huma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity
of one Man is the Humanity of every one; and
the same Object touches this Passion in all human
Creatures.</p>
               <p>BUT the Sentiments, which arises from Humanity,
are not only the same in all human Creatures, and
produce the same Approbation or Censure; but they
also comprehend all human Creatures; nor is there
<pb n="179" facs="180"/>
any one, whose Conduct and Character is not, by
their Means, an Object, to every one, of Censure
or Approbation. On the contrary those other Pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions,
commonly denominated selfish, both produce
different Sentiments in each Individual, according to
his particular Situation; and also contemplate the
greatest Part of Mankind with the utmost Indiffe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rence
and Unconcern. Whoever has a high Regard
and Esteem for me flatters my Vanity; whoever
expresses Contempt mortifies and displeases me: But
as my Name is known but to a small Part of Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kind,
there are few, that come within the Sphere of
this Passion, or excite, on its Account, either my
Affection or Disgust. But if you represent a tyran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nical,
insolent, or barbarous Behaviour, in any
Country or in any Age of the World; I soon carry
my Eye to the pernicious Tendency of such a Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duct,
and feel the Sentiments of Repugnance and
Displeasure towards it. No Character can be so re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mote
as to be, in this Light, altogether indifferent
to me. What is beneficial to Society or to the
Person himself must still be prefer'd. And every
Quality or Action, of every human Being, must,
by this Means, be rank'd under some Class or
Denomination, expressive of general Censure or
Applause.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="181"/>
WHAT more, therefore, can we ask to distinguish
the Sentiments, dependant on Humanity, from those
<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 span" rend="content:〈…〉">
                     <desc>illegible</desc>
                  </gap> any other Passion, or to satisfy us

                  </gap> Humanity, procures also the Ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plause
o<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">
                     <desc>illegible</desc>
                  </gap> all Mankind, by affecting the same Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciple

                     <desc>illegible</desc>
                  </gap>. But what serves my Avarice or Am<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bition
pleases only these Passions in me, and affects
not the Avarice or Ambition of the rest of Mankind.
No Conduct, in any Man. which has a beneficial
Tendency, but is agreeable to my Humanity, how<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever
remote the Person: But every Man, so far re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mov'd
as neither to cross nor serve my Avarice and
Ambition, is altogether indifferent to those Passions.
The Distinction, therefore, betwixt those different
Species of Sentiment being so strong and evident,
Language must soon be moulded upon it, and must
invent a peculiar Set of Terms to express those uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versal
Sentiments of Censure or Approbation, which
arise from Humanity or from Views of general Use<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fulness
and its contrary. VIRTUE and VICE
become then known: Morals are recogniz'd: Cer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain
general Ideas are fram'd of human Conduct and
Behaviour: Such Measures are expected from Men,
in such Situations: This Action is determin'd con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formable
<pb n="181" facs="182"/>
to our abstract Rule; that other, contrary.
And by such universal Principles are the particular
Sentiments of Self-love frequently controul'd and
limited<note place="bottom" n="*">It seems certain, both from Reason and Experience, that a rude, untaught Savage regulates chiefly his Love and Hatred by the Ideas of private Utility and Injury, and has but faint Conceptions of a general Rule or System of Behaviour. The Man, who stands opposite to him in Battle, he hates heartily, not only for the pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent Moment, which is almost unavoidable, but for ever after; not is he satisfy'd without the most extreme Punishment and Vengeance. But we, accustom'd to Society and to more enlarg'd Reflections, consider, that this Man is serving his own Country and Community; that any Man, in the same Situation, would do the same; that we ourselves, in like Circumstances, observe a like Conduct; that in general human Society is best supported on such Maxims: And by these Suppositions and Views, we correct, in some Measure, our ruder and narrower Passions. And tho' much of our Friendship and Enmity be still regulated by private Considerations of Benefit and Harm, we pay, at least, this Homage to general Rules, which we are accustom'd to respect, that we commonly pervert our Adversary's Conduct, by imputing Malice or Injustice to him, in order to give Vent to those Passions, which arise from Self-love and private In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terest. When the Heart is full of Rage, it never wants Pretexts of this Nature; tho' sometimes as frivolous, as those, from which <hi>Horace,</hi> being almost crush'd by the Fall of a Tree, affects to ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cuse of Parricide the first Planter of it.</note>.</p>
               <p>FROM Instances of popular Tumults, Seditions,
Factions, Panics, and all Passions, which are shar'd
with a Multitude; we may learn the Influence of
Society, in exciting and supporting any Emotion;
<pb n="182" facs="183"/>
while the most ungovernable Disorders are rais'd,
we find, by that Means, from the slightest and most
frivolous Occasions. <hi>Solon</hi> was no very cruel, tho',
perhaps, an unjust Legislator, who punish'd Neuters
in civil Wars; and few, I believe, would, in such
Cases, incur the Penalty, were their Affection and
Discourse allow'd sufficient to absolve them. No
Selfishness, and scarce any Philosophy, has there
Force sufficient to support a total Coolness and Indif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ference;
and he must be more or less than Man,
who kindles not in the common Blaze. What Won<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der,
then, that moral Sentiments are found of such
Influence in Life; tho' springing from Principles,
which may appear, at first Sight, somewhat small
and delicate? But these Principles, we must remark,
are social and universal: They form, in a Manner,
the <hi>Party</hi> of Human-kind against Vice or Disorder,
its common Enemy: And as the benevolent Concern
for others is diffus'd, in a greater or less Degree,
over all Men, and is the same in all, it occurs more
frequently in Discourse, is foster'd by Society and
Conversation, and the Blame and Approbation,
consequent on it, are thereby rouz'd from that Le<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thargy,
into which they are probably lull'd, in so<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>litary
and uncultivated Nature. Other Passions, tho'
perhaps originally stronger, yet being selfish and
private, are often over-power'd by its Force, and
<pb n="183" facs="184"/>
yield the Dominion of our Breast to those social and
public Principles.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER Spring of our Constitution, that brings
great Addition of Force to moral Sentiment, is, the
Love of Fame; which rules, with such uncontrol'd
Authority, in all generous Minds, and is often the
grand Object of all their Designs and Undertakings.
By our continual and earnest Pursuit of a Character,
a Name, a Reputation in the World, we bring our
own Deportment and Conduct frequently in Review,
and consider how they appear in the Eyes of those,
who approach and regard us. This constant Habit
of surveying ourself, as it were, in Reflexion, keeps
alive all the Sentiments of Right and Wrong, and
begets, in noble Natures, a certain Reverence for
themselves as well as others; which is the surest
Guardian of every Virtue. The animal Conve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niencies
and Pleasures sink gradually in their Value;
while every inward Beauty and moral Grace is studi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ously
acquir'd, and the Mind is accomplish'd in each
Perfection, that can adorn or embellish a rational
Creature.</p>
               <p>HERE is the most perfect Morality we are ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quainted
with: Here is display'd the Force of many
Sympathies. Our moral Sentiment is itself a Feeling
chiefly of that Nature: And our Regard to a Cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racter
<pb n="184" facs="185"/>
with others seems to arise only from a Care of
preserving a Character with ourselves, in order to
which we find it necessary to prop our tottering
Judgment on the correspondent Approbation of
Mankind.</p>
               <p>BUT in order to accommodate Matters, and re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>move,
if possible, every Difficulty, let us allow all
these Reasonings to be false. Let us allow, that
when we resolve the Pleasure, that arises from Views
of Utility, into the Sentiments of Humanity and
Sympathy, we have embrac'd a wrong Hypothesis.
Let us confess it necessary to find some other Expli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cation
of that Applause, which is paid to all Ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jects,
whether inanimate, animate or rational, if
they have a Tendency to promote the Welfare and
Advantage of others. However difficult it be to
conceive, that an Object is approv'd of, on Account
of its Tendency to a certain End, while the End
itself is totally indifferent; let us swallow this Ab<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>surdity,
and consider what are the Consequences.
The preceding Delineation or Definition of VIRTUE
must still retain its Evidence and Authority: It must
still be allow'd, that every Quality of the Mind,
which is <hi>useful</hi> or <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>Person himself</hi> or to
<hi>others,</hi> communicates a Pleasure to the Spectator,
engages his Esteem, and is admitted under the ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nourable
Denomination of Virtue or Merit. Are
<pb n="185" facs="186"/>
not Justice, Fidelity, Honour, Veracity, Allegiance,
Chastity esteem'd solely on Account of their Ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dency
to promote the Good of Society? Is not that
Tendency inseperable from Humanity, Benevolence,
Lenity, Generosity, Gratitude, Moderation, Ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derness,
Friendship, and all the other social Vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tues?
Can it possibly be doubted, that Industry,
Discretion, Frugality, Secrecy, Order, Perseverance,
Forethought, Judgment, and that whole Class of
Virtues, of which many Pages would not contain
the Catalogue; can it be be doubted, I say, that
the Tendency of these Virtues to promote the In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terest
and Happiness of their Possessor is the sole
Foundation of their Merit? Who can dispute that
a Mind, which supports a perpetual Serenity and
Cheerfulness, a noble Dignity and undaunted Spirit,
a tender Affection and Good-will to all around; as
it has more Enjoyment within itself, is also a
more animating and rejoicing Spectacle, than if de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jected
with Melancholy, tormented with Anxiety,
irritated with Rage, or sunk into the most abject
Baseness and Degeneracy? And as to the Qualities,
immediately <hi>agreeable to others,</hi> they speak sufficiently
for themselves; and he must be unhappy, indeed,
either in his own Temper, or in his Situation and
Circumstances, who has never perceiv'd the Charms
of a facetious Wit or flowing Affability, of a delicate
<pb n="186" facs="187"/>
Modesty or decent Genteelness of Address and Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner.</p>
               <p>I AM sensible, that nothing can be more unphilo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sophical
than to be positive or dogmatical on any
Subject; and that, even if <hi>excessive</hi> Scepticism could
be maintain'd, it would not be more destructive to
all just Reasoning and Enquiry. I am convinc'd,
that, where Men are the must sure and arrogant, they
are commonly the most mistaken, and have there
given Reins to Passion, without that proper Delibera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
and Suspence, which can alone secure them from
the grossest Absurdities. Yet I must confess, that
this Enumeration puts the Matter in so strong a
Light, that I cannot, <hi>at present,</hi> be more assur'd of
any Truth, which I learn from Reasoning and Ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gument,
than that Virtue consists altogether in the
Usefulness or Agreeableness of Qualities to the
Person himself, possest of them, or to others, who
have any Intercourse with him. But when I reflect,
that, tho' the Bulk and Figure of the Earth have
been measur'd and delineated, tho' the Motions of the
Tides have been accounted for, the Order and
Oeconomy of the heavenly Bodies subjected to their
proper Laws, and INFINITE itself reduc'd to
Calculation; yet Men still dispute concerning the
Foundation of their moral Duties: When I reflect
on this, I say, I fall back into Diffidence and Scep<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticism,
<pb n="187" facs="188"/>
and suspect, that an Hypothesis, so obvious▪
had it been a true one, would, long 'ere now, have
been receiv'd, by the unanimous Suffrage and Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent
of Mankind.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>PART II.</head>
               <p>THERE remains nothing, but to consider
briefly our <hi>Obligation</hi> to Virtue, and to en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quire,
whether every Man, who has any Regard to
his own Happiness and Welfare, will not best find
his Account in the Practice of every moral Duty. If
this can be clearly ascertain'd from the foregoing
Theory, we shall have the Satisfaction to reflect,
that we have advanc'd Principles, which not only,
'tis hop'd, will stand the Test of Reasoning and
Enquiry, but may contribute to the Amendment of
Men's Lives, and their Improvement in Morality
and social Virtue. And tho' the philosophical Truth
of any Proposition by no Means depends on its
Tendency to promote the Interest of Society; yet a
Man has but a bad Grace, who delivers a Theory,
however true, which, he must confess, leads to a
Practice, dangerous and pernicious. Why rake into
those Corners of Nature, which spread a Nuisance
all around? Why dig up the Pestilence from the
Pit, in which it is bury'd? The Ingenuity of your
<pb n="188" facs="189"/>
Researches may be admir'd; but your Systems will
be detested: And Mankind will agree, if they can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not
refute them, to sink them, at least, in eternal
Silence and Oblivion: Truths, which are <hi>pernicious</hi>
to Society, if any such there be, will yield to Errors,
which are salutary and <hi>advantageous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT what philosophical Truths can be more ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantageous
to Society, than those here deliver'd,
which represent Virtue in all her genuine and most
engaging Charms, and make us approach her with
Ease, Familiarity and Affection? The dismal Dress
falls off, with which many Divines, and some Philo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sophers
had cover'd her; and nothing appears but
Gentleness, Humanity, Beneficence, Affability; nay
even, at proper Intervals, Play, Frolic, and Gaiety.
She talks not of useless Austerities and Rigors, Suf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferance
and Self-denial. She declares, that her sole
Purpose is, to make her Votaries and all Mankind,
during every Instant of their Existence, if possible,
cheerful and happy; nor does she ever willingly part
with any Pleasure but in Hopes of ample Compen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sation
in some other Period of their Lives. The sole
Trouble she demands is that of just Calculation, and
a steady Preference of the greater Happiness. And
if any austere Pretenders approach her, Enemies to
Joy and Pleasure, she either rejects them as Hypo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>crites
and Deceivers, or if she admits them in her
<pb n="189" facs="190"/>
Train, they are rank'd, however, among the least
favour'd of her Votaries.</p>
               <p>AND indeed, to drop all figurative Expression,
what Hopes can we ever have of engaging Mankind
to a Practice, which we confess full of Austerity and
Rigour? Or what Morality can ever serve any use<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful
Purpose, unless it can show, by a particular Detail,
that all the Duties it recommends, are also the true
Interest of each Individual? And the peculiar Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantage
of the foregoing Theory, seems to be, that
it furnishes proper Mediums for that Purpose.</p>
               <p>THAT the Virtues, which are immediately <hi>useful</hi>
or <hi>agreeable</hi> to the Person, possest of them, are de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sirable
in a View to Self-interest, it would surely be
superfluous to prove. Moralists, indeed, may spare
themselves all the Pains they often take in recom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mending
these Duties. To what Purpose collect
Arguments to evince, that Temperance is advanta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>geous,
and the Excesses of Pleasure hurtful? When
it appears, that these Excesses are only denominated
such, because they are hurtful; and that, if the un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>limited
Use of strong Liquors, for Instance, no
more impair'd Health or the Faculties of the Mind
and Body than the Use of Air or Water, it would
not be a whit more vicious or blameable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="191"/>
IT seems equally superfluous to prove, that the
<hi>companionable</hi> Virtues of Good-manners and Wit,
Decency and Genteelness are more desirable than
the contrary Qualities. Vanity alone, without other
Considerations, is a sufficient Motive to make us
wish the Possession of these Accomplishments. No
Man was ever willingly deficient in this Particular.
All our Failures here proceed from bad Education,
Want of Capacity, or a perverse and unpliable Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position.
Would you have your Company coveted,
admir'd, follow'd; rather than hated, despis'd,
avoided? Can any one seriously deliberate in the
Case? As no Enjoyment is sincere, without some
Reference to Company and Society; so no Society
can be agreeable or even tolerable, where a Man
feels his Presence unwelcome, and discovers all
around him Symptoms of Aversion and Disgust.</p>
               <p>BUT why, in the greater Society or Confederacy
of Mankind, should not the Case be the same as in
particular Clubs and Companies? Why is it more
doubtful, that the enlarg'd Virtues of Humanity,
Generosity, Beneficence are desirable with a View
to Happiness and Self-interest, than the limited En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dowments
of Ingenuity and Politeness? Are we
apprehensive, that those social Affections have a
greater and more immediate Interference, than any
<pb n="191" facs="192"/>
other Pursuits, with private Utility, and cannot be
gratify'd without some important Sacrifices of Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour
and Advantage? If so, we are but ill instructed
in the Nature of the human Passions, and are more
influenc'd by verbal Distinctions than by real Dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferences.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER Contradiction, may vulgarly be sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pos'd
betwixt the <hi>social</hi> and <hi>selfish</hi> Sentiments or Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>positions,
they are really no more opposite than
selfish and ambitious, selfish and revengeful, selfish
and vain. 'Tis requisite there be an original Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pensity
of some Kind, in order to be a Basis to Self-love,
by giving a Relish to the Objects of its Pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>suit;
and none more fit for this Purpose than Bene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficence
or Humanity. The Goods of Fortune are
spent in one Gratification or other: The Miser, who
accumulates his annual Income, and lends it out at
Interest, has really spent it in the Gratification of
his Avarice. And 'twould be difficult to show, why
a Man is more a Loser by a generous Action, than
by any other Method of Expence; since the utmost
he can attain, by the most elaborate Selfishness, is
the Indulgence of some Affection.</p>
               <p>NOW if Life, without Passion, must be altogether
insipid and tiresome; let a Man suppose he has full
Power of modelling his own Disposition, and let
<pb n="192" facs="193"/>
him deliberate what Appetite or Desire he would
choose for the Foundation of his Happiness and
Enjoyment. Every Affection, he would observe,
when gratify'd by Success, gives a Satisfaction, pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>portion'd
to its Force and Violence; but besides this
Advantage, common to all, the immediate Feeling
of Benevolence and Friendship, Humanity and
Kindness, is sweet, smooth, tender, and agreeable,
independent of all Fortune and Accidents. These
Virtues are besides attended with a pleasing Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sciousness
and Remembrance, and keep us in Hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mour
with ourselves as well as others; while we re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain
the agreeable Reflection of having done our
Part towards Mankind and Society. And tho' all
Men show a Jealousy of our Success in the Pursuits
of Avarice or Ambition; yet are we almost sure of
their Good-will and Good-wishes, so long as we
persevere in the Paths of Virtue, and employ our<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves
in the Execution of generous Plans and Pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poses.
What other Passion is there, where we shall
find so many Advantages united; an agreeable Sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timent,
a pleasing Consciousness, a good Reputa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion?
But of these Truths, we may observe, Men
are, of themselves, pretty much convinc'd; nor are
they deficient in their Duty to Society, because they
would not wish to be generous, friendly, and hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mane;
but because they do not feel themselves such.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="194"/>
TREATING Vice with the greatest Candour, and
making it all possible Concessions, we must acknow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge,
that there is not, in any Instance, the smallest
Pretext for giving it the Preference above Virtue,
with a View to Self-interest; except, perhaps, in
the Case of Justice, where a Man, taking Things
in a certain Light, may often seem to be a Loser by
his Integrity. And tho' 'tis acknowledg'd, that,
without a Regard to Property, no Society could
subsist; yet according to the imperfect Way, in which
human Affairs are conducted, a sensible Knave, in
particular Incidents, may think, that an Act of Ini<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quity
or Infidelity will make a considerable Addition
to his Fortune, without causing any considerable
Breach in the social Union and Confederacy. That
<hi>Honesty is the best Policy,</hi> may be a good general
Rule; but is liable to many Exceptions: And he,
it may, perhaps, be judg'd, conducts himself with
most Wisdom, who observes the general Rule, and
takes Advantage of all the Exceptions.</p>
               <p>I MUST confess, that if a Man thinks, that this
Reasoning much requires an Answer, 'twill be a
little difficult to find any, that will to him appear
satisfactory and convincing. If his Heart does not
rebel against such pernicious Maxims, if he feels no
<pb n="194" facs="195"/>
Reluctance to the Thoughts of Villainy or Baseness,
he has indeed lost a considerable Motive to Virtue;
and we may expect, that his Practice will be an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swerable
to his Speculation. But in all ingenuous
Natures, the Antipathy to Treachery and Roguery
is too strong to be counter-ballanc'd by any Views of
Profit or pecuniary Advantage. Inward Peace of
Mind, Consciousness of Integrity, a satisfactory Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>view
of our own Conduct; these are Circumstances
very requisite to Happiness, and will be cherish'd and
cultivated by every honest Man, who feels the Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>portance
of them.</p>
               <p>SUCH a one has, besides, the frequent Satisfaction
of seeing Knaves, with all their pretended Cunning
and Ability, betray'd by their own Maxims; and
while they purpose to cheat only with Moderation
and Secrecy, a tempting Incident occurs, Nature is
frail, and they give into the Snare; whence they can
never extricate themselves, without a total Loss of
Reputation, and the Forfeiture of all future Trust
and Confidence with Mankind.</p>
               <p>BUT were they ever so secret and successful, the
honest Man, if he has any Tincture of Philosophy,
or even common Observation and Reflection, will
discover, that they themselves are, in the End, the
greatest Dupes, and have sacrific'd the invaluable
<pb n="195" facs="196"/>
Enjoyment of a Character, with themselves at least,
for the Acquisition of worthless Toys and Gewgaws.
How little is requisite to supply the <hi>Necessities</hi> of Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture?
And in the View of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> what Compa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rison
betwixt the unbought Satisfactions of Conver<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sation,
Society, Study, even Health and the common
Beauties of Nature, but especially the peaceful Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>flection
on one's own Conduct: What Comparison,
I say, betwixt these, and the feverish, empty Amuse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments
of Luxury and Expence? These natural Plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sures,
indeed, are really without Price; both because
they are below all Price in their Attainment, and
above it in their Enjoyment.</p>

            <head type="sub">Concerning moral SENTIMENT.</head>
            <p>IF the foregoing Hypothesis be receiv'd, 'twill
now be easy for us to determine the Question first
stated<note place="bottom" n="*">Sect. I.</note>, concerning the general Principles of Morals;
and tho' we postpon'd the Decision of that Question,
lest it should then involve us in intricate Speculations,
which are totally unfit for moral Discourses, we may
resume it at present, and examine how far either
<hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Sentiment</hi> enters into all moral Determi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nations.</p>
            <p>THE chief Foundation of moral Praise being sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pos'd
to lie in the Usefulness of any Quality or
Action; 'tis evident, that <hi>Reason</hi> must enter for a
considerable Share in all Determinations of this
Kind; since nothing but that Faculty can instruct us
in the Tendency of Qualities and Actions, and point
<pb n="198" facs="198"/>
out their beneficial Consequences to Society and to
their Possessors. In many Cases, this is an Affair
liable to great Controversy: Doubts may arise; op<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posite
Interests occur; and a Preference must be
given to one Side, from very nice Views and a small
Overballance of Utility. This is particularly re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>markable
in Questions with regard to Justice; as is,
indeed, natural to suppose from that Species of Uti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lity,
which attends this Virtue<note place="bottom" n="*">See Appendix II.</note>. Were every single
Instance of Justice, like that of Benevolence, bene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficial
and useful to Society; this would be a more
simple State of the Case, and seldom liable to great
Controversy. But as single Instances of Justice are
often pernicious, in their first and immediate Ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dency,
and as the Advantage to Society results only
from the Observance of the general Rule, and from
the Concurrence and Combination of several Persons
in the same equitable Conduct; the Case here be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>comes
more intricate and involv'd. The various Cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstances
of Society; the various Consequences of
any Practice; the various Interests, which may be
propos'd: These on many Occasions are doubtful,
and subject to great Discussion and Enquiry.
The Object of municipal Laws is to fix all
Questions with regard to Justice: The Debates of
Civilians; the Reflections of Politicians; the Pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cedents
<pb n="199" facs="199"/>
of Histories and public Records, are all
directed to the same Purpose. And a very accurate
<hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Judgment</hi> is often requisite, to give the true
Determination, amidst such intricate Doubts arising
from obscure or opposite Utilities.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' Reason, when fully assisted and improv'd,
be sufficient to instruct us in the pernicious or useful
Tendencies of Qualities and Actions; it is not alone
sufficient to produce any moral Blame or Approba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion.
Utility is only a Tendency to a certain End;
and were the End totally indifferent to us, we should
feel the same Indifference towards the Means. 'Tis
requisite a <hi>Sentiment</hi> should here display itself, in order
to give a Preference to the useful above the perni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cious
Tendencies. This Sentiment can be no other
than a Feeling for the Happiness of Mankind, and
a Resentment of their Misery; since these are the
different Ends, which Virtue and Vice have a Ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dency
to promote. Here therefore, <hi>Reason</hi> instructs
us in the several Tendencies of Actions, and <hi>Huma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity</hi>
makes a Distinction in favour of those, which
are useful and beneficial.</p>
            <p>THIS Partition betwixt the Faculties of Under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>standing
and Sentiment, in all moral Decisions,
seems clear from the preceding Hypothesis. But I
shall suppose that Hypothesis false: 'Twill then be
<pb n="200" facs="200"/>
requisite to look out for some other Theory, that
may be satisfactory; and I dare venture to affirm,
that none such will ever be found, as long as we
suppose Reason to be the sole Source of Morals. To
prove this, it will be proper to weigh the five follow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
Considerations.</p>
            <p>I. 'Tis easy for a false Hypothesis to maintain
some Appearance of Truth, while it keeps altoge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
in Generals, makes use of undefin'd Terms, and
employs Comparisons, instead of Instances. This
is particularly remarkable in that Philosophy, which
ascribes the Discernment of all moral Distinctions to
Reason alone without the Concurrence of Sentiment.
'Tis impossible, in any particular Instance, that this
Hypothesis can so much as be render'd intelligible;
whatever specious Figure it may make in general
Declamations and Discourses. Examine the Crime
of <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> for Instance; which has Place,
wherever we observe Good-will, exprest and known,
along with Good-offices perform'd, on the one Side,
and a Return of Ill-will or Indifference, with Ill-offices
or Neglect, on the other: Anatomize all
these Circumstances, and examine, by your Reason
alone, wherein consists the Demerit or Blame: You
never will come to any Issue or Conclusion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="201"/>
REASON judges either of <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> or of <hi>Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lations.</hi>
Enquire then, <hi>first,</hi> where is that Matter of
Fact, which we here call <hi>Crime;</hi> point it out; de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>termine
the Time of its Existence; describe its
Essence or Nature; explain the Sense or Faculty, to
which it discovers itself. It resides in the Mind of
the Person, who is ungrateful. He must, therefore,
feel it and be conscious of it. But nothing is there,
except the Passion of Ill-will or absolute Indifference.
You cannot say, that these, of themselves, always,
and in all Circumstances, are Crimes. No: They
are only Crimes, when directed towards Persons,
who have before exprest and display'd Good-will
towards us. Consequently, we may infer, that the
Crime of Ingratitude is not any particular individual
<hi>Fact;</hi> but arises from a Complication of Circum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stances,
which, being presented to the Spectator,
excites the <hi>Sentiment</hi> of Blame, by the particular
Structure and Fabric of his Mind.</p>
            <p>THIS Representation, you say, is false. Crime,
indeed, consists not in a particular <hi>Fact,</hi> of whose
Reality we are assur'd by <hi>Reason:</hi> But it consists in
certain <hi>moral Relations,</hi> discoverable by Reason, in
the same Manner as we discover, by Reason, the
Truths of Geometry or Algebra. But what are
the Relations, I ask, of which you here talk? In
<pb n="202" facs="202"/>
the Case stated above, I see first Good-will and Good-offices,
in one Person; then Ill-will and Ill-offices
in the other: Betwixt these, there is the Relation
of <hi>Contrariety.</hi> Does the Crime consist in that Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lation?
But suppose a Person bore me Ill-will or
did me Ill-offices; and I, in return, were indifferent
towards him, or did him Good-offices: Here is the
same Relation of <hi>Contrariety;</hi> and yet my Conduct
is highly laudable. Twist and turn this Matter, as
much as you will, you can never rest the Morality
on Relation; but must have Recourse to the Deci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions
of Sentiment.</p>
            <p>WHEN 'tis affirm'd, that two and three are equal
to the half of ten; this Relation of Equality, I
understand perfectly. I conceive, that if ten be di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vided
into two Parts, of which one had as many
Unites as the other; and if any of these Parts be
compar'd to two added to three, it will contain as
many Unites as that compound Number. But when
you draw thence a Comparison to moral Relations,
I own, I am altogether at a loss to understand you.
A moral Action, a Crime, such as Ingratitude, is a
complicated Object. Does the Morality consist in
the Relation of its Parts to each other. How?
After what Manner? Specify the Relation: Be
more particular and explicite in your Propositions;
and you will easily see their Falshood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="203"/>
NO, say you, the Morality consists in the Relation
of Action to the Rule of Right; and they are de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nominated
good or ill, according as they agree or
disagree with it. What then is this Rule of Right?
Wherein does it consist? How is it determin'd?
By Reason, you'll say, which examines the moral
Relations of Actions. So that moral Relations are
determin'd by the Comparison of Actions to a Rule.
And the Role is determin'd by considering the
moral Relations of Objects. Is not this fine Rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>soning?</p>
            <p>ALL this is Metaphysics, you cry. That is
enough: There needs nothing more to give a strong
Presumption of Falshood. Yes, reply I: Here are
Metaphysics surely: But they are all on your Side,
who advance an abstruse Hypothesis, which can
never be made intelligible, nor quadrate to any par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticular
Instance or Illustration. The Hypothesis we
embrace is plain. It maintains, that Morality is de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>termin'd
by Sentiment. It defines Virtue to be,
<hi>whatever mental Action or Quality gives to a Spectator
the pleasing Sentiment of Approbation;</hi> and Vice the
contrary. We then proceed to examine a plain
Matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> what Actions have this Influ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence:
We consider all the Circumstances, in which
these Actions agree: And from thence endeavour to
<pb n="204" facs="204"/>
extract some general Observations with regard to
these Sentiments. If you call this Metaphysics, and
find any thing abstruse here, you need only conclude,
that your Turn of Mind is not suited to the moral
Sciences.</p>
            <p>II. WHEN a Man, at any Time, deliberates con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerning
his own Conduct, (as, whether he had
better, in a particular Emergence, assist a Brother or
a Benefactor) he must consider these separate Rela<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions,
with the whole Circumstances and Situation
of the Persons, in order to determine his superior
Duty and Obligation: And in order to determine
the Proportion of Lines in any Triangle, 'tis ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessary
to examine the Nature of that Figure, and
the Relations, which its several Parts bear to each
other. But notwithstanding this apparent Similarity
in the two Cases, there is, at the bottom, an ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>treme
Difference betwixt them. A speculative
Reasoner concerning Triangles or Circles considers
the several known and given Relations of the Parts
of these Figures; and from thence infers some un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>known
Relation, which is dependent on the former.
But in moral Deliberations, we must be acquainted,
before-hand, with all the Objects, and all their Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lations
to each other; and from a Comparison of
the whole, fix our Choice or Approbation. No new
Fact to be ascertain'd: No new Relation to be
<pb n="205" facs="205"/>
discover'd. The whole Circumstances of the Case
are suppos'd to be laid before us, 'ere we can fix any
Sentence of Blame or Approbation. If any material
Circumstance by yet unknown or doubtful, we must
first employ our Enquiry or intellectual Faculties to
assure us of it; and suspend for a Time all moral
Decision or Sentiment. While we are ignorant,
whether a Man was Aggressor or not, how can we
determine, whether the person, who kill'd him, be
criminal or innocent? But after every Circumstance,
every Relation is known, the Understanding has no
farther Room to operate, nor any Object, on which
it could employ itself. The Approbation or Blame,
which then ensues, cannot be the Work of the Judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,
but of the Heart, and is not a speculative Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position
or Affirmation, but an active Feeling or Sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timent.
In the Disquisitions of the Understanding,
from known Circumstances and Relations, we infer
some new and unknown. In moral Decisions, the
whole Circumstances and Relations must be ante<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cedently
known; and the Mind, from the Contem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plation
of the Whole, feels some new Impression of
Affection of Disgust, Esteem or Contempt, Appro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bation
or Blame.</p>
            <p>HENCE the great Difference betwixt a Mistake of
<hi>Fact</hi> and one of <hi>Right;</hi> and hence the Reason, why
the one is commonly criminal and not the other.
<pb n="206" facs="206"/>
When <hi>OEdipus</hi> kill'd <hi>Laius,</hi> he was ignorant of the
Relation, and from Circumstances, innocent and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>voluntary,
form'd erroneous Opinions concerning
the Action he committed. But when <hi>Nero</hi> kill'd
<hi>Agrippina,</hi> all the Relations betwixt himself and the
person, and all the Circumstances of the Fact were
antecedently known to him: But the Motive of Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venge,
or Fear or Interest, in his savage Heart, pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vail'd
over the Sentiments of Duty and Humanity.
And when we express a Detestation against him, to
which he, himself, in a little Time, became insen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sible;
'tis not, that we see any Relations, of which
he was ignorant, but that, from the Rectitude of
our Disposition, we feel Sentiments, against which
he was harden'd, from Flattery and a long Perseve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rance
in the most enormous Crimes. In these Sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timents,
then, not in a Discovery of Relations of
any Kind, do all moral Determinations consist.
Before we can pretend to form any Decision of this
kind, every Thing must be known and ascertain'd
on the Side of the Object or Action. Nothing re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mains
but to feel, on our Part, some Sentiment of
Blame or Approbation, whence we pronounce the
Action criminal or virtuous.</p>
            <p>III. THIS Doctrine will become still more evident,
if we compare moral Beauty with natural, to which,
in many Particulars, it bears so near a Resemblance.
<pb n="207" facs="207"/>
'Tis on the Proportion, Relation, and Position of
Parts, that all natural Beauty depends; but 'twould
be absurd thence to infer, that the Perception of
Beauty, like that of Truth in geometrical Problems,
consists altogether in the Perception of Relations,
and was perform'd entirely by the Understanding or
intellectual Faculties. In all the Sciences, our
Mind, from the known Relations, investigates the
unknown: But in all Decisions of Taste or external
Beauty, the whole Relations are before-hand obvious
to the Eye, and we thence proceed to feel a Senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
of Complacency or Disgust, according to the
Nature of the Object, and Disposition of our Or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gans.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>EUCLID</hi> has fully explain'd all the Qualities
of the Circle; but has not, in any Proposition, said
a Word of its Beauty. The Reason is evident. The
Beauty is not a Quality of the Circle. It lies not in
any Part of the Line, whose Parts are all equally
distant from a common Center. It is only the Effect,
which that Figure operates upon the Mind, whose
peculiar Fabric or Structure renders it susceptible of
such Sentiments. In vain, would you look for it in
the Circle, or seek it, either by your Senses or by
mathematical Reasonings, in all the Properties of
that Figure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="208"/>
ATTEND to <hi>Palladio</hi> and <hi>Perrault,</hi> while they ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plain
all the Parts and Proportions of a Pillar: They
talk of the Cornice and Freeze and Base and Enta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blature
and Shaft and Architrave; and give the De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scription
and Position of each of these Members.
But should you ask the Description and Position of
its Beauty, they would readily reply, that the Beauty
is not any of the Parts or Members of a Pillar, but
results from the Whole, when that complicated Fi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gure
is presented to an intelligent Mind, susceptible
of those finer Sensations. Till such a Spectator ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pear,
there is nothing but a Figure of such particular
Dimensions and Proportions: From his Sentiments
alone arises its Elegance and Beauty.</p>
            <p>AGAIN; attend to <hi>Cicero,</hi> while he paints the
Crimes of a <hi>Verres</hi> or a <hi>Catiline;</hi> you must acknow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge,
that the moral Turpitude results, in the same
Manner, from the Contemplation of the Whole,
when presented to a Being, whose Organs have such
a particular Structure and Formation. The Orator
may paint Rage, Insolence, Barbarity on the one
Side: Meekness, Sufferance, Sorrow, Innocence on
the other: But if you feel no Indignation or Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>passion
arise in you from this Complication of Cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstances,
you would in vain ask him, wherein
consist, the Crime or Villainy, which he so vehe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mently
<pb n="209" facs="209"/>
exclaims against: At what Time, or on what
Subject it first began to exist: And what has a few
Months afterwards become of it, when every Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position
and Thought of all the Actors is totally
alter'd or annihilated. No satisfactory Answer can
be given to any of these Questions, upon the abstract
Hypothesis of Morals; and we must at last acknow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge,
that the Crime or Immorality is no particular
Fact or Relation, which can be the Object of the
Understanding: But arises altogether from the Sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timent
of Disapprobation, which, by the Structure
of human Nature, we unavoidably feel on the Ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prehension
of Barbarity or Treachery.</p>
            <p>IV. INANIMATE Objects may bear to each other
all the same Relations, which we observe in moral
Agents; tho' the former can never be the Object of
Love or Hatred, nor are consequently susceptible of
Merit or Iniquity. A young Tree, that over-tops
or destroys its Parent, from whose Seed it sprung,
stands in all the same Relations with <hi>Nero,</hi> when he
murder'd <hi>Agrippina;</hi> and if Morality consisted in any
abstract Relations, would, no doubt, be equally
criminal.</p>
            <p>V. IT appears evident, that the ultimate Ends of
human Actions can never, in any Case, be accounted
for by <hi>Reason,</hi> but recommend themselves entirely to
<pb n="210" facs="210"/>
the Sentiments and Affections of Mankind, without
any Dependance on the intellectual Faculties. Ask
a Man, <hi>why he uses Exercise;</hi> he will answer, <hi>because
he desires to keep his Health.</hi> If you then enquire, <hi>why
he desires Health,</hi> he will readily reply, <hi>because Sickness
is painful.</hi> If you push your Enquiries farther, and
desire a Reason, <hi>why he hates Pain,</hi> 'tis impossible he
can ever give any. This is an ultimate End, and is
never refer'd to any other Object.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS, to your second Question, <hi>why he desires
Health,</hi> he may also reply, that <hi>'tis requisite for the
Exercise of his Calling.</hi> If you ask, <hi>why he is anxious
on that head,</hi> he will answer, <hi>because he desires to get
Money.</hi> If you demand, <hi>Why? It is the Instrument
of Pleasure,</hi> says he. And beyond this, 'tis an Ab<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>surdity
to ask for a Reason. 'Tis impossible there
can be a Progress <hi>in infinitum;</hi> and that one Thing
can always be the Reason, why another is desir'd.
Something must be desirable on its own Account, and
because of its immediate Accord or Agreement with
human Sentiment and Affection.</p>
            <p>NOW as Virtue is an End, and is desirable on its
own Account, without Fee or Reward, merely for
the immediate Satisfaction it conveys; 'tis requisite
there should be some Sentiment, which it touches;
some internal Taste or Feeling, or whatever you
<pb n="211" facs="211"/>
please to call it, which distinguishes moral Good and
Evil, and which embraces the one and rejects the
other.</p>
            <p>THUS the distinct Boundaries and Offices of <hi>Reason</hi>
and <hi>Taste</hi> are easily ascertain'd. The former conveys
the Knowledge of Truth and Falshood: The latter
gives the Sentiment of Beauty and Deformity,
Vice and Virtue. The one discovers Objects, as
they really stand in Nature, without Addition or
Diminution: The other has a productive Faculty,
and guilding or staining all natural Objects with the
Colours, borrow'd from internal Sentiment, raises
in a Manner, a new Creation. Reason, being cool
and disengag'd, is no Motive to Action, and directs
only the Impulse, receiv'd from Appetite or Inclina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
by showing us the Means of obtaining Happi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
or avoiding Misery: Taste, as it gives Pleasure
or Pain, and thereby constitutes Happiness or Misery,
becomes a Motive to Action, and is the first Spring
or Impulse to Desire and Volition. From Circum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stances
and Relations, known or suppos'd, the for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mer
leads us to the Discovery of the conceal'd and
unknown: After all Circumstances and Relations
are laid before us, the latter makes us feel from the
Whole a new Sentiment of Blame or Approbation.
The Standard of the one, being founded on the Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture
of Things, is eternal and inflexible, even by
<pb n="212" facs="212"/>
the Will of the Supreme Being: The Standard of the
other, arising from the internal Frame and Constitu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
of Animals, is ultimately deriv'd from that Su<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>preme
Will, who bestow'd on each being its peculiar
Nature, and arrang'd the several Classes and Orders
of Existence.</p>

            <head type="sub">Some farther Considerations with regard to
JUSTICE.</head>
            <p>THE Intention of this Appendix is to give
some more particular Explication of the Ori<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gin
and Nature of Justice, and mark some Diffe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rences
betwixt it and the other Virtues.</p>
            <p>THE social Virtues of Humanity and Benevolence
exert their Influence immediately, by a direct Ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dency
or Instinct, which keeps chiefly in View the
simple Object, that moves the Affections, and com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prehends
not any Scheme or System, nor the Conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quences
resulting from the Concurrence, Imitation,
or Example of others. A Parent flies to the Relief
of his Child; transported by that natural Sympathy,
which actuates him, and which affords no Leisure
to reflect on the Sentiments or Conduct of the rest
of Mankind in like Circumstances. A generous
<pb n="214" facs="214"/>
Man embraces cheerfully an Opportunity of serving
his Friend; because he then feels himself under the
Dominion of the beneficent Affections, nor is he
concern'd whether any other Person in the Universe
was ever before actuated by such noble Motives, or
will ever afterwards prove their Influence. In all
these Cases, the social Passions have in View a single
individual Object, and pursue alone the Safety or
Happiness of the Person, lov'd and esteem'd. With
this, they are satisfy'd: In this, they acquiesce.
And as the Good resulting from their benign Influ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence,
is in itself compleat and entire, it also excites
the moral Sentiment of Approbation, without any
Reflection on farther Consequences, or more enlarg'd
Views of the Concurrence or Imitation of the other
Members of Society. On the contrary, were the
generous Friend or disinterested Patriot to stand alone
in the Practice of Beneficence; this would rather in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hance
his Value in our Eyes, and join the Praise of
Rarity and Novelty to his other more exalted
Merits.</p>
            <p>THE Case is not the same with the social Virtues
of Justice and Fidelity. They are highly useful, or
indeed absolutely necessary to the Well-being of
Mankind: But the Benefit, resulting from them, is
not the Consequence of every individual single Act;
but arises from the whole Scheme or System, con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cur'd
<pb n="215" facs="215"/>
in by the whole, or the greatest Part of the So<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciety.
General Peace and Order is the Attendant
of Justice or a general Abstinence from the Posses<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions
of others: But a particular Regard to the par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticular
Right of one individual Citizen may fre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently,
consider'd in itself, be attended with per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nicious
Consequences. The Result of the several
Acts is here often directly opposite to that of the
whole System of Actions; and the former may be
extremely hurtful, while the latter is, to the highest
Degree, advantageous. Riches, inherited from a
Parent, are, in a bad Man's Hand, the Instruments
of Mischief. The Right of Succession may, in one
Instance, be hurtful. Its Benefit arises only from
the Observance of the general Rule; and 'tis suf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficient,
if Compensation be thereby made for all the
Ills and Inconveniencies, which flow from particular
Characters and Situations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CYRUS,</hi> young and unexperienc'd, consider'd
only the individual Case before him, and reflected
on its limited Fitness and Convenience, when he
assign'd the long Coat to the tall Boy, and the short
Coat to the other of smaller Size. His Governor
instructed him better; while he pointed out more
enlarg'd Views and Consequences, and inform'd his
Pupil of the general, inflexible Rules, requisite to
support general Peace and Order in Society.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="216"/>
THE Happiness and Prosperity of Mankind,
arising from the social Virtue of Benevolence and its
Subdivisions, may be compar'd to a Wall, built by
many Hands; which still rises by each Stone, that
is heap'd upon it, and receives proportional Encrease
to the Diligence and Care of each Workman. The
same Happiness, rais'd by the social Virtue of Justice
and its Subdivisions, may be compar'd to the build<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
of a Vault, where each individual Stone would,
of itself, fall to the Ground; nor does the whole
Fabric support itself, but by the mutual Assistance and
Combination of its correspondent Parts.</p>
            <p>ALL the Laws of Nature, which regulate Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perty,
as well as all civil Laws, are general, and
regard alone some essential Circumstances of the
Case, without taking into Consideration the Cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racters,
Situations and Connexions of the Persons
concern'd, or any particular Consequences, that may
result from the Determination of these Laws, in
every particular Case, that offers. They deprive,
without Scruple, a beneficent Man of all his Posses<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions,
if acquir'd by Mistake, without a good Title;
in order to bestow them on a selfish Miser, who has
already heap'd up immense Stores of superfluous
Riches Public Utility requires, that Property should
be regulated by general inflexible Rules; and tho'
<pb n="217" facs="217"/>
such Rules are adopted as best serve the same End of
public Utility, 'tis impossible for them to prevent
all particular Hardships, or make beneficial Conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quences
result from every individual Case. 'Tis
sufficient, if the whole Plan or Scheme be necessary
to the Support of civil Society, and if the Ballance
of Good, in the main, does thereby preponderate
much above that of Evil. Even the general Laws
of the Universe, tho' plann'd by infinite Wisdom,
cannot exclude all Evil or Inconvenience, in every
particular Operation.</p>
            <p>IT has been asserted by some, that all Justice arises
from HUMAN CONVENTIONS, and pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceeds
from the voluntary Choice, Consent, or Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bination
of Mankind. If by <hi>Convention</hi> be here
meant a <hi>Promise</hi> (which is the most usual Sense of
the Word) nothing can be more absurd, than this
Position. The Observance of Promises is itself one
of the most considerable Parts of Justice; and we
are not surely bound to keep our Word, because we
have given our Word to keep it. But if by Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vention
be meant a Sense of common Interest;
which Sense each Man feels in his own Breast, which
he observes in his Fellows, and which carries him,
in concurrence with others, into a general Plan or
System of Actions, that tend to public Utility; it
must be own'd, that, in this Sense, Justice arises
<pb n="218" facs="218"/>
from human Conventions. For if it be allow'd
(what is, indeed, evident) that the particular Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sequences
of a particular Act of Justice may be
hurtful to the Public as well as to Individuals; it
follows, that every Man, in embracing that Virtue,
must have an Eye to the whole Plan or System, and
must expect the Concurrence of his Fellows in the
same Conduct and Behaviour. Were all his Views
to terminate in the particular Consequences of each
particular Act of his own, his Benevolence and Hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manity,
as well as Self-love, might often prescribe
to him Measures of Conduct very different from
those, which are agreeable to the strict Rules of
Right and Justice.</p>
            <p>THUS two Men pull the Oars of a Boat, by com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon
Convention, for common Interest, without any
Promise or Contract: Thus Gold and Silver are
made the Measures of Exchange; thus Speech and
Words and Language are fixt, by human Convention
and Agreement. Whatever is advantageous to two
or more Persons, if all perform their Part; but what
loses all Advantage, if only one perform, can arise
from no other Principle. There would otherwise be
no Motive for any one of them to enter into that
Scheme of Conduct<note place="bottom" n="*">This Theory concerning the Origin of Property, and conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently of Justice is, in the main, the same with that hinted at and adopted by <hi>Grotius.

               <pb n="219" facs="219"/>
THE Word, <hi>natural,</hi> is commonly taken in so
many Senses, and is of such loose Signification, that
it seems to little Purpose to dispute, whether Justice
be natural or not. If Self-love, if Benevolence be
natural to Man; if Reason and Forethought be also
natural; then may the same Epithet be apply'd to
Justice, Order, Fidelity, Property, Society. Men's
Inclination, their Necessities lead them to combine;
their Understanding and Experience tell them, that
this Combination is impossible, where each governs
himself by no Rule, and pays no Regard to the
Possessions of others: And from these Passions
and Reflections conjoin'd, as soon as we observe
<pb n="220" facs="220"/>
like Passions and Reflections in others, the Sentiment
of Justice, thro' all Ages, has infallibly and certainly
had place, to some Degree or other, in every Indi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vidual
of human Species. In so sagacious an Ani<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mal,
what necessarily arises from the Exertion of his
intellectual Faculties, may justly be esteem'd na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tural<note place="bottom" n="*">Natural may be oppos'd, either to what is <hi>unusual, miraculous, or artificial.</hi> In the two former Senses, Justice and Property are undoubtedly natural. But as they suppose Reason, Forethought, Design, and a social Union and Confederacy amongst Men, perhaps, that Epithet cannot strictly, in the last Sense, be apply'd to them. Had Men liv'd without Society, Property had never been known, and neither Justice nor Injustice had ever existed. But Society amongst human Creatures, had been impossible, without Reason and Forethought. Inferior Animals, that unite, are guided by Instinct, which supplies the Place of Reason. But all these Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>
                  <gap resp="#oxf" extent="3 letters" rend="content:•••">
                     <desc>illegible</desc>
                  </gap>s are merely verbal.</note>.</p>
            <p>AMONGST all civiliz'd Nations, it has been the
constant Endeavour to remove every Thing arbitrary
and partial from the Decision of Property, and to
fix the Sentence of Judges by such general Views
and Considerations, as may be equal to every
Member of the Society. For besides, that nothing
could be more dangerous than to accustom the
Bench, even in the smallest Instance, to regard pri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vate
Friendship or Enmity; 'tis certain, that Men,
<pb n="221" facs="221"/>
where they imagine, that there was no other Reason
for the Preference of their Adversary but personal
Favour, are apt to entertain the strongest Jealousy
and Ill-will against the Magistrates and Judges.
When natural Reason, therefore, points out no fixt
View of public Utility, by which a Controversy of
Property can be decided, positive Laws are often
fram'd to supply its Place, and direct the Procedure
of all Courts of Judicature. Where these too fail,
as often happens, Precedents are call'd for; and a
former Decision, tho' given itself without any suffici<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ent
Reason, justly becomes a sufficient Reason for a
new Decision. If direct Laws and Precedents be
wanting, imperfect and indirect ones are brought in
Aid; and the controverted Case is rang'd under them,
by analogical Reasonings, and Comparisons, and
Similitudes, and Correspondencies, that are often
more fanciful than real. In general, it may safely
be asserted, that Jurisprudence is, in this respect,
different from all the Sciences; and in many of its
nicer Questions, there cannot properly be said to be
Truth or Falshood on either Side. If one Pleader
brings the Case under any former Law or Precedent,
by a refin'd Analogy or Comparison; the opposite
Pleader is not at a Loss to find an opposite Analogy or
Comparison: And the Preference given by the Judge
is often founded more on Taste and Imagination.
<pb n="222" facs="222"/>
than on any solid Argument. Public Utility is the
general View of all Courts of Judicature; and this
Utility too requires a stable Rule in all Controversies:
But where several Rules, nearly equal and indif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent,
present themselves, 'tis a very slight Turn of
Thought, which fixes the Decision in favour of either
Party.</p>

DIALOGUE.</head>
            <p>MY Friend, <hi>Palamedes,</hi> who is as great a Ram<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bler
in his Principles as in his Person, and
who has run over, by Study and Travel, almost
every Region of the intellectual and material World,
surpriz'd me lately with an Account of a Nation,
with whom, he told me, he had pass'd a considerable
Part of his Life, and whom he found, in the main,
an extreme civiliz'd, intelligent People.</p>
            <p>THERE is a State, say'd he, in the World, call'd
<hi>Fourli,</hi> no matter for its Longitude or Latitude,
whose Ways of thinking in many Things, particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larly
in Morals, are diametrically opposite to ours.
When I came amongst them, I found I must submit
to double Pains; first to learn the Meaning of the
Terms in their Language, and then to know the Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port
of those Terms, and the Praise or Blame at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tach'd
to them. After a Word had been explain'd
to me, and the Character, which it exprest, had
<pb n="224" facs="224"/>
been describ'd, I concluded, that such an Epithet
must necessarily be the greatest Reproach in the
World; and was extremely surpriz'd to find one, in
a public Company, apply it to a Person, with whom
he liv'd in the strictest Intimacy and Friendship.
<hi>You fancy,</hi> said I, one Day, to an Acquaintance,
<hi>that</hi> Changuis <hi>is your mortal Enemy: I love to ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinguish
Quarrels; and I must, therefore, tell you, that
Heard him talk of you in the most advantageous Manner.</hi>
But to my great Astonishment, when I repeated
<hi>Changuis</hi>'s Words, tho' I had both remember'd and un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derstood
them perfectly, I found, that they were
taken for the most mortal Affront, and that I had
very innocently render'd the Breach betwixt these
Persons altogether irreparable.</p>
            <p>As it was my Fortune to come amongst this People
on a very advantageous Footing, I was immediately
introduc'd to the best Company; and being desir'd
to live with <hi>Alcheic,</hi> I readily accepted his Invitation,
as I found him universally esteem'd for his personal
Merit; and indeed regarded by every one in <hi>Fourli,</hi>
as a perfect Character.</p>
            <p>ONE Evening he invited me, as an Amusement,
to bear him Company in a Serenade, which he in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tended
to give <hi>Gulki,</hi> with whom, he told me, he
was extremely enamour'd; and I foon found his
<pb n="225" facs="225"/>
Taste was not singular: For we met many of his
Rivals, who had come on the same Errand. I very
naturally concluded, that this Flame of his must be
one of the finest Women in Town; and I already
felt a secret Inclination to see her, and be acquainted
with her. But as the Moon began to rise, I was
much surpriz'd to find, that we were in the Midst of
the University, where <hi>Gulki</hi> study'd: And I was
somewhat asham'd for having attended my Friend,
on such an Errand.</p>
            <p>I WAS told afterwards, that <hi>Alcheic</hi>'s Choice of
<hi>Gulki</hi> was very much approv'd of by all the good
Company in Town; and that 'twas expected, while
he gratify'd his own Passion, he would perform to
that young Man the same good Office, which he had
himself ow'd to <hi>Elcouf.</hi> It seems <hi>Alcheic</hi> had been
very handsome in his Youth, and been courted by
many Lovers; but had bestow'd his Favours chiefly
on the sage <hi>Elcouf;</hi> to whom he was suppos'd to owe,
in a great Measure, the astonishing Progress he had
made in Philosophy and Virtue.</p>
            <p>IT gave me some Surprize, that <hi>Alcheic</hi>'s Wife
(who by-the-bye happen'd also to be his Sister) was
no way scandaliz'd at this Species of Infidelity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="226"/>
MUCH about the same Time I discover'd (for it
was not attempted to be kept a Secret from me or
any Body) that <hi>Alcheic</hi> was a Murderer and a Parri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cide,
and had put to Death an innocent Person, the
most nearly connected with him, and whom he was
oblig'd to protect and defend by all the Ties of Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture
and Humanity. When I ask'd, with all the
Caution and Deference imaginable, what was his
Motive for this Action; he reply'd coolly, that he
was not then so much at his Ease as he is at present,
and that he had acted, in that Particular, by the Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vice
of all his Friends.</p>
            <p>HAVING heard <hi>Alcheic</hi>'s Virtue so extremely cele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brated,
I pretended to join in the general Voice of
Acclamation, and only ask'd, by way of Curiosity,
as a Stranger, which of all his noble Actions was
most highly applauded; and I soon found, that all
Sentiments were united in giving the Preference to
the Assassination of <hi>Usbek.</hi> This <hi>Usbek</hi> had been to
the last Moment <hi>Alcheic</hi>'s intimate Friend, had lay'd
many high Obligations upon him, had even sav'd
his Life on a certain Occasion, and had, by his Will,
which was found after the Murder, made him his
Heir to a considerable Part of his Fortune. <hi>Alcheic,</hi>
it seems, conspir'd with about twenty or thirty more,
most of them also <hi>Usbek</hi>'s Friends; and falling all
<pb n="227" facs="227"/>
together on that unhappy Man, when he was not
aware, they had tore him with a hundred Wounds;
and given him that Reward for all his past Favours
and Obligations. <hi>Usbek,</hi> said the general Voice of
the People, had many great and good Qualities:
His very Vices were shining, magnificent, and ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nerous:
But this Action of <hi>Alcheic</hi> sets him far above
<hi>Usbek</hi> in the Eyes of all Judges of Merit; and is
one of the noblest, that ever perhaps the Sun shone
upon.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Part of <hi>Alcheic</hi>'s Conduct, which I also
found highly applauded, was his Behaviour towards
<hi>Calish,</hi> with whom he was join'd in a Project or
Undertaking of some Importance. <hi>Calish,</hi> being a
passionate Man, gave <hi>Alcheic,</hi> one Day, a sound
Drubbing; which he took very patiently, waited
the Return of <hi>Calish</hi>'s good Humour, kept still a fair
Correspondence with him; and by that Means
brought the Affair, in which they were join'd, to a
happy Issue, and gain'd himself immortal Honour
by his remarkable Temper and Moderation.</p>
            <p>I HAVE lately receiv'd a Letter from a Correspon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dent
in <hi>Fourli,</hi> by which I learn, that since my De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parture,
<hi>Alcheic,</hi> falling into a bad State of Health,
has fairly hang'd himself; and has dy'd universally
regreted and applauded by every one in that Country.
So virtuous and noble a Life, says each <hi>Fourlian,</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="228"/>
could not be better crown'd than by so noble an
End; and he has prov'd by this, as well as by all
his other Actions, what was his constant Principle
during his Life, and what he boasted of near his last
Moments, that a wise Man is scarce inferior to the
great God, <hi>Vitzli.</hi> This is the Name of the Supreme
Deity amongst the <hi>Fourlians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Notions of this People, continu'd <hi>Palamedes,</hi>
are as extraordinary with regard to Good-manners
and Sociableness, as with regard to Morals. My
Friend <hi>Alcheic</hi> form'd once a Party for my Entertain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,
compos'd of all the prime Wits and Philoso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phers
of <hi>Fourli;</hi> and each of us brought his Mess
along with him to the Place, where we assembled.
I observ'd one of them to be worse provided than
the rest, and offer'd him a Share of mine, which hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pen'd
to be a roasted Pullet: And I could not but
remark, that he, and all the rest of the Company
star'd at my Simplicity. I was told, that <hi>Alcheic</hi> had
once so much Interest with his Club as to prevail
with them to eat in common, and that he had made
use of an Artifice to that Purpose. He persuaded
those, whom he observ'd to be <hi>worst</hi> provided, to
offer their Mess to the Company; after which, the
others, who had brought more delicate Fare, were
asham'd not to make the same Offer. This is regarded
as so extraordinary a Event, that it has since, as I
<pb n="229" facs="229"/>
learn, been recorded in the History of <hi>Alcheic</hi>'s Life,
compos'd by one of the greatest Geniuses of <hi>Fourli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PRAY, says I, <hi>Palamedes,</hi> when you was at <hi>Fourli,</hi>
did you also learn the Art of turning your Friends
into Ridicule, by telling them strange Stories, and
then laughing at them, if they believ'd you. I assure
you, reply'd he, that had I been dispos'd to learn
such a Lesson, there was no Place in the World more
proper. My Friend, so often mention'd, did no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing,
from Morning to Night, but sneer, and
banter, and railly; and you could scarce ever distin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guish,
whether he was in Jest or Earnest; But you
think, then, that my Story is improbable; and that
I have us'd, or rather abus'd the Privilege of a
Traveller. To be sure, says I, you was but in Jest.
Such barbarous and savage Manners are not only in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>compatible
with a civiliz'd, intelligent People, such
as you said these were; but are scarce compatible
with human Nature. They exceed all we ever read
of, amongst the <hi>Mingrelians</hi> and <hi>Topinamboues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVE a care, cry'd he, have a care! You are
not aware you are speaking Blasphemy, and are
abusing your Favourites, the <hi>Greeks,</hi> especially the
<hi>Athenians,</hi> whom I have couch'd all along, under
these bizarre Names I employ'd. If you consider
aright, there is not one Stroke of the foregoing
<pb n="230" facs="230"/>
Character, which might not be fo<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">
                  <desc>illegible</desc>
               </gap>nd in the Man of
highest Merit at <hi>Athens,</hi> without diminishing, in the
least, from the Brightness of his Character. The <hi>Greek</hi>
Love, their Marriages<note place="bottom" n="*">The Laws of <hi>Athens</hi> allow'd a Man to marry his Sister by the Father. <hi>Solon</hi>'s Laws forbid Paederasty to Slaves, as being of too great Dignity for such mean Persons.</note>, and the exposing of their
Children cannot but strike you immediately. The
Death of <hi>Usbek</hi> is an exact Counter-part to that of
<hi>Caesar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL to a Trifle, say'd I, interrupting him; you
did not mention, that <hi>Usbek</hi> was an Usurper.</p>
            <p>I DID not, reply'd he; lest you should discover the
Parallel I aim'd at. But even adding this Circum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stance,
we should make no Scruple, according to our
Sentiments of Morals, to denomitate <hi>Brutus,</hi> and
<hi>Cassius,</hi> ungrateful Traitors and Assassins: Tho' you
know, that they are, perhaps, the highest Characters
of all Antiquity; and the <hi>Athenians</hi> erected Statues
to them; which they plac'd near those of <hi>Harmodius</hi>
and <hi>Aristogiton,</hi> their own Deliverers. And if you
think this Circumstance, you mention, so material
to absolve these Patriots, I shall compensate it by
another, not mention'd, which will equally aggra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vate
their Crime. A few Days before the Execution
<pb n="231" facs="231"/>
of their fatal Purpose, they all swore Fealty to
<hi>Caesar;</hi> and protesting to hold his Person ever sacred,
they touch'd the Altar with those Hands, which they
had already arm'd for his Destruction<note place="bottom" n="*">Appian. Bell. Civ. Lib. 3. Suetonius in vita Caesaris.</note>.</p>
            <p>I NEED not put you in mind of the famous and
applauded Story of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> and of his Patience
towards <hi>Eurybiades,</hi> the <hi>Spartan,</hi> his commanding
Officer, who, heated by a Debate, lifted his Cane
to him in a Council of War (the same Thing as if he
had cudgel'd him) <hi>Strike!</hi> Cries the <hi>Athenian, Strike!
but hear me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOU are too good a Scholar not to discover <hi>Socrates</hi>
and his <hi>Athenian</hi> Club in my last Story; and you
would certainly observe, that it is exactly copy'd
from <hi>Xenophon,</hi> with a Variation only of the Names<note place="bottom" n="†">Mem. Soc. Lib. 3. sub fine.</note>.
And I think I have fairly made appear, that an
<hi>Athenian</hi> Man of Merit might be such a one as with
us would pass for Incestuous, a Parricide, an Assassin,
an ungrateful, perjur'd Traitor, and something else
too abominable to be nam'd; not to mention his
Rusticity and Ill-manners. And having liv'd in this
Manner, his Death may be entirely suitable: He
<pb n="232" facs="232"/>
may conclude the Scene by a desperate Act of Self-murder,
and dye with the most absurd Blasphemies
in his Mouth. And notwithstanding all this, he
shall have Statues, if not Altars, erected to his
Memory; Poems and Orations shall be compos'd in
his Praise; great Sects shall be proud of calling
themselves by his Name; and the most distant Poste<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity
shall blindly continue their Admiration: Tho'
were such a one to arise amongst themselves, they
would justly regard him with Horror and Execra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I MIGHT have been aware, reply'd I, of your
Artifice. You seem to take Pleasure in this Topic;
and are indeed the only Man I ever knew, who was
well acquainted with the Antients, and did not ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tremely
admire them. But instead of attacking their
Philosophy, their Eloquence, or Poetry, the usual
Subjects of Controversy betwixt us, you now seem
to impeach their Morals, and accuse them of Igno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rance
in a Science, which is the only one, in my
Opinion, wherein they are not surpass'd by the Mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derns.
Geometry, Physics, Astronomy, Anatomy,
Botany, Geography, Navigation; in these we justly
claim the Superiority: But what have we to oppose
to their Moralists? Your Representation of Things
is fallacious. You have no Indulgence for the Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ners
and Customs of different Ages. Would you try
<pb n="233" facs="233"/>
a <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> by the Common-law of <hi>England?</hi>
Hear him defend himself by his own Maxims; and
then pronounce.</p>
            <p>THERE are no Manners so innocent or reasonable,
which may not be render'd odious or ridiculous, if
measur'd by a Standard, unknown to the Persons;
especially, if you employ a little Art or Eloquence,
in aggravating some Circumstances, and extenuating
others, as best serves the Purpose of your Discourse.
All these Artifices may easily be retorted on you.
Could I inform the <hi>Athenians,</hi> for Instance, there was
a Nation, wherein Adultery, both active and passive,
so to speak, was in the highest Vogue and Esteem:
Wherein every Man of Education chose for his
Mistress a marry'd Woman, the Wife, perhaps, of
his Friend and Companion; and valu'd himself upon
these infamous Conquests, as much as if he had been
several Times a Conqueror in Boxing or Wrestling
at the <hi>Olympic</hi> Games. Wherein every Man, also,
took a Pride in his Tameness and Facility with re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard
to his own Wife, and was glad to make Friends
or gain Interest by allowing her to prostitute her
Charms; and even, without any such Motive, gave
her full Liberty and Indulgence. I ask, what Sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timents
the <hi>Athenians</hi> would entertain of such a Peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple;
they who never mention'd the Crime of Adul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tery
but in Conjunction with Robbery and Poison<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing?
<pb n="234" facs="234"/>
Which would they admire most, the Villainy
or the Meanness of such a Conduct?</p>
            <p>SHOULD I add, that the same People were as proud
of their Slavery and Dependance as the <hi>Athenians</hi>
were of their Liberty; and tho' a Man among them
were opprest, disgrac'd, impoverish'd, insulted, or
imprison'd by the Tyrant, he would still regard it as
the highest Merit to love, serve, and obey him;
and even to die for his smallest Glory or Satisfaction:
These noble <hi>Greeks</hi> would probably ask me, whether
I spoke of a human Society, or of some inferior,
servile Species.</p>
            <p>'TWAS then I might inform my <hi>Athenian</hi> Audience,
that these People, however, wanted not Spirit and
Bravery. If a Man, says I, tho' their intimate
Friend, should throw out, in a private Company, a
Raillery against them, nearly approaching any of
those, with which your Generals and Demagogues
every Day regale each other, in the Face of the
whole City, they never can forgive him; but in
order to revenge themselves, they oblige him imme<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diately
to run them thro' the Body, or be himself
murder'd. And if a Man, who is an absolute
Stranger to them, should desire them, at the Peril
of their own Life, to cut the Throat of their Bosom-companion▪
they immediately obey, and think them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves
<pb n="235" facs="235"/>
highly oblig'd and honour'd by the Commission.
These are their Maxims of Honour: This is their
favourite Morality.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' so ready to draw their Sword against
their Friends and Countrymen; no Disgrace, no In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>famy,
no Pain, no Poverty will ever engage these
People to turn the Point of it against their own
Breast. A Man of Rank would row in the Gallies,
would beg his Bread, would languish in Prison,
would suffer any Tortures; and still preserve his
wretched Life. Rather than escape his Enemies by
a generous Contempt of Death, he would infamously
receive the same Death from his Enemies, aggra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vated
by their triumphant Insults, and by the most
exquisite Sufferings.</p>
            <p>'TIS very usual too, continu'd I, amongst this
People to shut up several of their Children in a per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>petual
Prison (where every Art of plaguing, and
tormenting them is carefully study'd and practis'd)
in order, that another Child, whom they own to
have no greater or rather less Merit than the rest,
may enjoy their whole Fortune, and wallow in every
Kind of Voluptuousness and Pleasure. Nothing so
virtuous in their Opinion as this barbarous Partia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="236" facs="236"/>
BUT what is more particular in this whimsical
Nation, say I to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> is, that a Frolic of
yours during the <hi>Saturnalia,</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">The <hi>Greeks</hi> kept the Feast of <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Chronus,</hi> as well as the <hi>Romans.</hi> See Lucian. Epist. Saturn.</note>, when the Slaves
are serv'd by their Masters, is seriously con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinu'd
by them thro' the whole Year, and thro' the
whole Course of their Lives; and accompany'd too
with some Circumstances, which still farther augment
the Absurdity and Ridicule. Your Sport only elevates
for a few Days those whom Fortune has thrown
down, and whom she too, in Sport, may really ele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vate
for ever above you: But this Nation gravely
exalt those, whom Nature has subjected to them,
and whose Inferiority and Infirmities are absolutely
incurable. The Women, tho' without Virtue, are
their Masters and Sovereigns: These they reverence,
praise, and magnify: To these, they pay the highest
Deference and Respect: And in all Places and at all
Times, the Superiority of the Females is readily
acknowledg'd and submitted to by every one, who
has the least Pretensions to Education and Politeness.
Scarce any Crime would be so universally detested
as an Infraction of this Rule.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="237"/>
YOU need go no farther, reply'd <hi>Palamedes,</hi> I can
easily conjecture the People you aim at. The Strokes,
with which you have painted them, are pretty just;
and yet you must acknowledge, that scarce any
People are to be found, either in antient or modern
Times, whose national Character is, upon the Whole,
less liable to Exceptions. But I give you Thanks for
helping me our with my Argument. I had no In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tention
of exalting the Moderns at the Expence of
the Antients. I only meant to represent the Uncer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tainty
of all these Judgments concerning Characters;
and to convince you, that Fashion, Vogue, Custom,
and Law were the chief Foundation of all moral
Determinations. The <hi>Athenians</hi> surely, were a civi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liz'd,
intelligent People, if ever there was one;
and yet their Man of Merit might, in this Age,
be held in Horror and Execration. The <hi>French</hi> are
also, without doubt, a very civiliz'd, intelligent
People; and yet their Man of Merit might, with
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> be an Object of the highest Contempt
and Ridicule, and even Hatred. And what renders
the Matter more extraordinary: These two national
Characters are suppos'd to be the most similar of any
in antient or modern Times; and while the <hi>English</hi>
flatter themselves that they resemble the <hi>Romans,</hi>
their Neighbours on the Continent draw the Parallel
betwixt themselves and these polite <hi>Greeks.</hi> What
<pb n="238" facs="238"/>
wide Difference, therefore, in the Sentiments of
Morals, must be found betwixt civiliz'd Nations and
Barbarians, or betwixt Nations whose Characters
have little in common? How shall we pretend to
fix a Standard for Judgments of this Nature?</p>
            <p>BY tracing Matters, reply'd I, a little higher, and
examining the first Principles, which each Nation
establishes, of Blame or Censure. The <hi>Rhine</hi> flows
North, the <hi>Rhone</hi> South; yet both spring from the
<hi>same</hi> Mountain, and are also actuated, in their op<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posite
Directions, by the <hi>same</hi> Principle of Gravity:
The different Inclinations of the Ground, on which
they run, cause all the Difference of their Courses.</p>
            <p>IN how many Circumstances would an <hi>Athenian</hi>
and <hi>French</hi> Man of Merit certainly concur? Good-sense,
Knowledge, Wit, Eloquence, Humanity,
Fidelity, Truth, Justice, Courage, Temperance,
Constancy, Dignity of Mind. These you have all
omitted; in order to insist only on the Points, in
which they may, by Accident, differ. Very well:
I am willing to comply with you; and shall endea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vour
to account for these Differences from the most
universal, establish'd Principles of Morals.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Greek</hi> Loves, I care not to examine more par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticularly.
I shall only observe, that, however blame<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able,
<pb n="239" facs="239"/>
they arose from a very innocent Cause, the
Frequency of the Gymnastic Exercises amongst that
People; and were recommended, tho' absurdly, as
the Source of Friendship, Sympathy, mutual Attach<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,
and Fidelity<note place="bottom" n="*">Plat. Symp. P.182. Ex Edit. Serr.</note>; Qualities esteem'd in all Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
and all Ages.</p>
            <p>THE Marriage of Half-brothers and Sisters seems
no great Difficulty. Love betwixt the nearer Rela<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
is contrary to Reason and public Utility; but
the precise Point, where we are to stop, can scarcely
be determin'd by natural Reason; and is therefore a
very proper Subject of municipal Law or Custom.
If the <hi>Athenians</hi> went a little too far on the one Side,
the Canon Law has surely push'd Matters a great
way into the other Extremity<note place="bottom" n="†">See Enquiry. Sect. IV.</note>.</p>
            <p>HAD you ask'd a Parent at <hi>Athens,</hi> why he bereav'd
his Child of that Life, which he had so lately given
it. 'Tis because I love it, he would reply; and re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard
the Poverty it must inherit from me, as a greater
Evil than a Death, which it is not capable of dread<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing,
feeling, or resenting<note place="bottom" n="‡">Plutarch. de amore prolis, sub fine.</note>.</p>
            <p>HOW is public Liberty, the most valuable of all
Blessings, to be recover'd from the Hands of an
<pb n="240" facs="240"/>
Usurper or Tyrant, if his Power shields him from
public Rebellion, and our Scruples from private
Vengeance? That his Crime is capital by Law, you
acknowledge: And must the highest Aggravation of
his Crime, the putting himself above Law, form his
full Security? You can reply nothing, but by show<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
the great Inconveniencies of Assassination;
which, could any one have prov'd clearly to the
Antients, he had reform'd their Sentiments in this
Particular.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, to cast your Eye on the Picture I have
drawn of modern Manners; there is almost as great
Difficulty, I acknowledge, to justify <hi>French</hi> as <hi>Greek</hi>
Gallantry; except only, that the former is much
more natural and agreeable than the latter. But our
Neighbours, it seems, have resolv'd to sacrifice some
of the domestic to the sociable Pleasures; and to
prefer Ease, Freedom, and an open Commerce to a
strict Fidelity and Constancy. These Ends are both
good, and are somewhat difficult to reconcile; nor
need we be surpriz'd, if the Customs of Nations en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cline
too much, sometimes to the one Side, sometimes
to the other.</p>
            <p>THE most inviolable Attachment to the Laws of
our Country is every-where acknowledg'd a capital
Virtue; and where the People are not so happy, as
<pb n="241" facs="241"/>
to have any other Legislature but a single Person, the
strictest Loyalty is, in that Case, the truest Pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>triotism.</p>
            <p>NOTHING surely can be more absurd and barbarous
than the Practice of Duelling; but those, who
justify it, say, that it begets Civility and Good-man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ners.
And a Duelist, you may observe, always
values himself upon his Courage, his Sense of Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour,
his Fidelity and Friendship; Qualities, which
are here indeed very oddly directed, but have been
esteem'd universally, since the Foundation of the
World.</p>
            <p>HAVE the Gods forbid Self-murder? An <hi>Athe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nian</hi>
allows, that it ought to be foreborn. Has the
Deity permitted it? A <hi>Frenchman</hi> allows, that
Death is preferable to Pain and Infamy.</p>
            <p>YOU see then, continu'd I, that the Principles,
upon which Men reason in Morals are always the
same; tho' the Conclusions they draw are often very
different. That they all reason aright with regard to
this Subject, more than with regard to any other, it
is not incumbent on any Moralist to show. 'Tis
sufficient, that the original Principles of Censure or
Blame are uniform, and that erroneus Conclusions
can be corrected by sounder Reasonings and a larger
<pb n="242" facs="242"/>
Experience. As many Ages as have elaps'd since
the Fall of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and such Changes as
have arriv'd in Religion, Language, Laws, and
Customs; none of these Revolutions has ever pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duc'd
any considerable Innovation in the primary
Sentiments of Morals, more than in those of external
Beauty. Some minute Differences, perhaps, may
be observ'd in both. <hi>Horace</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Epist. Lib. 1. Epist. 7. Also Lib. 1. Ode 3.</note> celebrates a low Fore<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>head,
and <hi>Anacreon</hi> join'd Eye-brows<note place="bottom" n="†">Ode 28. Petronius (Cap. 86.) joins both these Circumstances as Beauties.</note>: But the
<hi>Apollo</hi> and the <hi>Venus</hi> of Antiquity are still our Models
for Male and Female Beauty; in like Manner as the
Character of <hi>Scipio</hi> continues our Standard for the
Glory of Heroes, and that of <hi>Cornelia</hi> for the Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour
of Matrons.</p>
            <p>IT appears, that there never was any Quality, re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>commended
by any one, as a Virtue or moral Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cellence;
but on account of its being <hi>useful,</hi> or
<hi>agreeable,</hi> to a Man <hi>himself,</hi> or to <hi>others.</hi> For what
other Reason can there ever be for Praise or Appro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bation?
Or where would be the Sense of extolling
<hi>good</hi> Character of Action, which, at the same Time,
is allow'd to be <hi>good for nothing?</hi> All the Diffe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rences,
therefore, in Morals may be reduc'd to this
<pb n="243" facs="243"/>
one general Foundation, and may be accounted for
by the different Views, which People take of these
Circumstances.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES Men differ in their Judgment about
the Usefulness of any Habit or Action: Sometimes
also the peculiar Circumstances of Things render one
moral Quality more useful than others, and give it a
peculiar Preference.</p>
            <p>'TIS not surprising, that, during a Period of War
and Disorder, the military Virtues should be more
celebrated than the pacific, and attract more the Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>miration
and Attention of Mankind.<q rend="inline">"How usual
is it,"</q> says <hi>Tully</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Tuse. Quaest. Lib. 2.</note>, <q rend="inline">"to find <hi>Cimbrians, Celtibe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rians,</hi>
and other Barbarians, who bear, with in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>flexible
Constancy, all the Fatigues and Dangers
of the Field; but are immediately dispirited
under the Suffrance and Hazard of a languishing
Distemper: While, on the other hand▪ the <hi>Grecks</hi>
patiently endure the slow Approaches of Death,
when arm'd with Sickness and Disease; but ti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>morously

is even the same Virtue of Courage amongst
warlike or peaceful Nations! And indeed, we may
<pb n="244" facs="244"/>
observe, that as the Difference betwixt War and
Peace is the greatest, that arises among Nations and
public Societies, it produces also the greatest Varia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
in moral Sentiment, and diversifies the most our
Idea of Virtue and personal Merit.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES too, Magnanimity, Greatness of
Mind, Disdain of Slavery, inflexible Rigour and
Integrity may suit better the Circumstances of one Age
than those of another, and have a more kindly In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fluence,
both on public Affairs, and on a Man's own
Safety and Advancement. Our Idea of Merit,
therefore, will also vary a little with these Variations;
and <hi>Labeo,</hi> perhaps, be censur'd for the same Qua<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lities,
which procur'd <hi>Cato</hi> the highest Approbation.</p>
            <p>A DEGREE of Luxury may be ruinous and perni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cious
in a Native of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> which only fosters
the Arts, and encourages Industry in a <hi>Frenchman</hi> or
<hi>Englishman.</hi> We are not, therefore, to expect,
either the same Sentiment, or the same Laws in <hi>Berne,</hi>
that prevail in <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DIFFERENT Customs have also some Influence,
as well as different Utilities; and by giving an early
Biass to the Mind, may produce a superior Propen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sity,
either to the useful or the agreeable Qualities; to
<pb n="245" facs="245"/>
those, which regard Self, or those, which extend to
Society. These four Sources of moral Sentiment
still subsist; but particular Accidents may, at one
Time, make one of them flow with greater Abun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dance
than at another.</p>
            <p>THE Customs of some Nations shut up the Women
from all social Commerce: Those of others make
them so essential a Part of Society and Conversation,
that, except where Business is canvass'd, the Male-sex
alone are suppos'd absolutely incapable of mutual
Discourse and Entertainment. As this Difference is
the most material, that can happen in private Life,
it must also produce the greatest Variation in our
moral Sentiments.</p>
            <p>OF all Nations in the World, where Polygamy
was not allow'd, the <hi>Greeks</hi> seem to have been the
most reserv'd in their Commerce with the Fair-sex,
and to have impos'd on them the strictest Laws of
Modesty and Decency. We have a strong Instance
of this in an Oration of <hi>Lysias</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Orat. 33.</note>. A Widow injur'd,
ruin'd, undone, calls a Meeting of a few of her nearest
Friends and Relations; and tho' never before ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>custom'd,
says the Orator, to speak in the Presence
of Men, the Distress of her Circumstances constrain'd
<pb n="246" facs="246"/>
her to lay the Case before them. Her very Opening
her Mouth in such Company requir'd, it seems, an
Apology.</p>
            <p>WHEN <hi>Demosthenes</hi> prosecuted his Tutors, to make
them refund his Patrimony, it became necessary for
him, in the Course of the Law suit, to prove that
the Marriage of <hi>Aphobus</hi>'s Sister with <hi>Oneter</hi> was en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tirely
fraudulent, and that, notwithstanding her
Sham-marriage, she had liv'd with her Brother at
<hi>Athens</hi> for two Years last past, ever since her Divorce
from her former Husband. And 'tis remarkable,
that tho' these were People of the first Fortune and
Distinction in the City, the Orator could prove this
Fact no Way, but by calling for her female Slaves
to be put to the Question, and by the Evidence of
one Physician, who had seen her in her Brother's
House during her Illness<note place="bottom" n="*">In Oneterem.</note>. So reserv'd were <hi>Greek</hi>
Manners.</p>
            <p>WE may be certain, that an extreme Purity was
the Consequence of this Reserve. Accordingly, we
find, that, except the fabulous Stories of an <hi>Helen</hi>
and a <hi>Clytemnestra,</hi> there scarce is an Instance of any
Event in the <hi>Greek</hi> History, that proceeded from the
Intrigues of Women. On the other hand, in modern
<pb n="247" facs="247"/>
Times, particularly in a neighbouring Nation, the
Females enter into all Transactions and all Manage<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
of Church and State; and no Man can suc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceed,
who takes not care to obtain their good Graces.
<hi>Harry</hi> the third, by incurring the Displeasure of the
Fair, endanger'd his Crown, and lost his Life, as
much as by his Indulgence to Heresy.</p>
            <p>'TIS needless to dissemble: The Consequence of a
very free Commerce betwixt the Sexes, and of their
living much together, will often terminate in In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trigues
and Gallantry. We must sacrifice somewhat
of the <hi>useful,</hi> if we be very anxious to obtain all the
<hi>agreeable</hi> Qualities; and cannot pretend to reach alike
every Kind of Advantage. Instances of Licence,
daily multiplying, will weaken the Scandal with the
one Sex, and teach the other, by Degrees, to adopt
the famous Maxim of <hi>la Fontaine,</hi> with regard to
female Infidelity, <hi>that if one knows it, it is but a small
Matter; if one knows it not, it is nothing</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <l>Quand on le sçait c'est peu de chose:</l>
                  <l>Quand on ne le sçait pas, ce n'est rien.</l>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>SOME People are inclin'd to think, that the best
Way of adjusting all Differences, and of keeping
the proper Medium betwixt the <hi>agreeable</hi> and <hi>useful</hi>
Qualities of the Sex is to live with them after the
<pb n="248" facs="248"/>
Manner of the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> (for the
Customs of these two Nations seem similar in this
Respect<note place="bottom" n="*">During the Time of the Emperors, the <hi>Romans</hi> seem to have been more given to Intrigues and Gallantry than the <hi>English</hi> are at present: And the Women of Condition, in order to retain their Lovers, endeavour'd to fix a Name of Reproach on those, who were addicted to Wenching and low Amours. They were call'd <hi>Ancillarioli.</hi> See Seneca de Beneficiis. Lib. 1. Cap. 9. See also Martial, Lib. 12. Epig. 58.</note>) that is, without Gallantry<note place="bottom" n="†">The Gallantry here meant is that of Amours and Attach<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments, not that of Complaisance, which is as much pay'd to the fair Sex in <hi>England</hi> as in any other Country.</note> and without
Jealousy. By a Parity of Reason, the Customs of
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and of the <hi>Italians</hi> of an Age ago (for
the present are very different) must be the worst of
any; because they favour both Gallantry and Jea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lousy.</p>
            <p>NOR will these different Customs of Nations affect
only the one Sex: The Idea of personal Merit in
the Males must also be somewhat different, with re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard,
at least, to Conversation, Address, and Hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mour.
The one Nation, where the Men live much
apart, will naturally more esteem Prudence; the
other, Gaiety: With the one, Simplicity of Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ners
will be in the highest Respect; with the other,
Politeness. The one will distinguish themselves by
<pb n="249" facs="249"/>
Good-sense and Judgment; the other, by Taste and
Delicacy: The Eloquence of the former will shine
most in the Senate; that of the other, on the The<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>atre.</p>
            <p>THESE, I say, are the <hi>natural</hi> Effects of such
Customs. For it must be confest, that Chance has a
great Influence on national Manners; and many Events
happen in Society, which are not to be accounted
for by general Rules. Who could imagine, for
Instance, that the <hi>Romans,</hi> who liv'd freely with their
Women, should be very indifferent about Music,
and esteem Dancing infamous: While the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
who never almost saw a Woman but in their own
Houses, were continually piping, singing, and danc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing?</p>
            <p>THE Differences of moral Sentiment, which na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turally
arise from a republican or monarchical Go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernment,
are also very obvious; as well as those,
which proceed from general Riches or Poverty,
Union or Faction, Ignorance or Learning. I shall
conclude this long Discourse with observing, that
different Customs and Situations vary the original
Ideas of Merit (however they may, some Conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quences)
in no very essential Point, and prevail
chiefly with regard to young Men, who can aspire
<pb n="250" facs="250"/>
to the agreeable Qualities, and may attempt to please,
The MANNER, the ORNAMENTS, the
GRACES, that succeed in this Shape, are more
arbitrary and casual: But the Merit of riper Years is
almost every-where the same; and consists chiefly in
Integrity, Humanity, Ability, Knowledge and the
other more solid and useful Qualities of the human
Mind.</p>
            <p>WHAT you insist on, reply'd <hi>Palamedes,</hi> may have
some Foundation, when you stick to the Maxims of
common Life and ordinary Conduct. Experience
and the Practice of the World readily correct any
great Extravagance on either Side. But what say
you to <hi>artificial</hi> Lives and Manners? How do you
reconcile the Maxims, on which these are founded?</p>
            <p>WHAT do you understand by <hi>artificial</hi> Lives and
Manners, said I? I explain myself, reply'd he.
You know, that Religion had, in antient Times'
very little Influence on common Life, and that,
after Men had perform'd their Duty in Sacrifices and
Prayers at the Temple, they thought, that the Gods
left the rest of their Conduct to themselves, and were
little pleas'd, or offended with those Virtues and
Vices, that only affected the Peace and Happiness of
human Society. In those Ages, 'twas the Business
of Philosophy alone to regulate Men's ordinary Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haviour
<pb n="251" facs="251"/>
and Deportment; and accordingly, we may
observe, that this being the sole Principle, by which
a Man could elevate himself above his Fellows, it
acquir'd a mighty Ascendant over many, and pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duc'd
great Singularities of Maxims and of Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duct.
At present, that Philosophy has lost the Al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lurement
of Novelty, it has no such extensive Influ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence;
but seems to confine itself mostly to Specula<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
in the Closet; in the same Manner, as the an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tient
Religion was limited to Sacrifices in the Tem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple.
Its Place is now supply'd by the modern Reli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gion,
which inspects our whole Conduct, and pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scribes
an universal Rule to our Actions, to our
Words, to our very Thoughts and Inclinations; a
Rule so much the more austere, that it is guarded by
infinite, tho' distant. Rewards and Punishments;
and no Infraction of it can ever be conceal'd or dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guis'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DIOGENES</hi> is the most celebrated Model of
extravagant Philosophy. Let us seek a Parallel to
him in modern Times. We shall not disgrace any
philosophic Name by a Comparison with the <hi>Domi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nics</hi>
or <hi>Loyolas,</hi> or any canoniz'd Monk or Friar.
Let us compare him to <hi>Pascal,</hi> a Man of Parts and
Genius as well as <hi>Diogenes</hi> himself; and perhaps too,
<pb n="252" facs="252"/>
a Man of Virtue, had he allow'd his virtuous Incli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nations
to have exerted and display'd themselves.</p>
            <p>THE Foundation of <hi>Diogenes</hi>'s Conduct was to
render himself an independent Being as much as
possible, and to confine all his Wants and Desires and
Pleasures within himself and his own Mind: The
Aim of <hi>Pascal</hi> was to keep a perpetual Sense of his
Dependance before his Eyes, and never to forget his
numberless Wants and Necessities. The Antient
supported himself by Magnanimity, Ostentation,
Pride, and the Idea of his own Superiority above
his Fellow-creatures. The Modern made constant
Profession of Humility and Abasement, of the Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tempt
and Hatred of himself; and endeavour'd to
attain these suppos'd Virtues, as far as they are at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tainable.
The Austerities of the <hi>Greek</hi> were in order
to inure himself to Hardships, and prevent his ever
suffering: Those of the <hi>Frenchman</hi> were embrac'd
merely for their own Sake, and in order to suffer as
much as possible. The Philosopher indulg'd himself in
the most beastly Pleasures, even in public: The Saint
refus'd himself the most innocent, even in private:
The former thought it his Duty to love his Friends,
and to rail at them, and reprove them, and scold
them: The latter endeavour'd to be absolutely in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>different
towards his nearest Relations, and to love
and speak well of his Enemies. The great Object
<pb n="253" facs="253"/>
of <hi>Diogenes</hi>'s Wit was every Kind of Superstition,
that is, every Kind of Religion known in his Time.
The Mortality of the Soul was his Standard Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciple;
and even his Sentiments of a Divine Provi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dence
seem to have been very licentious. The most
ridiculous Superstitions directed <hi>Pascal</hi>'s Faith and
Practice; and an extreme Contempt of this Life, in
Comparison of the future, was the chief Foundation
of his Conduct.</p>
            <p>IN such a remarkable Contrast do these two Men
stand: Yet both of them have met with universal
Admiration in their different Ages, and have been
propos'd as Models of Imitation. Where then is
the universal Standard of Morals, which you talk
of? And what Rule shall we establish for the many
different, nay contrary Sentiments of Mankind?</p>
            <p>AN Experiment, said I, that succeeds in the Air,
will not always succeed in a Vacuum. When Men
depart from the Maxims of common Reason, and
affect these <hi>artificial</hi> Lives, as you call them, no-one
can answer for what will please or displease them.
They are in a different Element from the rest of
Mankind; and the natural Principles of their Mind
play not with the same Regularity, as if left to them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves,
free from the Illusions of religious Superstition
or philosophical Enthusiasm.</p>
