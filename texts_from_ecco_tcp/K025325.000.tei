            <p>I HAVE two motives for inscribing this piece to you, gratitude and vanity; gra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>titude, because it's success has been greatly owing to your judicious advice; and vanity, because I wish to acquaint the world that such a character as <hi>Mr. Garrick,</hi> has been warmly the friend of his sincerely affectionate,</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE,</head>
            <byline>Written by DAVID GARRICK, Esq.
<note place="bottom" n="*">Mr. Kelly originally intended the prologue to be grave, and accor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dingly wrote a serious one himself; but as Mr. King was to speak it, Mr. Garrick, with great propriety, thought a piece of humour would be best suited to the talents of that excellent actor, and therefore very kindly took the trouble of putting it into a form so entirely different from the first, that it cannot, with the least justice, be attributed to any other author.</note>
            </byline>
            <stage>Spoken by Mr. KING.</stage>
            <sp>
               <l>I'M vex'd—quite vex'd — and you'll be vex'd—that's worse;</l>
               <l>To deal with <hi>stubborn scribblers!</hi> there's the curse!</l>
               <l>Write <hi>moral</hi> plays — the blockhead! — why, good people,</l>
               <l>You'll soon expect this house to wear a steeple!</l>
               <l>For our fine piece, to let you into facts,</l>
               <l>Is quite a <hi>Sermon,</hi> — only preach'd in <hi>Acts.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>You'll scarce believe me, 'till the proof appears,</l>
               <l>But even I, Tom Fool, must shed some tears:</l>
               <l>Do, Ladies, lock upon me — nay, no simp'ring —</l>
               <l>Think you this face was ever made for whimp'ring?</l>
               <l>Can I, a cambrick handkerchief display, —</l>
               <l>Thump my unfeeling breast, and roar away?</l>
               <l>Why <hi>this</hi> is <hi>comical,</hi> perhaps he'll say —</l>
               <l>Resolving this strange aukward bard to pump,</l>
               <l>I ask'd him what he meant? — He somewhat plump,</l>
               <l>New purs'd his belly, and his lips thus biting,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I must keep up the dignity of writing!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>You may, but, if you do, Sir, I must tell ye,</l>
               <l>You'll not keep up that dignity of belly;</l>
               <l>Still he preach'd on. — "<hi>Bards of a former age</hi>

                  <hi>Held up abandon'd pictures on the stage,</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>Spread out their wit, with facinating art,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And catch'd the fancy, to corrupt the heart;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>But happy change! — in these more moral days,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>You cannot sport with virtue, even in plays;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>On virtue's side, his pen the poet draws,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And boldly asks a hearing for his cause."</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Thus did he prance, and swell. — The man may prate,</l>
               <l>And feed these whimsies in his addle pate,</l>
               <l>That you'll protect his muse, because she's good,</l>
               <l>A virgin, and so chaste! — O Lud! O' Lud!</l>
               <l>No muse the Critic Beadle's lash escapes,</l>
               <l>Though virtuous, if a dowdy, and a trapes:</l>
               <l>If <hi>his</hi> come forth, a decent likely Lass,</l>
               <l>You'll speak her fair, and grant the proper pass;</l>
               <l>Or should his brain be turn'd with wild pretences;</l>
               <l>In three hours time, you'll bring him to his senses;</l>
               <l>And well you may, when in your power you get him,</l>
               <l>In that short space, you blister, bleed, and sweat him.</l>
               <l>Among the <hi>Turks,</hi> indeed, he'd run no danger,</l>
               <l>They sacred hold a <hi>madman,</hi> and a <hi>stranger.</hi>

               <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
               <p>STILL I can't help thinking but Lady Betty Lambton's refusal was infinitely more the result of an extraordinary delicacy, than the want of affection for your Lordship.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>WINWORTH.</speaker>
               <p>O my dear cousin you are very much mistaken; I am not one of those coxcombs who imagine a woman does'nt know her own mind, or who, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause they are treated with civility by a lady who has rejected their addresses, suppose she is secretly debating in their favour: Lady Betty is a woman of sense, and must consequently despise coquetry or affectation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
               <p>Why she always speaks of you with the greatest respect.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="2" facs="8"/>
               <speaker>WINWORTH.</speaker>
               <p>Respect! — Why she always speaks of you with the greatest respect; does it therefore follow that she loves you? No Charles — I have, for some time you know, ceas'd to trouble Lady Betty with my solicitations, and I see myself honour'd with her friendship, though I hav'nt been so hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>py as to merit her heart; for this reason I have no doubt of her assistance on the present occasion, and I am certain I shall please her by making my addresses to Miss Marchmont.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
               <p>Miss Marchmont is indeed a very deserving young woman.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>WINWORTH.</speaker>
               <p>Next to Lady Betty I never saw one so form'd to my wishes; besides, during the whole period of my fruitless attendance, she seemed so interested for my success, and express'd so hearty a concern for my disappointment, that I have consider'd her with an eye of more than common friendship ever since. — But what's the matter with you Charles, you seem to have something upon your spirits?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed my Lord you are mistaken, I am only attentive.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>WINWORTH.</speaker>
               <p>O, is that all! — This very day I purpose to request Lady Betty's interest with Miss March<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mont, for unhappily circumstanc'd as she is, with regard to fortune, she possesses an uncommon share of delicacy, and may possibly think herself
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>insulted by the offer of a rejected heart; — Lady Betty in that case will save her the pain of a supposed disrespect, and me the mortification of a new repulse. But I beg your pardon, Charles, I am forgetting the cause of friendship, and shall now step up stairs to Colonel Rivers about your affair. — Ah Sidney you have no difficulties to obstruct the completion of your wishes, and a few days must make you one of the happist men in England.</p>

               <p>A few days make me one of the happiest men in England, — a likely matter truly; little does he know how I passionately admire the very wo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man to whom he is immediately going with an offer of his person and fortune. — The marriage with Miss Rivers I see is unavoidable, and I am almost pleased that I never obtained any encou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ragement from Miss Marchmont, as I should now be reduc'd to the painful alternative, either of giving up my own hopes, or of opposing the happiness of such a friend.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
               <p>Upon my word my face is very much oblig'd to you.</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>And so you ought. — But for all that you and Lady Betty are unaccountably fond of those half-soul'd fellows, who are as mechanically regular as so many pieces of clock-work, and never strike above once an hour upon a new observation — who are so sentimental, and so dull — so wise and so drowsy. — Why I thought Lady Betty had al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ready a sufficient quantity of lead in her family without taking in this lump to increase the weight of it.</p>

               <p>Colonel, your most obedient: — I am come upon the old business; —for unless I am allow'd to entertain hope of Miss Rivers, I shall be the most miserable of human beings.</p>

               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>Sir Harry, I have already told you by letter, and I now tell you personally, I cannot listen to your proposals.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir, — I have promised my daughter to Mr. Sidney; — do you know that, Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
               <p>I do; — but what then? Engagements of this kind, you know —</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>So then, you do know I have promised her to Mr. Sidney?</p>

               <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
               <p>I do; — but I also know that matters are not finally settled between Mr. Sidney and you, and I moreover know, that his fortune is by no means equal to mine, therefore —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>Sir Harry, let me ask you one question before you make your consequence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
               <p>A thousand if you please, Sir.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>Why then, Sir, let me ask you, what you have ever observed in me or my conduct, that you de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sire me so familiarly to break my word: — I thought, Sir, you considered me as a man of honour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
               <p>And so I do, Sir, a man of the nicest honour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>And yet, Sir, you ask me to violate the sanctity of my word — and tell me indirectly that it is my interest to be a rascal —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
               <p>I really don't understand you, Colonel: — I thought, when I was talking to you I was talk<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to a man who knew the world — and as you have not yet signed —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>Why, this is mending matters with a witness! — And so you think because I am not legally bound, I am under no necessity of keeping my word! — Sir Harry, laws were never made for men of honour; — they want no bond but the
<pb n="16" facs="22"/>rectitude of their own sentiments, and laws are of no use but to bind the villains of society.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
               <p>Well! but my dear Colonel, if you have no regard for me, shew some little regard for your daughter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>Sir Harry, I shew the greatest regard for my daughter by giving her to a man of honour; — and I must not be insulted with any farther repetition of your proposals.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
               <p>Insult you Colonel! — is the offer of my al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liance an insult? — is my readiness to make what settlements you think proper —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>Sir Harry, I should consider the offer of a kingdom an insult, if it was to be purchased by the violation of my word: — Besides, though my daughter shall never go a beggar to the arms of her husband, I wou'd rather see her happy than rich; and if she has enough to provide handsome<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly for a young family, and something to spare for the exigencies of a worthy friend, I shall think her as affluent as if she was mistress of Mexico.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Colonel, I have done; — but I believe —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Sir Harry, and as our conference is done, we will, if you please, retire to the ladies: — I shall be always glad of your acquaintance though I can't receive you as a son-in-law, — for a union of interest I look upon as a union of dishonour, and consider a marriage for money, at best, but a legal prostitution.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>LORD, Lord, my dear you're enough to drive one out of one's wits. — I tell you, again and again, he's as much yours as ever; and was I in your situation, he shou'd be my husband to-morrow morning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
               <p>Dear Emmy you mistake the matter strangely. — Lord Winworth is no common man, nor wou'd he have continued his silence so long upon his favourite subject, if he had the least inclination to renew his addresses. — His pride has justly taken the alarm at my insensibility, and he will not, I am satisfied, run the hazard of another refusal.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>Why then, in the name of wonder, if he was so dear to you, cou'd you prodigally trifle with your own happiness, and repeatedly refuse him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
               <p>I have repeatedly told you because I was a fool, Emmy. — Till he withdrew his addresses I knew not how much I esteemed him; my unhappiness in my first marriage, you know, made me resolve against another. — And you are also sensible I have frequently argued that a woman of real de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>licacy shou'd never admit a second impression on her heart.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="18" facs="24"/>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and I always thought you argued very foolishly. — I am sure I ought to know, for I have been twice married; — and though I lov'd my first husband very sincerely, there was not a woman in England who cou'd have made the second a better wife. — Nay, for that matter, if another was to offer himself to-morrow, I am not altogether certain that I should refuse listening —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
               <p>You are a strange creature.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>And are'nt you a much stranger, in declining to follow your own inclinations, when you cou'd have consulted them so highly, to the credit of your good sense, and the satisfaction of your whole family. — But it is'nt yet too late; and if you will be advised by me every thing shall end as happily as you can wish.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
               <p>Well, let me hear your advice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>Why this, then: — My Lord you know has requested that you wou'd indulge him with half an hour's private conversation some time this morning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
               <p>Well!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>This is a liberty he has'nt taken these three months — and he must design something by it; — now as he can design nothing but to renew his addresses, I wou'd advise you to take
<pb n="19" facs="25"/>him at the very first word, for fear your delicacy, if it has time to consider, shou'd again shew you the strange impropriety of second marriages.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
               <p>But suppose this should not be his business with me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>Why then we'll go another way to work: — I, as a sanguine friend of my Lord's, can give him a distant hint of matters, exacting at the same time a promise of the most inviolable secrecy; and assuring him you wou'd never forgive me, if you had the least idea of my having acquainted him with so important a —</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
               <p>And so you wou'd have me —?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>Why not? — This is the very step I shou'd take myself, if I was in your situation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
               <p>May be so: — But it's a step which I shall never take. — What! wou'd you have me lost to all feeling? Wou'd you have me meanly make use of chambermaid artifices for a husband?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY:</speaker>
               <p>I would only have you happy my dear: — And where the man of one's heart is at stake I don't think we ought to stand so rigidly upon trifles. —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
               <p>Trifles, Emmy! do you call the laws of de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>licacy trifles. — She that violates these —</p>

               <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
               <p>But sha'nt I know it myself, Emmy! — and how can I escape the justice of my own reflections!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>Well, thank heav'n my sentiments are not suf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficiently refin'd to make me unhappy.</p>

               <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
               <p>I can't change my sentiments, my dear Emmy, — nor wou'd I, if I cou'd: — Of this, however, be certain, that unless I have Lord Winworth without courting him, I shall never have him at all. — But be silent to all the world upon this matter I conjure you: — Particularly to Miss Marchmont; for she has been so strenuous an advocate for my Lord, that the concealment of it from her might give her some doubts of my friendship; and I shou'd be continually uneasy for fear my reserve shou'd be consider'd as an indirect insult upon her circumstances.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>Well, the devil take this delicacy; I don't know any thing it does besides making people miserable: — And yet some how, foolish as it is, one can't help liking it. — But yonder I see Sir Harry and Mr. Cecil.</p>

               <p>Discover it to her father — why sure you woud'nt think of it. — Take care Cecil — take care — I do indeed love you better than any man in the world — and I know you have a friendship, a cordial friendship for me — but the happiness of my whole life is at stake, and must not be de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stroyed by any of your unaccountable peculiarities.</p>

               <p>Harry — you know I wou'd at any time rather promote your happiness than obstruct it. — And you also know that if I die without children — you shall have a principal part of my fortune; — but damn it — I wish you had not used the mask of friendship to steal this young Lady away from her relations — 'tis hard that their good nature
<pb n="24" facs="30"/>must be turned against their peace; — and hard, because her whole family treat you with regard, that you should offer them the greatest insult ima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ginable.</p>

               <p>Dear Cecil, I am more to be pitied than con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>demned in this transaction. — when I first endea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>voured to make myself agreeable to Miss Rivers, I imagined her family would readily countenance my addresses, and when I succeeded in that en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deavour, I had not time to declare myself in form, before her father entred into this engagement with Sidney. — The moment I heard it mention<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, I wrote to him, offering him a <hi>carte blanche,</hi> and this morning a repetition of my offer was treated with contempt. — I have therefore been forc'd into the measure you disapprove so much— but I hope my conduct, in the character of the son-in-law, will amply atone for any error in my behaviour as a friend.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>CECIL.</speaker>
               <p>Well well, we must make the best of a bad market, — her father has no right to force her inclinations; — 'tis equally cruel and unjust; there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore you may depend upon my utmost endeavours not only to assist you in carrying her off, but in appeasing all family resentments. — For really, you are so often in the wrong, that one must stand by you a little when you are in the right, — so I shall be ready for you kinsman.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Cecil, this is honest — this is really friendly — and you shall abuse me a whole twelvemonth without my answering a syllable —
<pb n="25" facs="31"/>but for the present I must leave you — yonder I see Miss Rivers — we have some little matters to talk of — you understand me — and now —</p>

               <p>For a torrent of rapture and nonsense. — What egregious puppies does this unaccountable love make of young fellows: Nay, for that matter, what egregious puppies does it not make of old ones? — <hi>ecce signum.</hi> — 'Tis a comfort though, that no body knows I am a puppy in this respect but myself. — Here was I fancying that all the partiality I felt for poor Hortensia Marchmont, proceeded from my friendship for her father — when upon an honest examination into my own heart — I find it principally arises from my regard for herself. — I was in hopes a change of objects would have driven the baggage out of my thoughts, — and I went to France; — but I am come home with a settled resolution of asking her to marry a slovenly rascal of fifty, who is to be sure a very likely swain for a young lady to fall in love with; — but who knows — the most sensible women have sometimes strange tastes; — and yet it must be a very strange taste, that can possibly approve of my overtures. — I'll go cautiously to work however, — and solicit her as for a friend of my own age and fortune; — so that if she refuses me, which is probable enough — I shan't expose myself to her contempt. — What a ridiculous figure is an old fool sighing at the feet of a young woman. — Zounds, I wonder how the grey-headed dotards have the impudence to ask a blooming girl of twenty to throw herself away upon a moving mummy, or a walking skeleton.</p>

               <p>Why what can I do? If it was improper for me, before I knew any thing of his design in re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard to Miss Marchmont, to insinuate the least desire of hearing him again on the subject of his heart, 'tis doubly improper now, when I see he has turn'd his thoughts on another woman, and when this woman, besides, is one of my most valuable friends.</p>

               <p>Well, courage Lady Betty — we are'nt yet in a desperate situation — Miss Marchmont loves you — as herself — and woud'nt, I dare say, accept the first man in the world, if it gave you the least uneasiness. — I'll go to her therefore this very moment — tell her at once how the case is — and my life for it, her obligations to you —</p>

               <p>IN close conversation with Sir Harry this half hour, at the remotest part of the garden. — Why, what am I to think of all this. — Does'nt she know I have refused him: — Does'nt she know herself engaged to Sidney? — There's something mean and pitiful in suspicion: — But still there is something that alarms me in this affair; and who knows how far the happiness of my child may be at stake. — Women, after all, are strange things; — they have more sense than we generally allow them — but they have also more vanity. — 'Tis'nt for want of understanding they err, — but through an insatiable love of slattery. — They know very well when they are committing a fault, but destruction wears so bewitching a form, that they rebel against the sense of their own conviction — and never trouble themselves about consequences till they are actully undone. — But here they come, — I don't like this listening: — Yet the meanness of the action must for once be justified by the necessity.</p>

               <p>Indeed, Sir Harry, you upbraid me very unjustly. — I feel the refusal which my father has given you severely. — Nevertheless I must not consent to you proposal. — An elopement wou'd, I am sure,

               <p>Because I was in hopes my father would have listen'd to your application, without putting me to the painful necessity of acknowledging my sentiments in your favour; and because I fear'd that unless the application was approved, on ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count of it's intrinsic generosity, there was no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing which cou'd possibly work upon the firmness of his temper.</p>

               <p>Sally, I insist that when you speak of my father, you always speak of him with respect. — 'Tis'nt your knowledge of secrets which shall justi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fy these freedoms; — for I wou'd rather every

               <p>Well Madam, I beg pardon; — but you know the Colonel, where he once determines is never to be alter'd; — so that call this steadiness of temper by what name you please — 'tis likely to make you miserable, unless you embrace the present opportunity, and go off, like a woman of spirit, with the object of your affections.</p>

               <p>Indeed, my dear Miss Rivers, Sally advises you like a true friend; — and I am satisfied your own good sense must secretly argue on her side the question. — The only alternative you have is to fly and be happy — or stay and be miserable: — You have yourself acknowledg'd my ever adorable. —</p>

               <p>From what I have urg'd you must see, Madam, that though you are so ready to sacrifice your peace for your father, he sets a greater value upon a trifing promise than upon your happiness: —
<pb n="39" facs="45"/>Judge, therefore, whether his repose should be dearer to you, than your own; and judge too whether to prevent the breach of his word, you shou'd vow eternal tenderness to a man you must eternally detest, and violate even your veracity to kill the object of your love?</p>

               <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
               <p>The Colonel, Madam, has great sensibility, and the consciousness that he himself has been the cause of your unhappiness will sill him with endless regret: — Whereas, by escaping with me, the case will be utterly otherwise. — When he sees we are inseparably united, and hears with how unabating an assiduity I labour to merit the blessing of your hand, a little time will necessarily make us friends; and I have great hopes that before the end of three months we shall be the favourites of the whole family.</p>

               <p>O, Sir!

               <speaker>Miss MARCHMONT.</speaker>
               <p>Dear Sir, I have always considered you with reverence, and it would make me inconceivably wretched if you imagin'd I was actuated upon this occasion by any ridiculous singularity of senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment. — I wou'd do much to please you, — and I scarcely know what I should refuse to Lady Betty's
<pb n="46" facs="52"/>request; — but, Sir, though it distresses me ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceedingly to discover it, — I must tell you I have not a heart to dispose of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>CECIL.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Miss MARCHMONT.</speaker>
               <p>At the same time, I must however, tell you, that my affections are so plac'd as to make it wholly impossible for me ever to change my situation. — This acknowledgment of a prepossession, Sir, may be inconsistent with the nice reserve which is proper for my sex, — but it is necessary to justify me in a case where my gratitude might be reasonably sus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pected, and when I recollect to whom it is made, I hope it will be doubly entitled to an excuse.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>CECIL.</speaker>
               <p>Your candour, Hortensia, needs no apology, — but as you have trusted me thus far with your secret, — may'nt I know why you can have no prospect of being united to the object of your affections?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miss MARCHMONT.</speaker>
               <p>Because, Sir, he is engaged to a most deserv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing young lady, and will be married to her in a few days: — In short, Mr. Sidney is the Man for whom I entertain this secret partiality: — You see, therefore, that my partiality is hopeless, — but you see, at the same time, how utterly im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proper it would be for me to give a lifeless hand to another while he is entirely master of my af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fections. — It would be a meanness of which I think myself incapable, and I should be quite un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>worthy the honour of any deserving hand, if, cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstanc'd in this manner, I could basely stoop to accept it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Miss MARCHMONT.</speaker>
               <p>None in the least. — Before the match with Miss Rivers was in agitation he made addresses to me, though privately; and, I must own, his ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derness, join'd to his good qualities, soon gave me impressions in his favour. — But, Sir, I was a poor orphan, wholly dependant upon the generosity of others, and he was a younger brother of a fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mily, great in his birth, but contracted in his circumstances. — What cou'd I do? — It was not in my power to make his fortune, — and I had too much pride, or too much affection, to think of destroying it.</p>

               <speaker>CECIL.</speaker>
               <p>You are a good girl, — a very good girl; — but surely if Lady Betty knows any thing of this matter there can be no danger of her recommend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Lord Winworth so earnestly to your atten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion. —</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Miss MARCHMONT.</speaker>
               <p>There, Sir, is my principle misfortune. — Lady Betty is, of all persons, the least proper to be made acquainted with it. — Her heart is in the marriage between Miss Rivers and Mr. Sidney; and, had she the least idea of my senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timents for him, or of his inclination for me, I am positive it would immediately frustrate the match. — On this account, Sir, I have carefully con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cealed the secret of my wishes, — and, on this account, I must still continue to conceal it. — My heart shall break before it shall be worthless;
<pb n="48" facs="54"/>— and I should detest myself for ever if I was ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pable of establishing my own peace at the expence of my benefactress's first wish, and the desire of her whole family.</p>

               <speaker>Miss MARCHMONT.</speaker>
               <p>My life was mark'd out early by calamity, — and the first light I beheld was purchas'd with the loss of a mother. — The grave snatched away the best of fathers just as I came to know the value of such a blessing; — and had'nt it been for the exalted goodness of others, I, who once expe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rienc'd the unspeakable pleasure of relieving the necessitous, had myself, perhaps, felt the imme<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diate want of bread; — and shall I ungratefully sting the bosom which has thus benevolently cherished me? — Shall I basely wound the peace of those who have rescu'd me from despair, — and stab at their tranquility in the very moment they honour me with protection? — O, Mr. Cecil! they deserve every sacrifice which I can make. — May the benignant hand of Providence shower endless happiness upon their heads, and may the sweets of a still-encreasing felicity be their portion, whatever becomes of me!</p>

               <p>Upon my word, my dear, you are extremely difficult in your choice, and if Lord Winworth is not capable of inspiring you with tenderness — I don't know who is likely to succeed; for, in my opinion, there is not a man in England posses<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sed of more personal accomplishments.</p>

               <p>Well, my dear, I see your emotion — and I heartily beg your pardon for saying so much. — I should be inexpressibly concern'd if I thought you made any sacrifice on this occasion to me. — My Lord, to be sure, possesses a very high place in my esteem, — but —</p>

               <p>THUS far, my dear Emmy, there is a gleam of hope. — She determined, posi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tively determined, against my Lord: — And even suspected so little of my partiality for him, that she appeared under the greatest anxiety lest I should be offended with her refusing him: — And yet, shall I own my folly to you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>Pray do, my dear; — you'll scarcely believe it, — but I have follies of my own sometimes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
               <p>Why you quite surprize me!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very true for all that. — But to your business.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
               <p>Why then, greatly as I dreaded her appro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bation of the proposal, — I was secretly hurt at her insensibility to the personal attractions of his Lordship.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>I don't doubt, it my dear. — We think all the world should love what we are in love with ourselves.</p>

               <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
               <p>Your are right. — And though I was happy to find her resolution so agreeable to my wishes, my pride was not a little piqu'd to find it possible for her to refuse a man upon whom I had so ardently plac'd my own affection. — The surprize which I felt on this account threw a warmth into my expressions, and made the generous girl appre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hensive that I was offended with her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>Well, this is a strange world we live in. — That a woman without a shilling shou'd refuse an Earl with a fine person, and a great estate is the most surprizing affair I ever heard of. — Perhaps, Lady Betty, my Lord may take it in his head to go round the family: — If he should, my turn is next, and I assure you, he shall meet with a very different reception.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>Why no! — Not very cruel. — I might give myself a few airs at first. — I might blush a little, and look down. — Wonder what he cou'd find in me to attract his attention: — Then pulling up my head, with a toss of disdain, — desire him, if ever he spoke to me on that subject again, —</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but hear him out: — <q>Mrs. Nelson, I know as much of my Lord's mind as any body; let him mary whom he pleases, he'll never be rightly happy but with her Ladyship; and I'd give a hundred guineas, with all my soul, that it cou'd be a match.</q> — These Nel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son tells me were his very words. — Arnold is an intelligent fellow, and much in the confidence of his master.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>O, Sally, you can't conceive my distress in this critical situation. — An elopement even from a tyrannical father, has something in it which must shock a delicate mind. — But when a woman flies from the protection of a parent, who merits the utmost return of her affection, she must be insen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sible indeed, if she does not feel the sincerest re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gret: — If he shoud'nt forgive me! —</p>

You now fly from these arms which have cherished you with so much tenderness, when gratitude, generosity and na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture, should have twin'd me round your heart. —</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>Look back, infatuated child, upon my whole conduct since your approach to maturity: Hav'n't I contracted my own enjoyments on purpose to enlarge yours, and watched your very looks to anticipate your inclinations? Have I ever, with the obstinacy of other fathers, been partial in favour of any man to whom you made the slightest objection. — Or have I ever shewn
<pb n="65" facs="71"/>the least design of forcing your wishes to my own humour or caprice? On the contrary has'nt the engagement I have enter'd into been carried on<gap resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">
                     <desc>illegible</desc>
                  </gap> seemingly with your own approbation. — And hav'n't you always appeared reconciled at least to a marriage with Mr. Sidney?</p>

               <p>How then, Theodora, have I merited a treat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment of this nature? You have understanding, my dear, though you want filial affection, and my arguments must have weight with your reason, however my tranquility may be the object of your contempt.—I lov'd you, Theodora, with the warm<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>est degree of paternal tenderness, and flatter'd myself the proofs I every day gave of that tender<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, had made my peace of mind a matter of some importance to my child. — But, alas! a pal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try compliment from a coxcomb undoes the whole labour of my life; and the daughter whom I looked upon as the support of my declining years, betrays me in the unsuspecting hour of security, and rewards with her person, the assassin who stabs me to the heart. —</p>

               <p>I do not come here, Theodora, to stop your flight, or put the smallest impediment in the way of your wishes. — Your person is your own, and I scorn to detain even my daughter by force, where she is not bound to me by inclination. — Since therefore neither duty nor discretion, a regard for my peace, nor a solicitude for your own wel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fare,
<pb n="66" facs="72"/>are able to detain you, — go to this man, who has taught you to obliterate the sentiments of nature, and gain'd a ready way to your heart, by expressing a contempt for your father. — Go to him boldly, my child, and laugh at the pangs which tear this unhappy bosom. — Be uniform<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly culpable, nor add the baseness of a despica<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble slight to the unpardonable want of a filial affection.</p>

               <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
               <p>I AM deeply sensible of Miss Rivers's very great merit, Sir; — but —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>But what, Sir, —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
               <p>Hear me with temper, I beseech you, Colonel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>Hear you with temper: — I don't know whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther I shall be able to hear you with temper; — but go on, Sir. —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
               <p>Miss Rivers, independent of her very affluent fortune, Colonel, has beauty and merit which would make her alliance a very great honour to the first family in the kingdom — But, notwith<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>standing my admiration of her beauty, and my reverence for her merit, I find it utterly impossible to prosit either by her goodness, or your generosity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>How is all this, Sir! do you decline a mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riage with my daughter?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
               <p>A marriage with Miss Rivers, Sir, was once the object of my highest ambition, and, had I been honoured with her hand, I should have studied to shew my sensibility of a blessing so invaluble; — but, at that time, I did not sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose
<pb n="73" facs="79"/>my happiness to be incompatible with her's. — I am now convinced that is so, and it becomes me much better to give up my own hopes, than to offer the smallest violence to her inclinations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>Death and hell, Sir! — what do you mean by this behaviour? — Shall I prefer your alliance to any man's in England? — Shall my daughter even express a readiness to marry you? — and shall you, after this, insolently tell me you don't choose to accept her? —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
               <p>Dear Colonel, you totally misconceive my mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive, — and, I am sure, upon reflexion, you will rather approve than condemn it — A man of common humanity, Sir, in a treaty of marriage, should consult the lady's wishes as well as his own, and, if he can't make her happy, he will scorn to make her miserable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>Scorn to make her miserable! — why the fel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low's mad, I believe — Does'nt the girl absolute<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly consent to have you? — Would you have her drag you to the altar by force? — Would you have her fall at your feet, and beg of you, with tears, to pity one of the finest women, with one of the best fortunes, in England?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
               <p>Your vehemence, Sir, prevents you from con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sidering this matter in a proper light. — Miss Rivers is sufficiently unhappy in losing the man of her heart, but her distress must be greatly ag<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gravated, if, in the moment she is most keenly sensible of this loss, she is compelled to marry an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>other. — Besides, Colonel, I must have my seel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings
<pb n="74" facs="80"/>too. — There is something shocking in a union with a woman whose affections we know to be alienated; and 'tis difficult to say which is most entitled to contempt, he that stoops to accept of a pre-engaged mind, or he that puts up with a prostituted person.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>Mighty well, Sir, — mighty well; but let me tell you, Mr. Sidney, — that under this specious appearance of generosity I can easily see your your motive for this refusal of my daughter, — let me tell you I can easily see your motive, Sir, — and, let me tell you, that the person who is in possession of your affections shall no longer find an asylum in this house.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
               <p>Colonel, if I had not been always accustomed to respect you, — and if I did not even consi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der this insult as a kind of compliment, I don't know how I should put up with it: as to your insinuation, you must be more explicit before I can understand you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>Miss Marchmont, — Sir. — Do you understand me now, Sir? If Miss Marchmont had not been in the case my daughter had not received this in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sult. — Sir Harry was right; and had not I been ridiculously besotted with your hypocritical plau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sibility I might have seen it sooner, but your cou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sin shall know of your behaviour, and then, Sir, you shall answer me as a man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
               <p>Miss Marchmont, Colonel, is greatly above this illiberal reflexion; as for myself, I shall be always ready to justify an action which I know to
<pb n="75" facs="81"/>be right, though I should be sorry ever to meet you but in the character of a friend.</p>

               <p>What a ridiculous bustle is there here about de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>licacy and stuff—your people of refin'd sentiments are the most troublesome creatures in the world to deal with, and their friends must even commit a violence upon their nicety before they can con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>descend to study their own happiness: — But have you done as we concerted?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I have pretended to Lady Betty that my Lord desires to speak with her privately on busi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness of the utmost importance; and I have told his Lordship that she wants to see him, to disclose a secret that must intirely break off the intended marriage with Miss Marchmont.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>I did not think that Mrs. Harley could be ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pable of such an action; — but since she has told you of the only circumstance which I ever wish'd to be conceal'd, I cannot deny my partiality for your Lordship.</p>

               <p>This secret was trusted with her, and her alone; but though she has ungenerously discover'd it, her end will still be disappointed.

               <p>Hold, my Lord — I guess what you are about, but you shan't monopolize generosity I assure you: — I have a right to shew my friendship as well as your Lordship; so, after your kinsman's marriage, whatever you have a mind to do for him shall be equalled, on my part, for Miss Marchmont; guinea for guinea, as far as you will, and let's see who tires first in going through with it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>WINWORTH.</speaker>
               <p>A noble challange, and I accept it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lady BETTY.</speaker>
               <p>No, there's no bearing this —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miss MARCHMONT.</speaker>
               <p>Speak to them, Mr. Sidney, for I cannot —</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>SIDNEY.</speaker>
               <p>I wish I had words to declare my sense of this goodness.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>I did'nt look upon myself as a very pitiful fellow; but I am strangely sunk in my own opi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nion since I have been a witness of this transaction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>CECIL.</speaker>
               <p>Why what the devil is there in all this to won<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der at? People of fortune often throw away thousands at the hazard table to make themselves miserable, and nobody ever accuses them of ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nerosity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>WINWORTH.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. Cecil is perfectly right, and he is the best manager of a fortune who is most attentive to the wants of the deserving.</p>

               <p>Why now all is as it shou'd be — all is as it shou'd be — this is the triumph of good sense over delicacy. — I could cry for downright joy: — I wonder what ails me — this is all my doing!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>CECIL.</speaker>
               <p>No, — part of it is mine, — and I think it ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tremely happy for your people of refin'd senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments to have friends with a little common under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>standing.</p>

               <p>Sister, I always thought you a woman of sense.—</p>

               <speaker>Mrs HARLEY.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, she has been a long time intimate with me you know.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>CECIL.</speaker>
               <p>Well said, sauce-box.</p>

               <speaker>Sir HARRY.</speaker>
               <p>If this story was to be represented on the stage the poet would think it his duty to punish me for life, because I was once culpable.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>WINWORTH.</speaker>
               <p>That wou'd be very wrong. The stage shou'd be a school of morality; and the noblest of all lessons is the forgiveness of injuries.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>RIVERS.</speaker>
               <p>True, my Lord. — But the principal moral to be drawn from the transactions of to-day is, that those who generously labour for the happiness of others, will, sooner or later, arrive at happiness themselves.</p>

               <l>And you, I'm sure, will join before you go,</l>
               <l>To maul <hi>False Modesty,</hi> — from <hi>Dublin</hi> ho!</l>
               <l>Where are these <hi>Lady Lambtons</hi> to be found?</l>
               <l>Not in these riper times, on English ground.</l>
               <l>Among the various flowers, which sweetly blow,</l>
               <l>To charm the eyes, at <hi>Almack's</hi> and <hi>Soho,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Pray does that weed, <hi>False Delicacy,</hi> grow?</l>
               <l>O, No. —</l>
               <l>Among the fair of fashion; common breeding,</l>
               <l>Is there one bosom, where <hi>love lies a bleeding?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>In <hi>olden</hi> times your grannams unrefin'd,</l>
               <l>Ty'd up the tongue, put padlocks on the mind;</l>
               <l>O, Ladies, thank your stars, there's nothing now confin'd.</l>
               <l>In love you <hi>English</hi> Men, — there's no concealing,</l>
               <l>Are most, like <hi>Winworth,</hi> simple in your dealing;</l>
               <l>But <hi>Britons,</hi> in their natures, as their names,</l>
               <l>Are different as the <hi>Shanon, Tweed,</hi> and <hi>Thames.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>As the <hi>Tweed</hi> flows, the bonny <hi>Scot</hi> proceeds,</l>
               <l>Wunds slaw, and sure, and nae obstruction heeds;</l>
               <l>Though oft repuls'd, his purpose still hauds fast,</l>
               <l>Stecks like a burr, and wuns the Lass at last.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Shannon,</hi> rough and vigorous, pours along,</l>
               <l>Like the bold accents of brave <hi>Paddy's</hi> tongue:</l>
               <l>Arrah, dear creature — can you scorn me so?</l>
               <l>Cast your sweet eyes upon me, top and toe!</l>
               <l>Not fancy <hi>me?</hi> — Pooh! — that's all game and laughter,</l>
               <l>First marry me, my jew'l — ho! — you'll love me after.</l>
               <l>Like his own <hi>Thames,</hi> honest <hi>John Trot,</hi> their brother,</l>
               <l>More quick than <hi>one,</hi> and much less bold than t'other,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Gentle not dull,</hi> his loving arms will spread;</l>
               <l>But stopt — in willows hides his bashful head;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>John</hi> leaves his home, resolv'd to tell his pain;</l>
               <l>Hesitates — I — love — <hi>fye, Sir — 'tis in vain,</hi> —</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>John</hi> blushes, turns him round, and whistles home again.</l>
