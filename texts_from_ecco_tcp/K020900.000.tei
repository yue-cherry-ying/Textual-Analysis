            <p>THE favourable reception which the fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowing Comedy has met with from a candid and generous Public, calls for my warmest acknowledgements; and tho' it may be of little consequence to them to know the source of so slight an amusement, I think myself bound by truth and gratitude to own, that the first idea of this Piece was hinted to me by my ever-respected and lamented friend Mr. GARRICK, who mentioned GOLDONI's <hi>Bourru Bienfaisant,</hi> as a sketch that, if adapted to our times and manners, might be rendered pleasing to an English Audience. Those who have read the French Piece must judge how far I have profited by GOLDONI's work; but of this I am certain, that had Mr. GARRICK lived to afford me that friendly assistance which he has done on former occasions, my Comedy would have been more worthy of the reception with which it has been honoured. I will, however, hope that, <q>with all its imperfec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions on its head,</q> the same indulgence which attended its representation, will follow it into the closet; and that the Reader will allow me the only merit I presume to claim, that of meaning well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="4"/>
I gladly take this opportunity of returning my thanks to my much-esteemed friend, Mr. SHERIDAN, senior, for his kind attention to the getting up my Play, my ill health not permitting me to attend one Rehearsal. But Mr. SHERIDAN's friendship, wherever pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fessed, is not of modern growth.</p>
            <p>I have more than common acknowledge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments to make to all the Performers in my Comedy; particularly to Mrs. ABINGTON and Miss POPE, who both chearfully undertook Parts out of their usual line of acting, and in which they have both excelled. I should be utterly unable to express my sentiments of Mr. KING, in the character of SIR WILLIAM WOODLEY, if I were not at liberty seriously to adopt the very words which he humorously, but justly, speaks of himself, under a personated character, in <hi>The Critic:—</hi>
               <q>But it is impossible for language to do justice to Mr. KING! Indeed, he more than merited those repeated bursts of applause which he drew from a most bril<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liant and judicious Audience.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I flatter myself, this little tribute to distin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guished merit will not be deemed tedious or impertinent by the Public, for whose opinion I have the sincerest respect, and to whom I have the honour to be</p>

               <l>TO glow with ardour, and attempt with zeal</l>
               <l>The reformation of the public weal,</l>
               <l>Is the high duty of the COMIC MUSE;</l>
               <l>And tho' keen Attic Salt allowed to use,</l>
               <l>To season Precept, and with Art to tickle</l>
               <l>The sores she means to wash with sharpest pickle,</l>
               <l>Yet not the rosy, pulpited Divine,</l>
               <l>Nor lank-hair'd Methodist with rueful whine,</l>
               <l>Is more intent to root out Vice and Folly,</l>
               <l>And make ye all lead lives discreet and holy.—</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet why to clear the field were all their toil,</l>
               <l>If weeds o'erspread not the luxuriant soil?</l>
               <l>Congreve or Wesley, Whitfield or Moliere,</l>
               <l>In vain might prompt the laugh, or bribe the tear,</l>
               <l>If no man felt, or in himself, or neighbour,</l>
               <l>Some failing to call forth the zealot's labour;—</l>
               <l>If no fair dame descried, 'midst her acquaintance,</l>
               <l>Some few who might be mended by repentance.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Loose as the buxom air, the Youth from College</l>
               <l>Comes fraught with all Newmarket's hopeful knowledge;</l>
               <l>In haste to spend the Estate, not yet his own,</l>
               <l>Compleats his ruin ere his beard is grown;</l>
               <l>And when to foreign climes he spreads the sail,</l>
               <l>'Tis not to enlarge his mind, but 'scape a jail.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then blest the Poet, happy the Divine,</l>
               <l>When Folly gives the <hi>Ton</hi> from Fashion's Shrine!</l>
               <l>But whilst the Priest and Satirist reprove</l>
               <l>Those vices which provoke the wrath of JOVE,</l>
               <l>Our Author, like the patient Angler sitting</l>

               <l>WHILE grave-paced Tragedy, with Oh's! and Starts!</l>
               <l>Flies at high game, to move and mend your hearts,</l>
               <l>We merrier folks, with spirits blithe and jolly,</l>
               <l>Just perch upon some little sprig of folly:</l>
               <l>For, in this Age, so pious, chaste, and grave,</l>
               <l>To rail at Vice, must surely be to rave!</l>

               <l>Yet thanks to here and there a modish fool,</l>
               <l>The COMIC MUSE may glean some ridicule.</l>
               <l>Jews will be Jews, if dupes can yet be found,</l>
               <l>And if one frail one's left on English ground,</l>
               <l>She'll find a Phaeton and pair of ponies</l>
               <l>To elope—for all men are not Maccaronies:—</l>
               <l>Those precious Dears, at least, would make her wait—</l>
               <l>'Twould be so vulgar, not to be too late.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Our sex—but shall I charge the weaker kind?</l>
               <l>Or can those fail to stray, whose guides are blind!</l>
               <l>Let men reform themselves, they're our examples—</l>
               <l>And goods prove seldom better than their samples.</l>
               <l>In former times the gallant British Youth</l>
               <l>Were formed for Chivalry, and Love, and Truth—</l>
               <l>In such an Age, in such a virtuous Nation,</l>
               <l>Love was in woman almost inspiration.—</l>
               <l>But now, alas! I speak without a jest,</l>
               <l>Women are not inspired—they're but possest.</l>
               <l>Men are our pilots! They should mark the shelves;</l>
               <l>For when they blame us, they reproach themselves.</l>

               <p>Good-morrow, Woodley! What, not dressed yet! I expected to find you booted, and ready to set out for Newmarket. You'll be late on the turf. Your horses run, I suppose? What matches have you made?</p>

               <p>Why, faith, I wish they were disposed of. But yet, I don't know, I should be ashamed, I think, to advertise them, as it might look some-how as if one could not afford to keep them. Ha! ha! ha!</p>

               <p>Ridiculous, indeed! That you know, Mountfort, is far from the case, but I really am tired of the sport; and the Meeting, too, is at a time of the year when there are so many more agreeable amusements to be met with in London, so that I should be glad to get rid of them, with all my heart.</p>

               <p>Let me dispose of them for you, then. I'll be your Auctioneer, and try if I can't emblazon their pedigree with a little of that true humour which Charles Surface bestows on his ancestors, when he sets up their pictures to sale. Bucephalus, the fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mous Bucephalus, Gentlemen, descended in a right line from the renowned quadrupede of that name, which had the honour of carrying a greater brute than himself—the immortal Alexander—</p>

               <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
               <p>You had better consult Tattersall, for their pedigree, as he is your only herald in those points. Heigh-ho!</p>

               <speaker>Col.</speaker>
               <p>Heigh-ho! This is but poor encourage<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment for me to enter on my new profession. Surely there is something malignant in the air, at present; for every man I have conversed with, this morning, seems rather to be depressed with the gloom of November, than enlivened by the sunshine of April. I have just now left Jack Knightly and Will Careless calculating, not their nativities, but their deaths.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
               <p>I saw them both at Boodle's, yesterday, in good health.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Col.</speaker>
               <p>Not the more likely to live, for that, I as<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure you. However, it was not their natural exist<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence,
<pb n="5" facs="11"/>
but their necessary subsistence, that employed their mathematics.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Woodley.</speaker>
               <p>You astonish me!—Why, it is but lately they came into possession of great estates.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Col.</speaker>
               <p>True:—but then they have travelled the modern short and easy road to ruin, of granting annuities for this twelvemonth past, and are now so nearly arrived at the last stage of their journey, that I think Jack said he had but two months to run; and Will flattered himself, that as the summer was approaching, he might be able to hold out four. I advised their compounding the terms, and run<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ning together for three months each.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
               <p>Poor fellows! I am sorry for them. <stage>(aside.)</stage> Would I could promise myself even so long a reprieve.</p>

               <speaker>Col.</speaker>
               <p>What! moping again, Woodley? You'll infect me, if I stay.—Where are the Ladies?—In truth, my visit was to them, for I scarce hoped to find you here. Are Lady Mary and your sister visible? or shall I pass on to your Uncle's apartment, and pay my respects to him? I think there is a door of communication to his house from this room. Shall I go this way?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
               <p>That may be a service of danger, Colonel; for I fear Sir William is not at present much delighted either with his vicinity, or affinity, to any of this family, except my sister.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Col.</speaker>
               <p>I am glad to hear you can except my sweet Louisa; for, notwithstanding the brusqueness of his manners, I have such an opinion of the old Knight's good sense and good nature, that I cannot readily acquit those he is offended with, as wholly free from blame.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
               <p>I subscribe to your censure, as far as it relates to myself; but the asperity of his behaviour to Lady Mary, renders me extremely unhappy; and not even my past obligations, or future prospects,
<pb n="6" facs="12"/>
shall ever make me acquiesce in his treating my wife with disrespect.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Col.</speaker>
               <p>Allow me to say, Woodley, that persons so nearly connected, ought to dispense with ceremony, in favour of sincerity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
               <p>That's a dangerous tenet, Colonel, and may be extended 'till downright rudeness may be considered but as the privilege of family-chat.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Col.</speaker>
               <p>I think you have no cause for such an appre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hension, in this case, as Sir William is quite as singular for goodness of heart, as for a deficiency in that outward varnish which too often supplies the place of it. But to compound the argument, let us admit there may be faults on both sides.</p>

               <p>The peremptory stile of this billet alarms me! Knightly used to be a careless, liberal fellow; but Mountfort told me just now, that he is on the verge of ruin. His state, however, is to be envied, in com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parison of mine. He falls alone. No wife, no family, at once to share and aggravate his wretched<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness. I'll go this moment and acquit me of his de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mand, by parting with these toys— <stage>(takes up the ear-rings).</stage> How much my Mary's beauty added to their lustre!

               <p>O, that alters the case considerably! Let us see—let's see.

But I cannot help being a little concerned at leaving my master and Lady; because I am sure I shall never get so good a place again. All masters—no servants—every one did as he liked. It grieves me to think what a hand the rest of the servants have made of them. There's the lazy Housekeeper, the drunken Butler, the cribbing Coachman!—But what signifies moralizing! Let me look about me a little, and see if there be any small matters lying loose, that are of no farther use to my master, and may be of some to me.— <stage>(Takes up a pair of lace ruffles)</stage> These have been worn, but never washed, and he may miss them.

               <p>In this case, then, you should suspect your own conduct, rather than his character.—But remonstrances are useless, now; and I promise to use my utmost interest to bring about a reconciliation.
<pb n="17" facs="23"/>
But I much fear that we shall not be able to get Lady Mary included in the family-compact; for I know no man more resolute in what he conceives to be right, than Sir William.</p>

               <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
               <p>My honour, as well as my love, obliges me to vindicate her; and I here pledge them both, that she is free from blame.</p>

               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>I am glad to find you still a lover, Mr. Woodley; but I who am but a friend, in this ques<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, can't help thinking, that if Lady Mary had spent more of her time in Dorsetshire, and less at Spa, Paris, and other places of dissipation and ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>travagance, she would have been more entitled to Sir William's esteem, and you would have had less need of his assistance.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
               <p>The fault was mine alone.—Vain of pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sessing such a treasure—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>You childishly exposed it to the gaze of fops and foreigners.—And let me tell you, Mr. Woodley, you are a lucky man, in these licentious times, to have preserved such a gem pure and entire, even at the expence of your other possessions. But, prithee, why don't you now retreat into the country?</p>

               <p>It is amazing, Sir William, that you can be so anxious about this trifling game, and at the same time so indifferent about your nephew!</p>

               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>I am in earnest about every thing, Mr. Belford; consequently, in my resentment against my silly nephew, who is a slave to his wife, and a victim to his vanity. Will you take the box, I say?</p>

               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, thanks to Providence! more than I have occasion for myself, and therefore I consider the overplus but as a bank for my friends.—Do you want money, Belford? Name the sum, and take it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>What! at it again? I will not give him a doit—not a doit, Sir. My fortune shall not be lavished to indulge his vanity, or supply his prodigality.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>I am persuaded he has so thoroughly re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>flected upon his past folly, that he would make a proper use of your future kindness.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Let him alter his conduct, first, if he expects I should alter mine. His repentance may merit my bounty; but my liberality shall not pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vent his reformation.</p>

               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Let her share his fate, as she has done his folly—she has earned it.—An extravagant woman, that could not be content to live at one of the finest Seats in England, but must frisk it to Spa and Paris, forsooth, like the rest of the silly English, to squander their money, and be laughed at by Foreigners!</p>

               <p>No, Sir, no—I'll have no mistress in my house, but old Jones. I would not displace her for a Duchess—it would break the poor woman's heart.—But I shall take proper care of Louisa.— <stage>(aside)</stage> I wish she was well married, out of the way.</p>

               <p>And so it did, I assure you; for I did not laugh, tho' he said something so ridiculous,

about your being ruined, the Nation being ruined, and all the world being ruined, that I had much ado to keep my countenance. However, I behaved very decently all the while, and even condescended to en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>treat that he would give you leave to justify your conduct to him.</p>

               <p>Your earnestness startles me, Mr. Woodley. Of what consequence can the old-fashion<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed opinion of an obstinate Don Choleric, who hates us both, be of to us? I wish he would endow an Hospital with his fortune, that our solicitude to please might end with our expectations.</p>

               <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>

            </stage>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>I AM no drinking man myself, Belford; but yet I do not approve of this water system of yours. It keeps the spirits too low—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>To say or do any thing mad or foolish, I grant it may. But if water does not raise, it never depresses the spirits. Can you say as much for your generous wine?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Well, well, I won't dispute with you, because I hate argument; and as you are an honest fellow, I can venture to take my glass chearfully in your company, tho' you don't partake of my liquor. But I'd give something, ay, more than I'll mention, that you'd share only one pint of claret with me, now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>I have made no vows, Sir William; and to humour a friend can easily dispense with rules of my own making: So here's your fair niece, Louisa Woodley, in a bumper.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Thank you, thank you, my good friend! She is a most excellent girl, and I like to have her toasted by such a man as you. I wish she was well settled, with all my heart.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>There can be no doubt of her marrying to advantage. She is a fine young woman, with a fine fortune.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>And so may be sacrificed to some fine young man, that may spend her fortune in finery, as her hopeful brother has done, and leave her a beg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gar.
<pb n="33" facs="39"/>
No, no,—I'll prevent that—I have thought of a match for her—Fill your glass, Belford!—a prudent, sober, sensible man.— <stage>(aside)</stage> I wish he'd take the hint.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>Rare qualities, indeed, for a young man of fashion to possess, in these days, Sir Wil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liam.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Who told you that he was a <hi>young man of fashion?</hi> Why, Sir, there have been no <hi>men</hi> born, at least, for these last thirty years—all monkies and macaronies. No Hearts of Oak, now, Belford,—all dwindled, dwindled into aspens!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>Your sarcasm is rather too general, my good friend. Courage is the birth-right of an Englishman, and while one acre of our soil remains, both the Oak and the Laurel will thrive on it.—We must not prejudge the rising generation; and I have not the least doubt but your niece will make a very proper choice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>A choice! I hope she has been better educated, than to have a choice, Sir. I was not consulted in her brother's match, and you see the consequence.—I shall dispose of Louisa in my own way.—I have a husband now in my eye for her, Belford.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>Whoever obtains Miss Woodley, will, I dare say, be a very happy man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Stick to that, my dear Belford.—Yes, yes, whoever marries Louisa will be a very happy man, and I am extremely glad you think so.— <stage>(aside)</stage> I wish he'd come to the point.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>You know, Sir William, that I have long been acquainted with Miss Woodley's merit.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>You charm me, my dear Belford. I am glad you know her worth, and you will therefore cherish it.—She is mild and timid—but you'll be kind and gentle to her, even for my sake, my good old friend.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>Most certainly.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Then why all this reiteration? If you marry Louisa—</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Sir—Did you not, this moment, allow that who ever married her, would be a very happy man? And I suppose, you can have no possible objection to being a very happy man, Mr. Belford?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Sir, the strongest in the world, if my happiness is to be purchased at the expence of another's misery.—But I am wrong for being serious, when I am certain you do but jest.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>In the first place, Sir, I never said any thing in jest, since I was born.—And, secondly, Sir, I never was more in earnest, in the whole course of my life. I therefore request from you a serious answer.—Jest, indeed! No, truly, Counsellor, I am no joker.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>Why, then, Sir, I should think myself highly honoured—</p>

               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>In a word, then, Sir William, the disparity of years between forty-eight and eigh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>teen—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Is just nothing at all.—What need you tell her you are forty-eight?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Louisa.</speaker>
               <p>I was informed, Sir, by my sister, that you desired to speak with me, and I am therefore come to receive your commands.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Why, my dear, it will neither be ques<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions nor commands, but cross-purposes, if you keep at such a distance as will make it impossible we should hear one another. Come nearer, I say—What are you afraid of?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>So you'll say, my dear, when you know all. But you must deserve my kindness, by your frankness;—therefore, first tell me, whether you have any particular objection to matrimony?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Louisa.</speaker>
               <p>It is a subject, Sir, that I have never much thought upon.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>That's singular, now; for I am told that the girls of these days think of nothing else. But, luckily, there is no occasion for your considering about the matter, as you have such a friend as I am to consider for you, child.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>And so I shall make your mind easy at once, by letting you know that I have provided a husband for you.</p>

               <p>And such a one as is not to be met with every day, I assure you—a man after my own heart—has not a fault, Louisa, but that he is a water-drinker. But I won't anticipate, by telling you his name. He shall surprise you with it him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self.—Why, hey!—what's the matter now? You don't seem at all overjoyed!—You are not hankering after a title, I hope; for, believe me, niece, if there be either happiness or virtue left in the present world, they are only to be met with in the middle ranks of life.

               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>You are right, my dear; but it must be my own way. Your brother's want of respect to my opinion, you see, has been his ruin, child. Don't attempt to copy him, Louisa.</p>

               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Why, child, I know every thing already, that you would wish to say. Your obligations to me, and your modesty, and your timidity, and your settlement, and all that—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Louisa.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Well, well, every thing shall be taken care of, except a provision for a separate mainte<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nance.

               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>But, my dear niece, don't insist upon it; for a woman who thinks of separation at the moment of her union, does not intend to abide by her husband, as she ought to do, 'till death do them part.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Louisa.</speaker>

               <p>Enough's said, enough's said, my dear. Here, take this bill, to provide for your dress. I'd have every thing handsome.

               <p>What, in the name of wonder, can this dear, kind, cruel uncle of mine intend for me? I almost doubt whether I wake or not. Married in a week, to a man perhaps I never saw! No, that's impossible—he is too good to think of such an union. Possibly Mountfort may have applied for his consent, before he asked mine!—Too fond a hope, I fear.—I wish I could see Counsellor Belford; my uncle keeps no secret from him, and he is a friend to all our fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mily.

               <p>Not more generous than prudent, Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dam, on this occasion. But, as I hope I have now deserved your confidence, Miss Woodley, tell me then, if you have any particular attachment, and I shall endeavour to serve you with Sir William;—though I know I shall, for a time, stand in the light of a culprit before him, by declining the honour he intended me.</p>

               <p>No speeches, my dear Madam. If I was not sufficiently gratified by the honour of the act, no acknowledgements could make me amends for the disappointment; so frankly name the hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>py man who is to raise my envy, and compleat your happiness.</p>

               <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
               <p>The great civilities we received from them, at Spa, first attached my wife to Mrs. Brom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ley, who was there in the first sets, and even in Lon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>don, where people are more nice.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
               <p>None in the world, to you; but cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstanced as I am at present, it would involve me in the greatest difficulties, to be called upon so sud<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>denly for ten thousand pounds.</p>

               <speaker>Col.</speaker>
               <p>That shall not be the case, Woodley. I should think even Louisa too dearly purchased, at the expence of distressing you. When I asked for your sister's hand, I did not demand her purse; nor shall I accept the one, 'till I have signed a release for the other.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
               <p>Mountfort, that must not, shall not be! I never will accept of such a sacrifice.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Col.</speaker>
               <p>Hark-ye, Woodley! A soldier's character should be uniform; and if there could be one who was not liberal, I should suspect his courage to be of the mere animal kind. My fortune is sufficiently ample; and I would as soon mount my charger, cry stand and deliver, as take money I don't want, from a friend who does.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Woodley.</speaker>
               <p>I will not lessen it, by offering thanks. But have you opened your trenches before the Knight of the Castle yet? <stage>(pointing to the middle door)</stage> He used to speak well of you, and his opinion is of some consequence in this business.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Col.</speaker>
               <p>My sentiments are even with the good old Knight's, I assure you. I esteem his good qualities, and do not dislike even his foibles, as they are truly natural and unsophisticate. But there, perhaps, you may see me play the usurer, like any Jew. He may double or treble Louisa's fortune, without the least impediment from any scruple or modesty of mine.</p>

But are you sure that Mr. Woodley would like it? for I must say, though I ask your pardon, Lady Mary, he is dull—absolutely dull, indeed, my dear.</p>

               <p>Why, I own, of late he has been rather gloomy;—but he is vastly good-natured, and never before refused any request of mine.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Bromley.</speaker>
               <p>That may be:—but had Mr. Bromley talked to me in the same manner—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Mary.</speaker>

               <speaker>Mrs. Bromley.</speaker>
               <p>You are admirable at guessing, my dear;—for as that same romantic notion of love never was the band of our connexion—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Mary.</speaker>
               <p>You startle me, Mrs. Bromley. Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riage without love must surely be a state of the greatest unhappiness.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Bromley.</speaker>
               <p>No, I don't feel in the least unhappy.—Convenience is the best matrimonial cement, and keeps many couples together for years, whose love did not out-last the honey-moon.—But these are mysteries, into which you seem not yet initiated.</p>

               <p>This treatment is unlike yourself, Sir Wil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liam. But Miss Woodley, I suppose, will inform me;—I presume she is not bound to keep the secret.</p>

               <p>Your servant, Colonel Huff-Cap. What a hot-brained boy! I am doubly glad Louisa has escaped him:—I would have no passionate man in the family, but myself. How lucky 'tis that Louisa does not know her husband's name!—Wo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>men should ever be kept in ignorance, to prevent mischief. I have conducted this business most ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mirably!—I have some doubts, however, whether my nephew should not be made acquainted with it; but he does not deserve my confidence, and he shan't vex me now.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>

               <p>Why, surely you have a mind to try my temper, with your fair and softly! But if you knew as much as I do, you would, perhaps, think it worth while to mend your pace a little; for <q>many things fall out between the cup and lip,</q> Mr. Belford.</p>

               <p>If I was not in the most heavenly tem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>per, you would put me in a rage. Have I not told you, Sir, that she had no consent, no choice, but what I please to give? And in twenty years ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quaintance, have you ever known me say an untruth, Sir? My niece is all compliance and gentleness; and you'll be a very happy man, my dear nephew.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>I should be unworthy of happiness, if I could enjoy it on such terms, Sir William.</p>

               <p>Why, what's the matter, Belford?—Your head seems to be turned with your good for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tune, and you want to turn mine. No man that is unworthy can be happy—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>In short, Sir William—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, ay, that's the thing—now you talk sense! I like <hi>in short—</hi>stick to that, my friend. If

               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>No law, but that of honour, has any thing to do in this case, Sir William; and however irksome the task, I must beg you will per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mit me to undeceive you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Will.</speaker>
               <p>Your proposition is false, Sir. I never deceived myself, nor any one else, since I was born, Sir. I scorn and abhor deceit, Mr. Belford. But come, Sir, let me know what all this round-about tends to? Despise the chicanery of your profession, and speak as if you was a witness on the table—not a Lawyer at the bar, Sir.</p>

               <p>What, then, you are married, I suppose?—have a wife already? Nay, don't smile, Sir, there is no joke in this matter; and you ought to have been hanged, if you had married my niece.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Belford.</speaker>
               <p>I think so too, though not upon the ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count you mention, as I give you my honour I have no wife; and if I continue in my present mood, may venture to say that I never shall have one.</p>

This piece of paper is all I have got for spending my time with a dull fool, and endeavouring to persuade him that he was a Solomon, and his silly wife the Queen of Sheba.

               <p>Stop, child, stop! I won't have them come to me, till the very hour they are going. If I were to see your brother often, I might be weak enough to grow fond of him again; so don't let him come, I charge you, 'till his boots are on.

               <p>That's noble! for he did not know that I would discharge the debt.—Nay, for that mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter, I don't know that I shall—I promise nothing—but I like this action of the Colonel.</p>

               <p>Ay! then perhaps you like the Co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lonel? Be honest, speak out.—I should be glad to make you some amends for a loss you don't yet know of;—but I can conceal it no longer.—Belsord has declared off!—but he is unworthy your resentment. The Colonel's father was my friend, and a noble fellow he was!</p>

               <p>You know, Sir, it was their determined purpose, before this misfortune happened.</p>

               <speaker>Sir William.</speaker>
               <p>That's something in their favour, to be sure, and I'm glad you told me of it.—One good act of choice, is worth all the virtues of necessity, in the world.—I should be glad to make their minds easy, to-night—But they'd thank me, and talk to me, and discompose me, and I should lose my night's rest—for I hate thanks.—I should be glad to see Co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lonel

               <p>Well, child, I can deny you no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing.—I like to make people happy, when they'll assist me in doing so, themselves; without which the best endeavours are but labour in vain.—But the country is the place!—You must settle in the coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try, Louisa!—There is no safety for good folks in London, believe me, child.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Louisa.</speaker>
               <p>I should hope, Sir, that with prudence and virtue one might be safe any where.</p>

               <speaker>Sir William.</speaker>
               <p>A fig for your prudence—ay, and for virtue too, against example! Example, child, is the ruin of us all. We naturally strive to ape those that are called our Betters, and so become worse than we otherwise should be.—But this is no time for mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ralizing. Do you step in and tell your brother I am coming. I'll just wrap my cloak round me and follow you.</p>

               <p>I'm glad to meet you here, all to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gether, for I have business with every one of you, jointly and severally.—And first for you, Colonel, I am very much obliged to you, Sir, and I scorn to be obliged to any man, without making him some return for his kindness. I therefore make you a pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent I refused you, a few hours ago, for the sake of old Sir Doubtful Deliberation there.—But do you take Louisa, and for aught I know, you may make her as good a husband as he would have done.</p>

               <p>That's right—stick to that.—No thanks, but deserve as much as ever you can.—And as for you, Mr. Belford, though I am confoundedly angry with you, I must get you to settle this young man's affairs; his debts of <hi>honour,</hi> his <hi>post obits,</hi> &amp;c.; though perhaps it may be only affording him an opportunity for <hi>deranging</hi> them again.—That's the modern phrase, I think, for being over-head-and-ears in debt.</p>

               <p>The sufferings my follies have brought upon me, Sir, and the remembrance of your gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rosity, will remain too strongly impressed on my mind, to admit of my relapsing into my former errors; as that would be adding ingratitude to ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>travagance, and vice to folly.</p>
