               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>R. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Project to usher his Letters into the World by my Means, was the Foundation of this Scheme of <hi>A Literary Cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>respondence;</hi> which has been so well re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceived, that it shall be continued while People of Taste approve of it: And that will be as long as People of Taste, who have valuable Performances in this Kind in their Power, contribute their Stores to the Emolument of Mankind. Not but that I am always ready and willing to pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chase any Genuine Pieces from such Pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sessors as expect a <hi>Premium.</hi>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Curll,</hi> how comes it that you call this Second Volume <hi>Mr.</hi> Pope's <hi>Correspon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dence,</hi> when there is so much more of other Peoples: This is a mere Imposition upon the Town.</p>

                     <p>Sir, be pleased to read the Title-Page. I began this Collection chiefly upon what re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>main'd of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s, and besides finding most of my Customers eager to see the Minds of Men, especially in the Case of <hi>Epistolary Writing;</hi> and having considerable Supplies of the Kind, I published a <hi>Second Volume,</hi> as you see; and have Materials of equal Value, and sufficient in Quantity, to make a <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth.</hi>

                     <speaker>B.</speaker>
                     <p>D—n me, I do not desire to read any Man's Writings but <hi>Pope</hi>'s; he's the only Writer of the Age; his Equal never lived in any Time or Country. There's nothing worth reading in either of your Volumes but what is his.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>C.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, It is not my Business to set up my Opinion against that of Gentlemen who do me the Favour to call at my Shop, but some of my Customers, whose Judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment is much esteemed among their Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quaintance,
<pb n="v" facs="4"/>
have said that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Share in this Second Volume is the very worst Part of the Book.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B.</speaker>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Z—</hi>s! what do you mean by that? Will you pretend to name any Writer in Competition with Mr. <hi>Pope.</hi>
                     </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>C.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, they do pretend to say, that the Pieces of Bishop ATTERBURY in this Vo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lume, are something beyond Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Compass: His Style in <hi>Prose,</hi> his Judgment in the Critical-Taste, his Heroic Love of his Country, his Vindication of Lord <hi>Cla<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rendon</hi>'s History from an unattested Ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lumny, and his ABSALON &amp; ACHITOPHEL, tho' done when he was a Youth at the Uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versity, are all inimitable by Mr. <hi>Pope.</hi>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B.</speaker>
                     <p>Your Judges are Blockheads, there's not a polite Man about the Town reads any Thing but what is <hi>Pope</hi>'s. How imper<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinent is it to publish that <hi>Absalon &amp; Achi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tophel</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> without getting it translated for the Ladies, if it be good for any Thing? What a Pox, do you think Gentlemen must be at the Slavery, like School-boys, of con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>struing it to them in <hi>English?</hi> It would be well for you if you could pacify Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> perhaps if he and you were Friends, he might be prevailed on to take a hundred Guineas to do it for you.</p>

                     <speaker>C.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, I presume you have seen the Poem, in its <hi>English</hi> Original, by Mr. <hi>Dry<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>den.</hi> I doubt whether the Public would desire Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s finishing Hand to that Piece.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B.</speaker>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dryden</hi> was a tolerable Poet in his Time, but nothing in Comparison to <hi>Pope.</hi> There's <hi>Le Neve</hi>'s <hi>Will and Creed,</hi> I like well enough, because they contain partly my own Religion: But there's his Epitaph in <hi>Latin,</hi> why is not that translated?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>C.</speaker>
                     <p>Because, Sir, it contains some Parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culars that cannot be so well expressed in any other Language.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, I think as I please; but what do you mean by those Political Letters of <hi>Addison, Prior, Harley,</hi> and the rest; there is not any <hi>Wit</hi> in them, surely?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>C.</speaker>
                     <p>I grant it, Sir, because the Wri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters of them did not intend it: But I am told there is much <hi>Good Sense</hi> in them; that they open the Scene of the famous <hi>Partition Treaty,</hi> and the Designs of <hi>France</hi> upon the Death of King CHARLES II. of <hi>Spain;</hi> that they discover the Importance of a Man who is trusted with Affairs, and how mere <hi>un homme sans consequence</hi> a Man may be, with a great Employment, if the Conduct of the secret Springs of Action is placed in other Hands: With many other useful Lessons.</p>

                     <speaker>B.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, Mr. <hi>Curll,</hi> you are a great Politician.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>C.</speaker>
                     <p>Very little of a Politician truly, Sir: But since there are some Gentlemen inclined to adore a single Name among the polite Writers, to the Prejudice of all the rest, and to point me out as Heretical, for being of a different Opinion, it is necessary I should be able to give some Reason for my Dissent; and that, I apprehend, is done to the Purpose, if I am able to shew the Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cellency, the Superiority, of many others over Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> in this Epistolary Taste especially.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B.</speaker>
                     <p>Pray, Mr. <hi>Curll,</hi> have you sorted your Materials for your <hi>Third Volume.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>C.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, Sir.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>B.</speaker>
                     <p>Do you make it a Secret, or may we be informed what the principal Parts are to be.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>C.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, I'll inform you with Pleasure; it is no Secret at all, I assure you. There are more of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Letters to Ladies, particularly her Grace the Duchess of <hi>Buck<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>inghamshire:</hi> Some very pretty Letters of Mrs. <hi>Manley,</hi> full of true Humour, perfectly picturesque, in a genteel unaffected Style, natively pleasant, and, as <hi>Horace</hi> says, <hi>sim<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plex munditiis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are excellent ones of the late Lord <hi>Lansdowne:</hi> They convince the Reader of
<pb n="viii" facs="7"/>
the Patriot, the <hi>Englishman,</hi> the Christian, the Tenderness of the most humane Mind, the Politeness of the finest Gentleman, the Dignity of the <hi>British</hi> Peer, are here united, and shine forth with full Lustre in the utmost Propriety and Perspicuity of Language.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <speaker>C.</speaker>
                     <p>Now, Sir, you are quite out; read his Lordship's Character of Queen CAROLINE. My Lord was indeed very young when he wrote some of these Letters, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was not then landed. But, I presume, had it been so, a <hi>Jacobite</hi> might possibly be a Man of Wit; for Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> is allowed to be so, tho' he owns himself a Papist. But here are Letters of my Lord's, that shew other Sort of Sentiments at a riper Age, with Regard to the Revolution Settlement.</p>

                     <p>Yes, Sir, The <hi>Hospital of Fools</hi> is an Imitation of <hi>Lucian,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Walsh,</hi> and Gentlemen of the best Taste among my Cus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tomers agree, that <hi>Lucian</hi> wrote nothing equal to it. I had forgot to mention a Letter concerning Asses, containing abun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dance of Wit. The rest of the Book will consist of Dr. <hi>Atterbury</hi>'s Pieces translated, Letters of Lady <hi>Chudleigh,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and others of great Character for Wit, or Literature, or both. And there will be some curious Anecdotes concerning that indefatigable Antiquary, the late Mr. <hi>Thomas Hearne</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and his Writings: And relating to that most exemplary, as well as most noble Princess, the late Duchess of <hi>Ormonde,</hi> with a fine Copy of Verses in her Praise, by a greater Man than Mr. <hi>Pope.</hi>

            <head>To Mr. CURLL.</head>
            <p>I Have read the Three Volumes of your <hi>Li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terary Correspondence</hi> with Satisfaction. A Collection of good Letters is much wanted in our Language. The <hi>French</hi> have several; and I think they outdo us in no other Article of polite Literature. Ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tificial Letters, written on Purpose to be published, are apt to fall short of the vivid Force and Openness found in the unbosom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing of Friend to Friend; therefore it is ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>treamly difficult to imitate well, as it also is to obtain the Papers of a valuable real Cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>respondence.</p>
            <p>If Gentlemen could be satisfied, there would be no Endeavours to know how Letters came to the Press, I am persuaded, our free, learned, polite Age and Country, might easily find you a genuine Collection in the best Taste.</p>
            <p>For my own Part I will not have any Doubt of your Conduct in this Respect; therefore you now receive inclosed the very Mind of a Man of Sense and Rank in his Country, upon public Affairs, from the Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>volution to the Year 1730. Most of them were Letters to the late Bishop <hi>Atterbury,</hi>
               <pb n="xii" facs="11"/>
and the rest, to an intimate Friend of his, who died before him.</p>
            <p>The Bishop, a few Months before his Death, lent them to a Nobleman in <hi>France</hi> (from whom I had them) and at the same Time he told him, <hi>they were written by the honestest Whig of his Acquaintance;</hi> that he differ'd from the Writer upon several Points, but look'd upon him to be a good <hi>English<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man</hi> in the main; that he (the Bishop) had been censur'd by his Enemies as a hot Par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty-man, but that he could always relish the Correspondence of a Person of Sincerity and Honour, though of different Sentiments in Politics or Religion; and that if he did not live to ask for these Letters again (as he found himself in a declining Condition) he desired they might not be lost, because there was <hi>much Truth and good Sense in them;</hi> but insisted, <hi>that if they went abroad, it would be in such a Manner as not to prejudice the Writer of them in any Branch of his Family, which might have Occasion for the Counte<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nance of Men in Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you think it agreeable to your Scheme, you may publish them; if not, I wish you Supplies more to your Purpose, and am,</p>

               <p>It is my Wish, that the same Fortune may in this happen to me as hath befallen you; who, after you have for so long time concealed the noblest things in the World, have in the Discovery of it, dazled all those that have seen it. But it is an over-great Fondness for my own Verses, to wish them that Advantage, nor indeed should I wish them better, since they were not made for you: If you think them very ill, you are so much the more obliged to me for them, in that knowing it as well as you, yet I have not forborn sending them to you. And, to deal freely with you, a less Power than what you have within these few Days gained upon me, would not have been suf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficient

to have prevailed with me to do it: And, without your Command, Madam, they had never known any other Place than that of my own Memory. But it is high time it were delivered of them, to make room for something more delightful; I mean that which Mrs. **** had the Grace to acquaint me with the other Day, and which fills it so much at present, that I doubt whether there be Place for any thing else.</p>
               <p>I perceive, Madam, that where it was my Design to send you a Letter of Excuse and Compliment, I am fallen into one of Love; but I wish all the other Defects you shall find in it, were as pardonable as that. In the mean time let me assure you, that I have not of a long time been so engaged, and that there are many in the World to whom I would not say so much, even tho' they held a Dagger at my Throat.</p>
               <p>But, since there is no fear of any Scan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dal, you are obliged, Madam, at least in my Opinion, to look favourably on those Elements of Affection, were it but to see, how I should behave myself, if I should fall in Love; and, if I were permitted, what might be the Consequence of it.</p>

               <p>THO' my Liberty were, as you say, greater than <hi>Alexander</hi>'s, it were more than recompenced by the Thanks you have been pleased to return it. Even his Ambition, as insatiable as it was, would, by so extraordinary a Favour, have been li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mited. He would have valued this Honour more highly than the <hi>Persian</hi> Diadem, and he would not have envied <hi>Achilles</hi> the Praises of <hi>Homer,</hi> might he have Yours. In like manner, Madam, considering the Reputation you do me, if I envy his, it is not so much that which he hath acquired, as what you have bestowed on him, and he hath received no Honours which I do not look upon below my own, unless it be that you do him, when you call him your Gal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lant. Neither his own Vanity nor his Flat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terers have ever advanced any thing so ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantageous to him, and the Quality of the Son of <hi>Jupiter Ammon</hi> was not so glorious as that. But, if nothing can cure me of
<pb n="xxiv" facs="23"/>
the Jealousy I have of it, yet, Madam, knowing you as I do, I am confident, if you do him that Favour, it is not so much because he is the greatest of Mankind, as because it is Two Thousand Years since he was.</p>
               <p>However it be, we may see, in this, the Greatness of his Fortune, which not able to forsake him so many Years after his Death, adds to his Conquests a Person which cele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brates them more than the Wife and Daugh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter of <hi>Darius,</hi> and hath re-infused into him a Soul greater than that of the World he hath subdued.</p>

                  <salute>MADAM,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Could never believe it possible that the Receipt of a Letter from you should add to my Affliction, or that you could have possibly sent me such bad News, as that you could not comfort me at the same time.</p>
               <p>I thought my Unhappiness at such a Point as could not admit of any Addition, and that since you were able something to strengthen my Patience to endure the Ab<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sence of your Mother and You, there could not be any Misfortune which You could not have encouraged me to suffer. But give me leave to tell you, that I have found the contrary in the Affliction I have for the Death of Mrs. <hi>A****,</hi> which hath been heavy enough to crush me, and want<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed not much to spend the Remainder of my Patience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xxvi" facs="25"/>
You may easily judge, Madam, what an excessive Grief it must needs be to me to have lost a Friend so good, so sprightly and so accomplished as she, and one that hav<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing always given me so many Expressions of her Affection, would needs do some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing when she had not many Hours to continue here. But tho' I reflected not on my own Concernments, yet could I not but infinitely regret a Person by whom you were infinitely beloved; and who, among many particular Endowments, had that of knowing you as much as may be, and esteeming you above all things. Yet I must confess, if this Disturbance can admit of any Remission, it is to reflect on the Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stancy she expressed, and the Fortitude wherewith she hath suffered a Thing whereof the Name would make her trem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble at any time.</p>
               <p>I am extremely comforted to understand, that at her Death, she had those Qualities which only she wanted in her Life, and that she so opportunely found Courage and Resolution. When I consider it seriously, it is somewhat against my Conscience to bemoan her, and methinks it speaks an over-interested Affection, to be sad because she hath left us to better her Condition, and is gone into the other World, (<hi>from</hi>
                  <pb n="xxvii" facs="26"/>
                  <hi>whose Bourne no Traveller returns</hi>
                  <note place="bottom" n="*">HAMLET.</note>) to find that Quiet she could never meet with in this.</p>
               <p>I very heartily entertain the Exhortations you give me thereupon, which is, often to con over a Lesson so profitable and neces<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sary, and to prepare myself for the like one Day; I know how to make my Advantage of your Remonstrance. The Miseries we have run thro' all this while is no small Preparation for it: There's no better Lec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture to instruct a Man how to die well, than not to take much Pleasure in living.</p>
               <p>But if it be not impossible for the Hopes that Fortune proposes to prove effectual; if after so many Years, we may presume to expect some few fair Days, be pleased to give me leave, Madam, to entertain Thoughts more diverting than those of Death; and if it be likely that we are shortly to see one another, let me not fall out with my Life.</p>
               <p>Where you say, <hi>You think me destined to great Things,</hi> you give so great Security of my Life, and so happy a Presage of the Adventures that shall happen to me, that I shall not be sorry for its Continuance yet
<pb n="xxviii" facs="27"/>
a while. For my part, if Destiny doth promise me any thing that is good, I assure you I will do my utmost to get it. I will contribute all I can thereto, that <hi>your Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phesies may be fulfilled.</hi> In the mean time, I beseech you to be confident, that of all the Favours I can beg of Fortune, what I most passionately desire is, that she would do for you what she ought, and for myself, only afford me the Means to acquaint you with the Passion which obliges me to be so much,</p>

               <p>THese Memoirs go no farther than the Parliament's resolving to treat no more with the King. My Lord <hi>Holles</hi> was of the Presbyterian Party, zealous at first, to take Arms against the King, but would not have carried it so far as the Independents did; he writes very virulently against them, gives Instances of <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s and <hi>Haslerig</hi>'s Cowar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dice, as may be seen in the annexed Ta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble;<note place="bottom" n="*">Alluding to the Table in the Manuscript.</note> mentions Lord <hi>Savile</hi> as an Impostor, who accused himself and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="50"/>
This Book is an Apology for the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Presbyterians, and a Satire against the Army and Independents, but wrote in so an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gry and declaiming a Stile, that it does not please me; it treats only of public Facts known to every body, and tells none of those secret Intrigues, Schemes, Conferen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are what is most valuable in these sort of Books.</p>

               <p>WHAT Mr. <hi>Nelson,</hi> in his Life of Bi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shop <hi>Bull,</hi> says of that learned Pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>late, may with the strictest Veracity be ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plied to Mr. <hi>Collins, viz.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"He hath receiv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed so great a Brightness from his own Pen, that it needs no auxiliary Light to increase its Lustre;"</q> and his Character is so secure, from the Example of his Life, that all Calumnies raised against it, fly like <hi>Chaff before the Wind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By a Letter from <hi>King</hi>'s-College, <hi>Cam<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bridge,</hi> I am informed, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> was bred at <hi>Eton,</hi> in quality of an Oppidane; where he was very remarkable, even while a Boy, for a good Taste of the Classics, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He was admitted a Fellow-Commoner of <hi>King</hi>'s-College, <hi>July</hi> 8, 1693, where, under the Tuition of Dr. <hi>Hare,</hi> he was soon perceived to grow in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>defatigable in the roughest Tracts of Phi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>losophy, particularly the <hi>Ars Cogitandi:</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="54"/>
He was almost a singular Example a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mong those of his Station. <hi>Rarus ferme communis sensus in illa fortuna,</hi> says <hi>Horace,</hi> is as applicable to a Man of flourishing Circumstances, as to the Patriot; and tho' it has been much controverted what was the Poet's View, yet in both Lights Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> has been thought to be an Exception."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Since Mr. LOCKE hath declared, that he <hi>considered Mr.</hi> COLLINS <hi>as a Philosopher, and a Christian,</hi> all the sneering and lucra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive Sarcasms of <hi>Ecclesiastics</hi> ought to be held in the utmost Contempt. His Chara<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cter is so secure from the Example of his Life, that I am the less concerned for my own Inability, to embalm his Memory; especially as the Weight and Importance of the Matter will make some Amends for those Defects which may arise from the Manner of handling it.</p>
               <p>That Part of <hi>Biography,</hi> Sir, which records Men famous in the Republic of Letters, is generally acceptable to the Learned, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause it attempteth to gratify a Curiosity, which prevaileth much, and is nourished among them; whereby they are prompted to search for, and enquire after the minutest Circumstances, which relate to such Authors, who are no otherwise known to them, than by the Works they have left behind them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="55"/>
And now, Sir, as the best, and most firm Basis I can lay, for the Support of my Superstructure, give me Leave to mortify the wrangling Priesthood, by ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hibiting the sincere Sentiments Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> had of Mr. <hi>Collins</hi>'s Virtues and Abilities: A Character which I am certain, with all those who knew his intrinsic Worth, will turn the Balance even against the Constitu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions of Popes, the Decrees of Councils, or the Cavils of Convocations.</p>

Upon Mr. <hi>Collins</hi>'s Return to Town, 1703, after paying the Visit mentioned in the foregoing Letter, Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> returns him the following Acknowledgment.</p>
               <p>I owe you my Thanks, for the greatest Favour I can receive, the Confirmation of your Friendship, by the Visit I lately re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceived from you.—<hi>In some other Letters he thus expresses himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is one Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> with whom if I desire to live upon equal Terms, it is not that I forget how much he is superior to me in many Things, wherein he will always have the Precedency.—You make my Life, since I have had <hi>your</hi> Friendship, much more valuable to me than it was before.—Tho' my Friendship be of very little Va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lue or Use, yet being the best Thing I have to give, I shall not forwardly bestow it, where I do not think there is Worth and Sincerity: And therefore, pray pardon me the Forwardness wherewith I throw my Arms about your Neck; and holding you so, tell you, you must not hope, by any Thing that looks like Compliment, to keep one at a civiller and more fashionable Distance.—Yours of the 16th Instant<note place="bottom" n="*">Of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1703-4</note> makes me love and value you, if it were possible, more than I did before; you having there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>in,
<pb n="26" facs="57"/>
in short, so well described, wherein the Happiness of a rational Creature in this World consists: Tho' there are very few who make any other Use of their half-em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ployed and undervalued Reason, but to bandy against it. 'Tis well, as you observe, that they agree as ill with one another, as they do with common Sense. For when by the Influence of some prevailing Head, they all lean one Way; Truth is sure to be borne down, and there is nothing so dan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gerous, as to make any Enquiry after her; and to own her, for her own sake, is the most unpardonable Crime.—'Tis no small Advantage to me to have found such a Friend, at the last Scene of my Life; when I am good for nothing, and am grown so useless, that I cannot but be sure, that in every good Office you do me, you can propose to your self no other Advantage, but the Pleasure of doing it.<note place="bottom" n="*">Letter of 19. <hi>March</hi> 1704.</note>—Give me leave to desire you, to bestow some of your spare Hours on the <hi>Epistles to the Corinthians,</hi>
                  <note place="bottom" n="†">Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Paraph. on those Epistles.</note> and to try whether you can find them intelligible or no.—If I regret my old Age, it is you that make me, and calls me back to the World just as I was leaving of it, and leaving it as a Place that had very little valuable in it: But
<pb n="27" facs="58"/>
who would not be glad to spend some Years with you?—He that has any thing to do with you, must own, that Friendship is the natural Product of your Constitution, and your Soul, a noble Soil, is enriched with the <hi>two</hi> most valuable Qualities of human Nature, <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Friendship.</hi> What a Treasure have I then in such a Friend, with whom I can converse, and be en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lightened about the highest Speculations!</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>EJOICE with me, my Friend, there is Probability of mine Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vancement, this is the Reign of Expectancy. Never, if not now, shall I become considera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble: Places of National and mighty Trust, are given to those the World will trust no longer. Emulous of the <hi>Roman</hi> Simplicity, our Nobility, like so many CINCINNA<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>TUS's, seem to be taken from the Plough; our Clergy, representing the Mechanic Pis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>catory Founders of Christianity, are Men of mean Descent, and altogether as emi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nent for their Ignorance. But as the uninterrupted Succession of their Apostle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship is most undeniable, the Lord in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spire these with those. <hi>Saul</hi> from a Ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der
<pb n="30" facs="61"/>
of his Father's ASSES, became a ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der Father to the People <hi>Israel,</hi> and left his former Care. <hi>Caesar</hi> too was called to be a King, but he retained his ASSES; some he made Judges, some Bishops, and some Ambassadors, which occasioned the Scoffers to say, that <hi>Caesar</hi> only wore the <hi>Lion</hi>'s Skin. What led me, I believe, to this Subject, was the hearing of Papers now crying about the Streets, intitled, <hi>The Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gress of Asses;</hi> which naturally brought to my Remembrance, many Folks and Occur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rences, both at Home and Abroad. We have a Poet Laureat here, Thanks to my Lord Chamberlain, now grown old, who is twice a-Year brought forth to be kicked at by his Brethren.</p>

               </q>
               <p>If Dean <hi>B—</hi> or Doctor <hi>S—</hi> pride themselves too highly on the Linguose Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culty, may not the Ass of <hi>Balaam</hi> serve for their Reproof, as well as he did for that of his Master. Nothing seems to me more unjust, than the Contempt which is offered to this noble ANIMAL by the Vul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gar, who mistake his solemn Majesty for Dullness. Should this Epistle ever appear in Public, as I hope it never will, I am sensible it would be thought an insinuating
<pb n="31" facs="62"/>
Artifice of mine, to get a Place at Court, or recommend myself to Somebody in Power; whereas, I have no such Intention, I assure you, but shall disinterestedly, and without Flattery, as far as I am able, take away part of the Burden from the Back of this generous Beast: For, What is heavier than an ill Name? in doing which, I have only imitated the renowned <hi>Osborn's</hi> and <hi>Walsingham's</hi> of these our Times, whose Labours I must acknowledge to be as far superior to mine, as they are more diffi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cult: But to proceed; ASSES formerly were not contemptible, their Names were not made a Reproach; they sometimes were cloathed in Furs like our Aldermen, and sometimes in Scarlet, and Cloath of Gold, and King's and Princes used to ride upon them. <hi>Midas,</hi> a <hi>Phrygian</hi> Monarch, had himself the Ears of an Ass, which was in those Days, held an uncommon Thing. Kings will not, out of brotherly Affection, despise them, moreover this stately Beast is not to be prevailed upon by Blows; the venerable Dispensers of our Laws are not endowed with more Gravity; all the Holy-gifted ones, should respect him as an Elder, and one of themselves; for he once spoke by the same Divine Power, they would be thought to speak by: Besides, he has that in him, which is well Worthy of
<pb n="32" facs="63"/>
their Imitation, I mean his <hi>Patience.</hi> Both Sacred and Profane History have emble<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>matized Strength and Heroism by the Ass, than which, nothing can be more natural, noble, beautiful, or just. <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he blesses his Sons, says, Issachar <hi>is a strong</hi> Ass, <hi>crouching down between two Burdens.</hi> And <hi>Homer,</hi> in the Eleventh Book of the <hi>Iliad,</hi> compares <hi>Ajax,</hi> making a noble Retreat, to one of these <hi>Animals</hi> forcing his Way into a Field of Corn, there satisfying his Hunger, and then retiring with a tardy sullen Intrepidity, Maugre the Opposition of a Troop of Boys,
<q>
                     <l>Whose ratt'ling Strokes resound upon his Sides.</l>
                  </q>
Had I nothing else to offer in their Behalf, the above-mentioned Instances are sufficient to abate all Ridicule, and draw Respect from the viperous Tongue of Calumny itself.</p>
               <p>But farther, the most eminent Poets, Orators, Historians and Naturalists, have not thought it beneath them to treat of the Ass, either in Metaphor, Simile, or De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scription Narrative. <hi>Pliny Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Cap.</hi> 37. gives large Account of him, describes his Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture, Passions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and shews us what Judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment we are to form of the pricking-up, and what from the limber and half-erected Position of his Ears. <hi>Virgil</hi> mentions him but sparingly. <hi>Horace</hi> more frequent, the

Scarce do I know whether the Ass is more indebted to the Poet for this excellent Description of him, or the Poet to the Ass, for those Qualifications of his, which were the Occasion of it: But certain I am, that every Language is enriched with ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny terse Sayings, Proverbs and Sentences, drawn from the known Qualities of this Quadrupede, <hi>fait en dos d'Asne,</hi> signifies any Thing done with Cunning. <hi>Asinus Antro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nius</hi> is a Lob-Cock. <hi>Asinus ad Lyram,</hi> and <gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 span" rend="content:〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉">

It is most unquestionable, that he has the Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantage of all other Beasts, the Sounds he utters being more articulate: And many learned Critics agree, that no living Pipe so nearly resembles the Hautboy, Bagpipe, or that more admired new-invented Water-Music, the French-Horn; the Perfor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mers upon which Instruments, if he does

               <p>I have already exceeded the Limits of a Letter, and shall conclude, after I have inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>preted two Fables, famous for their Anti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, Oenus,</hi> a Rope-maker in Hell, had an Ass always standing by him, who as fast as he twisted the Cord, bit it asunder; his Labour was thereby rendered abortive, eternally renewed, eternally frustrated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oenus</hi> resembles those hellish Ministers, who thro' their evil Counsels make Ropes to bind the People in Slavery. By the Ass is meant the honest Patriot, who, ever watch<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful for the public Safety, destroys his Schemes, discovers his Designs, drives him to invent new Mischief, which he still renders ineffectual by his Vigilance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> An Ass being honoured with carrying on his Back the Statue of <hi>Isis,</hi> the People bowed, fell on their Knees, and worshipped the Goddess: The Ass thinking his Merit to be the Cause of their Adoration, grew insolent and proud:

But when he was unloaded, they convinced him by Blows, it was not him they respec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted.</p>
               <p>By the Ass you are to understand, all such as have Places at Court; what Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spect they meet with, is not paid to them, but to their Office; from which, when they are once discarded, every Man carries a Cudgel, which will convince them of the Truth of what I say.

               <p>THIS small Packet of Letters, tho' written un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der the Fatigue of Travelling, is a delightful Proof of the true Taste both of the Thoughts and Sense of their inimitable Author. All who had the Happiness of her Conversation, were soon convinced how free she was from the general Frailties of her Sex; what a Nobleness and Generosity of Temper she possessed; how distant her Views from the least Appearance of Self-Interest, or mean Design! How often have I heard her compassionately regretting the Miseries of Mankind, and never her own, but when they prevented her extensive Charity to Others!</p>
               <p>Never was she Vindictive against the most inve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terate Enemy; the innate Softness of her Soul, ren<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dered her Deportment equally obliging to Friends and Foes, and never did she resent but with the strictest Justice.</p>

               <p>I Am got safe to <hi>Hartley-Row,</hi> and in a little better Humour than when I wrote my last. Our Landlord is a perfect Beau, and most exquisitely performs the Honours of his House. I am in pain for his Assidui<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty: I cannot fetch a Step, no not to the Window, from the Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he is Squiring me; and so dressed, and so con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceited, that nothing but serving a loose Apprenticeship, could have set him up a Master in the Trade of Foppery. He was a <hi>Goldsmith</hi>'s 'Prentice, where he studied more his Pleasures, than Profit. This House fell to him, and he wisely resolved to keep it himself, with the Help of his Sister, who is a neat, housewifely, obliging sort of Woman. I suppose it is, by much, the best Entertainment this Road affords. They have a tolerable Cook; and I was glad to find something I could eat at Three o'Clock, for we came in here at Two, and I can give you a little better Account of my Fellow-Travellers. The <hi>Sir,</hi> I spoke
<pb n="47" facs="78"/>
of, is a Baronet's Son, as he has carefully given me to understand: I take it for gran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted, he <hi>likes</hi> me, and would have me do the <hi>same</hi> by him. As he came in, he put off his Travelling Suit, for a Coat and Vest, designed to dazzle the Curate and all his Congregation. The Way I took to morti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fy his Foppery, was, not to speak a Word of the Change; which made him extream uneasy: At length, cut of all Patience, he desired my Opinion, if his Taylor had used him well? What the Brocade was worth a Yard? How many Ounces of Silver-Fringe? And recommended to my Curio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sity the exquisite Workmanship of the Loops; and then gave me the Sum Total of his Cost. I answered him, That Finery was lost upon me; I neither was, nor pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tended to be a Judge. He pertly answer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, He perceived by my Sullenness, that I had a great deal of Wit; tho' I understood he had but little by his Remark. Well, all this did not do: He would fain have had me enquired into his Family, Intrigues, and Fortune; which when he perceived I had no Curiosity for, 'Faith Madam, <hi>(says he)</hi> I beg your Ladyship's Opinion, if I am not the most unfortunate Man breathing: I'll tell you a very mortifying Adventure. Nay, you must hear me. I vow, this In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>differency does not look natural to you;

your Eyes promise us much more Fire. <hi>I'll shut 'em, thought I, for ever, rather than such a Fop shall find any thing to like them for.</hi> What! no Answer, Madam, <hi>(says he)</hi> I perceive your Attention by your Silence. 'Gad, I love a Person of your Breeding, that know themselves better than to inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rupt a good Story. Perhaps Madam is not well with her Journey, <hi>answered Mrs.</hi> May<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>oress <hi>of</hi> Totness. Alas! I wonder Riding in the Coach should not have got you a better Stomach. Poor Gentlewoman, she has scarce eat any thing.

               <p>It happened at <hi>Oxford</hi> three Months ago (where I often came, my Father's Estate being not far distant) I saw a Lady, and fell in Love with her; ay Gad, Madam, down<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>right in Love with her. She was a Person genteely bred, and had seen the <hi>Beau-Monde,</hi> made the <hi>Tour</hi> of all the Places of Gallan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try, shined in the Drawing-Room, languish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed in the Boxes, adorned the Park; in a Word, was all a Man of my Circumstances
<pb n="49" facs="80"/>
could desire in one he was resolved to make an Oblation of his Heart to. But as her Honour was my Care, and not marrying my Design, I searched for a dexterous Pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tence to visit, and be happy. I took Mr. <hi>Slye</hi> with me, a Gentleman of the Town, who had a Wife: To give you the Character of my Friend, He was naturally amorous, had a handsome Person, and Strains of natural Wit beyond whatever I saw in the most Acquired; and your Ladyship must allow me to be a Judge of Wit, by so dexterous<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly finding out yours, maugre your Silence. I bowed for this extraordinary Compli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment; and thought I could not more agreeably return it, than by continuing my Silence; and as the Poet has it, <hi>left him to his dear Mistake.</hi> Mr. <hi>Slye,</hi> continued he, was to propose a Marriage between me and my Lady <hi>Conquest,</hi> to the old People her Relations, whom she was just come to live with: But as soon as he saw her, if I was her First <hi>Oxford</hi> Victim, he was certainly the Second; and, as I found, presently took with her. She had a very fine Hand, which Mr. <hi>Slye,</hi> according to the Country Liberty, kissed; and then, with <hi>Cleveland,</hi> said,
<q>
                     <l>So soft, 'tis Air but once remov'd;</l>
                     <l>Tender, as 'twere a Jelly Glov'd.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="50" facs="81"/>
She gave him a Look, which seemed to say, she wondered in that Place at such a Piece of Gallantry; and then pursuing with her Wit the Victory of her Eyes, charm'd my Friend to that Degree, that he told me, he must enjoy her, or die. <hi>'Gad, Madam, was not this a very odd Turn? I carried him to speak for me; and he comes to make me the Confidant of his Designs?</hi> We agreed tho', as Friends should, to keep our mutual Confidence secret from her, and to endeavour each of us to make him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self happy, and faithfully to relate the Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gress of our Amours. But because the Country is much given to Tatling, the Pretensions of Marriage went on. Lady <hi>Conquest</hi> was Airy and Coquet; loved Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pany and Gallantry, if they could be pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chased with Safety: But she knew so well how to manage every body, that none durst speak to her, more than she had a mind to hear. I was one of the awed Fools. <hi>'Gad! would you believe, Madam, that Love could make so great an Ass of a Man of my Under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>standing?</hi> And yet it was not altogether that neither, my Pride was concerned; I was resolv'd not to serve for her Diversion, till I was sure she was consenting to be mine; but could no more keep out of her Company, than I could hang myself. I desired her to walk: She consented, with a
<pb n="51" facs="82"/>
Crony she picked up, upon Condition I would engage Mr. <hi>Slye</hi> of the Party. I was jealous, but to no Purpose; either my Rival's Company, or not my Mistress's. <hi>Slye</hi> pretended Fear of his Wife, that he durst not appear in public with any other Woman; for she already began to have Ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prehensions of my Lady <hi>Conquest,</hi> whose Way of Living was remote to those of Country-Gentlewomens; and therefore he was resolved to think no more of her; tho' infinitely pleasing to him; for his Fortune depended, in a great measure, upon his Wife's Mother. I came back with this doleful News to Lady <hi>Conquest. Go tell him,</hi> answered she, <hi>he who has pretended to love me, should fear nothing more than not being beloved; and that I command him to meet us at the appointed Place.</hi> I ran, like a Fool, to do her Message, which I believed Raillery, because she ought to have been more cautious of a married Man's Love, if serious. <hi>Slye</hi> wanted but Intreaty: He consented, and we met, but not to my Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fort; tho' the Expence was mine, he had the Profit: She was not easy unless he sat nigh her; she talked to him, stared at him, did every thing to shew she was pleased; whilst I, by a Notion of Pride, would pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tend nothing, for fear I should not have all: <hi>For 'Gad, Madam, I do not love being baulked thus.</hi> Several Times we met, but all
<pb n="52" facs="83"/>
as little to the Purpose. Undoubtedly, she saw I loved her, but would not see, because I was of Use in her Affair with <hi>Slye.</hi> The whole Town talked of our approach<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Wedding, and I began to be Fool enough to resolve on it, thro' <hi>Slye</hi>'s Persuasion, who continually extolled her Honour and Virtue, and tickled my Pride with the News of her Love; but that she wanted a Declaration from me, before I could ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pect a Confession from her. I told him, I would think on it; and so we parted. That Night (as Chance would have it) I passed along by the House where she lived, and I found the Gate open: I know not what Devil of Curiosity carried me in; and when in, to go to her Chamber: I did both unseen, and concealed myself behind the Bed, which I saw sitted for Night. I resolved to wait till she should be in Bed, and then to take Advantage of her Woman's Absence, (who lay in the Anti-Chamber) and there to declare my Love, and offer her Marriage. Long I had not waited, <hi>(tho' 'Gad, Madam, I was very im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>patient, and thought every Minute Seven)</hi> when the charming Fair came from her Dressing-Room, with nothing on but her Night-Gown and Slippers, which were soon thrown off, and the Goddess appeared more beauteous than the naked Queen of Love. The happy Bed soon received her;
<pb n="53" facs="84"/>
and she cryed, <hi>Haste, and bring my Lover to me.</hi> At these Words her Woman went into the Anti-Chamber, and returned soft<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly with <hi>Slye;</hi> who flew to her Arms, sigh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, kissed, and died there.—<hi>Imagine my Surprize!</hi> 'Twas so great I could not in a long time shew myself to interrupt 'em: At length, seeing him undress for Bed, 'Gad, Madam, my Patience was quite ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pired; <hi>Traytor,</hi> says I, shewing myself, <hi>Is it thus thou preservest thy feigned Duty to thy Wife?</hi> I laid my Hand upon my Sword, and he did the like on his; and we had certainly drawn, had not the Amorous Fair thrown herself out of Bed between us, and conjured us on her Knees to make no Noise, else she was lost for ever. I raised her naked Beauties, and carried them whence they came, but complained at my hard Fortune, which had made me the Instrument of my own Ruin. She saw I was extreamly touched at it, and after her Shame and Surprize was a little over, <hi>You have no Reason, Sir,</hi> (said she) <hi>to complain of me: I could have no Engagements with a Man who never pretended to love me. Tho' you have given me the Glory of refusing you as a Husband (in the Eyes of the Town) it could not but nettle me, to know there was nothing serious on your Side, but done like a Gentle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man, to secure my Reputation amongst ill-bred</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="85"/>
                  <hi>Fools, who know not the Charms of Conver<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sation, and will not permit it (without Cen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure) to those that do. But 'Gad, Madam,</hi> (answered I) <hi>your Ladyship is not so dull, but to know I loved you: All my Assiduities, Uneasiness, Sighs, and Ogleings, must have informed you. Our Sex dares hardly believe yours</hi> (she replied) <hi>when you take Pains to speak: And sure it were an unpardonable Va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity to draw such Consequences without it. These Circumstances you pretend, I have found common to all Gentlemen: Therefore must I conclude the whole World is in Love with me; and deny myself those who tell me they are my Servants, for the vain Imagina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion that another is silently so? 'Gad, Madam,</hi> (answered I) <hi>I cannot possibly forgive the Preference of a dull, silly, sober, married Man, to an airy, well-dressed, young, amorous One. I will be gone to</hi> London <hi>by Break of Day, for fear I should not conceal my Resentments, and so injure your Ladyship irreparably: For 'Gad, Madam, I must repeat again, you were to blame to slight all the Pains I took to breed you for nobler Game.</hi> This last, I con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fess, broke my splenetic Silence, and I could not hold laughing heartily; which amply paid my Squire for the Pains he had taken in his Relation. He con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cluded it with telling me his Journey to <hi>London,</hi> and short Stay there, only to ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>couter;

I answered him, That I found Experience had made him resolve against losing a Second Mistress for want of speaking. He had Manners sufficient (or rather Conscience) to think he had given me enough of his <hi>Beau</hi>-self for one Day, and withdrew.</p>
               <p>I could not forbear, late as it was, send<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing you an Account: If you laugh in your Turn, I am paid for my Pains, as well as the Squire. It is now past Eleven, and they will call us by Two: Good Night; I am going to try if I can drown in Sleep that which most sensibly affects me, the cruel Separation we have so lately suffered.</p>

               <p>DO not you think I am more constant than your Friendship could hope, or mine pretend to? I think it a great Proof of it, amidst the Fatigues of a West-Country Journey, to give you thus duly an Account of my insignificant self, and Travels. We parted from <hi>Hartley-Row</hi> at Three this Morning, thro' a Croud of Beggars who watch our Coach for Alms; and will never leave it unblessed. Hence my <hi>Beau</hi> took Occasion of <hi>Simile;</hi> bid me to observe how wakeful those Wretches were for small Charities, that he would do the like, in hopes of greater; and that my divine Idea had so filled his Sight, he could not resolve to let Sleep intrude, for fear of shutting me out. I perceived he took Pains to be thought uneasy, and I have more good Manners than to disappoint him. Mrs. <hi>Mayoress,</hi> now she is acquainted, has all the low, disagreeable Familiarity of Peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple of her Rank. She entertained us all the Morning with a sorry Love-business
<pb n="57" facs="88"/>
about her Second Husband; Stuff so im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pertinent, I remember nothing of it. <hi>Beau</hi> continues in his Assiduities: I think none was ever so plagued with dying Eyes; his are continually in that Posture, and my Opposites, that I am forced to take a good deal of Pains to avoid them. The two other Fellow-Travellers were never so pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>moted before, and are much troubled their Journey is to last no longer, and wish the four Days four Months. I hope every Jolt will squash their Guts, and give them enough of it: But they are Proof against any such Disasters, and hugely delighted with what they are pleased to call <hi>Riding in State.</hi> After this ridiculous Account, you need not doubt but I am thoroughly mortified. The <hi>Trouts</hi> are just brought upon the Table, which are the only good Thing here; they look inviting, and will not stay for cooling Compliments. I hope Time will shew none, to say,</p>

               <p>I Cannot give myself any Reason why these Coach-men are such unrea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sonable Rogues: They make us rise at Two in the Morning, to bring us into our Inn at the same Hour in the After<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>noon. After we were reposed a little, <hi>Beau</hi> shined again (as Yesterday) and waited upon me to Evening-Prayers. I need say nothing to you of <hi>Salisbury</hi> Cathe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dral: If in a foreign Country, as the LADY in her <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi>

                  </note> I could entertain you with a noble Description; but you have either seen, or may see it; and so I will spare my Architecture. There are abun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dance of pretty, innocent-looked Women, genteel enough; but I have lost my Heart to a'handsome Churchman. I never thought before that Dress was tolerable; but so wore, it seems a mighty Ornament. He was placed behind me; but I turned my Devotion, and kneeled to him, imagining him no less than (as in Antique Days) some
<pb n="59" facs="90"/>
High Priest of the Sun. The Canon gave me Cause to think he had dined too well, and was obliged to his Snuff, more than Religion, for keeping him awake. Well, Devotion done, I was forced to break up mine, and leave him without a Knowledge of his Conquest. As we were walking to our Inn, I asked <hi>Beau</hi> what we should do to pass the next Day without being very weary of each other, for <hi>Sunday</hi> does not per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mit Travelling. He (you may be sure) did not fail to tell me, he could never be wea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry of me, tho' (himself) expiring by my Sight and Cruelty. I waved his Compli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, and told him my Design of engaging the People in the <hi>Exeter</hi> Coach (if they seemed worth it) to live with us for the Time. When we returned, we were told it was not yet come in, occasioned by the breaking of the Axle-tree five Miles off; but that a Fellow was gone to mend it, and they were expected every Moment. My Chamber-Window answered the Court; I rose to it at the Noise of the Coach, and presently saw alight, a tall, blustering, big<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bon'd, raw Thing, like an over-grown School-Boy, but conceited above any Thing. He had an Appurtenance, called a <hi>Wife,</hi> whom he suffered to get out as well as she could. As long as he had lain by her, he did not think her worth the Civility of his Hand.
<pb n="60" facs="91"/>
She seemed a Giant of a Woman, but ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry fine, with a right Cit's Air. He bluster<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed presently for the best Lodging, which he saw taken up by her that held the fine Fan before her Face: You may guess this was your humble Servant. The Cham<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berlain told him, it was their Custom, first come, first served; but that there were very good Chambers besides. The rest of the Company were <hi>two</hi> Things that looked pert and aukward; Tradesmens Daughters I judged them. But methoughts, casting my Eyes upon a Gentlewoman and her Servant, that came out last, I found some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing pleased me; whether it were because she really deserved it, or that the Stuff she was with set her off. I had a Basin of fine Heart-Cherries before me, just come from the Garden: I caused them to be brought after me into the Gallery, and designed them as a Bait to the Woman whom I was to begin the Acquaintance with; for <hi>Beau</hi> designed to set up to get a Fortune in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> and was unwilling to shew any Irregularity; and I thought myself above their Reflec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions. The first that appeared was the Wife, with a rising Belly: This seemed a good Hint; I offered them to her, not knowing but she might <hi>long.</hi> The Sight (I suppose) did not displease her, for she readily accep<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted, and eat very greedily. The Genteel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>looked
<pb n="61" facs="92"/>
Lady had much to do to be persuad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed. As for the other <hi>two,</hi> they were gone to chuse a Lodging. We presently grew acquainted, taking Travellers Liberty, and supped together. But, shall I tell you! the Wife grew jealous of me. It seems, her Temper was such; and her Husband (no small Man in his Country, though him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self just set up in Merchandizing at <hi>London;</hi> his Father, one of the Canons at <hi>Exeter:</hi>) thought he might carry all Hearts before him, as well as the Country-Lasses. They were come from visiting their Friends, and returning to their House in <hi>London.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Stanhope</hi> (for that was the Lady's Name whom I liked) told me, I was not to count upon the Conquest, for he had given her <hi>Douceurs</hi> all the Way, and made her ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tream uneasy, because his Wife appeared to be such. We grew into an Intimacy, and left the Company. My <hi>Beau</hi> was to me faithless and inconstant. One of the aukward little Things I told you of, and who had a tolerable Face, was a Goldsmith's Daughter of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and acquainted with his Lady-Sister; that began their Acquain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tance. She seemed free and fond: He took the Hint, and applied himself to her; which I was very glad of. Mrs. <hi>Stanhope</hi> went with me to my Chamber; and after much Discourse, offered Friendship, and
<pb n="62" facs="93"/>
mutual Knowledge of each other; she gave me this Account of her last Adven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture:</p>
               <p>I came now from <hi>Falmouth, (says she)</hi> where I have been ever since the Begin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ning of the Spring, to visit a Brother and his Wife who live there. Until within these six Weeks I saw nothing that pleased me: At last it was a Captain of a Man of War had the Chance; my Brother brought him to his House: And for my Excuse, I must tell you, he is a very pretty, genteel young Gentleman, of a good Family and Education, and in Prospect of coming to very good Fortune. They talked of the Town and Country Beauties: At last, a young Creature was named, whom I had not seen; but the Captain set her before every thing he had. I was concerned at his Opinion, and asked him his of the Duchess of <hi>Grafton?</hi> He gave her due Praise; but yet in his Esteem, this ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceeded. I could not but think him ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>treamly in the Wrong; and was angry when I heard him wish himself a Man of mighty Fortune, to deserve her. He sailed that Night; and after ten Days Cruise, came in again. His first Visit was to me. I asked him if he had seen his Mistress? He said he had none. I remembred him of what he had spoke. He answered, that I
<pb n="63" facs="94"/>
had taught him better. He continued his Applications, visited me three Times a Day: And because I was still jealous of his Words, I had him watched, and an Account brought of all his Visits. The young La<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dy's Uncle made a Ball; but because my Brother and he were not well together, there was no Hopes of my being invited; which my Lover very well knew, and therefore said, he would not be there, ha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ving received Orders to sail. He took his Leave with transporting Sorrow; and had the Glory to find mine was real. How<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever, I would not lose the Ball, because I desired to see my reputed Rival. I for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>got to tell you he had never seen her but once, when he praised her to that Degree; and dexterously told me, a second Sight had undeceived him. I dressed myself like a Farmer's Wife, with a Basket on my Arm; and by the Help of one of the Ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vants, was placed like a Country Gazer at the Corner of the Room. I needed not to be told my Rival, a thousand dazzling Charms distinguished her; and tho' I look<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed with jealous Eyes, must acknowledge I never saw any Beauty more perfect. All my Hopes lay in a certain Softness, which did not promise much Wit. In a little Time my Traytor (whom I imagined in the wide Ocean) came to the Ball, danced
<pb n="64" facs="95"/>
with his Mistress, and was as assiduous as she deserved. I was so well pleased at the Discovery, I stayed not for any more, for fear I should not escape myself. About Midnight he came (for a Minute) to see me, and told me he was just come ashore, the Ship under Sail; yet without another Sight, it was impossible for him to depart. I confounded him with telling him what had so lately passed at the Ball: Yet he drew himself out of the Embarrass, and said every thing to make me think he loved me; and we were seriously treating upon the Affair of Matrimony. I told him he must get my Father's Consent who lived at <hi>London,</hi> where I was going. He begged me to defer my Journey till he came in; which I too readily promised; and so we parted. I knew my Fortune fairer than my Rival's, and began to be persuaded I had the better of her. For, what else could draw him to address me? When I saw him return, it was with mutual Joy: But he was ordered that same Night to sail to <hi>Ply<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mouth,</hi> and did not expect to be back in a Week; therefore we agreed upon my Jour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney. He swore an inviolable Love, and would have contracted himself, if I durst, without my Father's Consent: He intended to write to his Friends above to ask it. And thus we once more parted, but not till he
<pb n="65" facs="96"/>
had severely exclaimed against any Designs upon my Rival, before a whole Crew of Town-Gossips, that I was sure would tell her. You may conclude we agreed upon Writing. I took my Journey, and stay<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed at an Aunt's House in <hi>Exeter</hi> Ten Days; where I heard that within Four of my Departure, my Lover returned; and in three more was publickly married to my Rival. I wrote to thank him for ridding me of a knavish Husband, wish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed him Joy, took Coach, and resolved against too easily believing any Man again.</p>

               <head>LETTER VI.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>BEAU</hi> is now grown so <hi>insipid,</hi> that I shall say very little of him for the future; and I have Reason to believe my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self <hi>such</hi> to him; for these two last Even<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings (contrary to Custom) he has not re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dressed: The Fatigue which he seems more sensible of than any of us, has tarnished the Lustre of his Eyes; and instead of any farther Ogleing, drowns all his amorous Pretensions in as profound Sleep as the un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>easy Jolting of the Coach will permit. This is what I can never be so happy to gain. But to tell you something of our last Night's Entertainment: Whilst Supper was getting ready, the Gentleman I told you of, at <hi>Beau</hi>'s Intreaty, gave us an Account of what Affairs were carrying him to <hi>London:</hi> The short of it is this,</p>
               <p>Your Ladyship <hi>(says he)</hi> may soon per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceive by my Accent, that I am a Foreigner. I had the Glory of following the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (now our auspicious King) in his
<pb n="69" facs="100"/>
Expedition into <hi>England.</hi> We landed in the West, with all those Particulars, which are needless to repeat. During our Stay at <hi>Exeter,</hi> I rendered my constant Devotion at the Cathedral; and in coming thence one Evening, an old Woman (with a Look as mean as a Beggar) presented me a Letter; which when I had opened, I found from an Unknown, who stiled himself my Friend, and gave me this Advice, that a Lady of good Country-Quality and Fortune (and who was then in <hi>Exeter</hi>) was going to be disposed of by her Mother to a Man she no way affected: But that she had been heard to say, <hi>If the handsome</hi> Switzer <hi>were in his Place, she should obey without Reluctancy.</hi> And concluded the Letter with giving me Advice, like a good Friend, to improve my growing Fortune; for so considerable an one as Twelve Thousand Pounds was not every Day thrown into a Soldier's Lap. I had forgot to tell your Ladyship the Letter was writ in <hi>French,</hi> the Lady's Name, and Directions to her Lodgings. My Heart gave me a secret Presage that the Matter would not be lucky to me, which I follow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, and therefore took no Notice of the Letter. Three Days after, the same old Woman brought me another, much more pressing: Upon which I gave myself blind<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly up to my Destiny. I visited, and found
<pb n="70" facs="101"/>
the Lady, tho' not a Beauty, yet genteel and taking. It was easy to guess by my Reception, that the Letters came from her. I will omit the Discourse we had, and only rest upon Matter of Fact. She obliged me to leave my Command, and go with her to her Estate. Her Mother looked upon me with an evil Eye, but my Mistress was transport<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ingly kind, and much concerned that none of the Ministers round durst marry us, for fear of the old Lady. Whereupon we con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cluded I should pretend to take my Leave, as desingning for <hi>London;</hi> but instead of that, go directly into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where she had a considerable Estate, and would meet me. The Matter happened as we agreed; but for fear her Mother should pursue us, she consented to <hi>take me for her Husband,</hi> before the Parson could be got to make us <hi>such.</hi> That happy Night I had all the Reason in the World to believe myself agreeable to her; and all was confirmed in the Morning by the Priest. Thus caressed and blessed, we returned to her House. The old Lady (who had no Command of her Daughter's Fortune, and saw the Business beyond Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>medy) was one of the first to make her Court to me, and wish me Joy. Three happy Months I had all the Satisfaction that innocent Marriage and excessive Love in a Bride, could give me. Then I began
<pb n="71" facs="102"/>
to consider a little my Affairs, and proposed to my Wife my being naturalized, that I might look after hers. She swooned at the Name; and when she recovered, she snatched a Bayonet of mine, and wounded herself under the Left Breast, but not much. I cannot express my Surprize: We hushed the Matter for fear of her Mother; and I employed some of my Soldiery Skill to cure it, which had the Effect. I enquir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed into the Reason of this Extravagancy. She told me the Discovery of <hi>Interest</hi> in me, when she had believed <hi>Love</hi> was the only Motive of our <hi>Marriage.</hi> Some Days pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sed, and as often as I offered at it, she re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceived such mighty Disgust, that I resolved to get it done without her Notice; for she took me not as a Husband, but a Lover. It was true, I was received as a Guest, but not a Master; and my Circumstance (hav<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing left my Command) required that. I got her Leave for my Journey: She shew<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed such extravagant Passion at our Separa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, that I swore a speedy Return; and resolved to leave my Naturalization depend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, look after my other Affairs and return within a Fortnight to her: But before that Time I had a dangerous Fit of Sickness at <hi>London.</hi> I wrote often to her, and gave her an Account that the <hi>Act was passed,</hi> and I could now happily call myself an
<pb n="72" facs="103"/>
                  <hi>English</hi> Husband. She only answered, She knew how to interpret it; but she was out in her Cunning, if I should find an <hi>English</hi> Wife at my Service, who knew not the true Value and Use of one. This Letter damped me; but trusting to the Greatness of that Power Love had given me in her Heart, I did not question but my Presence would make all Things easy. I took Post, my Impatience would not stay the Coach, tho' the Remains of my Fever seemed to expect it. I gave myself no Rest during the whole Journey. I sent to give her No<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tice of my Arrival: but what was my Sur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prize, to find all shut at home! I called under her Window where I perceived Light: It was a heavy Night of Rain: I knocked at the Gates, and stormed, but all to no Purpose; I was glad to take up my Lodging in the Porch. At Six in the Mor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ning an Under-Servant appeared: I asked for her Lady. She told me she was gone none knew whether, and had conveyed away her Plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that, if I pleased, an empty House was at my Service. I calmly bore all this, imagining it but a Tryal, sought her round the Country, but in vain; she often shifted Places, and went disguised. Not long after, she commenced a <hi>Process</hi> against me, and by a Pretence (which will for ever make her notorious)
<pb n="73" facs="104"/>
rendered me to the Court as <hi>Incapable.</hi> I was still so tender of her Fame, as to suffer the Aspersion. Common Law separted us: She got the better, by my refusing to vin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dicate myself; and I Fifteen Hundred Pounds of her Fortune and the Charges of the Court. It is since last <hi>August</hi> that this has happened. I have vainly tried to remove her implacable Aversion, or to learn the Cause of it: But I see my Endeavours are all fruitless; and I am now going to leave <hi>England</hi> (I think) for ever.</p>
               <p>I complimented him upon his Misfor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tunes, and really, in my Opinion, he could not be deserving of them. 'Gad, Madam, (<hi>says</hi> Beau) see what inconstant Things you Ladies are! I happened to be at this Gentleman's House when he was first married, and never saw any thing so fond of him as his Wife. 'Gad, I do not be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lieve whatever Woman I make happy, tho' her Esteem be equal to my Merit, she can possibly be fonder.</p>
               <p>I am now got safely, weary into <hi>Exe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter;</hi> and I thank God, rid of the Imper<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinency of my Fellow-Travellers, <hi>Beau</hi> excepted, who will see me safe home, tho' distant from his. The Cathedral here is very fine; the Bishop's Seat, in it, sur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>passes <hi>Salisbury;</hi> tho' short in every thing
<pb n="74" facs="105"/>
else. Forgive me for leaving you thus abruptly, since it is more pleasingly to en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tertain myself with a Letter of yours just brought to me.</p>

               <p>IF I have omitted answering your Three last, it proceeded from nothing but the Desire of doing something new; and you know it is extremely so in me, not eager<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly to shew you all Testimonies of Friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship. My Solitude is much more pleasing than I fancied it: As yet I am not weary of that happy Indifferency, which leaves me nothing either to hope or fear.</p>

               <p>I have most foppish Letters from <hi>Beau,</hi> who parted with a World of seeming Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gret; and yet I hear he is endeavouring at a Mistress: I suppose I may bid his Imper<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinence farewel for ever. I think I bid you hope (in one of mine) to hear no more of him; I know not how I am fallen upon the nauseous Repetition. <hi>Themistocles</hi> re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fused <hi>Simonides,</hi> when he would have taught

               <p>I Am sorry I cannot make good my Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mise to so indearing a Friend as your<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self. Looking over my Papers, I find but one of Colonel PACK's Letters in Imitation of the <hi>Portugal</hi> NUN's: I certainly had <hi>Three,</hi> which he sent to me for my Opi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nion; but <hi>Two</hi> are lost, which I very much regret; and the more, because I know not where he is, to repair it. I would hear how you approve his Stile. I think <hi>Imi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tation</hi> the hardest Part of Writing: It con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fines a free-born Genius, which naturally loves untrod Wilds; at least, if I may guess at another's by my own. And now I am speaking of that, let me tell you all those romantic Ideas of <hi>Retirement,</hi> which view<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed at a Distance, give a ravishing Prospect, now I am wedded, and bedded to, prove the worst sort of <hi>Matrimony;</hi> but it is only to such a particular Friend as yourself, that I dare complain; to the remoter Sort I assume a Stoical Appetite and Air—Tell them, <hi>The World, with all its gaudy Pleasures, are but rich Delusions, which at once corrupt</hi>

But let me tell you, there is no real Satisfaction without <hi>Conversation.</hi> I have had so much of the <hi>Dead</hi> since I settled here, and (as I may say) nothing of the <hi>Living,</hi> (for I find none deserves the <hi>Name</hi>) that I wish for the conjuring Art; and would rather con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verse with the Ghosts of the Departed, than always with their Books, or with myself. But I forget, I detain you from better Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pany; I mean the inclosed. Write to me still, but nothing of News; I desire to hear none till I see <hi>London</hi> again; and when that will be, I have not the Pleasure so much as to imagine: It will be new (to lie <hi>for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gotten,</hi> and <hi>forgetting,</hi> and as it were, be born with Understanding) to all the Vani<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties and Virtues (if any) of that <hi>Hydra.</hi>

            <head>A LETTER FROM A NUN in <hi>Portugal,</hi> TO A GENTLEMAN in <hi>France.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>OH my <hi>fled Heart!</hi> and he that so un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>justly keeps it from me! Was not your barbarous Resolution sufficient that I should never possess <hi>Yours;</hi> but you must add the Use of all your best Art to keep me from my <hi>Own?</hi> In what Disorder do I speak and write, for want of <hi>a poor tender Heart!</hi> That is gone a Pilgrimage to Love, and (the unkind Heavens not hearing its Prayer) has thro' Distraction lost its Way, and never will return again? Fire fets on
<pb n="80" facs="111"/>
Fire: Why then does not my Flame make you burn? It is a false Maxim: <hi>Extremity of Cold scorches.</hi> Had I at first put on a Behaviour more cool and remote to your pretended Affection, and treated you with Unkindness, how many Bows and Vows would you have offered at <hi>Love's-Altar?</hi> With what Ardency would you have con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinued your Protestations? Who would have thought that a Fire (at first) so well kindled as yours, should need Fanning with an infectious Blast to preserve its Heat? Or that the wholsome Sun should put it out? But that alas! was my Mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fortune: My Burning was the greater, and drew yours away.—How can I then with any Confidence blame you, for what I myself was truly and principally the Oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>casion of? You too easily perceived how earnestly I was wont to watch your Eyes, that they looked not on others; as if mine took it unkindly they were not gazed on altogether. How perverse are our Fates! Why else was it not contrived that you might be as happy in me, as it was possible for me to be in you? Say what you will, you was to blame. What Care you took to assault my Affections, was sufficiently discoverable in the constant Ardour and Formality of your Approaches; contriving to appear at all Times as engaging as pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sible.
<pb n="81" facs="112"/>
Your Conquest was not so great: You could not well have met with a Heart less fortified for a Defence: Ye Gods! that I should yield upon your very <hi>first Sum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mons;</hi> and so dishonourably, that I was not allowed <hi>Flying Colours!</hi> Nay, what is yet more, that I should bear so mean, so low, and so contemptible a Spirit, as to take in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>finitely more Delight in my own Captivity and Vassallage, than in the most flourish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Tranquillity! What do I thus rave up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on? What would I have? If I am happy in my Condition, why do I not rest and retain my Senses like others of my Sex? But that still (and I fear ever) I have the same sad Tune to sing;</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>My Conqueror (whom I adored for being so) is gone; and my Cloyster is now as much a Prison to me, as it was Heaven, and Liber<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty, and all Things, when I had him there. It was an unworthy Thing to steal my better Part, my Soul, away, and not think this little Frame, its old Companion, worth taking with you. But what you had got, you thought was of light Carriage, needed little Stowage, paid no Freight, and (I dare stake my Life) was the All you ever intended to have of me: And to be so served, is (it seems) the All I am ever likely to expect from you. How grosly did I flatter myself, and abuse you,</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="113"/>
                  <hi>whenever I imagined you would be kind and true to me! You that are so cruel, that could you reduce any other Woman into my ill Cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstances, if there was a Third in the World, you would certainly leave the former, and there feign fresh Adorations. If there was not, yet purely to gratify your Inhumanity to her, even I, now slighted and neglected, should then have your Company; for you could not brook being put by a Pleasure of that Kind, though it cost you the Trouble of going to one who loved you more than the World.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>How very odd (and as tho' you were writing to some public Place of Intelligence) was that <hi>Discourse</hi> of yours in your last Letter! <hi>concerning the great Lightning and Thunder which you say happened in your Parts!</hi> Also, <hi>you desire to know what Wea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther we have had here.</hi> Are these proper Enquiries for a Love-Letter? Truly it might have <hi>Thundered, Lightened,</hi> and <hi>Rained,</hi> or it might have been very <hi>plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sant delightful Weather</hi> for aught I know; for I am not capable of making any Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>marks of that kind: But this I can inform you, being too sure of the Truth of it, that it has been very <hi>stormy Weather</hi> in my <hi>Eyes</hi> ever since your Departure; and until you return (the only <hi>Sun,</hi> whose Influence
<pb n="83" facs="114"/>
can disperse these <hi>Clouds</hi>) I fear it will ever be <hi>Tempestuous.</hi> This Account (it may be) pleases you more than if I had sent you Word the ill <hi>Weather</hi> had reached our Country, demolished our Monastery, set me at Liberty, and I was in Pursuit of you. Then, then, how I would glut my Revenge by the Incursions of my Love! For it should hunt you in all Places and all Countries. And since it wore so much the Visage of an evil Spirit in your Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceit here, as to make you quit the Spot, I would try whether Change of Air would alter its Complection and Features, so as to force you into a better Opinion of it, and be thoroughly revenged on you that Way: For <hi>to love,</hi> I find is the Unhappiness you would avoid above all other things: But your Appetite and Taste is as much depraved as my Project is vain and imprac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticable: I find the Sour of <hi>France</hi> gratifies your Palate above the Sweets of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and a <hi>French</hi> LADY (with her distant Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gards to your Address, and, at last, coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terfeit artificial Acceptance) shall engage you much more than the Loyalty, Integri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty, Truth and Freedom of my unlimited Passion. Will not the World swear we are both mad? You for preferring a Counter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>feit, (because it glisters, before the true Metal itself, which is known to every
<pb n="84" facs="115"/>
Child by its Weight:) I for my Fidelity to so much Ingratitude. But let the World blame us as it pleases, I am resolved to be as true to you, as you to your natural In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>constancy. To what a Degree of Bliss should I be advanced, if I could find you complaining of the Remissness of my Love, and admiring the Intenseness of your own: Then I should be but too happy if that Fault was not found on your Side, as alas! to all the World too visibly it is: And the same Conceptions you make of an Immen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sity, will but just serve you to fathom my Zeal, which (although cherished and pru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ned after the most careful Manner) is pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ductive of nothing but the most bitter, sour, and unpleasant Fruits imaginable.—Your unkind Dealings and Actions to me, are the Fruits of my extraordinary Passion. What Soul could imagine such dissonant Notes should strike, to interrupt the Har<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mony of my Affection? In what had you been the worse, had you retaliated my ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tream Kindness with but a little of yours; and although more than a little be my Due, yet with the least Grain I could have wrought my own Contentment: But you are so unjust to deny all, and leave me to a racking and a miserable Despair; one Hour's Torment of which, I would not wish you should endure Ages to come, to
<pb n="85" facs="116"/>
be set free myself; and yet no otherwise fond of my Condition, but as it is a Gift of yours, and which (for any Thing less than your Love) I will never part with. O! barbarous, barbarous Man! to deny me that which you take more Pains to throw away upon another, than I can do to ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain it. You shall not use me thus; indeed you must not: It is I say it, but you re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard not that, so insensible are you of my Condition; which though never so unfor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tunate as to my own particular, yet is ag<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gravated with Cares for your Welfare, who are the sole Cause of my Unhappiness. How you will relish this <hi>Letter</hi> I know not; I fear you will think there are too many Invectives against your Tyranny; in which I will agree with you myself, and ask your Forgiveness: But alas! they are as gentle as I could possibly persuade my Pen to drop; for since you take so much Pleasure in a hard Heart, I would not for the World any ways cross you, by making you less ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>durate; so tenderly I value your Satisfac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, and so little (for your sake) my own. But oh! the infinite Pleasures you would find in <hi>Love,</hi> if you thought them worth the looking after! <hi>Love</hi> (as it is, or is not mutual) is the truest Epitome of the super<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>natural States: If mutual, the Joys are la<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sting, and never cloy; if not, the Tor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments
<pb n="86" facs="117"/>
are intolerable, yet must be endur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed. Oh! that any thing I could say might dissolve you to a Sense of my miserable Life; or, indeed rather your own! And yet if it could in the least enter into my Thoughts, that you are altogether at Repose, I assure you, I would never interrupt you; no Noise of my Afflictions should ever be your Distur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bance: But I am very much mistaken, if you are altogether without Remorse for the Sufferings you have brought upon me. I remember you once was flexible, and of a compassionate Nature, and your Behaviour very like a Gentleman; whatever has mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guided you to the Abuse of my Favours, which (if I have Knowledge of my Heart) were at first, much more for your sake than my own, you were the Aggressor, and not I; and whatever Kindness I shewed you, was more to make me happy, than your<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self; that by Charity to a Serpent, I at last was stung. It is said that venomous Crea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tures have a balsamick Quality in them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves, to cure the Wounds they make: But you (more unnatural than all the rest) have none; at least, most cruelly you with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hold it from me. Oh Heaven! that I had but Power to contain myself! that I had but Temper to be a little calm! But it is a Condition I have long since abandoned, and (till I see you again) will never re-as<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sume.
<pb n="87" facs="118"/>
In the Rage I am in, I could think in you as many Unkindnesses, as by and by the Fury of Love would find a Task to un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ravel; for if one Half Hour I blame you, in the next I call it Injustice. So careful am I, that no ill Thought of you appear deserving, that were you worse than you are, my Pleasure would consist in being flattered that you are better than I think you: Nay, sometimes I persuade myself that you are a Man of the greatest Justice in the World; and that it is not even in your Nature (wilfully) to do an unequal Thing. But it is most certain, I am doom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed to a fruitless Love, without the least Possibility of a Deliverance. Indeed, for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merly I had a faint Prospect (as I thought) of being in some measure restored; but I looked through false Opticks, that present<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed me with a wrong Object; and since that, I have done the great Work, of lear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ning to be well satisfied with my intolera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble Condition. Did my Love run parallel with what is commonly found in the World, it would not be so desperate.—Happy they, who (in a Pet, or upon some small Disgust) can recede from their Pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions, and set up for new Ones elsewhere; and whatever they pretend, Self-Interest is the greatest Thing. This is the Way of Amouring most in Fashion: This is that
<pb n="88" facs="119"/>
Imposture which prevails upon so many tender Hearts: And in Cases of Denial, very artificially can usurp languishing Eyes, want no expressive Insinuations, counter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>feit Melancholy and Distraction; and all to serve some base Bye-End. If this had been the Quality of my Love, the Ven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>geance you assign me had then been me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rited. I verily believe, if it had had but the least Tincture of Treachery, I should have won your Heart, should have made you jealous: And that Temper would have been very inconsistent with your Resolu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions to make a thorough Conquest: No<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing less than which (to a Man of Prowess like you) could have been a real Pleasure. Yes, yes; it is very plain, if my Passion had been forged, and bore a false Accent, it would certainly much better have agreed with yours, as being much nearer related; but the fatal Consequence (of a true Fer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vency, returned with fair Assurances, and foul Actions) none knows but the wretch<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, solitary I. Upon the whole, I think verily I love you, because you make me miserable. If that be true, go on, be sig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nalized to the World for your Unkindness, that the more I may be so, for my unac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>countable Affection. That I love you, Heaven knows; you know else I should see you here again, cringing out the feigned
<pb n="89" facs="120"/>
Allegations of your Sincerity, though much more distant than we are. O, that we were to begin again! What Course would I then take! I fear, even fool myself, as I have done; for since I know no greater Pleasure than the Love of you, I should too willingly run the Risque of any Disad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantage that could happen by it. I die a thousand Deaths every Hour, and still re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vive, to die them over again: Adieu. What could I not endure for your sake? I have at this Moment so lively an <hi>Idea</hi> of you, that I almost fancy you here in Person. Methinks, how very kind you are! How affectionately you condole me for the Tor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments I have suffered in your Absence; and how thankful I am to you for them! How you press my Hand, and swear you will never part with me! And Ah, <hi>Monsieur!</hi> How I believe you, for being hitherto so faithful!—Once more Adieu. I think I never writ Letters to you in my Life, but their Length made them stayed for. The Post (at my Request) has waited a great while, and I am now sent to; I wonder else, when I should give over. You may judge a little of my Condition, when you see even hurrying-Post-haste itself can ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mit of a Delay to please me. The Actions of all People that see me, are designedly kind, and of a Desire to divert me. One takes
<pb n="90" facs="121"/>
me by the Hand, begging of me to be chearful, and leave my unprofitable Think<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing; shewing me good Reason for it: But, alas! I find <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> two very se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parate Things, not at all influencing each other. To-day a <hi>Sister</hi> brought me Varie<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty of the best Fruits; of which, nothing but a Piece of a <hi>Pomgranate,</hi> could I be per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>suaded to eat. I might thank her, but I am not sure I had so much Manners: Eve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry body excuses my ill Breeding, but much wonder at my Alteration. The Rigour and Severity of our Religion can dispense with many great Faults in me, that it will not allow in others. What shall I do? Well, I have only one Thing more (be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sides a Thousand) to say to you; which is, That if you can have Regard for any <hi>one</hi> Sentence in this long Letter; it may be to <hi>this</hi> last, <hi>I implore you to let me see you in</hi> Por<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tugal <hi>before I die.</hi> Adieu, Adieu.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OUR having no Prospect of ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>taining a Commission for me, can no way alter or cool my Desire at this important Junc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture, to venture my Life in some Manner or other, for my King and my Country.</p>
               <p>I cannot bear living under the Reproach of lying obscure and idle in a Country Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tirement,
<pb n="92" facs="124"/>
when every Man, who has the least Sense of Honour, should be preparing for the Field.</p>
               <p>You may remember, Sir, with what Reluctance I submitted to your Commands upon <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebellion, when no Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>portunity could prevail with you to permit me to leave the Academy; I was too young to be hazarded; but give me Leave to say, it is glorious at any Age to die for one's Country, and the sooner, the nobler the Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>I am now older by three Years; my Uncle <hi>Bathe</hi> was not so old, when he was left among the Slain at the Battle of <hi>Newbury:</hi> Nor you yourself, Sir, when you make your Escape from your Tu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tors, to join your Brother at the Defence of <hi>Scilly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same Cause is now come round about again: The King has been mis-led; let those who have mis-led him be answer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able for it: Nobody can deny, but he is Sacred in his own Person, and it is every honest Man's Duty to defend it.</p>
               <p>You are pleas'd to say, it is yet doubt<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful, if the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are rash enough to make such an Attempt: But be that as it will, I beg Leave to insist upon it, that I may be presented to his Majesty, as one, whose utmost Ambition it is to de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vote
<pb n="93" facs="125"/>
his Life to his Service, and my Coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try's, after the Example of all my An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cestors.</p>
               <p>The Gentry assembled at <hi>York,</hi> to agree upon the Choice of Representatives for the County, have prepared an Address, to as<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure his Majesty, they are ready to sacrifice their Lives and Fortunes for him, upon this, and all other Occasions; but at the same Time, they humbly beseech him to give them such Magistrates, as may be agreeable to the Laws of the Land; for at present, there is no Authority to which they can legally submit.</p>
               <p>They have been beating for Volunteers at <hi>York,</hi> and the Towns adjacent, to sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ply the Regiments at <hi>Hull,</hi> but nobody will list.</p>
               <p>By what I can hear, every body wishes well to the King, but they would be glad, his Ministers were hang'd.</p>
               <p>The Winds continue so contrary, that no Landing can be so soon as was ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prehended; therefore, I may hope, with your Leave and Assistance, to be in Rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diness before any Action can begin.</p>
               <p>I beseech you, Sir, most humbly and most earnestly, to add this one Act of In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dulgence more to so many other Testi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monies, which I have constantly received
<pb n="94" facs="126"/>

                  </dateline>
                  <salute>My Dear Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WHILST you are pursuing Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour in the Field, in the earliest Time of your Life, after the Example of your Ancestors, I am commanded by the Queen, to let you know, she has declared you her Lord-Lieutenant of the County of <hi>Cornwall;</hi> the Earl of <hi>Rochester</hi> to act for you till you are of Age.</p>
               <p>You will do well to write your most humble Thanks to her Majesty, for so gra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciously remembring you, unsollicited, in your Absence: You should likewise do the same to my Lord <hi>Rochester,</hi> for accepting the Trouble.</p>
               <p>This, my dear Lord, is a Preparative to bring you upon the Stage with some Lustre at your first Appearance in the World. You
<pb n="96" facs="128"/>
are placed at the Head of a Body of Gen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try, entirely dispos'd in Affection to you, and your Family: You are born possess'd of all those amiable Qualities, which cannot fail of fixing their Hearts: You have no other Example to follow, but to tread in the Steps of your Ancestors: It is all that is hoped or desired from you.</p>
               <p>You are upon an uncommon Foundation in that Part of the World: Your Ancestors, for at least five hundred Years, never made any Al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liance, Male or Female, out of the <hi>Western</hi> Counties: Thus there is hardly a Gentle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man, either in <hi>Cornwall</hi> or <hi>Devon,</hi> but has some of your Blood, or you some of theirs. I remember, the first Time I accompany'd your Grandfather into the <hi>West,</hi> upon hold<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing his Parliament of <hi>Tinners,</hi> as Warden of the <hi>Stannaries,</hi> when there was the most numerous Appearance of Gentry of both Counties, that had ever been re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>member'd together; I observ'd there was hardly any one but whom he call'd <hi>Cousin;</hi> and I could not but observe, at the same Time, how well they were pleased with it. Let this be a Lesson for you, when it comes to your Turn to appear amongst them. Nothing is more obliging, than to seem to retain the Memory of Kindred and Allian<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces, tho' never so remote: And by Conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quence, nothing more disobliging, than a
<pb n="97" facs="129"/>
Forgetfulness of them; which is always imputed to an affected, disdainful Superio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity and Pride.</p>
               <p>There is another Particular, in my Opi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nion, of no small Consequence to the Sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port of your Interest, which I would re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>commend to your Imitation; and that is, to make <hi>Stowe</hi> your principal Residence. I have heard your Grandfather say, if ever he liv'd to be possess'd of <hi>New-Hall,</hi> he would pull it down, that your Father might have no Temptation to withdraw from the ancient Seat of his Family. From the <hi>Conquest</hi> to the <hi>Restauration,</hi> your An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cestors constantly resided amongst their Countrymen, except when the public Ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vice call'd upon them to sacrifice their Lives for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stowe</hi> in my Grandfather's Time, till the Civil Wars broke out, was a Kind of Academy for all the young Men of Family in the Country: He provided himself with the best Masters of all Kinds for Educa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion; and the Children of his Neighbours and Friends shared the Advantage with his own. Thus he, in a Manner, became the Father of his Country; and not only en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gaged the Affection of the present Genera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, but laid a Foundation of Friendship for Posterity, which is not worn out at this Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="130"/>
Upon this Foundation, my Lord, you in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>herit Friends without the Trouble of make<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing them, and have only to preserve them: an easy Task for you, to whom Nature has been so liberal of every Quality ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessary to attract Affection, and gain the Heart!</p>
               <p>I must tell you, the Generality of our Countrymen have been always <hi>Royalists;</hi> you inherit too much Loyal Blood to like them the worse. There is an old Saying amongst them, That a <hi>Godolphin</hi> was never known to want Wit; a <hi>Trelawney,</hi> Courage; or a <hi>Granville,</hi> Loyalty. Wit and Courage are not to be mistaken; and to give those Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>milies their Due, they still keep up to their Character: But it is the Misfortune of Loyalty, not to be so clearly understood or defined. In a Country, subject to Revolu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions, what passes for Loyalty To-day, may be Treason To-morrow; but I make great Difference between Real and Nomi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nal Treason. In the Quarrel of the Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> both Sides were pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>claimed Traitors, as the other prevailed: Even under <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Usurpation, all who adhered to the King were proclaimed Traitors, and suffered as such; but this makes no Alteration in the Thing itself: It may be enacted Treason to call black, black; or white, white: But black will
<pb n="99" facs="131"/>
be black, and white will be white, in Spite of all the Legislators in the World.</p>
               <p>There can be no Doubt about Allegi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance, unless Princes become Tyrants, and then they cease to be Kings: They will no longer be respected as God's Vicegerents, who violate the Laws they were sworn to protect. The Preacher may tell us of pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sive Obedience; that Tyrants are to be pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tiently suffer'd, as Scourges in the Hands of a righteous God, to chastise a sinful Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion; and to be submitted to, like Plagues, Famines, and such like Judgments from above. Such Doctrine, were it true, could only serve to mislead ill-judging Princes in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to a false Security; Men are not to be rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son'd out of their Senses: Human Nature, and Self-Preservation, will eternally arm against Slavery and Oppression.</p>
               <p>It is therefore not to be supposed, that even the weakest Prince would run that Hazard, unless seduced by Advice, wicked<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly palliated by evil Counsellors. <hi>Nero</hi> himself, under the Influence of a good Mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nistry, was the mildest, the most gracious, and best beloved of the Emperors: The most sanguinary, the most profligate, and the most abhorr'd under a bad one. A Prince may be deceiv'd, or mistaken in the Choice of his Favourites; but he has this
<pb n="100" facs="132"/>
Advantage, he is sure to hear of it from the Voice of the Public: if then he is deaf, he seems to take upon himself the Blame and Odium of those Actions which were chargeable before but upon his Advisers.</p>
               <p>Idle Murmurs, groundless Discontents, and pretended Jealousies and Fears, the Ef<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect of private Prejudice and Resentments, have been, and will ever be, under the wisest Administrations: We are pester'd with them even now, when we have a <hi>Queen,</hi> who is known to have nothing so much at Heart, as the Contentment of her People: These are transitory Vapours, which scatter at the first Appearance of Light: The Infection spreads no farther than a particular Set of four, splenetic <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> in Politics, not worth minding or correcting. Universal Discontent can never happen but from solid Provocations.</p>
               <p>Many well-meaning Persons however, abounding in Zeal, have been often unwa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rily caught by popular Pretences, and not undeceived, till it was too late. Have a Care, my dear Cousin, of splitting upon that Rock: There have been <hi>false Patriots,</hi> as well as <hi>false Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>Fear God, and Honour the King,</hi> were Injunctions so closely tack'd together, that they seem to make but one and the same Command: A Man may as well pretend
<pb n="101" facs="133"/>
to be a good Christian, without fearing God, as a good Subject without honouring the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deo, Patrice, Amicis,</hi> was your Great-Grandfather Sir <hi>Bevil</hi>'s Motto: In three Words he has added to his Example a Rule, which in following you can never err in any Duty of Life. The brightest Carriage, and the gentlest Disposition, is Part of the Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s Character of him; so much of him you may have begun to shew us already; and the best Wish I can make for you, is to resemble him as much in all—but his untimely Fate.</p>

               <p>EVery living Creature, my dear Lord, is entitled to Offices of Humanity: The Distress, even of an Enemy, should reconcile us to him: If he thirsts, give him Drink; if he hungers, give him Food; overcome Evil with Good. It is with this Disposition I would have you enter into the Exercise of that Authority, [<hi>Lord-Lieute<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nant of</hi> Cornwall] with which her Majesty has honoured you over your Countrymen. Let no body inspire you with Party-Preju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dices and Resentments. Let it be your Business to reconcile Differences, and heal Divisions; and to restore, if possible, Har<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mony and good Neighbourhood amongst them: If then there should be any left to wish you ill, make them asham'd and confounded with your Goodness and Mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deration:
<pb n="103" facs="135"/>
Not that I would ever advise you to sacrifice one Hair of the Head of an old Friend to your Family, to gain fifty new ones; but if you can encrease the Number by Curtesy and Moderation, it may be worth the Trial.</p>
               <p>Believe me, my dear Lord, Humanity and Generosity make the best Foundation to build a Character upon: A Man may have Birth, and Riches, and Power, Wit, Learning, Courage; but without Genero<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sity it is impossible to be a great Man: Whatever the Rich and Powerful may think of themselves, whatever Value they may set upon their Abundance and Gran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deur, they will find themselves but the more hated and despis'd for the ill Use they make of it.</p>
               <p>You should look upon yourselves but as Stewards and Trustees for the Distressed: Your Over-abundance is but a Deposit for the Use and Relief of the Unhappy; you are answerable for all Superfluities mispent: It is not to be supposed that Providence would have made such Distinctions among Men, such unequal Distributions, but that they might endear themselves to one ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther by mutual Helps and Obligations. <hi>Gra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>titude</hi> is the surest Cement of Love, Friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship, and Society.</p>
               <p>

There are, indeed, Rules to be observ'd, and Measures to be kept, in the Distribu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of Favours. We know who have both the Power and Inclination to do Good, but for Want of Judgment in the Direction, they pass only for good-natur'd Fools in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stead of generous Benefactors.</p>
               <p>My Lord—will grudge a Guinea to an honest Gentleman in Distress, but rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dily give twenty to a common Strumper. Another shall resuse to lend fifty Pounds to his best Friend without sufficient Security, and the next Moment set his whole Fortune upon a Card or a Die; a Chance, for which he can have no Security. My Lord—is to be seen every Day at a Toy-Shop, squandring away his Money in Trinkets and Baubles; and at the same Time leaves his Brothers and Sisters without common Necessaries.</p>
               <p>Generosity does not consist in a Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tempt of Money, in throwing it away at Random, without Judgment or Distinction; tho' that indeed is better than locking it up, for Multitudes have the Benefit of it; but in a right Disposition to proper Objects, in Proportion to the Merit, the Circumstan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces, the Rank, and Condition of those, who stand in Need of our Service.</p>
               <p>Princes are more exposed than any others to the misplacing their Favours: Merit is
<pb n="105" facs="137"/>
ever modest, and keeps its Distance: The Forward and Importunate stand always nearest in Sight, and are not to be put out of Countenance, nor thrust out of the Way.</p>
               <p>I remember to have heard a Saying of the late King <hi>James, That be never knew a mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dest Man make his Way in a Court. David Floyd,</hi> whom you know, being then in wait<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing at his Majesty's Elbow, reply'd blunt<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly, <hi>Pray, Sir, whose Fault's that?</hi> The King stood corrected, and was silent. If Princes could see with their own Eyes, and hear with their own Ears, what a happy Situation it would be both for themselves and their Subjects? To reward Merit, to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dress the Injured, to relieve the Oppressed, to raise the Modest, to humble the Insolent; what a God-like Prerogative, were a right Use made of it!</p>
               <p>How happy are you, my dear Lord, who are born with such generous Inclinations, with Judgment to direct them, and the Means to indulge them! Of all Men most miserable is he, who has the Inclination, without the Means. To meet with a de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serving Object of Compassion, without hav<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the Power to give Relief, of all the Cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstances in Life is the most disagreeable: To have the Power is the greatest Plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure.</p>

Methinks I see you ready to cry out, <hi>Good Cousin, why this Discourse to me? What Oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>casion have I for these Lectures?</hi> None at all, my dear Lord; I am only making my Court to you, by letting you see, I think as you do.</p>
               <p>But one Word more, and I have done.</p>

               <head>To my Nephew, Mr. BEVIL GRANVILLE, Upon his entring into Holy Orders.</head>
               <p>WHEN I look upon the Date of your last Letter, I must own myself blameable for not having sooner return'd you my Thanks for it.</p>
               <p>I approve very well of your Resolution of dedicating yourself to the Service of God; you could not chuse a better Master, pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vided you have so sufficiently search'd your Heart as to be persuaded you can serve him well: In so doing you may secure to your<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self many Blessings in this World, as well as a sure Expectation in the next. There is one thing which I perceive you have not thoroughly purg'd yourself from, which is Flattery: You have bestow'd so much of that upon me in your Letter, that I hope you have no more left, and that you meant it only to take your Leave of such Flights of Fancy, which, however well meant, oftener put a Man out of Countenance than oblige him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="140"/>
You are now become a Searcher after Truth: I shall hereafter take it more kind<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly to be justly reprov'd by you, than to be undeservedly complimented.</p>
               <p>I would not have you understand me, as if I recommended to you a sour Presbyte<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rian Severity; that is yet more to be avoid<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed. Advice, like Physick, should be so sweeten'd and prepar'd, as to be made pala<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>table, or Nature may be apt to revolt against it. Be always sincere, but at the same Time always polite: Be humble without descending from your Character; reprove and correct without offending good Manners: To be a Cynick is as bad as to be a Sycophant: You are not to lay aside the Gentleman with your Sword, nor to put on the Gown to hide your Birth and good Breeding, but to adorn it. Such has been the Malice of the World, from the Beginning, that Pride, Avarice, and Am<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bition, have been charg'd upon the Priest<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hood in all Ages, in all Countries, and in all Religions. What they are most oblig'd to combat against in their Pulpits, they are most accus'd of encouraging in their Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duct. It behoves you therefore to be more upon your Guard in this, than in any other Profession: Let your Example confirm your Doctrine; and let no Man ever have it in
<pb n="109" facs="141"/>
his Power to reproach you with practising contrary to what you preach.</p>
               <p>You had an Uncle, Dr. <hi>Dennis Granville,</hi> Dean of <hi>Durham,</hi> whose Memory I shall ever revere; make him your Example: Sanctity sate so easy, so unaffected, and so graceful upon him, that in him we beheld the very Beauty of Holiness: He was as chearful, as familiar, and condescending in his Conversation, as he was strict, regular and exemplary in his Piety: As well bred and accomplish'd as a Courtier, as reverend and venerable as an Apostle: He was indeed in every Thing apostolical, for he abandon'd all to follow his Lord and Master.</p>
               <p>May you resemble him; may he revive in you; may his Spirit descend upon you, as <hi>Elijah</hi>'s upon <hi>Elisha;</hi> and may the great God of Heaven, in guiding, directing, and strengthening your pious Resolutions, pour down his best and choicest Blessings upon you.</p>
               <p>You shall ever find me, dear Nephew, your most affectionate Uncle, and sincere Friend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Perusal of this DIA<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>LOGUE, in DEFENCE of the FAIR SEX, written by a GENTLEMAN of my Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quaintance, much surprized me: For it was not easy for me to ima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gine, that one so young, could have treated so nice a Subject with so much Judgment. It is true, I was not ignorant that he was naturally ingenious, and that he had improved himself by Travelling; and from thence I might reasonably have ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pected
<pb n="116" facs="146"/>
that Air of Gallantry, which is so visibly diffused thro' the Body of the Work, and is indeed the Soul that animates all Things of this Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture: But so much Variety of Read<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, both in ancient and modern Authors, such Digestion of that Read<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, so much Justness of Thought, that it leaves no Room for Affecta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, or Pedantry, I may venture to say, are not overcommon amongst practised Writers, and very rarely to be found amongst Beginners. It puts me in Mind of what was said of Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> the Father of our <hi>Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lish</hi> Numbers, upon the Sight of his first Verses, by the Wits of the last Age, that <hi>he came out into the World Forty Thousand strong, before they had heard of him.</hi> Here, in Imita<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of my Friend's Apostrophes, I hope the Reader need not be told, that Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> is only mentioned for Honour's sake, that I am desirous
<pb n="117" facs="147"/>
of laying hold on his Memory, on all Occasions, and thereby acknow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledging to the World, that unless he <hi>had</hi> written, none of us <hi>could</hi> write. I know my Friend will forgive me this Digression; for it is not only a Copy of his Stile, but of his Can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dour. The Reader will observe, that he is ready for all Hints of com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mending Merit, and the Writers of this Age and Country are particular<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly obliged to him, for his pointing out those Passages which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Beaux Endroits,</hi> wherein they have most excelled. And tho' I may seem in this, to have my own Interest in View, because he has more than once mentioned me, so much to my Advantage, yet I hope the Reader will take it only for a <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> because the Piece would have been very perfect without it. I may be suffered to please myself with the Kindness of my Friend,
<pb n="118" facs="148"/>
without valuing myself upon his Partiality: He had not Confidence enough to send it out into the World, without my Opinion of it, that it might pass securely, at least amongst the fair Readers, for whose Service it was principally designed. I am not so presuming, to think my Opi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nion can either be his Touchstone, or his Passport: But I thought I might send him back to <hi>Ariosto;</hi> who has made it the Business of al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most Thirty <hi>Stanzas</hi> in the Begin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ning of the 37th Book of his <hi>Orlan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>do Furioso,</hi> not only to praise that beautiful part of the Creation, but also to make a sharp Satire on their Enemies; to give Mankind their own, and to tell them plainly, that from their Envy it proceeds that the Vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tue and great Actions of Women are purposely concealed, and the Fail<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings of some few amongst them ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed with all the aggravating Cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstances
<pb n="119" facs="149"/>
of Malice. For my own Part, who have always been their Servant, and have never drawn my Pen against them, I had rather see some of them praised extraordinarily, than any of them suffer by Detrac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion: And that in this Age, and at this Time particularly, wherein I find more <hi>Heroines</hi> than <hi>Heroes.</hi> Let me therefore give them Joy of their new Champion: If any will think me more partial to him than really I am, they can only say I have returned his Bribe: And the worst I wish him, is, that he may receive <hi>Justice</hi> from the <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> only from the <hi>Ladies.</hi>

Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> will have it, that the LADY characterized by Mr. <hi>Walsh</hi> under the Name of EUGENIA, was his Mistress. For this he could not have any other ground than his own malevolent Conjecture. But that our Author was a Gentleman very susceptable of the <hi>soft Passion,</hi> appears plainly from his own Pen; sending forth his <hi>Love-Letters</hi> and <hi>Poems</hi> with the following <hi>Address</hi> to the Public:<q>
                     <l>Go, little Book, and to the World impart</l>

                     <l>Those who Love's dear, deluding Pains have known,</l>
                     <l>May, in my fatal Stories, read their own.</l>
                     <l>Those who have liv'd from all its Torments free,</l>
                     <l>May find the Thing they never felt, by Me.</l>
                     <l>Perhaps, advis'd, avoid the gilded Bait,</l>
                     <l>And, warn'd by my Example, shun my Fate.</l>
                     <l>While with calm Joy, safe landed on the Coast,</l>
                     <l>I view the Waves on which I once was tost.</l>
                     <l>Love is a Medley of Endearments, Jars,</l>
                     <l>Suspicions, Quarrels, Reconcilements, Wars;</l>
                     <l>Then Peace again. O! wou'd it not be best,</l>
                     <l>To chace the fatal Poison from our Breast?</l>
                     <l>But since so few can live from Passion free,</l>
                     <l>Happy the Man, and only happy he,</l>
                     <l>Who with such lucky Stars begins his Love,</l>
                     <l>That his cool Judgment does his Choice approve.</l>

As for <hi>three</hi> Amours I have had in my Life-time, (says Mr. <hi>Walsh</hi>

                  </note>) I valued the <hi>one</hi> Mistress after I left loving her; I loved <hi>another</hi> after I left valuing her; I love and value the <hi>third,</hi> after having lost all Hopes of her: So that, methinks, according to the Course of my Passions, I ought to love and value the next, after having obtained her. However, from this time forward, upon what Follies soever you fall, be pleas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, for my sake, to spare those of Love; being very well satisfied, there is not one Folly of that kind (except Marriage) which I have not already committed. I have been, without Railery, in Love with the Beauty of a Woman whom I have never seen; with the Wit of one whom I never heard speak, nor seen any thing that she has written; and with the heroic Virtues of a Woman, without knowing any one Action of her Life, that could make me think she had any.—<hi>Cupid</hi> will have it so; and what can weak Mortals do against so potent a God? Adieu; live pleasantly, that is, <hi>philosophically;</hi> and guard your <hi>Heart</hi> from the <hi>Pains of Love.</hi> Such were the Sentiments of our Author when about Thirty Years of Age.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a dangerous thing, MADAM, it must be confessed, this Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versing with fair Ladies; and it draws us into Inconveniencies, of which we do not at first see the Consequences. I little thought, when I talked with your Ladyship, of the Vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tues of your Sex, that you would have commanded me to have given my Senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments upon that Subject in Writing. I grant you, <hi>Madam,</hi> you might have spo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ken
<pb n="126" facs="155"/>
to several of your Acquaintance, who would have undertaken the Business at first Word, with all the Courage imaginable; but to me, who never durst take Pen in Hand to write any thing beyond a Billet, the Enterprize seems very terrible. I con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fess, when you spoke to me of it first, I was well enough pleased with the Design; for I thought a Defence of the Sex, would be a Means of obliging all of the Sex, who were worth defending; and therefore look'd upon it as the writing a Circular Love-Letter to all the fair Ladies in the King<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom. But as Men generally mix Interest with Honour, so, upon second Thoughts, I considered what I should get by it, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sides Fame, if it should succeed; and I found, if I persuaded all Men to be as pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sionate Servants to the Ladies as myself, I should make but a very indifferent hand of it: Thus, <hi>Madam,</hi> you would engage me in a Controversy, where it would be a Scandal to be vanquished, and a Disadvan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tage to overcome: For I, who could never succeed in an Amour where there was any Fool pretended besides myself, should have great Hopes indeed, when I had persuaded all Mankind to be my Rivals. After all, <hi>Madam,</hi> there were your Commands to encourge me to it; and the Commands of a fair Lady are to me beyond all the Ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guments
<pb n="127" facs="156"/>
in Nature; I therefore resolved upon the Undertaking. But as it is no new thing to see People undertake a Business that they are altogether unable to perform, so I must own, I found a thing of this Nature quite beyond my Strength: You may believe, <hi>Madam,</hi> I was very melan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>choly at it, and it was then that a Friend coming into my Chamber, asked me the Occasion. As I never love to conceal any thing that afflicts me from a Friend, so I presently told him the Business, That a Lady had commanded me to write her a Treatise in Defence of Women. If that be all (says he briskly) I am come to your Deliverance; for this very Morning have I been at a Conversation, where the Que<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stion concerning the Virtues and Vices of that Sex, has been handled as fully as can be desired. Thou appearest to me, my dear Friend, (said I, embracing him) like my better Genius, and therefore, without any farther Ceremony, sit down, and give me an Account of the Conference.</p>
               <p>Taking a Walk (says he) this Morning in St. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Park,</hi> with several of my Acquaintance, there was one among the rest who was all the while, either gazing upon the Ladies as they came by, or speak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing with that Indifference to us, that made
<pb n="128" facs="157"/>
us very plainly see, he did not mind the Subject of our Discourse, tho' we talked of all the most considerable Things that offer themselves in such Conversations. (A very strange Man this, <hi>Madam,</hi> who was think<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing upon some Mistress, I warrant, when they were raising Taxes, and beating the <hi>French.</hi>) Another, who was a Person of excellent Sense, and had a particular Friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship for this, tho' they would often dispute about their several Thoughts of Women, in which Point they could never agree; (I wonder they should dispute about that, <hi>Madam,</hi> for the greatest Disputes in those Cases are, when they do agree) began to rally him upon this Subject; which he did so handsomely, that he pleased the rest of the Company very well, without displeasing his Friend in the least. PHILOGYNES (which was the Name of the first, as MISOGYNES was of the other) (Here, <hi>Madam,</hi> I must confess, I fancied my Friend put false Names upon me; for besides, that I re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>member neither of these Families in <hi>Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land,</hi> the one, you must know, signifies a Woman-hater, and the other, a Woman-lover) cried to MISOGYNES, Tho' I allow you to rally me as much as you please, and am glad of any Occasion I can give you, to exercise a Talent you possess in so eminent a Degree, yet I hope you do not in earnest
<pb n="129" facs="158"/>
think the Conversation of Women so ridi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culous as you would make us believe. Ten times worse, said MISOGYNES, than I can represent it; and since we have often had slight Skirmishes upon that Occasion, and we have now Time enough to fight it out, if you have the Courage to lose one Morn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing's gazing at them, I challenge you to the private Walk by the Canal-side, to de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fend their Cause; and these Gentlemen, if they please, shall be our Judges. Tho' I am very unwilling, answered PHILOGYNES, to lose a Morning that has called out all the best Company of the Town, yet since it is in Defence of the Ladies, and you so boldly challenge me, I take you at your Word, upon Condition, that if I get the better in the Judgment of these Gentlemen, you shall engage to be in Love by To-mor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>row Morning. Upon Condition, that if I overcome, said MISOGYNES, you will en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gage to be out of Love by the same Time, I agree. That is no equal Stake, replied PHILOGYNES, for it is to lay Happiness against Unhappiness; however, I am so well satisfied of my Cause, that I will undertake you, even upon those Odds.</p>
               <p>Upon this Agreement we walked all to the other side of the Park, full of Expecta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of the Event of the Debate; when we were come thither, we found we had
<pb n="130" facs="159"/>
the whole Walk to ourselves, and so MISO<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>GYNES who gave the Challenge, began in this manner:</p>
               <p>The Propagation of Mankind being the only Way to preserve it from Extinction; and the Copulation with Women being the only Means that Nature has ordained to that End; there is no doubt but all Common<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wealths ought to give any reasonable En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>couragements to it; I have therefore al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ways admir'd the Wisdom of those Go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernments that incited, or compelled their Subjects to marry, as a Thing so much more necessary to Mankind in general, than pleasing to any one in particular; but that a Man should, out of a mere Act of Judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, run after Women; that he should find Delight in their Company, is so very extraordinary, that the wise Men of old thought it hardly possible, otherwise they had had no need of making such severe Laws to force them to it, as they did.</p>

But to pick them out only for the Benefit of their Conversation, to fall in Love with their Understandings, and to leave the Company of wise Men for hand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>some Women, is just the same Thing, as if you should chuse rather to eat Jays and Parrots, than Woodcocks and Partridges, because the Feathers of the former make the finer Shew.</p>

It is a very good, as well as a very ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neral Way, to guess at People by the Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pany they keep; and thus we may give a great Judgment of the Female Sex, by a View of those with whom they are the most pleased of our own. Well, let them appear then; what do you find? Fine Coats, large Cravat-strings, and good Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riwigs, I must own, but for any Thing else, they, and their Perriwig Blocks are Critics alike. It is true, to do them Justice, they talk most learnedly of Points and Ribbons; have most mathematical Heads for the erecting of Ladies Top-knots, make as con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>siderable Figures, talk as loud, and laugh more than any in Drawing-rooms and Play<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>houses; and those who know nothing of their Language, would take them, by their Gestures, to be the wittiest Persons in <hi>Christendom;</hi> but if unluckily you under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stand them, you will find it only false Fire, and that all this violent Laughter is pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duced by no Jest. Then take them out of their own Element, begin a Discourse of any Thing that is worth knowing, they are dumb; out of Modesty? No; but they hate to talk of Things that are <hi>grossier;</hi> and the Pedantry of Scholars, and Gravity of Men of Business, is utterly unfit for a Gentleman.</p>

Were it nothing but the Company of such sort of Creatures as these, it would be enough, I should think, to frighten a Man of Sense from them. Can you see these Fops, as much as you are used to them, without laughing? except it rather makes you blush to think you should bring yourself into Competition with such Tools as they are: I am far from blaming them for fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowing the Ladies: They avoid the Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pany of Men who despise them, for that of Women who admire them: Nor do I find fault with the Ladies, for being pleased with them; for since Likeness, they say, breeds Love, what Wonder is it they are fond of those Men whose Follies make them most like themselves? but for a Man who has some Pretences to Wit and Learning; for one who might be acceptable to Men of Sense, to run after them; nay, for a Man who spends all the Morning in the Study of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> to spend the Afternoon among the Impertinencies of Women, puts me in mind of the Moun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tebank Stages in <hi>Naples,</hi> where the Jesuits and Jackpuddings entertain the Spectators by Turns.</p>
               <p>It is possible, you will say, that all this makes for you; that the Faults of your Rivals render your Virtues the more re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>markable, and that there is no doubt, but
<pb n="134" facs="163"/>
a Man of Merit may succeed in any Place where a Man of no Merit may pretend; but, alas! Sir, you deceive yourself very much, if you encourage that Opinion. Had you fit Judges, there is no doubt but you were in the right: But if the fairest Lady in <hi>Christendom</hi> were amongst the <hi>Indians,</hi> where they paint the Devil of her Colour, do you expect they should do her Beauty Justice? Or if a slender Man were among the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> do you think they would admire him for being well shaped, where they thought none but big-belly'd Men to be so? Credit me, Sir, a Man who leaves his Parts to the Judgment of Women, is very near the same Circumstances: Will you not believe me in that Case, because I profess an Enmity to them? You do well: but will you believe themselves? View all the Town, take good Notice: Among all the young Heiresses who run away from their Guardians, is there any one who does it with a Man of Sense? Among all those Widows who ruin themselves by second Marriages, is there any one who does it with a Man of Sense? Among all those Ladies who cuckold their Husbands, is there any one who does it with a Man of Sense? We see them do these Things every Day, with Chaplains, Dancing-masters, Butlers, and Footmen. Who are the Men that shew
<pb n="135" facs="164"/>
the tender Billets received? What are they who boast of the Favours of all the finest Women in Town? Are they not the most despicable of Mankind? Are they not such whose Conversation is the Jest of Men of Sense? And have they above one Thing about them, that distinguishes them from the other Sex?</p>
               <p>After all, Sir, are not the <hi>Women</hi> in the right in this Point? Or do they ever shew more Judgment, than when they pitch upon such Men? What do they look for in a Husband, but one who will admire them, who will be governed by them, and upon whom all their little Tricks will pass? And who but Fools are fit for that? What do they propose in a Gallant, but giving them Pleasure without Scandal? And to the for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mer Part they have a received Notion of the Ability of Fools: Then for the Scan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dal, who so likely to give none as those Men, whom the World will hardly believe were favoured by them, tho' they took their Oaths upon it? For notwithstanding Experience teaches us the contrary, yet People are apt to fancy, a Man of Sense must succeed before a Coxcomb; and will rather believe the former are favoured, tho' they swear they are not; than the latter, tho' they swear they are.</p>

See here a dreadful Army, <hi>Madam,</hi> against us. I asked my Friend what these Gentlemen had said upon this Occa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion?

For <hi>Simonides,</hi> he told me, he had written <hi>Iambics</hi> against them, in which he divides them into <hi>ten</hi> Sorts. The <hi>first</hi> he said was descended from a <hi>Sow,</hi> (you will find very noble Families among them, <hi>Madam</hi>) and she was sluttish: The <hi>second</hi> from a <hi>Fox,</hi> and she understands every thing, and has a great deal of Good in her, and a great deal of Ill too: The <hi>third</hi> from a <hi>Dog,</hi> and she is prying about, and snarl<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing at every Body: The <hi>fourth</hi> is made of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and she understands nothing but how to fill her Belly, and sit by the Fire-side: The <hi>fifth</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> and she is changeable and inconstant; sometimes in a Calm, and then on a sudden in a Storm: The <hi>sixth</hi> is made of <hi>Ashes,</hi> and a <hi>Labour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Ass,</hi> (an odd Composition you will say) and she is scarce driven to her Business with Threatnings or Force, but crams herself Night and Day, and lies with every one that comes; (now whether she takes this Quality of lying with all who come, from the Father's-side, or the Mother's-side, I

cannot absolutely determine.) The <hi>seventh</hi> was descended from a <hi>Pole Cat,</hi> and she is nauseous and stinking: The <hi>eighth</hi> from a <hi>Mare,</hi> and she never cares to do any Work, and minds nothing but appearing neat and fine: The <hi>ninth</hi> from a <hi>Monkey,</hi> and her Ug<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liness is a Jest to every body: The <hi>tenth</hi> from a <hi>Bee,</hi> and she makes an excellent Wife. <note place="bottom" n="1">

He reply'd, He was obliged to Secrecy; she swears it shall never be known to any one by her Means; upon that Promise he informs her, that there was a <hi>Lark</hi> seen flying over the Senate-House with a golden Helmet on his Head, and a Spear in one of his Claws, and that they had thereupon called the Soothsayers together, to know what it portended. No sooner was the Husband gone, but the Wife tells it too, under a Vow of Secrecy to her Maid; she to another who was her Fel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low-Servant, who told it to her Lover; so that, to be short, it ran so fast, that as soon as the Senator came into the Market-Place, one took him aside, and told it him for a great Secret; aways goes he, and tells

his Wife she had undone him, in divulging what he had trusted with her: She denies it, with a true feminine Impudence: How could it come to be known then? says he. Alas (reply'd she) are there not three hundred Senators, and might it not come from any of them as well as you? No, says he, for I invented it on a sudden, to satisfy your Cu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riosity, and thus had I been served, if I had trusted you with the Secret.

               <p>Here MISOGYNES left off, and PHYLO<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>GYNES began to answer him: But I must beg your Pardon, Sir, said my Friend, for my Time is come, and I must necessarily be gone. The Devil you shall, said I; you would engage me in a pretty Affair; I pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mise
<pb n="157" facs="186"/>
a Lady a Defence of her Sex, and you will make me send her a Satire against it. Truly, my dear Friend, said he, I designed to have told you all, but it is later than I thought, and I have Business waits for me. No Business, said I, can be so considerable to you, as the satisfying a fair Lady is to me, therefore sit down, and bring me fairly off what you have told me already, or you and I shall be Friends no longer. After all, <hi>Madam,</hi> to tell you the Truth, tho' there is no great Matter in this Speech of MISO<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>GYNES, yet I can hardly believe he made it upon a sudden; 'tis possible tho', they two having discoursed the Matter as they told us before, might have provided themselves each with Arguments. But supposing that, I can scarce believe one Man would be suf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fered to talk so long without Interruption; at least I am sure, some who we know were none of the Company. But it is possible, that he who told me, might leave out all that was spoke by others, for Brevity sake, being as you see in haste.</p>
               <p>If you are as apt to be mistaken in your Judgment of Things as of Looks, replied PHILOGYNES, it is no wonder you should make such strange Conclusions. Whatever Seriousness you may see in my Face, does not, I'll assure you, proceed from any Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trust of my Cause, but an Astonishment at
<pb n="158" facs="187"/>
what strange Arguments the Invention of Man can suggest against the best Things that are. I say, the Invention of Man, for I am far from believing you in earnest in this Point; I have too just an Opinion of MISOGYNES, to think he does any Thing but put on this Humour for a Trial of Skill; and I no more believe you a Hater of Wo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>men, for the Invective you have made against them, than I believe <hi>Erasmus</hi> a Lover of Folly, for the Encomium he has writ upon it. If you have therefore any thing more to urge, forbear it not upon any sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed Conviction you see in my Counte<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nance; for, notwithstanding that I think you have handled the Subject as fully as any one who has undertaken it, yet I will assure you I cannot submit to your Argu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments; and therefore am very ready to hear any thing you have further to urge. No, says MISOGYNES, I am sensible I have troubled the Company long enough about a Trifle, and it is very fit you should have your Turn of speaking now. Part of the Company was already convinced by his Arguments, the other Part thought he had said as much as the Matter would bear, and therefore both agreed in desiring PHI<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>LOGYNES to speak what he had to say, which he did in this Manner:</p>

I confess, Sir (said he smiling) when I saw the Associates you allotted me at first, I began to despair of my Cause; I own I was ashamed of my Company, and resolved to pack up Baggage instantly, and quit a Trade in which none but Fops and Fools were engaged; but when I saw the <hi>Ana<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>creons,</hi> the <hi>Ovids,</hi> and all the Wits, antient and modern, in the same Circumstances, I even took Heart again. Courage, said I, the Business is not so bad as I thought, and it is possible his Heart may relent, and al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low us some better Company than he con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>demned us to at first. At least, thought I, if it is a Folly to converse with Women, it is some Comfort that he owns it to be a Folly of which the greatest Wits of the World have been guilty before us: And when I saw all <hi>Greece,</hi> and the greater Part of <hi>Asia</hi> venturing their Lives for <hi>One</hi> Wo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man, I thought I had somewhat the Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantage of them, whilst I ventured nothing but my Rhetoric for them <hi>All</hi> together. And when you named <hi>Samson, Achilles, Hannibal,</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> I enquired who those Gentlemen were; for certainly, thought I, if they were such brave Men, and great Soldiers, as I have heard them represented, we have no Reason to despair of the Victory when we have them to lead us on.</p>

If <hi>Simonides</hi> gives you severe Cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racters of several Women, he gives you one at last that makes amends for all; one in whom no Fault can be found; and if you think that is not enough to take him off from your Party, if you are still so very fond of him, we will tell you, that Men who are deformed and ugly, as <note place="bottom" n="‡">Girald, <hi>in vit</hi> Simonidis. Plutatch <hi>in vit</hi> Themistoclis.</note>
                  <hi>Simonides</hi> was, naturally declare themselves Enemies to Women, because they fancy Women are Enemies to them; and upon that Account, not upon the Account of his Wit, we will allow him to you. As for St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> tho' we have all the Respect imaginable for a Father of Church, and upon that Account
<pb n="164" facs="193"/>
shall not enter into the Merits of the Cause betwixt <note place="bottom" n="*">V. Socrat. Schol. Sozomen. Evagr.</note>him and the Empress <hi>Eudoxia;</hi> yet this we shall say, Sir, that as Fathers of the Church are subject to Passions, as well as other Men; so it is no Wonder that a Man, who is used very ill by one Wo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man, and converses with few else, should conclude them all alike. Thus after hav<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing taken two of your Patriots from you, and if not taken, at least disabled the other two from being very credible Witnesses, you are reduced to <hi>Lucian</hi> and <hi>Juvenal.</hi> For the former, if I should quote you what the old Fathers say of him, if I should tell you, that he did not only abuse the Chri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stian Religion, but even his own; that he rallied all the Philosophers, Orators, and Historians of his Time; that not content with that, he falls foul upon those his own Religion taught him to worship as Gods; I fancy you would not think what such a Man says of any great Weight; but truly, Sir, there is no need of that in this Case: What does this <hi>Lucian</hi> do, pray? Why <note place="bottom" n="†">See the Dialogues of the Courtesans.</note>he describes the Bawds griping, covetous, and encouraging their Daughters in Lewd<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness; his Courtesans false, jilting, and true Courtesans throughout. And what of all this, pray? what does this make for you?
<pb n="165" facs="194"/>
It is not the Cause of Bawds, or Courtesans that we undertake; tho' even amongst them he represents a great part easy, loving, good-natur'd Fools, and us'd accordingly by their Lovers. But does <hi>Lucian</hi> pretend that there are no good Women? Does he fall upon the Sex in general? or does not he bring in <note place="bottom" n="*">In the Dialogue of Love.</note>
                  <hi>Charicles</hi> in one place defending them, and does not he make the greatest En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>comium that can be of <hi>Panthaea</hi> in another, and speak with abundance of Esteem of se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veral other Women in the same? And if he does introduce <hi>Callicratides</hi> in one of his Dialogues railing at the Sex, in Opposition to <hi>Charicles,</hi> he does it in the Defence of a Sin, which I am sure you will scarce think it civil to name. What shall we say to <hi>Ju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venal,</hi> but what <hi>Plato</hi> did to <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> bid him sacrifice to the Graces. He is al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ways violent, always declaiming, always in a Passion; and what Wonder if he falls upon the Women in one of his Fits? After all, you will make no great Matter of him; for if he has writ one Satire upon the Wo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>men, he has writ fifteen upon the Men. For the comic Poets and Satirists, whom you mention in general, when you name them in particular, I shall give them par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticular Answers. And now truly, Sir, see yourself reduced to a miserable Equipage;
<pb n="166" facs="195"/>
some old Husbands, and jilted Lovers; some Men with ill Faces, and worse Miens, may possibly stick to you still; but that is all: I am sorry to see a Man so well made, of so much Wit, and who has been so suc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessful amongst the Ladies, rank himself with such a Tribe; but you do it, I sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose, by way of Variety only; and so let <hi>Misogynes</hi> appear, at the Head of his Regi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, that makes a worse Figure than Sir <hi>John Falstaffe</hi>'s; let them be encouraged with stummed Wine and muddy Ale; let them give Fire to their Mundungus, and so let the Battel begin, whilst we with all the Heroes, Wits, and Philosophers, see how we can defend the Cause we have un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dertaken.</p>
               <p>I am sensible, Sir, that I have broken the Order of your Discourse, and I beg your Pardon for it: But I thought it was necessary to distinguish our Enemies from our Friends, before the Armies joined, that so we might know whom to attack, and whom to spare; and having done that, I shall now confine myself to your Method, and follow the Course that you please to lead me.</p>
               <p>Though I perfectly agree with you in the Esteem of the Laws made for the En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>couragement of Marriage, and consequent<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly cannot but regret the Want of them
<pb n="167" facs="196"/>
amongst ourselves; yet I must beg your Pardon, Sir, if I wholly dissent from you, in the Inference you would draw from it: For it is very apparent to me, and to any unbyassed Person else, I suppose, that those Laws were never made, as you fancy, for the forcing Men to the Love of Women, to which all Countries were naturally enough enclined; but for the restraining them to Particulars; that whilst they fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowed the general Pleasures of the Sex, they might not lose the useful Part, which was the Procreation of Children. Had there been so few Virtues amongst them, as you please to imagine, there had been no Need of this; When we have but one Dish of Meat that we like, we fall upon that with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out any Deliberation; but when the Fancy is distracted with Variety of Dainties, we often lose more Time in the making our Choice, than would otherwise be requisite to the satisfying our Appetites.</p>
               <p>It is true, Sir, it is a very good Way to judge of People by the Company they are fond of; but it is not a certain Way to judge of People by the Company that is fond of them. There was a Taylor in Love with Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but it does not necessarily follow that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was in Love with a Taylor. If there are ridiculous Fellows who follow the Ladies,
<pb n="168" facs="197"/>
before we run down the Ladies for it, let us see if they do not laugh at them as well as we our selves. And I cannot think their pursuing them any Reason at all for Men of Sense to avoid them. You would think it very hard, that <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> should quit the Art of War, because some <hi>Thrasoes</hi> and bragging Bullies pretended to it as well as they; and <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> would take it very ill, that you should damn all Sorts of Poetry, because of the <hi>Bavius</hi>'s and <hi>Maevius</hi>'s, who set up for it; and whatever Reason you would give against the being a Minister of State, I dare say, Sir <hi>Politic Woudbee</hi>'s aiming at it would be none. (Here <hi>Philogynes</hi> seems to me not to understand the right Use of that consi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derable Part of Mankind call'd Fools; For it is only the Half-Wit that is intolerable, and a true Fool, is next a true Wit the best Company in the World; for as a no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble Author has extreamly well observed,<q>
                     <l>Wit, like Terce Claret, when't begins to pall,</l>
                     <l>Neglected lies, and's of no Use at all;</l>

After this I need not tell you, Sir, that it is very ill judging of People by their Out-side; and as I laugh at those who like a Man only for his being well dressed, so I fancy you will allow them to be as ridicu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lous, who run him down only for the same Reason.

               <p>(Courage! there are two good Precedents for the Beaux.)</p>
               <p>After all, Sir, I know there are a great many of these gay Coxcombs, of these eter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nal Pretenders to Love; and I have nothing to say in their Behalf; let them even shift for themselves amongst the <hi>Thrasoes,</hi> and <hi>Bavius</hi>'s. But they do not only pretend (you say) they are successful too. It is very possible, Sir; I do not know but there may
<pb n="170" facs="199"/>
be Fools enough of the other Sex, to like the Fools of ours. But it is with the best Sort of Women too (you say) that they succeed. And who tells you so, pray? They themselves. I swear, Sir, though I have a very great Esteem for those Gen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tlemen, yet I must beg their Pardon for my Faith in this Point; I can never think a Woman, whose Wit we all allow, can be fond of a Man whose Folly we all see. On the other side, I know how natu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral it is, for every one to avoid Contempt; and when a Man is despised in one Place, what so reasonable as to make you believe he is esteemed in another. And I hope the Gentlemen themselves will take it for a Compliment, when I tell them I do not believe a Word they say in this Point; since certainly a Man of Honour would rather of the two, tell a Lye to the Prejudice of a Woman who uses him ill, than a Truth to the utter Ruin of one who grants him all the Favours he can ask.</p>
               <p>But let us judge them by their Actions, say you! Do not most of the young Heiresses run away with the pitiful Fel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lows? If they do, Sir, it should rather deserve your Pity than your Anger; or if you must be angry, be angry with the Guardians whose Severity frighten them away, and yet hinders them the Sight of
<pb n="171" facs="200"/>
any Men of Merit to run away with. It is no Wonder that one who has never seen any Town, but where he was born, should think that the finest in the World; and you cannot blame a Woman for being in Love with a Man who does not deserve her, if she never saw any who did. All that we can reasonably expect in that Point is, that she should make some Satisfaction when she sees the World better; and if she shews her Contempt of her Choice then, it is as much (if not more) than can be re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quired. In like manner you cannot say a Widow makes an ill choice, except you prove she was offered a better. If a Man, who is obliged to ride a Journey, does it upon an ill Horse, you will be very well satisfy'd certainly, when he tells you, it is the best he could get. (I confess, Madam, this seems to me but a very indifferent Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cuse for the Widows; for he would make us believe, it is but next Oars with them; and so I told my Friend; but he reply'd, I must consider, it is only those Widows who make an ill Choice, about which he is to speak; and as he cannot say of them, as of the young Maids, that it was for want of seeing the World; so they must be con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tented with this Excuse, or make a better for themselves.) For the Wives, who you say cuckold their Husbands, there may be some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>what
<pb n="172" facs="201"/>
more to be said. Modesty being almost an inseparable Quality of Wit, there is no Wonder that a Man who is possessed of that, should so seldom succeed in these Under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>takings; whilst Fools, by their natural Impudence push on the Thing; and mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ried Women are a sort of Forts that are sooner taken by Storm than Treaty. So that this shews rather the great Confidence of the Man, than the little Judgment of the Woman; who it is forty to one had much rather a Man of Sense was possessed of her, if he would take the same Methods to gain her as the other had done.</p>
               <p>(After all, Madam, I think none of these Excuses extraordinary; therefore if I were worthy to advise the Ladies, they should rather make Use of Men of Wit in all these Capacities, than put their Friends to the Trouble of inventing such pitiful Defences for them.)</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, as I cannot see any Reason why Women should naturally love Fools more than Men of Wit, so I shall very hardly be brought to believe they do. In a Husband I suppose they propose a Man whose Conversation shall be agreeable as well as his Person; and who shall have Wit to entertain them, as well as Wisdom to direct them; and in whom can this be found, but in Men of the best Sense? If in
<pb n="173" facs="202"/>
a Gallant, as you say, they propose Plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure without Scandal, tis very hard the Heat that warms a Man's Brain, should so en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tirely settle there, as to render him inca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pable of pleasing them otherwise; though it is possible, by reason of his having Varie<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty of Thoughts to divert him, he may not give himself so entirely up to those Plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sures, as People less capable of thinking do: And for the Scandal, who so proper to hinder that, as those who have Prudence to manage Things so as not to be found out, and Wit enough to turn it off if they are? Whilst a Fool by his Want of Sense shall quickly make the Thing public, if there be an Intrigue, or by his Vanity brag of one, though there be none. Add to this, that when a Woman seems pleased with a Man of Wit, every body is apt to attribute it to the Pleasure of his Conversa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion; whereas, when she is fond of a Man, in whom we can see nothing to be liked, we naturally suppose she likes him for something that we do not see: And though it is possible it may be only Want of Judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment in the Lady, yet the World is apt to compliment her Understanding in that Case, to the Prejudice of her Reputation. And to conclude, Sir, though I do not believe all those Men successful who say they are not, yet I am very much inclined to believe
<pb n="174" facs="203"/>
all those Men not to be successful, who say they are.</p>
               <p>For your Examples of Women-haters, I have sufficiently I think reply'd to them already; and for your other Arguments, if it be an Affront to call a Man effeminate, I hope you do not think it any great Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pliment to tell a Woman she is masculine; and had that Argument been urged against you, I dare answer for you, you would have said, that that only proved the Perfections of the Sexes different; and as Man was made for the ruder Labours, it was requi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>site he should be strong and coarse; and the Women, being made for the easier Things, ought to be soft, tender, and de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>licate: And as for Mens being governed by their Wives, though the being hector'd by them is not so commendable; yet it <note place="bottom" n="*">

                  <hi>Spartans</hi> (the bravest Men of the World) were com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manded by their Wives, and that all the Care and Management of domestic Affairs was committed to them. So that I can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not imagine how a Thing should be so very scandalous, that was practised by most of the bravest People under the Sun.</p>
               <p>Here are very good Precedents for mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ried Women, which it is to be hoped they will lay up in their Hearts, and practise in their Lives and Conversations.</p>
               <p>I have as great a Veneration for those Poets you mention, as any Man can; and upon that Account I shall not believe all the Ill they say of their Mistresses, because I suppose they would not have me: As I have been a Lover myself, so I know very well that People are apt in those Cases to take Suspicions for Realities, and Surmises for Matter of Fact. Does not <note place="bottom" n="‖">See the Tragedy by Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi>

<pb n="176" facs="205"/>
and would not any one who came in when he was in one of his Rants, conclude, a Man who loved so well, would not be en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>raged against a Mistress at that rate, unless her Falshood was very apparent? And yet when we come to examine the Cause of this Disorder, what is it, but <hi>Morats</hi> giv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing him his Life at her Request, or his leaning upon her Lap when he died. I rather mention this than any of the Poets you spoke of, not only because all the Mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions and Passions of a Lover are described with as much Art and Delicacy, as in any of those Antients, but also, that seeing the whole Business before you, you may judge of every little Cause of his Disorder, as well as he himself, which in Odes and Elegies you cannot do. You see the Lover there in a Fury, but what Cause he has to be so, there is no body to tell you, but he who is in it. Add to this, that a Man often feigns Jealousy of his Mistress, to binder her from being so of him, and will upbraid her Falshood to defend his own. (That is a Thing, now I confess, Madam, which I can hardly believe.) And it is evident, they had not really any such bad Opinion of Women, since with all this they did not cease to run after them. However, if you think these general Answers not sufficient, let us see what we can say to Particulars.
<pb n="177" facs="206"/>
For the Complaints of Cruelty and Scorn. I look upon them as Things of Course; and therefore, shall say nothing to them. If <hi>Anacreon</hi>'s Mistress did ask him nothing but Money, why did he chuse one whose Necessities drove her upon it. And if other Men have made Complaints of the Wo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mens minding Wealth more than Love; I desire to know whether Women have not as much Reason to make the same Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plaints of the Men. And for those who talk of their Mistresses Inconstancy, let us see first whether they were constant to them. For <hi>Ovid,</hi> he does not pretend to put it upon you, but complains in <note place="bottom" n="*">

Thus whatever Qualifications those great Men had, Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stancy, you, see was none; and though we allow you, each of them had Merit enough for any one Woman, yet one Man can hardly have enough for half a Score.</p>
               <p>Now if Ruin and Desolation has come to great Men, and States, from Women, it shewed they had a good Opinion of the Sex in general, that they would suffer for them; and had they not been sensible the greatest Part were good, they could never have been imposed upon by the Bad. Then as for those ill Women whom you have
<pb n="179" facs="208"/>
mentioned, as I suppose you will not un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dertake to defend all the Actions of Ty<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rants and Murderers; so I do not think my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self at all obliged to defend all the Women who have been guilty of some of their Crimes. The Dispute is not whether there have been any ill Women in the World, but whether there are not more Good. And when I have told you that the Book that condemns <hi>Dalilah,</hi> cries up <hi>De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>borah</hi> and <hi>Jael:</hi> That if <hi>Homer</hi> has repre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sented <hi>Helen</hi> guilty of some Faults (for you will see that <hi>Homer</hi> does not represent her Cause so violently bad) he tells us of <hi>Hecuba</hi> and <hi>Andromache,</hi> and a Thousand others who were very good ones; That if <hi>Clytemnestra</hi> was false to <hi>Agamemnon, Penelope</hi> was as famous for her Truth to <hi>Ulysses;</hi> and so put you Example against Example, which I forbear to do, only because it is so very ea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sy; should I, I say, do but this, you could not complain that your Arguments were unanswered. But truly, Sir, we might carry the Thing much farther; we might defend some of those Women you mention<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, and excuse the rest. For <hi>Dalilah</hi> I shall say say nothing, out of Respect to the Scripture, that represents her as an ill Woman; it is possible, were she alive, she might tell you in her own Defence, that what Account you have of her, is from
<pb n="80" facs="209"/>
her professed Enemies: That however taking the Thing as they tell it; if she did commit a Piece of Treachery, it was against an Enemy of her Country; and that it was very hard she should be so much run down for the same Thing they have so much admired in <hi>Jael</hi> and <hi>Judith,</hi> as well as every body else did in <hi>Marcus Bru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tus;</hi> she would perhaps push her Defence further, and tell you, that though she de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liver'd <hi>Samson</hi> to the <hi>Philistines</hi> to be kept Prisoner, yet she neither drove a Nail through his Head, nor cut it off. But for <hi>Helen,</hi> give me Leave to tell you, it is a great Dispute amongst the Historians, whether she was forced away by <hi>Paris,</hi> or went by her own Consent; several are of the former Opinion; and <note place="bottom" n="*">Prologom. ad Apollon.</note>
                  <hi>Hoelztzim</hi> says plainly, he wonders <hi>Homer</hi> will put such a ridiculous Story upon the World, as to make her the Occasion of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War. (<hi>Menelaus,</hi> it must be confessed, Madam, if the Story be true, was a very easy good<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>natur'd Husband, who would be at so much Pains and Charge to fetch back a Wife who run away with another Man. I do not remember in my own Memory, to have known above five or six Examples like it). And <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Phaed.</hi> speaks as if
<pb n="181" facs="210"/>
the belying her were the Cause of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Blindness, as well as of <hi>Stesichorus</hi>'s; but that the latter understood the Way of ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piating his Fault better, and made his Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cantation to this Effect, That there was not a Word of Truth in the Story of her going to <hi>Troy.</hi> If <hi>Clytemnestra</hi> was consenting to her Husband's Death, yet it was <hi>Egist<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hus,</hi> a Man, who gave the Blow: And if <hi>Thais</hi> did advise the burning <hi>Persepolis,</hi> yet it was no less a Person than <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great who put it in Execution. And as for <hi>Deianira</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whatever Fata<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lity arrived to their Lovers from them, may certainly be very well excused upon the Innocence of their Intentions, and their Pu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nishment of themselves afterwards, the one hanging, the other poisoning herself. If the <hi>Capuan</hi> Women destroyed <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Army, they destroyed a Body of Enemies that all the Men in <hi>Italy</hi> could not. In like manner, for your other Instances we might tell you, that <hi>Procopius,</hi> who tells those terrible Stories of <hi>Theodora, Anecdota,</hi> is so very passionate all along, and mixes such ridiculous Fables with what he tells, that there is no great Credit to be given to him. (This <hi>Procopius</hi> was a Soldier un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der <hi>Justinian,</hi> and has writ, amongst other Things, a secret History of those Times: In this he represents the Empress <hi>Theodora</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="211"/>
more like a Devil than a Woman; he makes her and the Emperor converse frequently with Spirits, and makes her put them to an Employment, that savours more of the Flesh than the Spirit.) Though granting she was as lewd as he represents her, what Wonder is it, that one who had been a stro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ling Play-wench, and common Strumpet before the Emperor married her, should not turn Saint after? If the <note place="bottom" n="*">See <hi>Bentivoglio, Strada, Garnier</hi>

And as for your two Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s, <hi>Caussin,</hi> in his <hi>Holy Court</hi> you know, makes a Saint of the One, and <hi>Parsons,</hi> of the Other, with whom I leave you to fight it out, not thinking our Dispute very much concerned in it.</p>
               <p>Then, Sir, if there are Impertinents, if there are ridiculous Persons of the other Sex, I hope you do not think they are all <hi>Platos,</hi> nor all <hi>Aristotles</hi> of our own; And I will undertake, for every Woman who plagues you with her Business, for every woud-bee Politician, and for every Pedant amongst them, to bring you double the Number of the Men.

Company; And if I should carry you to a City Coffee-House, and there shew you a Parcel of People talking of Things that they understand nothing at all of; and settling the Governments of Countries, which they never saw as much as in a Map: From thence to a Play-House, and shew you the pert and insipid Railery of the Sparks upon the Vizard-Masks: From thence to a <hi>New-Market</hi> Course, and enter you at a Table, where you should hear nothing talked of but Dogs and Horses: From thence to a Tavern, and shew you a Set of Men in their drunken Frolics: I fancy you would wish yourself in your Drawing-Room again, as a more agreeable Folly than any of those I have mentioned. And I appeal to you, whether <hi>Lucian</hi> in his <hi>Ti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon, Boileau</hi> in his eighth Satire, and my Lord <hi>Rochester</hi> in his upon the like Sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject, say not as much against Mankind, and make them as ridiculous as you can do the Women. And I will assure you, Sir, I am far from being of the Duke of <hi>Bri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tanny's</hi> Mind, that Learning is unfit for a Woman; and shall, without any Offence, either to him or you, continue of the same Opinion, till you have answer'd <hi>Anna Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ria Schurman</hi>'s Arguments in their Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>half, and till you have taken away her<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self, who is one of the best Arguments.</p>

(This <hi>Anna Maria Schurman</hi> was a <hi>Dutch</hi> Lady of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> of whom you will hear more anon.

The other I shall mention, is <hi>Christina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> a Princess whose Accomplishments are so generally known, that it is enough to have named her; a Lady of that true Judgment, that she knew how to esteem Wit and Learning at the same Time that she de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spised Crowns; and seemed to be born as a sufficient Recompence to the Common<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wealth of Letters, for all the Mischiefs her Predecessors the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> had done it before; I am satisfied it is impossible for me to add any Thing to a Glory so esta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blished as that of this Princess is; yet as I never passed any Time either with greater Benefit, or greater Satisfaction, than what I passed in her Conversation, so I am very well pleased, methinks, with any thing that gives me Occasion to call it to my Remem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brance. There might be as advantageous Characters, perhaps, given of some Ladies of our own Country now living, did not their Modesty, that inseparable Quality of Wit and Women, deter me from it.</p>
               <p>We might tell you farther, Sir, that this Modesty too often hinders them from make<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing their Virtues known: That they are not of those eternal Scriblers who are con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinually plagueing the World with their Works; and that it is not the Vanity of
<pb n="191" facs="220"/>
getting a Name, which several of the greatest Men of the World have owned to be the Cause of their writing, that is the Cause of the Womens. Had not <hi>Sapho</hi> been so much in Love, it is possible we had never heard any Mention of one of the greatest Wits that ever was born; had not <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Quintilian</hi> given us Accounts of <hi>Cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nelia,</hi> and the Daughters of <hi>Laelius,</hi> and <hi>Hortensius,</hi> they had never done it them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves; had not <hi>Jane Gray</hi> been put to Death, her Virtues had never been so much taken notice of; had not the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Nun been deserted by her Gallant, we had missed some of the most passionate Letters that these latter Ages have pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duced; and had not <hi>Anna Maria Schur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man</hi>'s Works been published by a Friend, without her Consent, we had lost the Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nefit of them. We may tell you too, that it is not only in respect of their own Sex that they are admired, but even of ours. That of those two Odes we have yet of <hi>Sapho,</hi> we owe one to <hi>Dionysius Halicar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nassaeus,</hi> the other to <hi>Longin,</hi> the two best Critics of <hi>Greece,</hi> who chose them out for Examples to their Rules, before any of the Mens: That the Epistle of <hi>Sapho</hi> to <hi>Phaon,</hi> which is esteemed the most delicate of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s, is supposed to be taken out of her Writings: That <hi>Corinna</hi> was five Times
<pb n="192" facs="221"/>
victorious over <hi>Pindar,</hi> the best Lyric Poet of our Sex. And were we here in <hi>England</hi> as forward in printing Letters, as they are in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> we might furnish Vo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lumes of them written by our own Ladies, that would make all the Women-haters blush, or make all Men else blush for them.</p>
               <p>(Here, <hi>Madam,</hi> I must own to you I grew jealous, for I could not imagine that PHILOGYNES would have said this, without having seen some of your Ladyship's Let<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters.)</p>
               <p>We may tell you too, that granting the equal Capacities of both Sexes, it is a greater Wonder to find one Learned Woman, than a hundred Learned Men, considering the Difference of their Educations. If you should go into <hi>Greece,</hi> and, seeing the Ig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>norance is among them at present, tell them their Countrymen were incapable of learn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, would you not be very well satisfied, when they told you of the <hi>Platos</hi> and <hi>Ari<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stotles</hi> of Antiquity? And that if they had not as famous Men now, it was because they have not the same Advantages they had then? And pray why may not the Women be allowed the same Excuse? Will you by your Laws and Customs en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deavour to keep them ignorant, and then blame them for being so? And forbid all
<pb n="193" facs="222"/>
Men of Sense keeping them Company, as you do, and yet be angry with them for keeping Company with Fools? Consider what Time and Charge is spent to make Men fit for somewhat; Eight or Nine Years at School; Six or Seven Years at the Uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versity; Four or Five Years in Travel; and after all this, are they not almost all Fops, Clowns, Dunces, or Pedants? I know not what you think of the Women; but if they are Fools, they are Fools, I am sure, with less Pains, and less Expence than we are.</p>
               <p>Upon second Thoughts I hope, Sir, you will allow, that Women may have Wit and Learning; for their Courage and Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duct we may possibly say more anon. But for Heaven's sake, do not aggravate their Faults always at that Rate; for whatever <hi>Sapho</hi>'s Life and Conversation were, there is nothing in her Writings, but what re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>presents the most tender, and delicate Pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion in the World: And as for <hi>Aloisia Sigaea,</hi> (I give you Thanks for putting me in mind of <note place="bottom" n="*">

                  <hi>Aloisia Sigaea,</hi>) who was as remarkable for her Wit and Learning as any of the other, I am very well assured you do not believe that infamous Book which goes un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der her Name, to have been written by her; <note place="bottom" n="†">Vid.

After all, we must own if there are lewd Women, they endeavour to conceal their Lewdness, they do not brag of it, nor fly openly in the Face of Religion; and if they once come to be publicly discovered, they are rendered infamous to all the World, and their nearest Friends and Relations avoid their Company: Whilst there are several Men who boast of their Iniquities, value themselves upon their being thought lewd, and what is worse, find others to value them upon it too; nay, by their Incitements and Encouragements to Wickedness, often bring themselves to that Pass, that the least

But we need not go so far for Instances; our own Country, and our own Time, will furnish us with enow. In all the Plots we have had continually on foot, tho' we have had Women engaged and accused; tho' there was one pilloried in the first, three executed in another, and sixteen or seven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>teen excepted in a General Pardon; though there have been several seized upon like Accounts since, yet, you see, there has not been one of them who ever made a Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>covery.

Give me leave, Sir, to commend them for their Virtues at the same Time that I am far from defending their Faults; and though I have a very good Opinion of those Men who discover a Conspiracy upon Remorse of Conscience, yet I must take leave to believe that there are some, at least, who do it upon another Account; and without any Sorrow at all for their Design, except that it did not succeed, think to save their own Lives, by the Sacrifice of other Peoples; and make Amends for their Treason against the Government, by their Treachery to their Friends.</p>
               <p>But no Wonder you are so severe upon the Faults of modern Women, when you fall upon those whom all Antiquity has reverenced. It is hard that <hi>Jael</hi> and <hi>Ju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dith,</hi> whose Actions have been so long ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mired, should be called to Account for them so many thousand Years after.

After all, I give you even in that greater Power than I should care to take myself; I would rather by other Peoples Faults correct my own, and should think the noblest Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venge a Man could take upon a Woman who injured him, would be the doing some Action that would make all the World ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mire him; I would have every body up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>braid her with my Wrongs, whilst I myself was silent: It is true, if by the Injuries she

did me, there were any Aspersions cast upon my Reputation; there Justice to myself would oblige me to make the Story public: But I would certainly endeavour to reclaim her by Mildness, before I made Use even of that Severity; and as I should scorn any Favour that was the Effect of Fear, so if I once broke into an open War, all the Sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mission she could make should never bring me to an Amity again, though perhaps my own Good-nature might in Time prevail upon me for a Forgiveness.</p>

               <p>But it is generally agreed that all Virtues are requisite for those who govern well; and since there are some Countries where Women are excluded from the Throne, and no Country where they are not post<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poned, it would be convenient, methinks, to see what they do, when by Accident they are placed upon it.

                  </note>At a Time when the <hi>Britons</hi> groaned under the Servitude of the <hi>Romans;</hi> when the King, by thinking to oblige the Em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>peror, gave him an Opportunity of pillag<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing his Country; and that their Patience under their Sufferings, was only a Means of making them more; When their Houses were robbed, their Wives and Daughters ravished, and their Sons taken away from them; then <hi>Boadicea</hi> arose, and by her Courage, as well as Eloquence, inspired
<pb n="211" facs="240"/>
her dispirited Countrymen with a Resolu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of throwing off that Yoke which was grown intolerable to be born. It is true, indeed, the End was not answerable to the Successes of the Beginning; nor to the Glory so heroic an Undertaking deserved; however as it was neither Want of Courage nor Conduct in her, so we ought to render her that Veneration which is due to so resolute an Enterprize.</p>
               <p>But as one of the greatest Attempts the <hi>Britons</hi> made for their Liberty was whilst they were led by a Woman, so we must own the greatest Glory our Nation could ever boast, was under the Government of one of the same Sex. It was in the Time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> that this Island arrived at that Pitch of Greatness, to which it had been ascending for several Ages, and from which it has been declining, till very lately, ever since: It is the Name of this Princess that is dearer to all <hi>Englishmen,</hi> than the Names of all the Monarchs since the Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quest besides, and the only one whose Birth<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>day has been celebrated after her Death, by the voluntary Gratitude of the People.</p>
               <p>But however we may forget Things that are past, let us not oversee that which lies before our Eyes; and since the Occasion is so very fair, I know not how we can omit the shewing our Sense of those Virtues, of
<pb n="212" facs="241"/>
which the whole Nation has demonstrated so grateful an Acknowledgment by the Body of their Representatives; and never were they more truly their Representatives before. Yes, Sir, without going to foreign Countries, without searching the Histories of our own, we have even in our own Time, and our own Country, a Princess who has governed to their general Satis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>faction, a People the most curious to pry into the Faults of their Governors, of any People under the Sun. A Princess, who though she never shewed any Fondness of Vain-glory, or Authority, yet when the Necessity of the Kingdom called her to the Helm, managed Affairs with that Dexte<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity, which is very rarely found in those who are the most ambitious of Command. Every Thing during that little Time of her Government, was ordered with that Cou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rage, Conduct, and Prudence, that her greatest Friends cannot find Eloquence enough to commend, nor her greatest Enemies the least Pretences to condemn. Though she had a Husband venturing his Life in another Country, with a Bravery equal to what has made us suspect the Sto<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ries of Antiquity; tho' our Fleet, the Bul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>warks of the Nation, was managed in a Manner the Courage of the <hi>English</hi> Seamen was utterly unacquainted with; tho' a
<pb n="213" facs="242"/>
Monarch, who thinks himself able to con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tend with all <hi>Europe</hi> together, seemed to make his utmost Efforts against a Princess, who had nothing but the universal Hearts of her Subjects to defend her; tho' all Christendom was in Suspence to see the Event of the Undertaking, and every little Prince had forgot his own Danger to con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>template hers; even at this Time did we see her look with all the Unconcern ima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ginable, and whilst every Body else was alarmed for her Safety, she only seemed to have known nothing of the Danger. Not that this Unconcern proceeded from any Ignorance of her Condition, or unreason<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able Contempt of her Adversary; no, she provided against their Attempts with all the Prudence could be wished for, at the same Time that she looked upon the Danger with all the Courage in Nature.</p>
               <p>But however great these Virtues may appear, when they are set off by the Lustre of a public Command, yet they are in Effect much greater, when they teach Peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple to despise all such dazling Trifles. Here it is, Sir, that we have a fresh Field for Eloquence, when we see a Lady dissatisfied at that Glory which she had to every Bodies Satisfaction beside, and grudge herself that Authority, which she owed to the Absence of a Husband whom she loved so much
<pb n="214" facs="243"/>
better than that. What think you, Sir, of that Alacrity, of that Joy with which she resigned up the Government? Does it not put you in mind of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rals, who quitted their Plough to command an Army, and when the Victory was gain'd, returned with greater Content to their Plough again? This is that Wisdom which we should admire; this is that Virtue which we should adore; and we ought to despise all those little Pretenders to Business, who thrust themselves into the Management of Affairs against every Bodies Will but their own; and having neither Virtue nor Pru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dence enough to retire from it at the uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versal Murmurs of the People, are gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rally made Sacrifices at last to the just Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sentment of an enraged Nation.</p>
               <p>These are those blazing Comets, whose fatal Glories portend Destruction to a Go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernment, whilst the Virtues of the others, like those of the Sun, give it Life and Heat, by their benign Influence. Much more, Sir, might be said in <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Sex,</hi> which I shall purposely omit, because I am satisfied I can never conclude with a more illustrious Example.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>AESCULAPIUS.</speaker>

               <p>All that I can say, Sir, is, that the Gen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tleman is a very worthy <hi>Gentleman;</hi> and his Lady a very fine <hi>Lady.</hi> He has often,
<pb n="222" facs="251"/>
indeed, bragg'd to me of the Happiness of a marry'd Life. I thought the best Way to find out this Happiness, was in going to his Lady, who has fully convinced me of all her Husband said. But as I have a perfect Friendship for the Gentleman, I must confess, Sir, I am as well satisfied with his having a fine <hi>Wife,</hi> as if I had <hi>one</hi> myself.</p>

               <speaker>HUSBAND.</speaker>
               <p>I confess, Sir, I have nothing to say in Contradiction to these Gentlemen. All that the one says, and the other would in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sinuate, may be true for aught I know; nor do I think it much worth my While to enquire after it. Half the Town, the first says, laugh at me for being a <hi>Cuckold;</hi> and he would have me make it public, that the other Half might laugh at me too. But pray let us consider how much wiser he acts: He marry'd a <hi>Wife,</hi> who by the way is not extreamly taking; and yet you cannot imagine what Care, what Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trivances, what cunning Stratagems, this wise Person made Use of to search out a Thing, which, after all, he did not care to
<pb n="223" facs="252"/>
find. And though with all his Bustle he could find out nothing that really made against her, yet he has cast her off with Infamy and Shame, chiefly indeed to him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self, for using a Wo man ill who never gave him Occasion for it. If there be so many who laugh at me for a tame Husband, let him hearken after his own Concerns, and he will find a much greater Number who rail at him for a base and ill-natur'd one.</p>
               <p>Now for this brisk <hi>Monsieur</hi> here, for this <hi>finished</hi> Gentleman, who can with so much Delicacy rally the poor <hi>Fools</hi> that <hi>marry!</hi> So very ingenious a Person, no doubt, acts much more wisely himself. Lord, how is his Estate divided? One Part upon Taylors; another upon Milli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ners; a third upon Perfumers; a fourth upon Perriwig-makers. All his Time spent between the Toilet, the Play-house, the Park, and Drawing-Room. And upon what noble Design, pray, is all this Time and all this Money wasted? Even, Gen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tlemen, that this most charming Person of his, may attain that with all this Cost which I received Twenty Thousand Pound for doing. Would his Niceness be con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tented with the Meat that had been tum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bled, and cold upon my Trencher? Tru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly, Sir, his Happiness is little more than
<pb n="224" facs="253"/>
this, I that am the <hi>Fool,</hi> come to her when I will, stay with her as long as I will, and command her as I will; while this wise Gentleman is waiting a frosty Night under her Window, breaking his Brains for Songs and Billets for her; bribing her Women, losing his Rest, and venturing the being abused, kicked down Stairs, and having his Throat cut whenever he happens to be found out.</p>

               <p>I think there is no great Need of con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vincing <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> how little that Man deserves the Title of Wise, since he him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self has been pleased to prove it sufficiently already. I will not say any Thing to the Man himself, or enquire what Pretences he has to the Title of a Poet; but taking it for granted that he is as good as he fan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cies himself, yet can any Thing be so ri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diculous as the very Design he proposes. He does not pretend that Poetry makes People happy in this World, because we very plainly see the contrary; but he pleases himself with a vain Reversion of imaginary Honours that he is never to enjoy till he himself is insensible of them. It will be a very great Satisfaction, doubtless, to a Man when he is in the Grave, to think his Verses run as smoothly as ever; and one must be an Infidel to doubt but that the Author of a fine Poem will be extreamly considered in the other World.</p>
               <p>I do not say this out of any Malice to the Profession of a Poet, nor would I pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tend to take a Title from them, though they do not deserve it, but in order to shew you those who do.

               <p>Though I am of a Profession that do not trouble themselves with the Trifles of the World, yet I cannot, I confess, be pleased to see People take a Title to themselves, to which they have not the least Pretence. I might observe here, that considering how Kings are for the most part advised, and Commonwealths governed, a Man has no great Reason to boast of his having a Hand in either. But I shall wave all that as to
<pb n="233" facs="262"/>
my Particular, and speak to the Employ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment of a <hi>Statesman</hi> in general. Is there then any Thing so ridiculous as for a Man to pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose the making himself Great, as the End of all his Actions? The only End a Wise Man proposes, is the making himself happy; how ridiculous then must he appear, who makes himself miserable, in order to make himself Great? Who seeks the Contempt of the Wise, that he may get the Admiration of Fools? Who leads a false dissembling Life; fawning upon those who treat him insolently, and treating those insolently who fawn upon him? Who values himself upon the bearing other Peoples Burdens, for which the only Thanks he gets, is Envy, or Contempt: Envy if he succeed, and Contempt if he fail? Should a Man, who came late to an Inn, instead of taking the Rest that was requisite to refresh him for the next Day's Journey, enter into Cabals, form Designs, and manage Intrigues to get the best Room in the House, which would make him very uneasy if he fail'd of it; and from which, tho' he succeeded, he must necessarily depart the next Morning; would not this Man appear ridiculously foolish, and contemptible to all the World? And when we see a Man in a World from which he must necessarily depart in a very short Space of Time, instead of preparing
<pb n="234" facs="263"/>
himself for what is to follow, waste all that little Time in senseless Cabals, in vain De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>signs, and in ridiculous Intrigues, to make himself Great and Powerful; which, if he do not attain it, makes him uneasy; and which, if he do, he must leave immediate<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly again: Is not this Man ten Times more ridiculous, and more foolish than the other? The Man who by his Folly loses his Rest one Night, will without doubt grow wiser, and take a double Share of Rest the next: But, alas! in the other Case, it is quite different; there is no second Opportunity of correcting the first; and he who has spent <hi>one</hi> Life foolishly, will never be trust<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed with <hi>another</hi> to employ better.</p>

               <p>You judge right, divine <hi>Aesculapius!</hi> it is among us, and only us, that you must expect to find a real Wise Man. And our Leaders have taught us, upon a due Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sideration
<pb n="235" facs="264"/>
of the World, to pronounce all Men Mad beside. 'Tis true, their Extra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vagance does not appear, perhaps, to the Vulgar; but as in a Mad-house, one of the Patients does not perceive <hi>that</hi> Madness in his Companion, which is presently found out by a sober Stander-by: So in this <hi>uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versal</hi> Madness which possesses the World in general, tho' they do not discover it in one another, yet it is at first Sight apparent to the Eyes of the Sage. Do you ask me then, who is this Wise Man that I have mentioned? It is he who places not his Felicity in his Beauty, his Wealth, or his Learning; who desires no Pleasure, who fears no Pain: Whom the Frowns of For<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tune cannot deject, nor her Smiles exalt: Who is happy in Prisons, in Banishments, in Torments: Who, if he were broiling in <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s BULL, would cry out, <hi>How plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sant is this!</hi> It matters not how many Ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rows Fortune aims at him, since he is im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>penetrable to them all. As there are some Stones so hard, that the Iron cannot touch; as Diamonds can neither be cut nor broken, but resist the strongest Force; as Rocks in the Sea break the Fury of the Waves, and, beaten upon so many Ages, retain no Marks of its Rage; so is the Soul of a Wise Man, solid and firm; and has collected so much Strength, that it remains as safe from all
<pb n="236" facs="265"/>
Injuries, as any of the Things I mentioned. But what will you say; is there no one then who will attempt the injuring a Wise Man? Yes, they will attempt it, but they cannot perform it: He is elevated so much above the Vulgar, that none of their ill Designs can arrive at him. When that foolish King darkened the Day with his Arrows, there was not one of them which reached the Sun; when the Chains were cast into the Sea, they could not bind the Waves; and those who destroy the Tem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ples, do no Injury to the Divinity: In like Manner, whatever is done proudly, mali<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciously, or insolently, against a Wise Man, (who is in nothing different from a God, but in Point of Time) is but attempted in vain.</p>

               <p>O sage! O wonderful! O incomparable <hi>Stoic!</hi> This, this is a Wise Man indeed! Is it possible that People can continue Slaves to their <hi>Follies,</hi> when Wisdom proposes such sublime, such noble Rewards to her <hi>Fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowers?</hi> But descend a little from this high Region, in which you are placed; con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>form yourself to the Weaknesses of others; and convince their Stupidity by living Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>amples of this high Pitch of Wisdom you have so nobly described to them. But what
<pb n="237" facs="266"/>
is the Matter with that Man to laugh so? You, there, who <hi>stand by yourself</hi> on the <hi>left</hi> Side, while all the rest are gotten upon the <hi>right.</hi>

                  <hi>Mercury,</hi> thou art a swift Messenger, haste away to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> inform him of what we have done, and know his further Plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure in the Matter: You may tell him, that upon a full Survey of Mankind it appears, that every one has such a <hi>sufficient Share of Folly,</hi> that he has no Reason at all to com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plain of his Neighbours having more. That in Answer to those who think their Folly obstructs their Happiness, it is very plain, that the Happiness of Mankind is so com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plicated with this Folly, that it is impossi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble to cure them of the one, without endan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gering the other too. Should we convince the <hi>Fool</hi> who squanders away his Money, that he might live to want it; should we convince the <hi>Fool</hi> who heaps up Treasure, that in a little Time he must die, and have
<pb n="240" facs="269"/>
all his Treasure taken from him; should we convince the <hi>Husband,</hi> who places his Happiness in his Wife and Children, that the one cuckolds him, and the other are none of his; should we convince the <hi>Man</hi> who does Things to be eternally famous, that after Death he will have no Sense of Fame, or of whatever is said of him; we should make them all miserable and wretch<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed. On the other Side, by taking away their Folly, we shou'd take away one of the most useful Qualities in the World, since it is very evident, that Mankind live upon the Follies of one another. Were there not <hi>Fools</hi> who sell Estates, what would become of the <hi>Fools</hi> who buy them? Were there not <hi>Fools</hi> who marry, human Kind would come to an End. Were there not <hi>Fools</hi> of Business, how would the <hi>Fools</hi> that meddle with no Business be managed? Were there not fighting <hi>Fools,</hi> who would protect the <hi>Fools,</hi> that would not fight, from Oppression? And were there not <hi>Writing Fools,</hi> what would the <hi>Reading Fools</hi> do for a Diversion? So that upon the whole Mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter I think we had even as good leave the World as we find it. However, if he thinks there ought to be somewhat done in this Matter, after having made so much Noise about it; the most general Folly in Men being that of shewing Severity to other
<pb n="241" facs="270"/>
Peoples Faults, while they neglect those they commit themselves; He may order a solemn <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be made, <hi>That no Man shall have the Privilege of censuring the Follies of other People, till he can bring a Certificate, under the Hands of three judi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cious Neighbours, that he has none at all of his own.</hi>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THOUGH I receiv'd your generous Present two Days after the Date, yet the Affairs of my Parents, and the Commands of a noble Lady,<note place="bottom" n="*">Lady <hi>Delawar.</hi>
                  </note> have harrass'd me so much, that I could not get Time to return my Thanks sooner. I doubt you'll quickly be convinc'd you have formed a very unjust Idea of me; for I protest, on a Self-Examination, I can't find one of those good Qualities you lay to my Charge. However, 'tis highly obliging in you, to fancy me ingenious and agreeable, 'till you know the contrary; as such, I accept the Compliment, and acknowledge your un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>common Candor. The Question now is, Whether I ought not to stop here, and pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serve your favourable Opinion by my Silence, rather than hazard it by a farther Discovery of my Ignorance? The first is certainly most prudent, but the latter, being more just, I think it a Point of Honour to undeceive you, and dispel the false Charms of an imaginary Prospect. Your <hi>American</hi> Simile
<pb n="9" facs="279"/>
would have been proper enough for me, but I can by no Means allow you to make Use on't, neither can I admit of a Barter so exceedingly disadvantageous to my Cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>respondent. No, Sir, I'll preserve your finish'd Poems as a Standard of good Verse, but I shall not pretend to traffic with you, because I never wrote any Thing that pleas'd myself; and surely if an Author can't satisfy her own Judgment, 'tis in vain to expect she should please others.</p>
               <p>I hope you'll be contented with this Answer, because 'tis Truth; and I hope also, that if I should not send so quick a Return to your Letters, as you may expect, or as they deserve, you will not presently accuse me of Disrespect; for, what with the continued Weakness of my Grand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mother, and the necessary Concerns of Life, I have so little Time at my own Disposal, that I dare not promise a constant Corre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spondence, lest I should engage for more than I can perform. I conjure you, by your most beloved Muse, never more to call any Thing of mine <hi>excellent,</hi> since, in my Opinion, <hi>unmerited Praise</hi> is no better than <hi>civil Lampoon.</hi> I should pity your hard Fate in living among such <hi>unsociable Ani<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mals,</hi> did I not believe that a <hi>wise Man</hi> scorns to be beholden to <hi>Fortune</hi> for a pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>carious Happiness; and that you are this
<pb n="10" facs="280"/>
Philosopher, I no more doubt, than that you imitate the <hi>Elder</hi> SCIPIO, and improve your <hi>Lucky Idleness.</hi> However, since you seem too Modest to own the Happiness you find in <hi>Solitude,</hi> and again think fit to de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scend to Complaint, I will also confess, that I join in your just Resentments, (for I have had the same Account of the ill-natur'd <hi>Wintonians</hi> by another Hand) and am now sensible, that what I took for a <hi>Satire,</hi> was no more than a <hi>Character</hi> well <hi>drawn.</hi> But is it possible the Inhabitants should be all of a Piece? Is there no shining Exception, no generous Mind who has Fortitude enough to resist the malig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nant Particles of its native Air? Yes, yes, you will confess, I know you will, that Mrs. <hi>Martland</hi> has Learning, Virtue, Wit, and good Humour, sufficient to atone for the Vices, Folly, and Ill-nature of a much larger City than <hi>Winchester.</hi> How then can you complain of <hi>Solitude?</hi> or how can you call that Place dull, where our <hi>English</hi> SAPHO resides? SAPHO was the Name Mr. CROMWELL chose for her, and not unde<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>servedly, her excellent Verses requiring a nobler Epithet, if the Records of Time had afforded it. I know not whether you have the good Fortune to be acquainted with this incomparable Lady; if you are, and find a convenient Opportunity, I would

intreat you to give her my best Respects, and to assure her that I have been many Years very ambitious of subscribing myself her unfeign'd Admirer. I have also ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther Request, which is this, that you would send me the Title of that Book wherein is DURFY's Lampoon on Mr. DRYDEN's Marriage, or do me the Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vour to transcribe it from your own Me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mory.

               </opener>
               <p>INstead of convincing me that I have form'd a very unjust Idea of you, your last Letter has but the more confirm'd my Opinion of your Worth and Goodness: and tho' an Unwillingness of owning the shining Qualifications of your Mind, and the distinguishing Character of true Merit, has conjur'd me never to use the Word <hi>excellent</hi> for any thing of <hi>yours,</hi> yet I must and will say, that I never saw any of your Writings, but what deserv'd that <hi>Title;</hi> neither can I admit of your excusive Arguments for solid Reasons, why you should deny me the Advantage and Satisfaction of a <hi>Poetical Merchandise,</hi> but only take them to be a modest Refusal of my Offer, upon the Account of my Insufficiency to become your Correspondent in so precious a Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>modity as <hi>Verse.</hi> Tho' I have been some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>what slow in answering your Letter, yet do not accuse me of Disrespect or Negli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gence, since it is not design'd as a premedi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tated Silence, for indeed I have been seiz'd with so severe a Fit of Melancholy, that for the Space of ten Days I have not had
<pb n="13" facs="283"/>
the Heart to apply my Mind to any thing but the unsociable Companions of an uneasy Being, Sorrow and Discontent; and how long it would have continu'd upon me, had not the prevailing Thoughts of Fair CORINNA rous'd me from that Lethargy of Temper, I cannot well determine. Stu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pidity and Insipidness are the Epidemical Distempers of our Town; therefore it is no Wonder that my Spirits, naturally prone to Dullness, should so soon catch the reigning Contagion. LUCIUS FLORUS, in his <hi>History of the Second</hi> PUNIC WAR, gives us an Account, how HANNIBAL in his Nonage was sworn ROME's <hi>eternal Foe:</hi> In like manner, do I verily believe, that the <hi>Wintonians,</hi> in their Infancy, fretfully resolv'd to be everlasting Enemies to Mirth and Sense; for at the least Appearance of either, they start like wild Beasts at Fire-Arms, and raise all their Posse of Malice and Ill-nature to suppress whatever bears the Face of Wit or Diversion. Tho' I am a Stranger, Madam, to Mrs. <hi>Martland</hi>'s Perfections, yet since you are pleased to bestow so high an Elogy on her Learn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, Virtue, Wit, and Good-humour, I believe her to be an extraordinary Lady, and on your Commendation, am very de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sirous of her Acquaintance, but how to introduce myself to her is the Point; for
<pb n="14" facs="284"/>
you must know, that our <hi>Ladies</hi> here, like <hi>Snails,</hi> keep every one in their own <hi>Shell,</hi> and are wond'rous shy of Men Visitants. How far a Person of such fine Notions, and such an exalted Mind as the <hi>Elder</hi> SCIPIO was, might improve the Minutes of a solitary Retirement, I am not able to judge; but sure I am, that one of my slender Understanding, destitute of Books, and ingenious Conversation, can reap no other Advantage from a Country Life, than what DOMITIAN <hi>did from killing of Flies,</hi> passing away time in an idle Employment: Whatever Pleasures that renowned <hi>Hero</hi> found in Solitude, were certainly owing to his Choice; but my Retirement is only the Result of invincible Necessity, which gives a Tincture of Bitterness and Disgust to all the Pleasures of a rural Life.

               <head>THE Mosaic Creation.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>WHEN first the starting Hours, with fleeting Pace,</l>
                  <l>O'er Time's eternal Plain began their Race:</l>
                  <l>The wise Creator with his Hands did rear,</l>
                  <l>The Fabric of this beauteous Theatre:</l>
                  <l>The wond'rous Frame of Heav'n and Earth arose</l>
                  <l>At his Command, and did their Forms disclose:</l>
                  <l>Th' expanded Earth was one continu'd Void,</l>
                  <l>'Till his creating Pow'r its Strength employ'd:</l>
                  <l>No Form the hudled Mass of nothing bore,</l>
                  <l>But gloomy Marks of wild Confusion wore,</l>
                  <l>Clouds of substantial Darkness to be felt,</l>
                  <l>On the brown Face of unshap'd Nature dwelt,</l>
                  <l>Th' Almighty's Spirit on the Waters play'd,</l>
                  <l>And all his heav'nly Energy betray'd.</l>
                  <l>Th' Eternal spake: Let smiling Light convey</l>
                  <l>Around th'Abyss an unaccustom'd Day.</l>
                  <l>

Strait from the Region of tremendous Night,</l>
                  <l>Dawn'd forth, in ruddy Streaks, primaeval Light,</l>
                  <l>Its orient Beams e'en charm'd th' Almighty's Sight.</l>
                  <l>Then by his Pow'r a Separation made,</l>
                  <l>Between the lovely Light and beamless Shade;</l>
                  <l>The streaming Light, was call'd refulgent Day,</l>
                  <l>The Darkness Night, and sunk in Horror lay.</l>
                  <l>And when the Ev'ning and the Morn came round,</l>
                  <l>Thus far th' Almighty's <hi>First</hi> Day's Work was crown'd.</l>
                  <l>Again the God-head spoke: Let strait appear,</l>
                  <l>A Firmament amidst the Waters clear,</l>
                  <l>To part the Streams with an officious Care.</l>
                  <l>Soon a new model'd Firmament was seen</l>
                  <l>Divide the Waters, with its lucid Screen,</l>
                  <l>So in distinguish'd Channels calmly move,</l>
                  <l>Waters beneath the Sky, and those above:</l>
                  <l>Then by his Mouth the sacred Name of Heaven,</l>
                  <l>Was to the new-created <hi>Aether</hi> given.</l>
                  <l>And when the Ev'ning and the Morn came round,</l>
                  <l>The Labour of God's <hi>Second</hi> Day was crown'd.</l>
                  <l>Then from his Throne, thus said the Pow'r supreme,</l>
                  <l>Let all these Waters make one flowing Stream,</l>
                  <l>Which roll beneath the vast Aetherial Mold,</l>
                  <l>And let one Place their liquid Troops infold;</l>
                  <l>That the dry Land may shew its recent Head,</l>
                  <l>And with extended Force its Beauties spread.</l>
                  <l>No sooner spoke, but the dry Land appear'd,</l>
                  <l>And from the Deep, its barren Forehead rear'd;</l>
                  <l>

The Name of Earth, th'unmeasur'd Land possess'd,</l>
                  <l>As that of Sea, the congregated Waves express'd;</l>
                  <l>The spacious Forms his Pow'rful Hands had made,</l>
                  <l>With secret Pleasure did his Mind invade:</l>
                  <l>Once more th'Eternal spoke: Let teeming Earth,</l>
                  <l>Disclose a sudden and prolific Birth;</l>
                  <l>Let grassy Burdens load the naked Plain,</l>
                  <l>And useful Herbs in verdant Triumph reign;</l>
                  <l>Let Fruit-Trees bearing Fruit, in Vigour grow,</l>
                  <l>Which on the Years their Product may bestow;</l>
                  <l>And let the pregnant Seeds of ev'ry Kind,</l>
                  <l>To every Herb, and every Tree assign'd:</l>
                  <l>With springing Grass, the Fields were cover'd o'er,</l>
                  <l>And Herbs, which in themselves, their Seedings bore;</l>
                  <l>In stately Rows the spreading Fruit-Trees stood,</l>
                  <l>Bearing their proper Seed, and God pronounc'd it good:</l>
                  <l>So when arriv'd the Ev'ning and the Morn,</l>
                  <l>Thus far his Work the <hi>Third</hi> Day did adorn.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Jehovah</hi> said; let glorious Lights display</l>
                  <l>Their beamy Splendor round the heav'nly Way,</l>
                  <l>Which may distinguish Night from chearful Day;</l>
                  <l>Whilst in its Orb each shining Spark appears,</l>
                  <l>For Signs, for Seasons, and revolving Years.</l>
                  <l>When strait with Lights the Crystal Plain was spread,</l>
                  <l>That on the Earth their dazzling Lustre shed:</l>
                  <l>Two Lights immensely great, he form'd in haste,</l>
                  <l>Which in the Skies were to Advantage plac'd.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="19" facs="289"/>
The greater Orb to rule the burning Day,</l>
                  <l>The less amidst the Shades of Night to stray,</l>
                  <l>And from the darken'd Space its Beams convey.</l>
                  <l>To these the Stars, with twinkling Lustre bright,</l>
                  <l>He added, to adorn the Face of Night:</l>
                  <l>High in the Azure Roof they took their Place,</l>
                  <l>With their fair Rays, this under World to grace;</l>
                  <l>So when the Godhead saw how all Things stood,</l>
                  <l>His awful Voice declar'd the Labour good:</l>
                  <l>And when the Ev'ning and the Morning clos'd,</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Day's Work in Order was compos'd.</l>
                  <l>Again th'Almighty spoke; Let now the watry Field,</l>
                  <l>Unnumber'd Shoals of moving Creatures yield,</l>
                  <l>With a vast Product of the feather'd Kind,</l>
                  <l>To fan, with various Wings, the buxom Wind.</l>
                  <l>Huge Whales he form'd, the Monsters of the Deep,</l>
                  <l>And Creatures which on Earth's low Surface creep,</l>
                  <l>With springing Fowls that wing the airy Steep:</l>
                  <l>Each in themselves their proper Kind contain'd,</l>
                  <l>That all was good his sacred Tongue explain'd:</l>
                  <l>Increase, and Multiply, the Maker said,</l>
                  <l>And o'er the Earth be fruitfully convey'd;</l>
                  <l>Full to the Brim the foaming Ocean lade,</l>
                  <l>And let the num'rous Fowl the Land invade:</l>
                  <l>So when the Ev'ning and the Morn roll'd on,</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Fifth</hi> Day's Labour was compleatly done.</l>
                  <l>

                  <l>

Of Cattle, creeping Forms, and Beasts of Prey,</l>
                  <l>And let their Seed be stor'd in the cemented Clay,</l>
                  <l>Lest moldring Time should wear the Kind away.</l>
                  <l>The furious Herds the shady Forest trace,</l>

                  <l>Th' Eternal look'd, and saw 'twas wond'rous good,</l>
                  <l>'Cause all Things in a just Decorum stood:</l>
                  <l>Thus from his Seat th'Almighty did declare,</l>

                  <l>Confess him Lord, and own his pow'rful Reign:</l>
                  <l>In his own Image God created Man,</l>
                  <l>As Male and Female join'd, his Hours began.</l>
                  <l>The Father Hand pour'd wond'rous Blessings round,</l>

               <head>Lady CHUDLEIGH, TO Mrs. THOMAS. 1720.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>YOUR various Styles of <hi>Cross</hi> and <hi>Kind,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Recals a <hi>Custom</hi> to my Mind,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>How Farmers,</hi> politickly, vein</l>
                  <l>Their <hi>Bacon-Hogs</hi> with Fat and Lean:</l>
                  <l>They feast them one Day, next they fast,</l>
                  <l>And make 'em excellent at last.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>How generously <hi>condescending</hi> and <hi>good<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>humour'd</hi> were you, when you wrote that Letter of the 10th, and how <hi>peevish</hi> and <hi>splenatic</hi> in that of the 12th: But I ought to be the last who should arraign you, since I know, by un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>happy Experience, it is not always to be avoided, nor will I ever complain of the
<pb n="23" facs="293"/>
Style when you take the Pains to write, and are not absolutely angry. What Pity it is, that the brightest Genius should not inhabit the strongest Constitution; and that our Intellects must sympathize with those crazy Machines our Bodies, which, like Barome<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters, are affected with every Change of Air; but 'tis always so, the richest Jewels are set in the most malleable Metals, and Brass and Iron serve for Implements of com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon Use. It is very rare that one shall meet with a fine Genius, in a <hi>Herculean</hi> Fi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gure; and I am often induced to compare such Persons to great Houses, where the Garrets are generally the worst furnish'd.</p>
               <p>I must confess, however, they have an Advantage which the others wants, they are pleas'd better cheap, and as they have less Delicacy, they find no Difficulties to their Satisfaction. For it is certainly a Misfor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tune to have a Taste too refined for the Age one lives in, and to spin such Cobweb No<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions of Excellence, as 'tis probable one may never find but in one's own Treasury of Ideas.</p>
               <p>I have often endeavour'd to correct in myself this Research, after what <hi>Reason</hi> would persuade me was a <hi>Non-Entity;</hi> but I could never make my Relish descend to the Common, the Modish Entertainment of Life; I have at last sound the <hi>Phoenix</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="294"/>
I despair'd of, and met with a Person whose Sentiments and Delicacy most exactly tally with mine, and entirely happy should I be in such a Friendship, had He, <hi>Madam,</hi> but a little more Steadiness; but alas! when I consider his Passion for Novelties, <note place="bottom" n="*">Sir <hi>George Chudleigh</hi> was very much addicted to Women.</note> I must own I suffer all the Torments of a final Separation.</p>

            <head>THE SPEECH Of the Reverend FRANCIS ATTERBURY, D.D.</head>
            <head type="sub">On the Day of his Admission to the Deanry of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> OXON. 1711<note place="bottom" n="*">Translated from the <hi>Latin</hi> Original. See VOL. II.</note>.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST Excellent Youth, this your Reception of me, in the Entrance of your Court, with your oblig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Oration, is truly acceptable. I rejoyce not so much that I am, as that this House is adorned thereby; which has always been esteemed the Nur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sery of ingenuous Education; and I am with Pleasure induced to believe, that your Cotemporaries are in all Things like your<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self: In which Expectation, if I am not deceived, you may with Confidence assure yourselves of such Incouragment and Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards as I have Power to bestow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="305"/>
Your Congratulation, select Batchelour, and that of your Society, is the more plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sing to me, for that it proceeds from those who are grown up to a Maturity of Judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, enlarged and perfected by the Pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cepts and Instructions of Philosophy, and other various Kinds of Learning. I wish I was altogether the Man, which I under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stand from you, they take me to be. He I truly am, who with the utmost Satisfaction behold a Learned Body of young Men hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pily pressing after whatever is praise-worthy, and who cannot therefore but greatly en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>courage the growing Commendation of your House. I know I shall hear much concern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing your Love of the profound Sciences, the commendable Course of your Studies, and the Progress of your Learning, from that worthy Man the Sub-Dean of this House; whose Vigilance and Industry if I can any ways assist, he will find in me, when Occasion offers, an active Sharer of his Care and Counsel.</p>
            <p>Most Eloquent Reader of Rhetoric, you indeed shew yourself well fitted to that your Province, which you have sustained for many Years with Reputation; when hav<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing so slender a Subject to work upon, you dignify and enlarge it, with a plentiful Flow of Words, and all the forceful Charms of Eloquence. Both I myself am but too
<pb n="36" facs="306"/>
conscious, and you, notwithstanding the great Things you say of me, cannot be insensible how little I deserve these Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mendations; yet with what Ingenuity and Modesty do you treat me, when not judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing it convenient to admonish me publick<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly, you have Recourse to those Rules of your Art which say, That an Exhortation is then most effectual, when you extol him whom you mean to excite. If any there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore, led away by this Kind of Speech, should imagine that the Virtues recited are mine, great is his Mistake; it was designed to a different Intent, that whilst you thus discharged your own Duty, you might re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mind me of mine; and your whole Endea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vour was, that the Auditors of this Pane<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gyrick might understand not who I am, but what he ought to be that has the Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour to preside in this flourishing College; who being placed over so numerous a Body of those already Learned, and others yet a Learning, should be ever mindful to defend the Cause of Religion, cultivate good Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ners, and promote sound Literature; truly a very difficult Undertaking! however, you shew me the Way to make it easier, for even at this Instant, we cannot but remem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber those worthy Men my Predecessors in this Trust; from which Remembrance you readily hit upon all those Perfections re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quired
<pb n="37" facs="307"/>
to compose a Picture, highly finished, of the Greatest Man, and the most Skilful Governor.</p>
            <p>However, when I think of filling this Post, now fallen to my Lot, and consider my own Abilities, there arises a Dread and Diffidence sufficient to confound and over<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>whelm me; nor am I ever so dispirited or out of love with myself, as when <hi>Fell</hi> and <hi>Aldrich,</hi> those two great Luminaries of your Commonwealth of Letters, present themselves to my Remembrance; for who has not Reason to dread treading in the Paths they trod, who (being endowed with the choicest Gifts of Nature, furnished with a great Variety of Arts, exercised in a long Tract of Academical Employments) brought this House, which ever had its Share of Glory, ever illustrious for its Praise of Learning, to the utmost Pitch of Splendor and Perfection.</p>
            <p>Both of them were eagerly studious of Knowledge, and earnestly disposed to culti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vate the liberal Sciences: Both of them were possessed with extraordinary Candour, so as to cherish every Appearance of Virtue that presented itself, ever interpreting fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vourably and to the milder Sense, whatever bore the Face of Doubt: Both of them were noble and generous, not carried away with the Thirst of Riches or of Honours:
<pb n="38" facs="308"/>
They were careless of their private Affairs, but vigilant for the Public Good: No Man ever loved his Family more ardently, or cherished it with more Affection, than both of them did this House: No Man's Country was ever dearer to him, than this University to them: By their own Labour, by their own Cost, to increase the Art of Printing, to repair, to rebuild these Walls; as it was always a Care to them, so was it a Pleasure: With these Thoughts, with these Desires were they employ'd when liv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, nor was there any Intermission to the Hour of their Deaths. You are not un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>acquainted with the Things I speak of, which so lately were, and still are in your Sight and Hearing; but be they rivetted ever so strongly in your Minds, the Repeti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of them will always be a Pleasure, and the Remembrance of them delightful, who excelled in every Qualification that could be in Man. The Image of that most humane Man can never be forgot by me or you, by whose Demise this House, as tho' it were deprived of a Parent, now lies in Mourning and in Sorrow: God grant that now, by my coming among you, it may in some measure be refreshed and comforted. To him nothing was wanting which indulgent Nature could bestow, either to the propa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gating or Embellishment of Learning; no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing
<pb n="39" facs="309"/>
which could excite either the Love or Admiration of those over whom he presid<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed: What Perspicuity, what Strength of Thought, what a ready Utterance was he endowed with, applying himself to different Kinds of Learning, with Ease and Quick<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness! Never at a Loss, nor a Stranger to any Sort of Literature that was laid before him: Whatsoever he undertook in any Art, was performed to Exactness; so that one might say, he was alone born for that Part which he then sustained, and that all his Time and Labour had been imployed there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>in: Whether he followed more serious Studies, or delighted himself with those of less Consequence; whether he treated of divine or moral Subjects, you could not per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceive which he was more capable to per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>form, this or that: But then, in his Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dress and Conversation, in his Recess and Business, how genteel was his Behaviour, how plain and open was his Mind! What Integrity in his Life, what Truth in his Words, what Modesty in his Countenance, what Gracefulness in his Front! Adorned with these Gifts of Nature, that which often seems morose and severe in abstrase Learning, he was wont to allay, with a wonderful Pleasantness; so that he could mould and form the Minds of young Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ginners, not barely by his Precepts and In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>structions,
<pb n="40" facs="310"/>
but by his Aspect and engaging Manner, to the Love of Learning and all the Praises of Humanity. In this Man were many Things admirable, many Things excellent, but nothing more so, than that he held the Memory of blessed <hi>Fell</hi> in singular Regard and Veneration, looking upon him, and declaring him to be the unerring Guide and Pattern of all his public Actions, the best Master for the Instruction and Govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment of Youth, a Restorer of that Disci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pline which was interrupted amongst us in the Times of Distraction; and, in a Word, the Guardian Establisher of this spacious Building: And, truly, ever since a Way was opened for the Return of true Religion and sound Learning to this Place, from whence it was driven. Whatsoever this House hath contributed to the Help of Science, or the Increase of Piety; whatsoever Benefit hath accrued from it to the Church or State, all flows from the Labour, Care, and Coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sels of that most holy Prelate: By him was laid the Foundation of our Praises; by him were sown the Seeds of Virtue, Industry and Learning, which even now flourish, and which from him, both living and dead, hath so often ripened into a plenteous and joyful Harvest.</p>
            <p>As often, therefore, as I consider this Body still flourishing by the Instructions of
<pb n="41" facs="311"/>
               <hi>Fell,</hi> methinks I see that well planted Field, which <hi>Cyrus</hi> formerly shewed <hi>Lysander,</hi> where, if I may say so, one might admire the Height, Ranks, and regular Disposi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of Trees, the Ground cultivated, smooth and clean, with the sweet and flagrant Odor wafted from the Flowers, but above all, the Diligence and Industry of him by whom they were thus planted and de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>signed.</p>
            <p>Happy that Husbandman of ours, who can truly say with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> All these have I thus disposed, mine is the Order, the De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sign is mine; many of these Trees have I also planted with my own Hands, for the Benefit of this, and, perhaps, of the coming Generation. To me therefore, in the Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>charge of this Office (shall I say it was a Happiness or a Misfortune, immediately to succeed such eminent Men) what now re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mains, but that I, who am diffident of my own Abilities, should rouse myself up by the Contemplation of those Virtues with which they excelled, and that those best of Masters whom I profitted by, when living, I should copy after when dead, and look on them as Examples to be followed in all Things according to my Ability.</p>
            <p>They truly, by their excellent Endow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments obtained this, that they were singu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larly serviceable to you, which I too well
<pb n="42" facs="312"/>
know I can never attain to. There is one Thing, however, which I boast to share in common with them. It is a certain un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>speakable Degree of Love and good Will, which I bear towards this House, by which I have at Heart, you and all your Interests. In this I trust never to be out-done by any of those my Ancestors, with some of whom, in nothing else am I worthy to be com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pared.</p>

               <l>YOU who would build yourselves eternal Fame,</l>

               <l>Chuse out some eminently virtuous Name,</l>

               <l>If so, you justly share the Villain's Fate,</l>

                     <p>AS you intend to publish the Life of that eminent Antiquary Mr. <hi>Tho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mas Hearne,</hi> it is to be wished that it might be compleat and just; not in that Manner as it was set out about four Years ago, by a <hi>Chaplain</hi> of <hi>All-Souls</hi> College, which was intended rather as a <hi>Sneer</hi> upon Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi>
                        <note place="bottom" n="*">The Gentlemen herein hinted at, is the Reverend Mr. <hi>Bilson,</hi> who published Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi>'s Vindication of taking the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance;</hi> the Preface to which is so far from <hi>Sneer,</hi> that it contains many judicious <hi>Remarks,</hi> and is a full Detection of our Antiquary's <hi>gross</hi> Errors.</note> than to give us an impartial Account of his Life and Writings.</p>
                     <p>Among the Manuscripts he has left, is A DIARY of his LIFE, inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spersed

               <head>THE LIFE OF Mr. <hi>Thomas Hearne.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT He, may never be forgotten, who has raked the Repositaries of Antiqui<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty, and been indefatigable in fetching Learning from Places where many would not have sought after it; a few Memorials of his Life, and some Observations on his Writings, will, we hope, redound to his Credit.</p>
               <p>In the Parish-Register of <hi>Abbots,</hi> or <hi>White-Waltham,</hi> a Village about six Miles
<pb n="2" facs="323"/>
distant from <hi>Windsor,</hi> it stands upon Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cord that he was baptized by the Name of <hi>Thomas,</hi> Son of <hi>George Hearne</hi> and <hi>Edith</hi> his Wife on the Eleventh of <hi>June,</hi> 1678. His Father, we have been in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formed, was a considerable Antiquary of the lower Class; and was Sacristan of that Parochial Church to the Day of his Death. So that Mr. <hi>Hearne,</hi> in all pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bability, received his great Propensity to the Study of Antiquity as it were <hi>ex Traduce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is agreed on all Hands that his early Inclination to Letters first discovered it<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self among the <hi>Tumuli</hi> of his own Parish Church-yard; over which he was observed to be continually plodding lmost as soon as he was Master of the English Alphabet. To this soon after adding a little Wri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ting, he grew impatient after Antiquity: resolved never to be unprepared for col<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lecting Materials that might be service<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able hereafter, and accordingly stuffed his Diary (which was his constant Compa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nion) with every Occurrence worthy his Notice. This he prudently foresaw would turn to a good Account in his more ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vanced Years; Vacancies in his future Labours might be supplied with a Story from his Journal; and tho' it might not
<pb n="3" facs="324"/>
be very methodical, or perhaps not at all to his Purpose in Hand, yet the Design of preserving it might sufficiently justify its Publication.</p>
               <p>This was the advantageous Method he pursued all his Life Time: He co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pied <hi>Monuments</hi> and <hi>Inscriptions; Original Letters</hi> and <hi>venerable Ballads of Antiquity;</hi> Stories of honest <hi>John Ross</hi> and <hi>Peter Langtoft; Robert</hi> of <hi>Brune</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas Cantilupe:</hi> Men! who had not Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> lived, might have lain for ever buried in an ignoble Obscurity. The Preservation of these Things may be ascribed to his <hi>Col<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lectanea</hi> which are now swelled to a pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>digious Size.</p>
               <p>It is difficult indeed to determine to what particular Number these MSS Vo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lumes are now grown, because they are kept with as strict and sacred a Care from the Eyes of Mankind as the <note place="bottom" n="*">See Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi>'s Account of these choice <hi>Leaves</hi> in the 485 page of Vol. 2. of his <hi>Connection:</hi> where we find that none but the Keepers of them were ever suffered to pe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ruse them, and They only upon particular Exigencies.</note> Oracles of the <hi>Sibylls</hi> deposited in the Capitol. The highest Number we have yet seen quoted by himself is cxxiii, in his Preface to the

                  <note place="bottom" n="*">P. 29.</note> Annals of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Trokelowe.</hi> So that notwithstanding there can be no certain Calculation made of an exact Number, yet there is some room for a Conjecture that they are not fewer than five Hun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dred.</p>

This however we only took Notice of to shew what an <hi>inestima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble</hi> Loss the World must sustain, should this <hi>prodigious</hi> Treasure perish with its <hi>Collector.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Digression we hope the Reader will pardon; and so, without dwelling on the first eight or ten Years of his Life, we shall follow him to the School, where we
<pb n="5" facs="326"/>
are told he laid the Foundation of his fu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture Greatness.</p>
               <p>It was happy for him as well as the <hi>World</hi> that he fell into the Hands of a good <note place="bottom" n="*">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Gibson, <hi>Author of the excellent</hi> Grammatical Exceptions against the late Alterations made in the common Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cidence and Grammar.</note>Master at <hi>Bray</hi> School: it being a ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lancholly Thing to consider how many great Genii have either been cramped or utterly spoiled thro' the Ignorance or In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dolence of trifling Pedagogues. Here he soon mastered the Rudiments of Learning, and by a gradual but speedy Progress be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>came acquainted with the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek Historians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus encouraged by the Pregnancy of his <hi>Parts,</hi> his assiduous Industry and Profici<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ency in School Learning, his liberal Friend <note place="bottom" n="†">Mr. <hi>Cherry</hi> of <hi>Shettesbroke, Berks.</hi> This Gentleman paid for Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi>'s Education, which he has gratefully acknowledged.</note>thought them sufficient Motives to the Continuance of his Bounty, and sent him accordingly in the Year MDCXCV (with a considerable Addition) to the University of <hi>Oxford.</hi> Fortune here again (if we are rightly informed) seemed particularly fond

                  </note> of the Parish where his Benefactor lived was at that Time a considerable Tutor in <hi>Edmund Hall,</hi> and in the Study of Antiquity most eminently remarkable. Thro' this Gen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tleman's Means he was admitted into this Place, and used more like a Son than barely a Pupil by him.</p>
               <p>A few Years being spent in Academical Learning, by the Help of which he had improved his Propensity to Antiquity; He gave the World a Specimen of his fu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture Designs. In the Year MDCCII (but se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven Years from his Matriculation) he pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lished a copious Index of the principal Passages in Sir <hi>Roger L'Estrange</hi>'s Tran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>slation of <hi>Josephus;</hi> which seems to have met with so good a Reception, that the same was reprinted not long after in an Octavo Edition. In MDCCIII he obliged the World with (or at least occasioned the Publication of) the <hi>Reliquiae Bodleianae,</hi> or some genuine Remains of Sir <hi>Thomas Bod<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ley,</hi> adding the same Year, to his other La<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bours. <hi>Pliny</hi>'s <hi>Epistles</hi> and <hi>Panegyric,</hi> with various Lections and Annotations; not to mention his Edition of <hi>Eutropius,</hi> with
<pb n="7" facs="328"/>
many other Things published all in this Year. In MDCCIV and V came out that laborious Work called <hi>Doctor Historious,</hi> in two Volumes, 8<hi>vo,</hi> being a short Sy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stem of Universal History, and an Intro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duction to the Study of it.</p>
               <p>It would be almost endless to expatiate particularly on his Labours, or to give an Account of the Product of every Year; for which Reason we must refer the Reader to his own printed Catalogue of them, inserted at the End of every Book, he published, since they became numerous.</p>
               <p>During this Period however it is obser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vable that his <hi>Vindication</hi> of Those who take the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> was writ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ten, which loudly speaks in the Behalf of Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi>'s Industry, and shews the early Application he had made to Books. The many just Quotations in it from sa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cred History as well as Profane, from Acts of Parliament and Lawyers of the greatest Name, we flatter ourselves will ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cuse our writing a Panegyrick, and its Author's Name recommend it enough to the Perusal of Mankind.</p>
               <p>In MDCCIII, on the 3d of <hi>July,</hi> he took the Degree of Master of Arts, and had
<pb n="8" facs="329"/>
no sooner compleated it, but the Eyes of the whole University were upon him: His Industry was almost become a Proverb, and (notwithstanding a little Surliness of Temper which it is thought he brought into the World with him, and which pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bably increased with his severe Studies) he met with Friendship in a great many, and much Respect from all Men,</p>
               <p>I should have mentioned indeed before this, the Encouragement he had from the <note place="bottom" n="*">Dr. <hi>Hudson</hi> Principal of St. <hi>Mary-Hall.</hi>
                  </note>Head Librarian, who (acquainted with his Diligence) made him Underkeeper of the <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library. There he had Room enough for his Inquisitive Genius to range in; of which he made so good a Use, that the Product of every Year afterwards may justly be ascribed to the Acquisitions he had made in this Treasure of Learning.</p>
               <p>After some Years spent in this Way, of printing <hi>Indexes, Itineraries</hi> and <hi>Collectanea,</hi> his Labours met with an additional Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward; being on the 19th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1714-15, elected <hi>Architypographus</hi> of the University and superior <hi>Beadle</hi> of Civil Law <note place="bottom" n="†">

                  </note> This we find him acknowledging with Pleasure and Humility to be an Honour, which
<pb n="9" facs="330"/>
he took the first <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'Opportunity of menti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>oning to the World, on purpose that his Gratitude might be made known to Posterity. And notwithstanding he was conscious to himself that the University Favours were conferred upon One who every way undeserved them, in respect of Learning, and other requisite Quali<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fications, yet still he had very good Reason for accepting them upon this Account amongst others, as they sea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sonably assisted and relieved one of their Members who had for many Years led an obscure and retired Life, and was at that Time reduced to a necessitous Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dition thro' the great Expence he had been at in carrying on many public Designs.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this happy Posture of Affairs one would have imagined he might have been easy and satisfied: But neither Friendship nor Preferment could put a Stop to his Enquiry after <hi>Truth.</hi> Soon after this Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>motion he acquired better Reasons (to <hi>Himself</hi> at least) for Non-Compliance with the Oaths which were necessary for <hi>keeping</hi> it, than he had before for the <hi>Acceptance</hi> of it; and accordingly resigned that ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantageous Post, which the University had so lately consered on him, as incon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sistent

with his <hi>Conscience,</hi> or at least, his Manner of <hi>Thinking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ever since he steadily adhered to the Principles of a Non-juror; spent his Time in annually obliging the World with some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing relating to the History of <hi>England,</hi> or with some other Affairs as they accidental<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly have fallen in his Way, both for the Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nefit and Pleasure of Mankind. Here we think he might have been left still labour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing at the Oar, deserving the Favour and Compliments of the Learned upon his yearly Revival of something (as it were) lost to every one but himself. <note place="bottom" n="*">

               <p>During the late unhappy Contest in that House, occasioned by the Death of Dr. <hi>Charlett,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> published <hi>Peter Langtoft</hi>'s Chronicle; at the End of the Se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cond Volume of which, he adds a Glossary upon English Words.

                  </note>One Passage there is respecting <hi>Sprott</hi> (whose Authority we own we have some Reason to scruple) which proves, that Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> had either not kept up to his avowed Regard for <hi>Truth,</hi> or else had unhappily blundered in a Point of Chro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nology, tho' he abused Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> for it in the very same Case.

               <p>It is observable here, in the fifth place, that <hi>Sprott</hi> lived (according to Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi>'s own Confession) in 1274, which was in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the First; that he Studied <hi>in ea parte Aedis Christi quam vulgo vocant Quadrangulum Cantuari<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ense,</hi> and that he wrote of <hi>Canterbury College,</hi> and left a Book behind him con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerning it, is evident from the above-cited Preface to <hi>Sprott</hi>'s <hi>Chronicle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a very surprising <hi>Canterbury</hi> Tale indeed; and that would make <hi>Sprott</hi> (provided it could be proved) more Famous than the <hi>Samian</hi> Philosopher, who, by the Help of Transmigration, passed thro' two or three Successive Stages of Generation, but never under the same Name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sprott,</hi> who lived in 1274, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, studied in <hi>Canterbury College,</hi> which was not built till 1363, and therefore agreeable to this Account, must either have lived about 89 Years before he was born, or at least written
<pb n="17" facs="338"/>
of a Place as many Years before it was built.</p>
               <p>This Mistake we would have accounted for in our Author's Behalf, had it been in our Power; but as it was not, we left it to himself, who was better qualified to reconcile Difficulties of this Nature.</p>
               <p>Another Slip of this kind appears in Page 302 of his Collection of <hi>Curious Discourses. Academia</hi> (says he) <hi>scripsit</hi> Guilielmo Wykham <hi>Episcopo</hi> Winton: <hi>ut il<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lis accommodaret Machinas, quarum Ope</hi> Scholam Theologicam <hi>Voltis &amp; Fornicibus exornarent.</hi> It is very well known that the <hi>Divinity School</hi> (for which this Loan was desired) was built in the Year 1476, by <hi>Tho.

                  <hi>Rymer</hi> in his <hi>Foedera</hi> tells us, that <hi>Hen. Beaufort</hi> Bp. of <hi>Winton</hi> died the 3d Id. of <hi>April</hi> 1447. and was succeed<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed by <hi>William Waynflete,</hi> who lived in
<pb n="18" facs="339"/>
Possession of the same till 1486. So that if for <hi>Wikham</hi> we read <hi>Waynflete,</hi> as the Person petitioned to by the University, we shall come within the Time of building the <hi>Divinity School,</hi> and set Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> right in his Chronology. This we believe was an Alteration of no Design, but only a simple, thoughtless Blunder. Mistakes of this sort we shall conclude with an As<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sertion of his relating to <hi>University College,</hi> where he makes <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> to have studied in the <hi>Great Hall,</hi> which was not bought for the Use of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi>'s Scholars till 124 Years after his Death.</p>
               <p>As for the Censure passed upon Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> in the Passage above-cited (which really is too severe without better Grounds for it) we may venture to say it is Unjustifi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able. For supposing that <hi>Sprott</hi>'s Book was written before <hi>Higden</hi>'s, yet still Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> (who had never seen or heard of it till he had finished his <hi>Annals</hi>) might un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doubtedly say, and consistent with Truth too, that <hi>Ralph Higden</hi> was the first he ever had met with quoted as a Friend to the weak Cause of K. <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Halls, and who seemed first to have introduced this Novelty into the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="340"/>

               <p>These are sounding Words, and express a great deal of Loyalty to the Memory of those Princes. But such fickle Things are our <hi>Memories,</hi> that sometimes they seem to take Pleasure in exposing us. Hence doubtless it was that Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> lately run counter to his own above-cited Declarations. It must be Forgetsulness (we hope so at least) that will suffer a Man to draw his own Character in an infamous I Light; and whether he has not done it to the Life, let the <hi>Reader</hi> judge when he has heard the Accusation, and is referred to the Place where he may soon inform himself.</p>
               <p>At the latter <note place="bottom" n="*">Pag. 405</note> End of the Life of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d, there is a <hi>Letter</hi> printed and Mr. (<hi>Hearne</hi> says an <hi>Original</hi> one) of
<pb n="2" facs="342"/>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> the First when Prince of <hi>Wales:</hi> It is directed to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and interpreted by the <hi>Publisher</hi> of it, as carrying on an Affair of Gallantry. Be the Letter what it will, <hi>Original</hi> or not, He ought to have given a better Reason for making it publick. He was apprehen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sive (he tells us) that if such a <hi>Letter</hi> should be stifled, some Persons might interpret it an Instance of Partiality, and be apt to make base Reflections upon it. Let us ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>amine this kind of Reasoning a little. The stifling this <hi>Letter</hi> would have been thought an <hi>Instance</hi> of <hi>Partiality;</hi> The Reason of which must be this; Because Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> was necessarily obliged to pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lish every Thing he met with. And then, he says, that some Persons would be apt to make base Reflections on it: On the <hi>Letter</hi> we snppose, which if stifled, they might never see or hear of: Or if he meant those Gentlemen who communi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cated it to him, he again forgot his <hi>Ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ritatis Amor,</hi> because they never intended it should be printed. That it might escape therefore all <hi>Censure</hi> he published it in a heap of <hi>Appendixes</hi> and <hi>Curae secvndae,</hi> and made it a hundred Times more easy for base Reflections to be cast on it than it was before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="343"/>
This is the <hi>Reason</hi> given for publishing this <hi>Letter.</hi> In the next Book printed by him, which was <hi>Trokelowe</hi>'s Annals of <hi>Edward</hi> the 2d) we have an Apology in his Preface for the very same Thing. The <hi>Letter</hi> became the Subject of almost every one's Discourse, and a Reflection cast up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on a Prince, remarkable for his <hi>uncommon Chastity,</hi> could not but be taken Notice of by many of his Friends. Whether it had like to have discontinued any of his Subscriptions, or whether he had more maturely considered the Matter, we cannot say; this however is plain, that his <hi>Apo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>logy</hi> was designed to give a softer Turn, than was hinted in his <hi>Explanation</hi> of the <hi>Let<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter;</hi> and that he had rather have it thought, that the <hi>Prince</hi> was unwarily <hi>misled,</hi> than <hi>inclined</hi> to this Gallantry.</p>
               <p>It had been more <hi>prudent</hi> (and we may add less <hi>officious</hi>) in Mr. <hi>Hearne,</hi> whilst he was thus endeavouring to clear himself, to have first got leave for the Printing this Letter from the <hi>Gentleman</hi> who shewed it him, and who, we are informed since, so highly resents it, that he broke off a Friendship with him, which had been kept very strict for many Years. We must subjoin by the way, that it is certainly a greater Instance of <hi>Partiality</hi> to publish a
<pb n="23" facs="344"/>
                  <hi>Letter</hi> as an <hi>Original,</hi> which the Editor could not at that Time, nor afterwards, prove to be so.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apology</hi> will appear, upon a little Consideration, not at all inferior to his <hi>Reason</hi> for printing it; especially if we observe, that tho' he did not know what the <hi>Intrigue</hi> was, yet he happily conjec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tured, by making the <hi>Prince</hi> to be inticed like <hi>Joseph</hi> by the Importunity of a lewd Mistress; tho' we do not remember that <hi>Joseph</hi> ever wrote to a third Person about his Affair. Nay, it may be remarked farther, that Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> makes the <note place="bottom" n="*">This Blunder reached our Author's Ears, and in his Preface to <hi>Tho. Caius</hi> stands corrected, th with some Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>luctance. For he says it signifies nothing whether it was <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s or <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s Wife.</note> Wife of <hi>Pharoah</hi> the <hi>importunate</hi> Woman, when the Scriptures assure us, it was <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s Spouse that was so deeply smit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ten with the Comeliness of the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> But a Man may possibly forget his <hi>Bible,</hi> who is so very much taken up with <hi>Adam</hi> de <hi>Domerham,</hi> and the <hi>black Book</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Had this unfortunate <hi>Prince</hi> lived some hundred Years before he did, Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi>'s Love for <hi>Antiquity</hi> might probably have
<pb n="24" facs="345"/>
engaged him in his <hi>Defence</hi> rather than in <hi>exposing</hi> him. We find him, in the <note place="bottom" n="*">Page 77.</note> Ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pendix to <hi>Leland</hi>'s <hi>Collectanea,</hi> very angry with <hi>Tyrrel</hi> the Historian for staining the Reputation of <hi>Ethelred</hi> and his first <hi>Queen:</hi> There he says <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'it is a great Crime to scan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dalize any Person; the Heinousness of it increases according to the Dignity of the Person, of whom the Scandal is raised: But this <hi>(says he)</hi> may be wiped off by a public <hi>Retraction.</hi>'</q>
               </p>
               <p>This was good Doctrine, had not a Preface to <hi>Canden</hi>'s Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> shewed, that Men do not always practise as they advise: But a public Retracta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion which (from the ingenuousness of Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi>'s Dposition) we had Reason to think he would make, might wipe off the Blemish he may have contracted, either in the Case of Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> or the inde<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cent Language given Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi> His Pretence to <hi>strict Integrity,</hi> we were almost confident, would prevail with him to do it, in a better Manner than disguising it in a trifling <hi>Apology;</hi> and as he was a strict En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quirer after <hi>Truth,</hi> and is, by this Time, convinced it was wrong to publish the <hi>Letter,</hi> or abuse the aged <hi>Divine,</hi> we do not
<pb n="25" facs="346"/>
doubt but that he retracted what he had said in both Cases, and frustrated the Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pectations of some People who thought he delighted in <hi>Abuse,</hi> tho' we hope he acowledged our <hi>Friendship</hi> in setting him right.</p>
               <p>Thus have we considered one of his ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cellent Qualities; the next is his <hi>Fidelity</hi> as an <hi>Editor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One Rule which we have been informed he at first laid down, and generally speak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing closely observed, was always to fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low his Authors religiously.

               <p>This Method is very observable through<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out the numerous Volumes he has obliged the World with. <hi>Sic MS.</hi> he has noted perhaps in the <hi>Margin</hi> to shew that he was not ignorant of the Error in the <hi>Copy.

                  </note>In the Catalogue of his Works, an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nexed to the History of <hi>Glastonbury,</hi> he has published an Inscription in the fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowing manner, now to be seen in the Remains of <hi>Rewly.</hi>

Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> saw this intire; but afterwards it was broken, and unskilfully placed in a Wall of one of the lower Rooms of <note place="bottom" n="†">A Monastery adjoining <hi>Oxon.</hi>

<pb n="29" facs="350"/>
often seen it, and that it is very legible. In this ancient Inscription we find there is a <hi>Jingle</hi> too; and had it been so legible as he declares it was when he saw it, we are surprised that <hi>He,</hi> of all Men, would be so inaccurate a Copyer a Trade he fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowed all his Life) as to transpose one Word and add another, instead of tak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing it as it really is,

                  </q>
The Word <hi>Longespe,</hi> inserted in his Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count of it, is not upon the Stone, how legible soever he asserted it to be; and the Spelling of <hi>Werwick</hi> quite altered by him, without the least Authority whatever but his own.</p>
               <p>This Blunder may in some Measure be accounted for in this Manner.—There is now in the <hi>Anatomy School</hi> (which was formerly under the Care of Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi>) a Stone found at <hi>Rewly,</hi> (probably the Foundation-Stone of a Chapel there) bear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing this Inscription—ELE LONGESP COMIT: WAREW: HANC CAPELLAM FECIT: This no doubt had often been perused by our <hi>Antiquary,</hi> as well as the other before mentioned; and perhaps the
<pb n="30" facs="351"/>
trusting too much to Memory, might raise a confused Notion of both Inscrip<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions, and corrupt the <hi>Monkish Jingle</hi> in the former Case.</p>
               <p>These few Mistakes then having taken their Rise from not sticking closely to his <hi>Copy:</hi> we shall take Notice of but One more, which was occasioned by following it too closely; and it may be seen in his Edition of that valuable <note place="bottom" n="*">MS. Latino Graec. <hi>Fol.</hi> 38.</note>MS. which is said to have belonged formerly to Venerable <hi>Bede.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let it be observed in the first Place, that this MS. is in very old Capital Letters, and each Page divided into two Co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lumns: The first contains the <hi>Latin,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> is wrote collaterally in the other. Thro' the <hi>Oscitancy</hi> of the Scribe, the <hi>Latin</hi> Sentence is frequently carried be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>yond the Bounds of its own Column, by which means it becomes intermixed with the <hi>Greek.</hi> The Text as he has printed it stands thus: <hi>viz.</hi>

At the Bottom of his Page (not contented

with Dr. <hi>Mills</hi>'s <hi>Reading.</hi>) he adds <hi>sic plane in Codice nostro non</hi>

                  <hi>ut a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pud Millium;</hi> tho' it will appear beyond all Dispute upon any one's Enquiry, that the Doctor was not in the least to be blamed. For, as we observed before, thro' the Care<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lessness of the Scribe, the Latin Line be¦ing carried beyond its due Bounds into the Greek Column, and the Words MENTE and MEN TE consisting of five Capital Let<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters, just the same in both Languages, un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>happily led Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> into this Mistake. So that by defalcating one Word from the Latin, and converting it into two Greek ones of no Signification at all, he spoiled the Sense of the one, and made the other quite superfluous.—But some Faults sure are pardonable in so <hi>voluminous</hi> a Writer.</p>
               <p>To be particular in shewing his Talent at <hi>Reasoning</hi> would, we fear, be making too free with our <hi>Reader</hi>'s Time: We might quote three Parts of his Discourse on the <hi>Stunsfield Pavement,</hi> had not Mr. <hi>Peyntr</hi> thoroughly considered it already; and give such Instances of it which nothing but <hi>Envy</hi> or <hi>Ill-Nature</hi> could find Fault with: But the following <hi>Epistle</hi> prevents our dwelling upon this Excellency, it being a Master-piece of its kind, and what the Reader, we hope, will be greatly delighted with.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="353"/>
But let the Epistle speak for itself: There is one Paragraph in his <note place="bottom" n="*">Pag. 28, 29.</note>Preface to <hi>Sprott</hi>'s <hi>Chronicle,</hi> which really seems to be a new Method of <hi>Reasoning,</hi> such as no Writer but himself, we believe, dares lay any Claim to. He is there speaking in <hi>Sprott</hi>'s Praise, and his Words are these—<q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Adeo ut non videam cur mihi sit Detri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mento, si publice declarem me opinari de A<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cademia nostra Oxoniensi Opus etiam justum ac distinctum contexuisse:</hi>
                  </q> And then comes the Reason in the very next Sentence, viz. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Opinioni favet Auctoris Pietas. Quod si Tu aliter sentias, Ego in Sententia non perstabo</hi> nec <hi>quorsum recidant quaecunque animadverti magnopere laborabo, si modo il<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lud concesseris de Collegio Cantuariensi Opus post se reliquisse, in quo multa itidem de to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ta Academia è Monumentis praeclaris obiter notaverit.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Argument produced to prove that the Author of that <hi>lean Chro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nicle</hi> (whether <hi>Sprott</hi> or some other) it not clearly appearing that <hi>Sprott</hi> was the Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thor of it, composed many other valuable Books, not at all inferior to the <hi>Chronicle</hi> which is published. Great Pity indeed! that such profitable Works should be bu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ried
<pb n="33" facs="354"/>
in Obscurity; and doubtless was there not some Hope of their being still recoverable, <hi>Sprott</hi>'s Admirers (how in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>flexible soever in other Cases) would la<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment greatly under their Loss in this.</p>
               <p>Agreeable to this new Method of Rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>soning we find an uncommon Conjecture in his Preface to the Sixth Volume of <hi>Le<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land</hi>'s <hi>Itinerary,</hi> which very few Writers would ever have made. From a Medal of <hi>Carausius</hi> bearing this Inscription, VICTORIA CEA, he endeavours to prove, that the Brogue of the common People is the true Standard of the <hi>Roman</hi> Dialect and Pronunciation. The Word <hi>Caesar,</hi> ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cording to this <hi>curious Remark,</hi> is not to be pronounced as it generally is by People of Fashion and Breeding, <hi>Cesar,</hi> but a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>greeable to the broad Manner of speak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing used by the most rustic of Mankind, and as it stands upon the Coin, CEASAR.</p>
               <p>We acknowledge the Observation to be a very curious one, and to stand upon the Authority of a Medal, but if it should ever be discovered, that it proceeded from an Error of the <hi>Mint-Master,</hi> from a simple Literal Transposition, or from any other Accident (as possibly it might) the Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mark will then sink into its Value; The
<pb n="34" facs="355"/>
Coin indeed may be curious upon the Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count of the Blunder, but is no more an Argument to ascertain the Truth of Dia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lect or Pronunciation, than that <hi>spurious Halfpenny</hi> of his present <hi>Majesty,</hi> would be a Standard in the next Age for pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nouncing GEOGIVS instead of GEORGIVS.</p>
               <p>It would waste too much of the Reader's Time probably, to offer here a Collection of all the Poetical Fragments scattered thro' his Labours; the Preservation of which by Printing them, we must ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serve, shews no small Desire to be useful to Mankind, as these Rhythmes contain either Lessons of Oeconomy; such as,<q>

                        <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'If Men, <hi>says he,</hi> would but consider, that it is not only our Duty, but our Interest to be Virtuous, one would think this were no hard Task to perform, <hi>viz.</hi> reforming the Manners of the People, and restoring them to their antient Sobriety and Virtue. Among a thousand Advantages that Christianity has, above all other Religions, this is none of the least, that it has united our In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terest

and our Duty together. Would not a wise Man be Chaste for the sake of Health; Honest for the sake of Profit; Temperate for the sake of Pleasure, and all Three for the sake of Fame? For Vice was never yet so triumphant as to be in greater Reputation than Virtue. These Considerations, together with the innumerable Mischiefs and Inconveni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>encies which attend a vicious Course of Life, ought in Reason to reclaim Men from <hi>all</hi> unmanly Excesses.

Now Sir, tho' I should be as far from interrupting the indefatigable Labours of Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> in his Historical Studies as any Man living; yet I think no Man ought to be indefatigable in Slander, and that the Unchristian Temper he has shewn ought to be reprehended. And it gives me no small Concern to find the grave Style of an Antiquarian changed to the foul-mouthed Language of the most aban<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doned Prostitute. Neither can I by any means agree, that whatever <hi>unguarded Expressions</hi> Mr. <hi>Moyle</hi> may have dropt, can be just Grounds of Provocation for such Scurrility, as I believe never before fell from the Pen of any Controvertist. But Mr. <hi>Moyle</hi> has himself hit the right Nail on the Head in the Passage above cited. Mr. <hi>Moyle</hi> was a professed <hi>Whig,</hi> and a hearty Well-wisher to his Country. Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> is a professed <hi>Non-Juror,</hi> and a fiery Bigot to those of his own Principles. With him, Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the XI, and Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> were equally Infallible, and, in the true mean<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing of the Word, I believe so too. Mr. <hi>Moyle,</hi> as a <hi>Whig,</hi> must be <hi>a Republican, a Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>temner of Religions; one who had a natural Antipathy to the Clergy and their Friends, a meer Ignoramus,</hi> and, in good Ecclesi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>astical Charity, <hi>gone to the Devil.</hi> I can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not
<pb n="44" facs="365"/>
help therefore asking you, Sir, whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther you really think the Positions advanced by Mr. <hi>Moyle</hi> in his <hi>Lescard</hi>-Charge, or any part of his Conduct to which you were ever a Witness, could deserve such Treatment, especially from one who never knew him otherwise than by his Writings.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Critical Dispute,</hi> I shall be as silent as I resolve to be about the <hi>Legendary one</hi> above mentioned. Yet I cannot help observing, that what Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi> says, is very merrily dogmatical. For, he will have it that Mr. <hi>Hearne forms a right Judgment of all Mr.</hi> Moyle<hi>'s Works,—because the best Antiquaries have judged his Shield to be a</hi> Clypeus Votivus. And Mr. <hi>Moyle</hi> is highly criminal, <hi>and passes Sentence upon it, without ever having seen it,</hi> otherwise than by two Draughts. Now I would only ask the learned Doctor one plain Question; <hi>If I see the Picture of a Horse,</hi> am I to believe the <hi>living Animal</hi> it represents to be a <hi>Bear?</hi> But indeed he descends a little, and says, That <hi>the Ba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ron</hi> Spanheim <hi>and Mr.</hi> Sellers intended to write Dissertations upon it, and that some other Antiquarians really believed it to be an Antique; <hi>(anglice)</hi> the Back of an Old Sconce, which I have been credibly in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formed he bought in <hi>Rag-Fair.</hi>

                        <pb n="45" facs="366"/>
As to that Piece of Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi>'s, which Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> complains is imper<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fectly printed, it is to be hoped he will oblige the learned World with a more correct Copy; tho' this Imputation does not lye against Mr. <hi>Moyle,</hi> but against the <hi>Person</hi> who transmitted that Piece to him.</p>
                     <p>May Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> hereafter retain a more Christian Temper. May his useful Studies, as you are pleased to call them, meet with all the Success he can expect, and may the scurrillous Cavils, both of him and every other Writer, meet with that just Contempt which is due to such Performances.

In the first place you will have it, that all who dissent from Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> are <hi>a set of abandoned Wretches, and such indeed was</hi> Walter Moyle <hi>
                           <abbr>Esq</abbr> whose Posthumous Works all good Men ought to lay aside;</hi> for Reasons hereafter to be considered. As to Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> I had above twenty Years intimate Correspondence with him, and always believed him to be a learned, and very pious Man. But at the same time, all, who knew him, will allow that Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Character of a certain Peer, in <hi>Absalom</hi> and <hi>Achitophel,</hi> too much re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sembled Mr. <hi>Dodwell;</hi> for he truly was, what the Poet asserts,

                     <p>Now since your Breast is animated with so much Heat in behalf of these <hi>Venerabi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lia,</hi> the <hi>Fathers,</hi> I desire to know by what better Authority, than a <hi>Popish</hi> Canoniza<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, are they invested with the Epithet of <hi>Holy?</hi> If indeed, all the <hi>Libertinism</hi> of <hi>Youth</hi> be sufficient to confer that Title, and all the <hi>Impotence</hi> of <hi>Age,</hi> be sufficient to confirm it, the Plea is good, and the Precedents produced may be St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> St. <hi>Origen,</hi> and that notorious Saint, of <hi>Creed-making</hi> Memory, St. <hi>Athanasius.</hi> Who in their Works may say of each o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther—

such only were opposed by Mr. <hi>Moyle.</hi>) What you farther, with the greatest Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ingenuity insinuate against him, may be strictly applied to your own Temper, that, as all good Men must despise the Censure of so scurrilous an Antagonist, so they must, upon the same Principles, have but a very slight Opinion of those Persons whose Encomiums are drawn by your Pen.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>MOYLE</hi>'s <hi>wayward-Editor,</hi> you have indeed justly reprehended; but as to your Cavils concerning the <hi>Bath</hi> In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scription, they are equally disingenuous.

               </p>
               <p>We shall next consider our Antiquary's Political and Religious Principles.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> wrote a Letter to his Pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tron, Mr. <hi>Cherry,</hi> in Vindication of those who took the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to King <hi>William;</hi>
                  <note place="bottom" n="*">It was intitled, <hi>A Vindication of these who take the Oath of Allegiance to his present Majesty, from Perjury, In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>justice, and Disloyalty, charged upon them by such as are against it. Wherein is evidently shewed, That the common Good of a Nation is what is primarily and principally respected in an Oath, and therefore when the Oath is inconsistent with that, the Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sons who have taken it, are absolved from it. In proving of which, the</hi> Case <hi>of</hi> Maud <hi>and King</hi> Stephen <hi>is particularly considered. In a Letter to a Non-Juror.</hi> Conscientia mille Testes.

                  <pb n="58" facs="379"/>
which others refused. The Point was disputable, and Censures no Doubt were passed upon the <hi>Jurors</hi> as well as <hi>Non-Jurors.</hi> His Reasons for Compliance (how weak soever in the Eyes of those of a dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent Persuasion) were doubtless good in his own; and if he discovered better afterwards for <hi>refusing</hi> the Oath, than he before gave for the <hi>taking</hi> it, we think, and with strict Justice, that he ought to have produced them for the Benefit of the Public and clearing the Point in Dispute. How he became dissatisfied in this Affair, is not the Business of our Inquiry.</p>
               <p>What Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> could mean by pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lishing a Letter of King <hi>Charles</hi> I, when Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> (therefrom insinuating, that his Royal Highness had then an In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trigue upon his Hands, and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> played the Part of Pimp up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on the Occasion) is a Mystery which we believe his Fautors will have much ado to unravel.

               <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>NE must have but little Know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge of human Nature, not to be sensible of that Curiosity which prompts Mankind to be acquainted with the History of Persons distinguished by their extraordinary Vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tues and Qualifications, and who have experienced many uncommon Varieties of Life. In reading their Transactions, we become agreeably intimate with the Characters which have raised our Admi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ration; we attend them in the different Scenes thro' which they pass, and are sensible of a secret Longing to imitate the shining Parts of their Conduct: They frequently teach us an easy Moderation in Prosperity, and are no less successful in reconciling us to the severe Dispensa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of Providence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="390"/>
THE Impressions we receive from per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sonal Characters, are more lively and affecting than such as are imparted to us by moral Precepts; and those Virtues, which Institutions of Philosophy might give us but a languid Invitation to imi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tate, are altogether irresistable, when they are set off by the Conduct of Persons of Elevation; and they must be thrown into Action, in order to give them their last Polish and Refinement.</p>
               <p>THIS may be one Reason why Bio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>graphy has generally met with such a fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vourable Reception, and we may venture to affirm, that if the Authors who engage in this Kind of Writing, would select such Characters as are entertaining, and instructive at the same Time, they would have no Cause to complain of any Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>regard from the Public.</p>
               <p>THE noble Lady, who is the Sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject of the following Memoirs, has made so conspicuous and engaging a Figure, thro' the series and Vicissitudes of a long Life, that she may be justly reputed an Honour to her own Sex, as
<pb n="3" facs="391"/>
she has always been the Admiration of ours.</p>
               <p>IF a Descent from an illustrious Race of <hi>British</hi> Nobility, a polite and generous Education, an early Familiarity with the most amiable Accomplishments, an inchanting Harmony of Person and Mind, a Virgin Purity of Youth, and a taintless Fidelity of conjugal Life, have any Charms in the softer Sex, they have all lent their full Lustre to the late Dutchess of <hi>ORMONDE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT should seem as if Providence intend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed to guard this Lady from every Impu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tation that could be formed against her by envious and detracting Minds, and therefore would not confine her Virtues to Scenes of Satisfaction and Prosperity; she had long convinced the World of her Ability to act an unexceptionable Part in such a Situation, but something still remained to give her Conduct its full Perfection. The appointed Period ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rived; this incomparable Person was de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prived of the dearest of all her Enjoy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments: She saw herself for ever sepa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rated from her darling Consort, and her former Affluence contracted into a very
<pb n="4" facs="392"/>
moderate Limitation: Her Sunshine of Happiness darkened with Adversity; but that Adversity only gave her an Oppor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tunity of charming all who knew her, by her inimitable Resignation to the Decrees of Heaven.</p>
               <p>AS there was Reason to believe the Public would be curious to know the Particulars of a Life so diversified by such unusual Events, all possible Care has been taken to collect every authen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tic Circumstance that could make such a Relation useful and entertaining; and, we presume, that the Impartiality with which we have proceeded, on this Oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cation, will intitle this Performance to a candid Reception from those who are pleased to favour it with their Perusal.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Dutchess of <hi>ORMONDE,</hi> whose Life we propose to write, was the Elder surviving Daugh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter of <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Beau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fort,</hi> by his Dutchess <hi>Mary,</hi> Daughter of that unfortunate Patriot, the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> whose steady Attachment to his distressed Soveraign, King <hi>CHARLES,</hi> I. de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prived him, in 1648, of a Life which deserved a much happier Period.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="394"/>
THE most noble House of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> as it was august in its Original, so it has been perpetuated by a Train of Descen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dants, who have been justly esteemed the Ornaments of their Country. And the great <hi>Plantagenets,</hi> who founded this illustrious Family, have transmitted their Virtues thro' a long Series of their Po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sterity, and adorned the Kingdom with a Progeny, of both Sexes, which will be ever remembered with Honour.</p>
               <p>THE Dutchess of <hi>ORMONDE</hi> was born at <hi>Beaufort</hi>-House, near <hi>Chelsea, Anno</hi> 1665; and, in her early Years, presented such a Dawn of amiable Qua<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lities to her noble Parents, as convinced them that the Lustre of their Family would receive no Diminution from their lovely Daughter. Animated by this Persuasion, they were particularly care<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful to cultivate, by a suitable Education, the Virtues which had already sprung up in her Mind with such a luxuriant Bloom. Their Cares succeeded to their Wish, and there was no Accomplishment neces<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sary to give Perfection to her Sex, but what appeared with all its Charms in the Conduct of this young Lady.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="395"/>
NATURE sometimes presents us with a great deal of Inequality in her Produc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions; and it is no uncommon Thing to see a very disagreeable Exterior allotted to a finished Mind; but she now determined to be uniform in her Operations, and prepared, for the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi>'s Daughter, a Form as amiable, as the Soul which was to claim it, for her Habi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tation.</p>
               <p>IT would require a Pen, much more masterly in Description than mine, to give the Reader a competent Idea of this engaging Lady; the inchanting Harmo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny of her Shape, the Lustre and Viva<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>city of her Eyes, which inspired all who beheld them with unutterable Impressions; the glowing Blush of the Rose, which was blended in her Cheeks with the Virgin Purity of the Lilly, the flowing Shade of Hair which wantoned in a Profusion of Ringlets, that no Pencil could imitate; the delicate Turn of her Face, and the bewitching Softness which diffused itself thro' every Feature; the panting Snow of her Bosom, and the taper Whiteness of her Arms; with a thousand other Beauties which perpetually played around her, formed such an Assemblage of Perfection,
<pb n="8" facs="396"/>
that was to be resisted by nothing but Insensibility itself.</p>
               <p>WE believe we shall not be taxed with Falshood, when we affirm, that such a Prodigality of Charms were capable, without any other Assistance, of capti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vating a thousand Hearts; but we have already intimated that Nature discarded all Partiality in her Plan, and made this irresistable Form the Residence of a Soul which was altogether as attractive as its lovely Mansion: The most refined Poig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nancy of her Wit was contrasted by the sedatest Judgment; and each of these fine Qualifications were so beautifully softened by her native Sweetness of Tem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>per, that her Pleasantry never gave Pain, and none ever thought themselves insult<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed by her superior Penetration.</p>
               <p>THE Happiness of her Memory facili<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tated her Improvement, by those Books and Industry, with which she was daily conversant; and, in a few Years, it proved such a Treasury of Knowledge and Po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liteness, as few Ladies of her Age were ever enriched with: The little Levities of the Sex, and those refined Deviations from Sincerity and Sanctity of Manners, which are become so fashionable a Part
<pb n="9" facs="397"/>
of modern Education were altogether un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>known to her. True Virtue is certainly amiable in herself, but she puts on re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doubled Charms when she shines in the Conduct of a blooming Virgin.</p>
               <p>SUCH was the Lady we are describ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing; her Mind was as immaculate as her Face, and every Year that added to her Youth, presented her with new Perfec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions, and awaken'd a general Curiosity to know what happy Man was to be bless'd with the Endearments of her nup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tial Love.</p>
               <p>IT is not to be imagined in what Manner that pleasing Expectation influ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>enced some of the noblest of the <hi>British</hi> Youth. A virtuous young Lady of Rank and Beauty is a publick Blessing, she civi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lizes the Souls of her Admirers more than all their Academical Institutions, and fires them to aim at a proper Simili<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tude of Accomplishments. Innocence, Purity and Honour appear so persuasive in the Fair-One, that it is no Wonder if she daily increases the Number of their Votaries, and brings them fresh Acces<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions of Homage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="398"/>
AMONGST the shining Crouds of Adorers who wished to inspire her with the soft Sensibility of Love, none made so conspicuous a Figure as the Duke of <hi>Ormonde;</hi> he was descended from a very antient and illustrious Family that had given many Heroes to their Country, and, in the Person of the Duke, had pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sented it with an Ornament that did not a little contribute to its Lustre. Death had for some Time deprived him of his first Lady (who was the eldest Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Rochester</hi>) and left him a Widower in the full Bloom of his Youth. His endear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Behaviour to his deceased Dutchess, warmed many of the fairest with secret Wishes to succeed her in his Embraces. His Person was such as might impart the softest Impressions to the chastest Heart, and was set off by such a winning Singu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larity of Sweetness, Generosity, and eve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry other Quality which constitutes the fine Gentleman, that it was almost impossible for him to be long considered with In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>difference by any Lady to whom he breathed his Passion. We may add to this, that he possessed such a Princely Estate, that Fortune seemed to contend with Nature which of them should be his greatest Benefactor. It is true, the Duke
<pb n="11" facs="399"/>
only valued the Favours of the former, as they enabled him to distinguish him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self by numberless Acts of Humanity, and indulged him in his natural Propen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sity to Benevolence. And if the Goddess has not of late been so liberal to many others, it may have proceeded from their being destitute of his Inclinations to com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>municate her Bounties to their Fellow Creatures.</p>
               <p>AFTER the Account I have attempt<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed to give of these two illustrious Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sons, it will be natural to conclude, that they were formed for each other; and therefore, without entering into the Par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticulars of that tender Intercourse which Love, and a Similitude of Dispositions, established between them, it will be suffi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cient if we acquaint the Reader, that his Grace was so fortunate in his Addresses, as to prevail on the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi>'s charming Daughter to consent to be the loveliest Bride in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Number of the young Dutchess's Admirers was not diminished by her Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riage, and tho' they found themselves re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>strained from disclosing to her the Senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments with which her Charms had in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spired them, yet there were several who

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="14" facs="400"/>
merited that Friendship by a Number of amiable Qualities.</p>
               <p>IT often happens, that Men of Wit, thro' too much Partiality to themselves, are apt to fancy that a Lady's Satisfac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion in their Conversation, must create a Fondness for their Persons, and the Earl did not fail to impute to the Dutchess, Impressions in his Favour, which she her<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self was never sensible of; and conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently he was always ready to improve every Instance of her Complacency too much to his own Advantage. The Opinion he entertained of his being more agreea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble to her than he really was, made him look on the dishonourable Conduct he was meditating against the Duke, as a Crime that was capable of a very easy Vindication, he thought it more hon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ourable to succeed with the Dutchess, than to preserve Fidelity in his Friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship to her Lord; and to such an Infa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tuation was he hurried by his guilty Love, that he imagined it to be the most criminal Action in the World to neglect the Happiness which his Vanity repre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sented the Dutchess inclinable to afford him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="401"/>
IN Consequence of this Persuasion, as he had the Honour one Evening to lead her Grace from the Drawing Room, he slipt a Letter into her Hand, as she was stepping into her Coach, and then retired with a profound Reverence. The Lady believed the Paper contained some agreeable Piece of Poetry, in which the Earl, as we intimated before, was very happy, and was impatient to read this new Product of his Capacity: But who can describe her Confusion and Resent<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, when she found it to be a Decla<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ration of Love, and her Displeasure was the greater, as she was conscious that no Part of her Conduct could possibly give that Nobleman any Pretentions to the indecent Presumption with which he treated her; and tho' it was late at Night, she resolved to acquaint the Dutchess her Mother with the Affront that had been offered to her Virtue.</p>
               <p>SHE accordingly ordered her Coach<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man to drive to the Dutchess of <hi>Beau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fort</hi>'s House, and, at her Arrival there, went into her Grace's Bed-Chamber, and intreated her, with a Flood of Tears, to read the Letter she put into her Hands. The Dutchess was not a little surprized

to see her Daughter in a Disorder of Mind intirely new to her, and immedi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ately read over the Letter, with an Asto<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nishment natural to such an Event. <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Is it possible, Madam,</hi> said the Dutchess of <hi>Ormonde, that any Man can dare to think he has a Privilege to treat me in this dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>honourable Manner! I can appeal to Hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven and Earth, that my Conduct has hither<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to been without Reproach, which makes this Violation of the Respect due to me, so insupportable.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Dutchess of <hi>Beaufort</hi> was as much dissatisfied with this Adventure, as her Daughter, and was justly apprehen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sive that it might be attended with very fatal Consequences; to prevent which, all imaginable Discretion was necessary.</p>
               <p>WHILST they were deliberating what Steps were most proper to be taken in so delicate an Affair, a Lady of great Quality, and a near Relation to them both, came in very seasonably to assist at the Consultation; and after she had heard a particular Account of the whole Affair, she gave it as her Opinion, that <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>it would be most proper for the Dutchess of</hi> Ormonde <hi>to dissemble her Resentment, and treat the amorous Peer with such an</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="405"/>
                     <hi>Air of Indifference, as would effectually mortify his Vanity, and discourage him from persisting in his criminal Desires:</hi> The Lady added, <hi>that if such a Course of Behaviour should not have the Effect that might be reasonably expected, she would undertake to disclose the Affair to the Duke of</hi> Ormonde, <hi>in such a Light as should en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gage him to come into a Scheme she had formed for making this new Lover the Di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>version of the whole Town.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS Advice was allowed to be just, and, after some farther Consideration, the Dutchess of <hi>Ormonde</hi> took her Leave, with a Determination to conduct herself according to her Relations Sentiments. It was not long before the young Earl saw her, and, as he was pleased to flat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter himself, that the Graces of his Wit and Person were irresistable, he was not a little surprised at the negligent Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner in which the Dutchess heard all the fine Things he said to her; and as he found that he had not made the least Impression on her Heart, he began to imagine she might possibly not have read his Letter, for he could not believe that so much premeditated Wit and Tenderness as it contained, could prove ineffectual; and therefore resolved to be certain that

his next Letter should be read by the Dutchess; for which Purpose, he found Means to gain, as he imagined, one of her Women to his Interest; he made her a Present of a large Purse of Gold, ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>companying it with a second Billet, which he intreated her to deliver into her La<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dy's Hands, and, at the same Time, gave her to understand, that if she ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quitted herself of the Confidence he re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed in her, to his Satisfaction, there was nothing she might not promise her<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self from his future Bounty.</p>
               <p>THE Dutchess's Woman performed her Commission, and gave the Letter to her Lady, with a particular Account of the Earl's Liberality, and all the large Promises he had made her. The Dutch<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ess, after she had read the Letter, made her Mother, and the other Lady, who had instructed her how to behave, acquainted with the Contents; upon which they thought it now a proper Time to make the Duke of <hi>Ormonde</hi> privy to the Secret. This they did, in such a Manner as ea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sily disposed his Grace to come into their Measures, to make his Rival as ridicu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lous as his Vanity ought to render him. To accomplish which, it was agreed a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mong them, that the Dutchess should an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swer
<pb n="19" facs="407"/>
her Lover's Letter, and it is easy to imagine, that an Epistle dictated by such Persons, and on such an Occasion, was artful enough to deceive, even a Gen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tleman of the Earl's Penetration. It would be no disagreeable Entertainment to the Reader, could I repeat all the plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sant Things, and the diverting Contri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vances that were invented by this illu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>strious Company, to expose the presum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing Lover. The Dutchess of <hi>Ormonde</hi> was for having him <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>privately admitted in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to the House, and shut up in some Place where he might be half frozen, before he should be set at Liberty:</hi>
                  </q> But the Duke replied, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>That would be a Management of too low a Turn for the Earl's nice and de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>licate Taste,</hi>
                  </q> and then recollecting, that his Garden Wall was of a very conveni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ent Heighth, he thought it would be best <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>for the Lover to climb over it, in order to come to his Lady, the Danger and Diffi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culty only tending to compleat the Glory of such a gallant Adventure; besides,</hi> added he, <hi>we shall by this Means see whether his Lordship is in earnest, and dare ha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>zard his fine Person in the Prosecution of his Amour.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS Proposal meeting with the Ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>probation of all the Ladies, they went
<pb n="20" facs="408"/>
into the Garden to examine the Wall, and, observing a Place that had Hooks, which a Ladder might be commodiously fastened to, the Dutchess's Woman had Directions to describe this convenient Situation to the Earl; but it was not done till several Letters had passed be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween him and the Dutchess, and he be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>came persuaded, that his Addresses were as successful as he could wish. And now the Dutchess's Woman acquainted him, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>he had made all imaginable Impressions on her Lady, and that she expected the Plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure of his Company with the greatest Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>patience, but then,</hi> continued she, <hi>it will be impossible for your Lordship to pass by the Porter in any Disguise; and you are not insensible what Regard is due to a Lady's Reputation, in an Affair of this Nature, and therefore some Expedient must be thought of, to prevent any Discovery of your being admitted into my Lady's Apart<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Earl, upon this, gave her the strongest Assurances of his strict Regard for the Dutchess's Honour; <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>and there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore,</hi> said he, <hi>I am desirous of being intro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duced in any Manner you can contrive, to prevent my being discovered by any of the Servants, and there is no Danger, that I</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="409"/>
                     <hi>will ever decline to accomplish my Happi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, with all the Privacy my lovely Dutch<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ess can possibly desire.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Gentlewoman finding him in such a Resolution, thought it then pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>per to acquaint him, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>That no Way would be more effectual, to prevent the Affair from being detected, than for his Lordship to climb over the Garden-Wall,</hi>
                  </q> and then she described that particular Part of it, where the Hooks were fastened; <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>your Lordship,</hi> added she, <hi>is too gallant, to hesitate at a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny little Danger that you may be exposed to, on such an Occasion, and you are like<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wise to consider, that you could not have a more favourable Opportunity of convinc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing my Lady, that your Passion for her, can make you despise every Hazard and Diffi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culty that may lie between you and the Happiness you are in Pursuit of, and there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore, if your Lordship has no Objection to what I have been proposing, I will be, at Eleven this Night, in the Garden to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceive you.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>HIS Lordship was so animated, with the Hopes of his imagined Joys, that he told the Gentlewoman, in a Kind of Transport, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>That he thought Fortune was very propitious to him, in giving him such</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="410"/>
                     <hi>an Opportunity of convincing her Lady how much his Passion could surmount eve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry Danger and Impediment;</hi>
                  </q> upon which he took his Leave, with a solemn Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mise to be punctual to the appointed Time; and then went to pay a Visit to the Duke of <hi>Ormonde,</hi> by whom, as was before observed, he was treated with the greatest Friendship and Intimacy.</p>
               <p>THE Duke received him with his usual Affability, and after some Conver<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sation, walked with him in his Garden, where he could not forbear smiling to himself, to observe, with what a curious Eye his Visitor examined rhe Wall he was to scale that Evening. After they had taken a few Turns, the Earl took his Leave, and went to his own House, where he passed the Remainder of the Day with all the impatient Desires, natural to a Lover, who expects the happy Period of all his Wishes. The appointed Hour was, at last, come, and his Lordship did not fail to be exactly punctual at the Place agreed on, where he found the Ladder of Ropes thrown over the Wall, by the Means of which he mounted to the Top, with wonderful Activity, and from thence, as nimbly descended into the Garden: But, alas! how frequently
<pb n="23" facs="411"/>
do Disappointments and Disgrace attend the finest Schemes of poor Mortals; and how common is it for Men to meet with the most disagreeable Accidents, in the very Instant that he promised him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self nothing but Rapture, and the most perfect Felicity! The adventrous Peer had no sooner set Foot on the fatal Ground, than the Gardener, who hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pened to be a very sturdy Fellow, pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tending to mistake him for a Person who intended to rob the House, fell upon him with Herculean Force, and gave him such a vigorous Drubbing, that he was ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liged to cry out for Assistance. The Noise alarmed the House, and the Duke, with all the Company, who were then at Supper with him, came out in a seeming Surprise to know the Occasion of the Clamours they heard. Any one will ima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gine, that the unfortunate Lover made no very graceful Figure in such a Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>juncture; and, as it was impossible for the Spectators of his Disgrace, to keep their Countenances, he grew sensible, that this had been a premeditated Scheme to expose him. But, as he had a peculi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ar Presence of Mind, and was, likewise, one of those Philosophic Lovers, who never run distracted at the Disappoinment of their Passion, he asked the Duke's
<pb n="24" facs="412"/>
Pardon for the Folly he had committed, desiring his Grace to impute it to a youthful Inconsideration he would no longer indulge; after which, he joined with the Company in their Mirth, and rallied himself very pleasantly for the Discipline he had received from the ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nest Gardiner.</p>
               <p>THE Earl's ill Success in his Amour, soon became public, and was, for a considerable Time, the Entertainment of all the gay Company about the Court; and besides this, it entirely extinguished the Hopes of all who sighed for the amiable Dutchess in Secret. They were convinced, that her Vertue was impreg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nable, and that it was possible for a La<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dy to be the fairest of her Sex, and, at the same Time, capable of preserving an untainted Fidelity to her Nuptial Vow.<note place="bottom" n="*">The foregoing was an Adventure of the late Duke of <hi>Buckinghamshire</hi> when he was Earl of <hi>Mulgrave.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>ANY one will easily believe, that the Duke, after this amiable Proof of his Lady's Virtue, could not but cherish such a Treasure with the utmost Fond<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, and, indeed, our noble Pair lived in so mutual an Intercourse of Endear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments, as rendered them the Envy and
<pb n="25" facs="413"/>
Admiration of the Age. I say, the En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vy, because there have been People ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>licious enough to declare, that the Dutchess, some time after her Marriage, entertained such a Fondness for Cards, as in a great Measure alienated the Duke's Affection from her for a considerable Time. But whilst some have been so ungenerous as to propagate such a Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port, and others so weak as to believe it, all must acknowledge this to be the only Frailty that was ever imputed to that Lady, and even this has been aggravated much beyond the Reality of the Fact. The Truth is, Cards being at that Time, as well as now, the fashionable Amusement of the Fair, it was impossi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble for the Dutchess, whose House was continually filled with the best Company in the Kingdom, to do otherwise than comply with the Inclinations of her Vi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sitors in that Diversion; and it may be true, that she might sometimes sit up late at Play to oblige her Company, and we will not deny, that the Duke might be sensible of some Uneasiness to find his Lady compelled by the reigning Deco<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rum among the Great, to be absent more Hours from him, than were agreeable to her Inclinations. But, at the same Time, in Justice to the Memory of that incom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parable
<pb n="26" facs="414"/>
Lady, we must affirm, That the Moment she was sensible of the least Uneasiness in her Lord on that Account, she never after would suffer Play to de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain her from him, to any late or un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>seasonable Hour. A singular Instance this, of a Lady, who could resolve to sacrifice what was then thought an innocent Amusement, to the Repose of her Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sort; whereas the same Motive now, is frequently insufficient to make Numbers of the Sex resign Pleasures that are really criminal and injurious to their own and their Husband's Reputation. But to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn to this noble Pair.</p>
               <p>WHEN the Duke was constituted Lord-Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Dutchess undertook that Voyage; and her Recep<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion and Return is so truly, and so ele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gantly described by Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> in his Address to her Grace<note place="bottom" n="*">See the <hi>Dedication</hi> of his <hi>Fables.</hi>
