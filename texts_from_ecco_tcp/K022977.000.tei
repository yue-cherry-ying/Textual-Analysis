The Miser's Enjoyment consists in hoard<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing up his Wealth, and feasting his Eyes with the Sight there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>of. Our old Friend <hi>Horace</hi> has assured us of this, almost Two Thousand Years ago; for he introduces a Man of this Character, saying, <q>

And tho' perhaps his Taste in Painting, Ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chitecture, &amp;c. may not be altogether so exquisite as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s in Philosophy or Poetry, yet still he certainly tastes the Purchase he makes, better than the Purchase Money; for otherwise, he de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serves to be begg'd for a Fool for parting with it.</p>

However, it is not impossible but he may have bought Books from Second and Third Hands, and he may very likely have some, among so prodigious a Collection, which he has hardly deign'd a reading. But I hope Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Works are none of that Number, tho' he may well save himself the Trouble even of looking into them; for whether Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> knows it or no, he can read <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Statius,</hi> nay, and <hi>Chaucer</hi> and <hi>Shakespear,</hi> in <pb n="4" facs="6"/> their Originals, without Recourse either to a rhiming Translator, or a Modernizer to point him out their Meaning.—But <hi>Mead</hi> is not only famous for Books, but for several choice Curiosities, among which is his celebrated Head of <hi>Homer,</hi> for a Copy of which, if I mistake not, Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> has been oblig'd to him, to grace his <hi>Odyssey.—</hi> And the World tells strange Stories, if Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> be not oblig'd for the best Part of his own Head to some Body else, who may, not unlikely, meet the same Treatment in his next Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formance, as these have done in This.</p>

A descendant of his, of a different Taste (or, if Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> pleases, of a finer Taste) may possibly, some Ages hence, cut down his shady Woods, plow up his fine Walks, and turn the whole to Corn-Ground again. This will also be Employment and Bread for the Neighbourhood, whenever it happens.—And whether Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> be sensible of it, or no, Satyr rebounds back upon the Author, whenever it is pointed at a wrong Object.</p>

But perhaps this is only his private Opinion, which he has a mind to father upon the Publick. —Be that as it will, any other Extravagance would have produced as ill an Effect, and several, much worse.—But <hi>Timon</hi> has thrown away vast Sums in Building.—The Publick <pb n="13" facs="15"/> certainly gathered up as much as he threw away, and this was no more than changing Hands. The whole was undoubtedly gi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven to Stone-Cutters, Carvers, Statuaries, Bricklayers, Carpenters, Joyners, Labourers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All the Materials too were undoubtedly the Produce of our own Island, except a little foreign Marble, and some other Trifles of small Importance. So that such a private Expence is so far from being a Publick Loss, that the Nation would not be one Farthing the poorer, if fifty such Fabricks were erected every ten or a dozen years.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IF we will look a little into the Conduct and Custom of the World, it may not appear so extraordinary as some have thought it, that Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> because he cannot be the <hi>Foun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain of Honour</hi> to Mankind, should be fond of usurping the <hi>Fountain of Infamy,</hi> and please himself with dealing out a Fund of <hi>dirty</hi> Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>motions from that <hi>inexhaustible</hi> Spring. And as nothing yields a more sincere Delight than to see the Workings of a <hi>beneficent</hi> Mind; I doubt not but every <hi>good</hi> Man is rejoiced to observe this <hi>Great Prince</hi> creating <hi>Dunces</hi> upon <hi>Dunces,</hi> of his own free Will and Motion, with so much Alacrity, and all in a due Subordination. It is
<pb n="32" facs="34"/> certain, I ought to be very well satisfied with my Share of <hi>Honours</hi> in this Kingdom of <hi>Dul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness,</hi> since the Preamble to my Patent is, That <hi>He could not find One more fit to wear them.</hi> I would not willingly act like the Favourite, whom <hi>Shakespeare</hi> somewhere describes, who being made proud by his Prince, advanced his Pride against the Power that bred it: But I would rather, like a grateful Favourite, lay out my Talents in asserting the Legality of my Master's Title to those Dominions, in which he exercises so free a Sway, and from whence he so unsparingly dispenses his <hi>Promotions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And since I have mention'd <hi>Shakespeare,</hi> (one of the Tributaries by Conquest made subservi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ent to his Throne) I will attempt to convince Unbelievers, by some few Instances of his <hi>Prowess,</hi> with what a Strength of Arm, and Fineness of Head, he has <hi>humbled</hi> that proud Adversary to his Sceptre; Or, (to step out of all <hi>Metaphor</hi> at once) I will attempt to shew with what Fidelity he has perform'd the <hi>dull</hi> Office of an <hi>Editor,</hi> hardly without aiming to under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stand his Author himself, or having any Ambi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion that his Readers ever should: Or, where he does aim, to shew he has such a happy Fatality at Mistaking, that we are to wish he would not explain the Author into <hi>Nonsense.</hi> Give me Leave to subjoin some Examples just as they oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cur to my Observation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I. Much ado about Nothing. Act. 3. Scene 5.</hi> Sometimes fashioning them like <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Soldiers▪
<pb n="33" facs="35"/> in the <hi>reechy</hi> Painting, sometimes like the God <hi>Bel</hi>'s Priests in the old Church-Window, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> is pleas'd to tell us, that <hi>reechie</hi> sig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nifies <hi>valuable.</hi> But the Poet had no Intention here of complimenting the Richness, or Value of the Painting: On the other Hand, he would speak despieably of it, as of a common <hi>Wall-Painting;</hi> as he does in another Play of the Story of the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> and the <hi>German</hi>-hunt<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing in <hi>Water-Work.</hi> We may be pretty sure therefore our Author wrote, <hi>the</hi> reechy <hi>Paint<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing;</hi> i. e. Smoke-dry'd, exposed to Weather, or reeking and steaming with Nastiness. There are two other Passages, where, I remember, this Word again occurrs in our Author.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>Coriolanus. Act 2. Scene 4.</bibl>
               <l>—The Kitchen-Maukin pins</l>
               <l>Her richest Lockram 'bout her <hi>reechy Neck,</hi> &amp;c.</l>
            </q>
            <q>
               <bibl>And Hamlet. Act 3. Scene 11.</bibl>
               <l>And let him for a Pair of <hi>reechy</hi> Kisses,</l>
               <l>Or padling in your Neck, &amp;c.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now if <hi>reechy,</hi> in either of these Passages, sig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nifies <hi>valuable,</hi> I shall be content to allow Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Gloss upon the Passage first quoted.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>II. Henry VIII. Act 1. Scene 1.</bibl>
               <l>One sare that promises no <hi>Element</hi>
               </l>
               <l>In such a Business.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Here we are told that <hi>Element</hi> is <hi>Rudiment,</hi> or <hi>Beginning:</hi> But here again the common Sense of the Passage is explain'd away. <hi>Shake<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>speare</hi> means no more than that, He is One who
<pb n="34" facs="36"/> promises no <hi>Qualifications,</hi> no <hi>Talents</hi> for such a Business; or, is not in a <hi>Sphere</hi> for it. In these Acceptations, I think, our Poet generally uses the Phrase. So,</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>Merry Wives of Windsor. Act 4. Scene 4.</bibl>
               <l>And such Dawbry as this is beyond our <hi>Ele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment.</hi>

               <l>What you would is out of my Welkin, I might say <hi>Element,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>but the Word is over-worn.</l>
            </q>
            <q>
               <bibl>And again. Act 3. Scene 9.</bibl>
               <p>You are idle shallow Things, I am not of your <hi>Element.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>In every one of which Quotations Mr. <hi>Pope's</hi> Gloss would be out of the Way: It were not amiss, perhaps, that this Commentator should remember, <hi>A Man may sometimes be out of his</hi> Element.</p>
            <q>

                     <p>All Relations, or kindred Elements that com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose Man, as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> expounds it.

                        <l>i. e. <hi>Germina,</hi> Seeds of Matter.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>So, again, in <bibl>Mackbeth. Act 4. Scene 2.</bibl>
                     </p>
                     <l>—tho' the Treasure</l>

               <l>Ev'n 'till Destruction sicken.—</l>
            </q>
            <p>For so it must here like wise be corrected. And to put this Emendation beyond all Doubt, I will produce one more Passage, where our Author not only uses the same Thought again, but the Word that ascertains my Explication into the Bargain.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>Winter's Tale. Act 4. Scene 9.</bibl>

               </l>
            </q>
            <p>I would very willingly know, as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clares against his having made any <hi>Innovations,</hi> from what Authority he has adopted this quaint Word, <hi>Nicety.</hi> It is in none of the Old Co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pies, that ever I have seen; and if he derives it either from Mr. <hi>Row</hi>'s Edition, or Mr. <hi>Tate</hi>'s Alteration of this Play, he must give me Leave to except against it. The Old Reading, (which, I presume, Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> did not know what to make of) 'tis true, is corrupted.—<hi>The</hi> Curi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>osity <hi>of Nations.</hi>—but out of it I will venture to restore the Poet's genuine Word;</p>
            <q>The <hi>Courtesy</hi> of Nations to deprive me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>Our accurate <hi>Editor</hi> might have observ'd, that his Author chuses the very Term upon the like Occasion, in another of his Plays. <hi>As you like it.</hi> Act 1. Scene 1.</p>

            <p>Sagacity with a Vengeance! What? Neither osund Sense, true Grammar, right Inserence, Pointing, or Meaning?—Then, what is <hi>In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vention imitary?</hi> Invention and Imitation are certainly two distinct Things. In short, is Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> won't merrily call it <hi>pidling,</hi> I will venture to give Light to this very difficult Passage. The Speech is by a Pedant, who frequently throws in a Word of <hi>Latin</hi> amongst his <hi>English;</hi> and he is here flourishing upon the Merit of Invention, beyond that of Imitation, or copy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing after another. Correct it thus, and all is plain and intelligible.</p>

               <bibl>IX. Titus Andronicus. Act 3. Scene 3.</bibl>
               <l>Which of your Hands hath not defended <hi>Rome,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And rear'd alost the bloody Battle-Ax,</l>
               <l>Writing Destruction on the Enemies <hi>Castle?</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>Sagacity again! unless Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> means an Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>provement of the <hi>Art Military,</hi> by teaching us that it was ever a Custom to hew down Castles with a Battle-Ax. Or, how if he should have a Mind to tell us, that they wore <hi>Castles,</hi> former<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly, upon their Heads for <hi>defensive</hi> Armour? There is, indeed a Passage in <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Cressida,</hi> which such a Commentator might take in such a Sense.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="39" facs="41"/> 
               <hi>—And,</hi> Diomede,</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Stand fast and wear a</hi> Castle <hi>on thy Head,</hi> &amp;c. But as I cannot come in to this Interpretation, I shall venture to read the Passage in <hi>Andronicus</hi> thus,</p>
            <p>Writing Destruction on the Enemies <hi>Caske?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A broken <hi>k</hi> in the Manuscript might be mista<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ken for a <hi>tl,</hi> and thus a Castle was built at once: But I think it would be something easier to split an <hi>Helmet</hi> with a Battle-Ax, than cut down a <hi>Castle,</hi> and that is one Reason which induces me to propose this Reading.</p>
            <p>I had design'd to throw in another Emenda<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion upon the Word <hi>Castle;</hi> but I have already transgress'd the Limits of a Letter, and there are two, or three, Topicks still behind, that I have an Occasion to touch upon.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s DUNCIAD having lately made its Appearance in so pompous a Shape, with <hi>Notes variorum,</hi> (I am sorry the Editor could not spare us this short Scrap in a <hi>single</hi> Lan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guage;) I am very well content to pass over the <hi>Slander</hi> of his <hi>Wit;</hi> but ought not, as I apprehend, to rest Silent under <hi>that</hi> of his <hi>Malice,</hi> in which he would fix a pretended Charge of Ingratitude upon Me, a Vice, I hope, of all others the least ingrasted in my Nature. This Charge is, <q>That during the Space of two Years, while Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> was preparing his Edition of <hi>Shakespeare,</hi> I, who had then some Correspondence with him, and was sol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liciting Favours by Letters, did wholly con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceal
<pb n="40" facs="42"/> my Design (upon that Author) till after his Publication.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To one Part of this Accusation I have re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ply'd in a former Letter in this <hi>Paper.</hi> To say I concealed my Design, is a slight Mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>take: for I had no such certain Design, till I saw how <hi>incorrect</hi> an Edition Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> had gi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven the Publick. To the other Part, I think, I dare securely charge my Memory with all the <hi>Favours</hi> that ever I ventur'd to ask of Mr. <hi>Pope:</hi> and I challenge him to produce my Let<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters against me, if he thinks there is any Room for it. The first Favour that I ask'd, was, when I introduced a Play upon the Stage, that he would assist me in a few Tickets towards my Benefit. In about a Month after this Request, I received my Packet back, with this civil Excuse, That he had been all the while from home, and had not my Parcel till it was too late to do any thing with it. This, I confess, induced me, when I put out my Proposals for <hi>Aeschylus,</hi> to sollicit Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> for this <hi>Second Favour,</hi> that he would please to recommend <hi>that</hi> my <hi>Design,</hi> if it did not interfere with his own Affair of the <hi>Odyssey.</hi> To this Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> reply'd by Letter, <q>That <hi>he was glad I had undertaken this Work, and should be as glad to promote my Interest, notwithstanding his own Subscription to the</hi> Odyssey: <hi>That his own Awkwardness, and indeed Inability, of solliciting in any Kind, made him quite use<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>less
<pb n="41" facs="43"/> to his own Interest; but that he might not be intirely so to mine, he would ask those of his Friends for me, with whom he was familiar enough to ask any thing.</hi>
               </q>—But from that Day to the Publication of my <hi>Shake<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>speare Restored,</hi> (an Interval of above Two Years) I never received one Line more from Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> no Intimation of <hi>one</hi> Subscriber by his Interest, not even an Order that I should put his <hi>own</hi> Name down in my List. Upon this naked Fact, I submit the Censure both of my <hi>Obligations</hi> and <hi>Ingratitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Publick</hi> should not have been troubled with this State of the Case, had not these Insi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nuations been industriously propagated at this Crisis, both to hurt my Interest in my <hi>Subscrip<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion</hi> for my <hi>Remarks on</hi> SHAKESPEARE, which will now shortly appear in the World; and in that <hi>Play,</hi> which is designed for my <hi>Benefit</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi> next in the Theatre at <hi>Drury Lane.</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Double Falshood.</note> It is my Misfortune, I can boast but of a very scanty Interest, and much less Merit; and, con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sequently, Both are the more easily to be shock<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed. I had no Method, but This, of appealing to those Many, whom I have not the Honour of approaching, for their <hi>Favour:</hi> and of hum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bly hoping it the rather, because all my poor Attempts in Writing are calculated to entertain, and none <hi>at the Expence of any Man's Character.</hi>
