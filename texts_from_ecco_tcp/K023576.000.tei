               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I PREFIX this address in order to induce you, before you pass sentence on the fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowing pages, to read them through: <hi>"Strike, but hear!"</hi> To enable you to do this I have desired my publishers to send each of you a copy; for, though you may have <hi>Jack the Giant-killers coat,</hi> it has never been suspected that you possess <hi>Fortunatus's purse;</hi> and the title of a book, read in a newspaper, or through a shop-window, may not be always a suf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficient ground for unqualifyed condemnation and virulent abuse.</p>
            <p>On second thoughts, however, I believe I might as well have saved them the trouble; since you will, most probably, allow Mr. Malone the grateful pri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vilege of reviewing it himself: the virtue and honour
<pb n="iv" facs="4"/>of this literary hero frequently condescending to bring down an unsuspicious enemy from the masked battery of a Review. And yet, I see, one of your "gangs"<note place="bottom" n="*">These <hi>societies of gentlemen</hi> (as they modestly intitle them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves) are, with equal justice and ability, characterised by Dr. Brown as—"two notorious gangs of <hi>monthly</hi> and <hi>critical</hi> book-thieves, hackney'd in the ways of wickedness, who, in the rage of hunger and malice, first <hi>plunder,</hi> and then <hi>abuse, maim,</hi> or <hi>murder,</hi> every honest author who is possessed of ought worth their <hi>carrying off;</hi> yet skulking among other vermin in <hi>cellars</hi> and <hi>garrets,</hi> keep their persons tolerably out of sight, and thus <hi>escape</hi> the hands of <hi>literary justice.</hi>" ESTIMATE OF THE MANNERS AND PRINCIPLES OF THE TIMES, vol.

                  <l>Nor sets down aught in malice.</l>
               </q>
That you "nothing extenuate," unless it be in fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vour of yourselves or your employers, I can easily believe; but the next line certainly requires, if not a different reading, an opposite construction. It suits your purpose, no doubt, to delude the unwary by false colours; as the devil, when he commences innkeeper, hangs out an angel for his sign. The real meaning, however, is that you
<q>—set down <hi>ALL</hi> in malice.</q>
Shakspears morality, in the hands of a Reviewer, is to be read backward, like a witch's prayer.</p>

               <pb n="v" facs="5"/>Accustomed as you are to every species of misre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>presentation, you must by no means do me the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>justice to say that I treat you with contempt. For, though a literary prostitute be, in reality, a most de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spicable character, I cannot but consider you in, if not a far superior, at least, a very different light;—as two formidable, in short, and mischievous gangs of nocturnal banditti, or invisible footpads, equally cowardly and malignant, who attack when there can be no defence, and assassinate or destroy where you cannot plunder. And yet, surprising as it is, while offenders of comparative insignificance are almost every day exposed on pillories, or perishing in dun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>geons, you have the luck to escape the resentment of the injured, and the vengeance of the law! Upon my word, gentlemen, I admire your good fortune, though I cannot persuade myself you deserve it; and, indeed, as guilt is only hardened by impunity, the sooner, I think, you are brought to justice the better. Nor is this event, perhaps, at so great a distance as you may imagine: even <hi>the Monster,</hi> you know, was caught at last; and, though you pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sibly conceive this <hi>brother assassin</hi> to have been as inferior to you in cunning, as he certainly was in criminality, it will not be amiss to let his fate be a warning to you.</p>
            <p>I shall make no apology for having taken up so much of your time, which would, most probably, have been worse employed. You may now pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceed

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MR. MALONE, in the year 1780, when pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lishing a <hi>Supplement to Shakspeare</hi> of plays which he never wrote, modestly remarked that <hi>by a di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ligent collation of all the old copies thitherto disco<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vered, and the judicious restoration of ancient readings, the text of this author seemed then finally settled.</hi> Since that period, however, he has been labouring "with unceasing solicitude," for the space of "eight years" to convince the public that he had, if not directly asserted the thing which was not, at least gone a little further than was consistent with the exact state of the case. For, if the text had been already <hi>diligently collated</hi> with <hi>all the old copies,</hi> why should he make such a parade of having collated it himself? If it had not been so collated, why should he say it had? This fact is therefor manifest, upon Mr. Malones own evidence, that the text of Shak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>speare had never been collated, whether diligently or not, with all or any of the old copies, by any person before Mr. Malone. To which one may add that even this great critics collation has not been either so diligent or so successful as he would
<pb n="viii" facs="8"/>induce us to believe;<note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <p>Of this the following instances, occasionally noticed, in the <hi>two first</hi> vols. may serve as the specimen of a proof:
<list>
                        <item>Vol. I. p. 80. "If <hi>thou</hi> be pleas'd"—Both the folios read—<hi>you.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Vol. I. p. 140. "For love is still <hi>more</hi> precious in itself."—The old editt. agree in reading—<hi>most.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Vol. I. p. 154. "<hi>Speed.</hi> Item, she can <hi>sew.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>"<hi>Launce.</hi> That's as much as to say, can she <hi>so.</hi>" Both the folios read <hi>sow,</hi> which is manifestly requisite. Probably, however, the editor may suppose <hi>sew</hi> and <hi>so</hi> to have the same pronunciation.</item>
                        <item>Vol. I. p. 155. "And that <hi>I cannot</hi> help." In the old editions—<hi>cannot I.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Vol. I. p. 174. "As easily as I do tear <hi>this</hi> paper." Both folios read—<hi>his.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. 70. "But grace being the soul of your complexion <hi>should</hi> keep the body of it ever fair."—In the folios—<hi>shall.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. 71. "Let me hear you speak <hi>further.</hi>" Both edi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions—<hi>farther;</hi> a word entirely different from <hi>further,</hi> though too frequently confounded with it by ignorant persons: the one being the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parative of <hi>forth;</hi> the other a corruption of <hi>farer.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. 143. "In what safe place you have <hi>dispos'd</hi> my mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney." The old editions read—<hi>bestow'd</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. 151. "If it be, sir, <hi>pray</hi> eat none of it." In the folio—<hi>I pray.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. 157. "Ay let none enter"—The old copies—Ay, <hi>and</hi> let.</item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. 190. "And much different from the man he was," The folios read: "And much <hi>much</hi> different;"—the additional syllable being necessary to the metre, which the editor could not perceive.</item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. <hi>Ibi.</hi> "And <hi>therefore</hi> came it that the man was mad." In the old copies—"And <hi>thereof</hi> came it."</item>
                        <item>Vol. II. p. 477. "Through the forest have I gone, "But Athenian <hi>found</hi> I none." All the old editions read—<hi>find,</hi> which is not only more elegant but more grammatical.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is not reason to believe that each of the remaining volumes would not have contributed an equal number of these damning proofs; but in fact the search required too large a portion of both time and patience.</p>
               </note> and also that it would have been much better for the said text if he had never collated it at all. By a <hi>judicious restoration of ancient readings,</hi> Mr. Malone seems to understand the re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>placing of all the gross and palpable blunders of the first folio, from which it has been the labour of such
<pb n="vii" facs="9"/>critics as Rowe, Pope, Theobald, Warburton, and Hanmer to purge the text. Mr. Malone is a critic of a very different description.</p>
            <p>I have thought proper, in the following pages, to make a few observations on some of Mr. Malones notes. Now Mr. Malone will take this exceedingly ill; for Mr. Malone has a very high opinion of himself, and a very mean one of every body else. But I confess I do not seek to please Mr. Malone: I wish to rescue the language and sense of an ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mirable author from the barbarism and corruption they have acquired in passing through the hands of this incompetent and unworthy editor. In a word, I mean to convict and not to convince him.</p>
            <p>The total want of <hi>ear</hi> and <hi>judgement,</hi> under which Mr. Malone will be found to labour, is undoubt<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>edly a natural defect, for which he would be an
<pb n="viii" facs="10"/>object rather of pity than of reprehension, if he had not forced himself into an employment for which ear and judgement were essential, and nature, of course, in depriving him of those indispensable requisites, had utterly disqualifyed him. Want of courage, in a common man, may be considered as mere weakness of nerves; in a commander, it is punished with death.</p>
            <p>But it is not the want of ear and judgement only of which I have to accuse Mr. Malone: he stands charged with divers other high crimes and misde<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>meanors against the divine majesty of our sovereign lord of the drama; with deforming his text, and de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>grading his margin, by intentional corruption, fla<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>grant misrepresentation, malignant hypercriticism, and unexampled scurrility. These charges shall be proved—not, as Mr. Malone proves things, by groundless opinion and confident assertion, but—by fact, argument, and demonstration. How sayest thou, culprit? Guilty or not guilty?</p>
            <p>Whoever may think fit to censure the language of these "criticisms," Mr. Malone has no such right; having himself rifled the blooming beds of Billings-gate to grace his commentaries with the choicest rhetorical flowers.<note place="bottom" n="*">He seldom introduces the author of the <hi>Remarks,</hi> &amp;c. without a compliment on his <hi>profound ignorance</hi> or <hi>crude notions,</hi> the <hi>feeble<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness of his attempts at jocularity,</hi> the <hi>slenderness of his criticism,</hi> and the like; or the favourite epithet of <hi>a shallow</hi> or <hi>half-informed remarker.</hi> "And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges."</note> It is surely lawful to return an
<pb n="ix" facs="11"/>enemy the shot of his own poisoned arrows: and, as for the rest, whatever respect may be due to the errors of genius, the blunders of ignorance and pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sumption deserve no quarter.</p>
            <p>{inverted ⁂} Since these sheets were printed off, Mr. Malone has issued proposals for a new and splendid edition of the plays and poems of this admired author, IN FIFTEEN VOLUMES ROYAL QUARTO!!! The reciprocal good opinion which the public and Mr. Malone appear to entertain of each other does both parties infinite honour; the one from his singular confidence, the other from its refined taste. Having sufficiently, and, I trust, satis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>factorily, proved how peculiarly qualifyed this inge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nious gentleman is for an editor of our great poet, I have only to add my sincerest wishes that com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pletion of so magnificent a work may happen in time to afford me another equally favorable oppor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tunity of giving my humble testimony to his very extraordinary merit.</p>

                  <p>THERE cannot well be a more flagrant proof of disingenuity in the support of a particular opinion than is here manifested by the editor in his treatment of the <hi>second folio,</hi> in order to substantiate his position "that the editor of that book was intirely ignorant of our poet phraseology and metre; and that various alterations were made by him, in consequence of that ignorance, which render his edition of no value whatever." Many of the instances adduced in sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port of this assertion are mere self-evident errors of the press, the accidental omission or insertion of a single word, or the inadvertent transposition of a couple of letters;<note place="bottom" n="*">

                     </note> faults to which every copy is
<pb n="2" facs="13"/>equally subject; and consequently prove that editors ignorance much less than his accusers malice; which is the more remarkable as he has actually availed himself of a very considerable number of the cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rections of the identical edition which he thus anxi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ously labours to depreciate as a sink of ignorance and corruption. It must be evident, that by this par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tial mode of proceeding, the same charge might be brought home not only to the first folio, but to almost any edition of any author. A person who had only truth and justice in view would have exhibited a faithful statement, a fair debtor and creditor ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count of the merits and defects of the two editions. But this method, Mr. Malone is conscious, so far from answering his purpose, would have completely disproved and give the <hi>lye direct</hi> to his accusation; since, in fact, for <hi>one</hi> instance of an alteration for the worse it will be easy to produce <hi>ten</hi> instances of alterations for the better, and such, at the same time, as not only no ignorant or capricious person, but not even a man of sense and sagacity would have hit upon, without the assistance of manuscript correc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions or personal information: and after all, it is not in the least improbable that both editions were printed by one and the same person, there being only <hi>nine</hi> years difference in their dates, and the one, whether intentionally or otherwise, just as in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>accurate as the other. Both editors, at least, if two there were, were Shakspeares contemporaries; pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bably
<pb n="3" facs="14"/>his acquaintance; possibly his friends; and, in all events, equally familiar with the language of his time and his peculiar phraseology. But, leaving Mr. Malones partiality and ingratitude out of the question, I am by no means disposed to admit his judgement as to any ones ignorance of Shakspeares phraseology and metre: in neither of which, I believe, we shall find him a proficient. Some of these identical in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stances prove the direct reverse of what they are brought to do, and convict the prosecutor of both ignorance and malignity.</p>

                  <p>"I can go <hi>no</hi> further," instead of "I can <hi>not</hi> go <hi>no</hi> further;"</p>
                  <p>"<hi>I</hi> appointed him," instead of "<hi>I am</hi> appointed him," the syllable having slipped out in the press:</p>
                  <p>"The way to <hi>study</hi> death," instead of "the way to <hi>dusty</hi> death;" a mere accidental transposition of two letters; which is constantly happening. The following is of more consequence.</p>
                  <p>"The seventh [fifth] scene of the fourth act of this play <hi>[Antony and Cleopatra]</hi> concludes with these words:—"Dispatch,—Enobarbus!" Anthony, who, is the speaker, desires his attendant <hi>Eros</hi> to dispatch, and then pronounces the name <hi>Enobarbus,</hi> who had recently deserted him, and whose loss he here la<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments. But there being no person in the scene but Eros, and the point being inadvertently omitted
<pb n="4" facs="15"/>after the word <hi>dispatch,</hi> the editor of the second folio supposed that Enobarbus must have been an error of the press, and therefore reads;
<q>"Dispatch, <hi>Eros.</hi>"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such is Mr. Malones account of the matter, in which it is only necessary to supply a small omission of the very accurate writer, <hi>viz.</hi> that the line, of which the two words in question are part, is in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tended for metre, of which he is too good a judge for the omission to have been designed. This in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tention, however, would be defeated by the word <hi>Enobarbus;</hi> unless we are to accent it thus:
<q>
                        <l>—my fortunes have</l>
                        <l>Corrupted honest men. Dispatch.—<hi>Enōbārbūs?</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
Antony is continually repeating the name of Eros; he does it no less than five times in the preceding scene, and once before in this. The manuscript, it is probable, had, in this place, only an <hi>E.</hi> of which the original printer improperly made <hi>Enobarbus:</hi> this mistake must have been some how or other made known to the editor of the second folio, most likely by a MS. correction in the copy he printed from; he has therefor rightly corrected the word, but, at the same time, has neglected to observe the transposition which had been made by his predecessor (supposing the printer of each copy two different persons). Take the line, therefor, as Shakspeare
<pb n="5" facs="16"/>gave it, and let us acknowlege our obligation to the second folio, for so valuable an alteration:
<q>Corrupted honest men.—<hi>Eros! dispatch.</hi>
                     </q>
If he had meant that Anthony should apostrophise his absent officer, he would have given it thus:
<q>Corrupted honest men.—<hi>O Enobarbus!</hi>
                     </q>
The editor of the second folio was therefor right in supposing, if indeed he was not sure, "that Eno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>barbus must have been an error of the press."</p>
                  <p>"In <hi>K. Henry VIII.</hi> are these lines
<q>
                        <l>"—If we did think</l>
                        <l>"His <hi>contemplation</hi> were above the earth,—"</l>
                     </q>
Not understanding this phraseology, and supposing that <hi>were</hi> must require a noun in the plural number, he reads:
<q>
                        <l>"—If we did think</l>
                        <l>His <hi>contemplations</hi> were above the earth, &amp;c."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, one would be glad to know where there is a single person to be found, setting aside this petulant dogmatist, who ever heard of such a phraseology, or who does not know "that <hi>were</hi> must require a noun in the plural number."</p>
                  <p>It would be well if charges of no better founda<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion or greater strength could be brought against the ignorance of M. Malone.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="6" facs="17"/>II. "Let us now examine how far he was ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quainted with the <hi>metre</hi> of these plays." Ay marry, now for it; this is a subject upon which we are quite at home.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>"In the <hi>Winter's Tale,</hi> we find,—</l>
                     <l>"What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?</l>
                     <l>"In leads, or oils?"—</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>"Not knowing that <hi>fires</hi> was used as a dissyllable he added the word <hi>burning</hi> at the end of the line."</p>
                  <p>He did so; and it will be evident to every one who can read that the addition was absolutely neces<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sary, in point of quantity, to the perfection of the line. Mr. Malone can <hi>not</hi> read, and is totally ig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>norant of the consequences of his own absurd ideas; he could never else have thought such a line as the following consistent with the laws of metre:
<q>"What wheels? racks? <hi>fi-ers?</hi> what <hi>flay<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing? boiling?</hi>
                     </q>
Thus, however, he insists that Shakspeare intended us to read—<hi>swor-en, cha-rums,</hi> instead of <hi>sworn, charms; su-ar,</hi> for <hi>sure,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. converting one syllable into two, two into three or four and so on.</p>
                  <p>Instead of
<q>"And so to <hi>arms,</hi> victorious <hi>noble</hi> father,"</q>
with the <hi>second</hi> folio, we are to read
<pb n="7" facs="18"/>
                     <q>"And so to <hi>a-rums, vic-to-rī-ous</hi> father,"</q>
because <hi>noble,</hi> or some other word of equal quantity, has been omited by the printer of the <hi>first.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Instead of
<q>"<hi>But</hi> prove it, <hi>Henry,</hi> and thou shalt be king."</q>
As given by the editor of the second folio, "not knowing Henry to be used as a trisyllable," we are to read:
<q>"Prove it <hi>He-nē-ry,</hi> and shalt be king."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Instead of
<q>"Pours into captains wounds! <hi>ha!</hi> banish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment.</q>
                     <hi>pours</hi> being a dissyllable, we are to adopt the follow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing harmonious line:
<q>"<hi>Po-ūrs</hi> in-<hi>tō cap-tāins</hi> wounds! banishment.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Instead of
<q>She's tickled now, her fume <hi>can</hi> need no spurs.</q>
he thinks it more in the authors manner to read:
<q>"She's <hi>tickclēd</hi> now; <hi>hēr</hi> fume needs no spurs,"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Instead of
<q>
                        <l>"The body of <hi>the</hi> city, country, court:"</l>
                        <l>"The body of <hi>ci-ty, coun-tē-ry,</hi> court."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="19"/>And Instead of
<q>
                        <l>"<hi>Burn</hi> hotter than my faith. O but <hi>dear</hi> sir.</l>
                        <l>"<hi>Bu-ūrn hot-tēr</hi> than <hi>mȳ</hi> faith. O but sir."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"The editor, indeed" he says, "was even igno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rant of the author's manner of accenting words, for in the <hi>Tempest,</hi> where we find,
<q>
                        <l>"—Spirits, which by mine art</l>
                        <l>"I have from their <hi>confines</hi> call'd to enact</l>
                        <l>"My present fancies,"—</l>
                     </q>
he exhibits the second line thus:
<q>"I have from <hi>all</hi> their <hi>cònfines</hi> call'd to enact."</q>
It is somewhat lucky, however, for the editor of the second folio, that we are able to produce in his de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fence no less decisive a testimony than that of Shak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>speare himself. The word in question occurs in <hi>Julius Caesar:</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>"And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,</l>
                        <l>"Shall, on these <hi>cònfines,</hi> with a monarch's voice,</l>
                        <l>"Cry havock, and let slip the dogs of war."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reader will now judge for himself which of these two editors, the prosecutor or defendant, is most ignorant of his authors "phraseology, metre," and "manner of accenting words."</p>
                  <p>"Had he consulted the original quarto," says M. Malone, "he would have found that the poet
<pb n="9" facs="20"/>wrote"—so and so. Well, but how if he could not get, or never heard of the original quarto? how then? Had he not, in common with every other edi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tor, the right of supplying imperfections or correcting mistakes, according to the best of his judgement? It is no imputation upon the sagacity of Dr. Thirlby or sir Thomas Hammer that they have suggested readings, which, however plausible, are disproved by the more recent discovery of the old quartos: all of which have not been yet seen, even by Mr. Malone; who has, at the same time, been indebted to chance or favour for many of the others; for which he has not, on every occasion, made the most grateful or liberal return.</p>
                  <p>I shall now proceed to make the editor of the second folio some amends for the injustice, malevo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lence, and personal abuse of his Hibernian adversary, by displaying a few instances not only of his actual superiority to his predecessor (if, in fact, either edi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion had any other editor than the compositor of the press), but also where that superiority is admitted by Mr. Malones own adoption. The latter case is distinguished by an asterisk. It was once my intention to have given, what Mr. Malone ought to have done, a fair and faithful collation of the various readings of the two editions; but the space and press-work required even by the following specimen and the necessity I should have thought myself under of going through them a second time, which no one
<pb n="10" facs="21"/>needs to be told is a word of time and patience, will be a sufficient apology for not having carryed it into effect at present. However, as Mr. Malone has preserved all the <hi>errors</hi> of the second folio, and I shall exhibit a considerable number, at least, of its <hi>emendations,</hi> the reader will, between us, have a to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lerably complete view of the controversy. The first reading is that of the folio 1623, the other that of the folio 1632.</p>

                  <p>"The Quip Modest, &amp;c."</p>
                  <p>☜ "THE author of this pamphlet, after a few copies had got abroad, had the <hi>modesty</hi> to suppress it. Some time afterwards, repenting as it were of his repentance, he issued it out. One instance may be sufficient to shew his <hi>profound ignorance</hi> of the poet whom he attempted to illustrate; he supposed the words <hi>ignomy</hi> and <hi>intergatory,</hi> in a late edition of Shakspeare, to be errours of the press! So, when the clown in <hi>Measure for Measure</hi> says "there were but two stew'd prunes in the house, which at that very <hi>distant</hi> time stood, as it were in a fruit-dish, &amp;c. this Remarker for <hi>distant</hi> would read <hi>instant.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>The veracity of this note is no less remarkable than its decency. That the author of the pamphlet in question ever "had the modesty to suppress it" is an absolute falsehood, known to his printer, his bookseller, and all who bought it. The truth is that, "after a few copies were got abroad," the further sale was delayed till a leaf could be reprinted, in which some erroneous references had been detected, and an expression used which was thought too strong for the person alluded to, even if that person had been Mr. Malone, and another added to convict the
<pb n="28" facs="39"/>editor or reviser of the "late edition" of a gross and wilful misrepresentation. All this might take up a week, when the publication was continued. As to the rest, both Mr. Malone and the author of that pamphlet may have sufficient reason to wish that neither of them had ever betrayed more <hi>profound ig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>norance</hi> of this great poet than in barely prefering the reading of one edition to that of another. That <hi>ignominy,</hi> the correction of the second folio, and of which <hi>ignomy</hi> is every where either a contraction or a corruption, is requisite in the present instance will be evident to all, except Mr. Malone, and perhaps the editor (or reviser) of the edition in question, from the line itself:
<q>
                        <hi>"Ignòminy</hi> in ransom and free pardon."</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Intergatories,</hi> is likewise nothing more than a contraction of <hi>interrogatories,</hi> as Shakspeare would always have written it, if his metre had not required the sacrifice of a syllable, which prose does not. So, in <hi>K. John:</hi>
                     <q>"What earthly name to <hi>interrògatories.</hi>"</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Instant</hi> is also the reading of the second folio, and of every other edition before that of 1785. As however it was thought <hi>distant</hi> might be intentional, the instance was omitted in the cancel.</p>
                  <p>After all, if the <hi>"Quipsters ignorance"</hi> of his author was so <hi>"profound,"</hi> why has this infallible
<pb n="29" facs="40"/>judge adopted any of his remarks or suggestions, sometimes word for word, and elsewhere with <hi>sneak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing approbation,</hi> or at second-hand. See vol. ii. 11. 256. 491. 507. iii. 27. 77. 316. 394. iv. 497. 504. vi. 146. 273. v. 495. viii. 634. &amp;c. &amp;c. How say you to this M. Malone?</p>

                     <hi>"Richard the Confessor."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>"THIS piece," Mr. Malone observes, "should seem to have been written by the tinker in <hi>The Taming of the Shrew,</hi> who talks of <hi>Richard Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>queror."</hi> Unfortunately, however, the observation is but one out of many instances of our "half-in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formed" editors pleasantry being occasioned by his ignorance. He supposes <hi>Richard</hi> a blunder for <hi>Ed<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward;</hi> because he does not know that there is such a personage as <hi>Richard the Confessor;</hi> whereas there are no less than <hi>four Confessors of that name,</hi> any of whom might have been, and one certainly was, the hero of the above play. In the first place there is saint <hi>Richard the Confessor,</hi> an imaginary king of England, supposed to be buried at Lucca, where he is said to have dyed on his return from a pilgrimage to Rome. Another was bishop of Chichester; a
<pb n="30" facs="41"/>third of St. Andrews in Calabri; and the fourth hermit of Hampole near Doncaster, whose somni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferous lucubrations have contributed in no small de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gree to the bulk of Mr. Wartons <hi>History of English Poetry.</hi> All of these are expressly stiled <hi>Confessors</hi> in the <hi>English Martyrologe,</hi> 1608, and other books of the same cast: so that the editors "attempt at jocularity" is as "feeble" as his "ignorance" is "profound."</p>

                     <p>The elder folio regulates the passage thus:
<q>
                           <l>Go make thyself like a nymph o'th' sea:</l>
                           <l>Be subject to no sight but thine and mine; invisible</l>
                           <l>To every eye-ball else.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second reads:
<q>—like <hi>to</hi> nymph o'th' sea.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now comes our Irish editor, and pronounces as positively as if he had been at the copyists or compositors elbow that the words <hi>be subject</hi> were transfered to the second line "by the carelessness of
<pb n="31" facs="42"/>the transcriber or printer." "The regulation that <hi>I</hi> have made," says he, "shews that the addition [of the second folio] was unnecessary."</p>
                     <p>The only difference between the editor of the second folio and Mr. Malone is that the former per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fected the metre of the only defective line, and the latter has destroyed that of each. Had this "very fond and skill-less" editor possessed one thousandth part of the sense and sagacity he assumes the credit of, he would have perceived that the blunder of the transcriber or printer consisted, not in transposing the words <hi>be subject,</hi> but, in the insertion of two other syllables which certainly have no business there, and could not possibly have come from Shakspeare, unless Shakspeare had written like Mr. Malone. "The regulation that <hi>I</hi> have made shews that the addition was necessary:" I appeal to those who have ears:
<q>
                           <l>Go make thyself like to a nymph o'th' sea,</l>
                           <l>Be subject to no sight but mine, invisible</l>

The me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tre of the line is manifestly and simply perfect, as consisting of ten monosyllables, alternately short and long: so that it is absolutely impossible to conceive a less exceptionable instance of heroic verse.

our notable critic, for the improvement of the metre, of which he is a complete judge, alters it thus:

                        </q>
And justifies the alteration by gravely telling us that "our author and his contemporaries generally use <hi>odious</hi> as a trisyllable." How then, will he tell us, do <hi>he</hi> and <hi>his</hi> contemporaries use it?</p>
                     <p>It is evident that all we get by this capricious change is a transfer to one line of the defect of ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther; at least, to make any metre of the second we must read it thus:

                     <p>Dr. Johnson, finding the measure defective, pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fixed the word <hi>No</hi> to the latter hemistich, "But per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps," says Mr. Malone, "the particle which he

                     <p>They who look for information upon the subject in Mr. Tyrwhitts note will be as much disappointed as that learned gentleman would have been surprised to find them sent thither for it.</p>

                  <p>The position too hastily advanced by Mr. Steevens of the mortality of fairies has been so fully and com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pletely refuted, that I do not at all wonder to find our present candid and liberal editor continuing that gentlemans note, tho' I own I am not a little sur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prised to see the swaggering comment in the edition of 1785 reduced to half a dozen words—</p>
                  <p>"See the <hi>Faery Queen</hi> B. II. c. 10; and War<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tons OBSERVATIONS on Spenser, vol. i. p. 55. REED."</p>
                  <p>And why not likewise to "Tickell's poem, called <hi>Kensington Gardens,"</hi> which was to shew "that the
<pb n="43" facs="54"/>opinion prevailed in the present century?"<note place="bottom" n="*">
                        <p>This poem is printed in Dodsleys Collection, of which the editor or reviser of the edition of 1785 had been a very few years before employed in the republication. He must therefor know that it proved the direct reverse of that for which he refered to it, and consequently that he was asserting an untruth.</p>
                        <p>I should like to know from the gentleman concerned, or any other able casuist, the exact difference between asserting that a book proves what the asserter knows it disproves, and producing, like Lauder, supposititious extracts for the purpose.</p>
                     </note> But the reduction and omission are sufficient to prove that our modest editor was himself convinced of the fallacy of Mr. Steevens's assertion, and Mr. Reeds <hi>authorities,</hi> though he has not had the candour to acknowledge it. See the <hi>Quip Modest.</hi> pp. 11. 33.</p>
                  <p>The passage three quoted from Ariosto is thus translated by Sir J. Harington:
<q>
                        <l>"But (either auncient folke beleeu'd a lie,</l>
                        <l>"Or this is true) a <hi>fayrie cannot die.</hi>"</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The following instances, from this very play, were accidentally omited:
<q>
                        <l>"But <hi>she, being mortal,</hi> of that boy did die."</l>
                        <l>"I am a <hi>spirit</hi> of no common sort."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If ever any position was or can be demonstrated by literary evidence it is that the fairies of Shakspeare were not subject to mortality. There is no evi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dence whatever on the other side.</p>

                     <l>Due but to one, and crowned with one crest.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>"According to the rules of heraldry," it is the editors note, "the <hi>first</hi> house only, (e. g. a father who has a son living, or an elder brother as distin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guished from a younger,) has a right to bear the fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mily coat. The son's coat is distinguished from the father's by a label; the younger brother's from the elder's by a mullet. The same crest is common to both. Helena therefore means to say, that she and her friends were as closely united, as much as <hi>one</hi> person, as if they were <hi>both of the first house;</hi> as if they both had the privilege <hi>due but to one</hi> person, (viz. to him of the first house,) the right of bearing the family coat without any distinguishing mark."</p>
                  <p>Every reader of this incomparable edition will have frequent occasion to observe that the editor "draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument." The present instance, indeed, is nothing in comparison to pages of inanity with which the work abounds, and which, on ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count of their "true no-meaning," are actually in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>capable of refutation or discussion. What, in the name of Shakspeare, of sense or reason, has either <hi>the father</hi> or <hi>his eldest son</hi> to do with the passage in ques<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion?
<pb n="45" facs="56"/>The <hi>two seeming bodies</hi> united by <hi>one heart</hi> are resembled to <hi>coats in heraldry, crowned with one crest.</hi> And this happens either where the <hi>heir</hi> keeps his <hi>paternal</hi> and <hi>maternal</hi> coats, or <hi>the husband his own</hi> and <hi>his wifes,</hi> in <hi>separate shields,</hi> as is done on the continent; or, as at present with us, in the quar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terings of the same shield; in both cases there are <hi>two coats, due but to one, and crowned with one crest:</hi> which is clearly the authors allusion. But I am sorry to add that he must have entirely misunder<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stood, since he has so strangely misapplyed, the expres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion, <hi>Two of the first;</hi> which, in heraldical jargon, always means <hi>two</hi> objects <hi>of the first</hi> colour men<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tioned; that is the <hi>field.</hi> For instance: in blazoning a coat they will say, <hi>Argent,</hi> upon a fesse <hi>gules, two</hi> mullets <hi>of the first,</hi> that is, <hi>argent,</hi> the colour of the <hi>field.</hi> These words are therefor a melan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>choly proof that our great author sometimes re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tained the phrase after he had lost the idea, or up the former without sufficient precaution as to the latter.

                  <p>"If a Christian (says Launcelot, on receiving a love-letter for Lorenzo,) do not play the knave, and carry thee away from thy fathers house, I am much deceived." Such is the ingenious editors explana<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, which he "would not have attempted of so easy a passage, if the ignorant editor of the second folio, thinking probably that the word <hi>get</hi> must necessarily mean <hi>beget,</hi> had not altered the text, and substituted <hi>did</hi> in the place of <hi>do,</hi> in which he has been copied by every subsequent editor." Every subsequent edi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tor must therefor be, at least, equally ignorant; and I dare say, if Mr. Malone is to be the judge, there never was editor, commentator or critic of Shak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>speare who had a grain of sense beside himself. A
<pb n="48" facs="59"/>refutation cannot be expected of such peculiar absur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dity. "Launcelot," he says, "is not talking about Jessica's father, but about her future husband." But how does he know this? who told him so? can he be better acquainted with the subject of Launcelots conversation than the man himself? He is aware, at the same time, that, in a subsequent scene, he says to Jessica, "Marry, you may partly hope your <hi>father got you not;</hi>" but he is now, it seems, on another sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject. That, however, is but the idle opinion of Mr. Malone; the editor of the second folio, and all his successors, and, I will venture to add, Shakspeare himself, and all his readers, think very differently.</p>

The present editor, how<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever, who is in fact, what he would have the other thought to be, "utterly ignorant of our authors phra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>seology and metre," omits the article, under pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tence that "<hi>Country</hi> is here used as a <hi>trisyllable.</hi>" To reason with a man who has no more ear for poetry than Dr. Johnson had for music, and he scarcely "knew a <hi>drum</hi> from a <hi>trumpet,</hi> or a <hi>bag<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pipe</hi> from a <hi>guitar,</hi>" would be absurd: every other person will see it was utterly impossible for Shak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>speare to write such a line as this, or indeed for any one but Mr. Malone to conceive it:
<q>"The body of <hi>coun-tè-ry,</hi> city, court.</q>
What a pity it is that the public cannot have the pleasure of hearing Mr. Malone read his own text! I say <hi>pleasure,</hi> because undoubtedly it would be a most laughable performance.</p>

                  <q>Over the wretched? What though you have <hi>mo</hi> beauty.</q>
                  <p>The old copies reading—no <hi>beauty,</hi> the editor
<pb n="52" facs="63"/>will have it to be a misprint for <hi>mo,</hi> or <hi>more,</hi> as he has every where else thought proper to write it. This, he says, "appears clearly from the passage in Lodge's <hi>Rosalynde,</hi> which Shakspeare has here imi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tated:—"Because <hi>thou art beautiful,</hi> be not so coy, &amp;c." A passage which, as it contains neither <hi>no</hi> nor <hi>mo,</hi> can not certainly prove what it is brought to do. The construction adopted by this pene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trating critic is that though a <hi>woman</hi> has <hi>more</hi> beauty than her <hi>lover</hi> she is not on that account to insult him: an idea which one can easily suppose never entered into any head but his own; one would not, therefor, wish to deprive the present edition of an emendation so worthy of it. But, however, Mr. Malone may read, his author certainly wrote
<q>Over the wretched? what though you have beauty.</q>
He could not perceive that <hi>no</hi> or <hi>mo</hi> was as injurious to the metre, as his quotation from Lodge might have led him to suspect it was to the sense: though I believe he understands both equally well. But, I well know that "my learned friend is above taking notice of such slender criticism."</p>

                  <p>"Vincentio's" according to Mr. Malone, "is

                  <p>Mr. Malone, no doubt, is able to perceive a great many thing which neither Mr. Pope nor any body else would dream of; though, if Mr. Pope did not perceive that a <hi>word of four syllables</hi> was a <hi>word of four syllables,</hi> he must have been a more extraordi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nary person than he is generally reputed. No, no, Mr. Malone, it was not because he did not perceive <hi>Vincentio's</hi> to be used as a quadrisyllable, that he read <hi>Vincentio his,</hi> but because, not having had the advantage of an Irish education, he perceived that such a line as the following could not have been written by Shakspeare:

<pb n="55" facs="66"/>Now, in my humble opinion, it rather completes the evidence that the editor does not know what metre is. He should have accented his lines. What delectable harmony is here!

                  <p>There is a poem, intitled <hi>Teisa,</hi> which was pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lished a few years ago, entirely written in this way, and on that account a sort of curiosity.

                  <p>The text, which is too plain to be misunderstood by a reader of common sense, will speak for itself, and clearly prove that neither Falstaff nor the hostess knows the prince till he says he is "come to draw him out by the ears." Falstaff himself allows that he did not know the prince was within hearing: but this perspicacious critic, who can see into the midst of a millstone, would be thought to know what passes better than either Falstaff, or Falstaffs creator.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="75"/>was very near Blackfriars playhouse. See Stows Survey, 4to. 1618. p. 686.</p>
                  <p>No doubt there might be many signs of the <hi>Boars head,</hi> in and about London, besides that in East-cheap; but why need Shakspeare be at the trouble of carrying a sign from Blackfriars and hanging it up in Eastcheap, where, he must know, it existed already? If the <hi>Boars head</hi> were not the sign of the <hi>Boars head Tavern,</hi> in Eastcheap, let the editor tell us what it was. If it were not, Shakspeare might have looked long enough about Blackfriars playhouse before he had found either the <hi>Boars head</hi> or the <hi>Boars head Tavern.</hi> The sign which Stow mentions was a <hi>Beares head,</hi> and he speaks of it—not as hanging at the time he wrote, but—as having formerly been one of the signs of the stew-houses, which had been long suppressed, and which, every one knows, were not near Blackfriars playhouse.

                  <p>Mr. Steevens, from the MS. notes of Mr. Ed<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards,
<pb n="68" facs="79"/>having observed "that Shakspeare has varied from the truth of history, to introduce this scene be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween Mortimer and Richard Plantagenet," "a half-informed <hi>Remarker</hi> on this note" (they are the words of the gentle Edmond) "seems to think that he has totally over-turned it, by quoting the following pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sage from Hall's <hi>Chronicle:</hi> "During which par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liament [held in the third year of Henry VI. 1425.] came to London Peter Duke of Quimber,—which of the Duke of Exeter, &amp;c. was highly fested.—Du<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ring which season Edmond Mortymer, the last Erle of Marche of that name, (whiche long tyme had bene restrayned from hys liberty and finally waxed lame) disceased without yssue, whose inheritance descended to Lord Richard Plantagenet," &amp;c. as if a circumstance which Hall has mentioned to mark the <hi>time</hi> of Mortimer's death, necessarily ascertained the <hi>place</hi> where it happened also. The fact is, that this Edmund Mortimer did <hi>not</hi> die in London, but at Trim in Ireland." So far, so good.</p>
                  <p>This testy critic seems to smart so much from some corrections of that same "half-informed <hi>Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>marker,</hi>" that he may be readily allowed to avail him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self of every opportunity of abusing him, particularly where he happens to anticipate a quotation which an all-informed editor would have been glad to produce. The passage in Hall (and it is copyed by Hollinshed) would be sufficient, it was said, to justify Shakspeare "even if the fact were otherwise;" and
<pb n="69" facs="80"/>so it undoubtedly is, notwithstanding either the great learning or little scurrility of Edmond Malone. The historian does not, to be sure, expressly say that the Earl of March dyed in the <hi>Tower;</hi> but no person of common sense can think that he meant to relate an event which happened to a <hi>sound, free man</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as happening to a <hi>lame prisoner</hi> during the time a particular person was feasting in <hi>London.</hi> In fact, he <hi>does</hi> say that this nobleman <hi>dyed in prison,</hi> and that by such prison he meant either the <hi>Tower,</hi> or some place of confinement at no great distance, is almost certain, not only from the circumstance already mentioned, but from a passage in the pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceding part of his book, where he expressly tells us that "the Erle of Marche was euer <hi>kepte in the courte</hi> vnder such a keper that he could nether doo or attempte any thyng agaynste the king without his knowledge, and dyed without issue." If he did not mean the <hi>Tower,</hi> let Mr. Malone say what prison he did mean. To what purpose is it that the actual truth was otherwise? Our author had neither <hi>Ry<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mer,</hi> nor <hi>Dugdale,</hi> nor <hi>Sandford,</hi> to consult, and it cannot surely be expected that he should have gone to examine the record office: He naturally took for fact what he found in <hi>History,</hi> and if the historian were but <hi>half-informed,</hi> how could he help it? He was writing a play, not a chronicle. I know, much better, I am persuaded, than Mr. Malone, how little either Hall or Hollinshed is to be depended on in
<pb n="70" facs="81"/>matter of fact. Is the death of Edmond Mortimer of greater consequence than the intended marriage of lady Bona, or the capture, imprisonment and escape of K. Edward IV. both which are absolutely fabulous and without the slightest possible founda<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion. And why is not Shakspeare, who has adopted these two lying stories, charged with having in these instances "varyed from the truth of history?" The remark was natural enough to Mr. Edwards, who did not know what sort of histories our author con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sulted; neither indeed is the editors defence of it otherwise, being a pedantic parade of historical knowledge picked up for the occasion, to fasten Shakspeare with a charge which every one must think frivolous, and which he knew to be unjust.</p>

His oath," however, "is in record, and what his <hi>resolution</hi> was when he marched from London at the head of a large body of men, and sent the message abovestated to his son, it is not very difficult to conjecture."</p>
                  <p>A little superficial reading, and a consummate stock of assurance authorise this hypercritical com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mentator to abuse what he does not understand. The "anonymous Remarker," confidently if it must be, asserts that the scene in question, in which Ed<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward and Richard persuade their father to break his oath, had no foundation in history; and gives this reason for it, that, "neither the Earl of March nor Richard was then at Sandal; the latter being like<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wise a mere child, scarcely more than (if indeed so much as) nine years old:" in fact he was but just turned of eight. How, therefor, does the Irish edi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tor, with all his pitiful caviling and malignity, pick out from these words that York had never taken an oath? And, though he and Warwick did leave Lon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>don
<pb n="73" facs="84"/>with 5 or 6,000 men, and might send a message to his son to follow them, it was with the kings own authority, to suppress an insurrection against the established government: nor could either his attack<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, or his defending himself against, the queen or prince be any breach of his oath. So that the Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>markers assertion, however confident, is strictly true; which is more than this ingenuous Hibernian can always say of his own, which are at the same time very seldom distinguishable by diffidence.</p>
                  <p>It is not true that the queen and prince were at York, nor do we find from any good authority that they were sent to by the King. Though, if they had been sent to, and, instead of obeying the requisition, had employed themselves in raising a rebellion, it would have been perfectly consonant with the dukes oath and duty to have prevented or quelled it. But in fact, whatever concern the queen might have in the Yorkshire insurrection, she did not return from Scotland till after the battle of Wakefield.</p>

                  <p>The reason of Mr. Rowes changing <hi>years</hi> to <hi>months,</hi> and inserting <hi>weeks</hi> was not, as this equally superficial and blundering commentator imagines, purely on account of the measure, but because the king has already mentioned <hi>weeks</hi> and <hi>years,</hi> and af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terward enumerates <hi>months.</hi> These two curious dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>syllables it must be confessed, help the metre prodi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>giously: but, in fact, the editor should be expected to rehearse his text to the purchaser, as no one will ever be able to read it without his instructions.

He should rather have said, that it is so to his own: which indeed, I can as easily believe as pardon; since the gentleman unfortunately labours under a natural defect, to which whoever interpolated the word must have been also subject, though not in an equal degree. The ears of Shakspeare were formed very differently from Mr. Malones. Observe how smoothly the verse will run!

"This Remarker, however," he proceeds to relate, "<hi>after a feeble attempt at jocu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larity,</hi> and saying that he shall take no further notice of this editors <hi>see-saw conjectures,</hi> with <hi>great gra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vity</hi> proposes a comment evidently formed on the latter of them, as an original interpretation of <hi>his own,</hi> on which the reader may <hi>safely rely.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>Friend Butler somewhere tells us, there is no ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gument like matter of fact: we shall presently see who is the <hi>thief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the edition of 1778, the latter of this ingenious gentlemans "see-saw conjectures" is as follows: "The passage however may be explained thus:—<hi>His</hi> may refer to <hi>mine;</hi> as if he had said: Your master's confidence was above <hi>my masters;</hi> else surely <hi>his,</hi> i. e. the sum <hi>demanded from my master</hi> (for that is the last antecedent) had been equal to the sum <hi>demanded from yours.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Remark</hi> is: "Your master, it seems, had more confidence in lord Timon than mine, other<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wise, his (<hi>i. e.</hi> my masters) debt (<hi>i. e.</hi> the sum due to him from Timon) would, certainly, have been as great as your master (<hi>i. e.</hi> as the money which Timon owes
<pb n="92" facs="103"/>to your master); that is, my master, being as rich as yours, could and would have advanced Timon as large a sum as your master has advanced him, if he (<hi>i. e.</hi> my master) had thought it prudent to do so."</p>
                  <p>Very well: now comes "the true explication," which the editor says he "also formerly proposed;" an assertion, if he mean in the edition of 1778, which is evidently untrue. The reader may com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pare them.</p>
                  <p>"<hi>His</hi> may refer to <hi>mine.</hi> "It should seem that the confidential friendship subsisting between your master and Timon was greater than that subsisting between Timon and my master; else surely <hi>his</hi> sum, i. e. the sum <hi>borrowed</hi> from <hi>my</hi> master, [the last antecedent] had been as large as the sum <hi>borrowed</hi> from yours."</p>
                  <p>It must be perfectly clear, that the Remarker could not be indebted to a note which, so far as it is intelligible, seems diametrically opposite to his idea. It is equally so, that the editor has availed himself of the above "shallow" Remark, to vary the expres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion of his "see-saw conjecture," and give it a sense it would otherwise never have had.

                  <p>And, pray, what is all this to the signification of the word <hi>carnal?</hi> But it is natural enough for a <hi>feeble Remark</hi> to produce a <hi>pitiful cavil</hi> from a <hi>half-informed hypercritic.</hi>

This compliment cannot possibly be applyed to our editor, who always talks like himself; pretending to know every thing and knowing nothing. One would have thought that every fool knew that the <hi>lee</hi> side of a ship is that—not <hi>on</hi> which, but <hi>from</hi> which the wind blows. The editor has read in the
<pb n="99" facs="110"/>newspapers of a <hi>lee-shore,</hi> which would be there rightly interpreted, a shore <hi>on</hi> which the wind blows; but it is so termed in reference to the <hi>ship,</hi> as being a shore on its <hi>lee side.

                  <p>There is, I am persuaded, some misrepresentation as well as some ignorance in this note.

The <hi>Leet</hi> being a <hi>criminal court</hi> as well as a <hi>court of record</hi> never had, nor possibly could have, the slightest connection with the <hi>county court,</hi> which is neither the one nor the other, and consequently cannot have merged in it.

               <p>On this difficult passage our editor had one con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jecture which had luckily, it seems, escaped him when the play was printing, but he unfortunately recollected it in time for his appendix. It is that the word <hi>table</hi> is right, and the corrupted word <hi>and,</hi> which may have been misprinted for <hi>in;</hi> and thus then the passage will mean—"and his note was as sharp as a <hi>pen</hi> in a <hi>table</hi> of green fields." A <hi>pen</hi> may have been used for a <hi>pin-fold,</hi> and a table for a picture. The pointed stakes, he adds, of which pinfolds are sometimes formed were perhaps in the poets thoughts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Risum teneatis?</hi> If Shakspeare had had the pointed stakes of a pinfold in his minds eye he would have mentioned it, for though the <hi>stake</hi> may be sharp, the <hi>pinfold</hi> is not. But why waste a moment in the
<pb n="103" facs="114"/>consideration of such miserable nonsense? Whoever knew the word <hi>pen</hi> used for <hi>pinfold,</hi> or a pinfold placed amidst a parcel of green fields?

               <p>P. 495. "An anonymous writer," we are told, "supposes that by the words—<hi>keep close,</hi> Pistol means <hi>keep within doors.</hi> That this was not the meaning," it seems, "is proved decisively by the words of the quarto."</p>
               <p>That this is not the meaning in the quarto may be proved decisively by the words of that edition, but the meaning of the folio is to be ascertained by its own: so that the supposition may be right enough.</p>
               <p>Such are the observations which I have had to make upon this most sagacious of editors, and his unparalleled edition. I must not, however, be un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derstood to say that I have paid equal attention to all his absurdities. His pages abound with examples of <hi>profound ignorance, idle conjectures, crude actions, fee<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble attempts at jocularity, slender criticism, shallow, half-informed, fond, skill-less, tasteless</hi> and <hi>unfounded remarks,</hi> no less, or possibly much more, worthy of contempt and derision than those exposed in the present sheets. They can only, therefor, serve as a
<pb n="104" facs="115"/>hasty or imperfect sketch of what may be done by others; if indeed either Mr. Malone or his edition be intitled to any further notice. It will be easily seen that, in the course of this investigation, "I have en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deavoured, as much as possible, to avoid all contro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versy;" and Mr. Malone, I am sure, has too exalted an opinion of his peculiar merits, and too sovereign a contempt for those who dare call them in question, to permit that the serenity of his mind should suffer a moments discomposure by the appearance of an insignificant pamphlet; well knowing that "of such flimzy materials are many of the <hi>hyper-criticisms</hi> composed to which the labours of the editors and commentators on Shakspeare have given rise."</p>
