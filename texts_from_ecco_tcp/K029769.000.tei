            <p>THE CAPTIVES, A TRAGEDY; As Performed at the THEATRE-ROYAL, DRURY-LANE.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Captives</hi> are at length released from the theatre, where they have been confined for more than three months; and now they hope to find a sanctuary in the closet. It was the inten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of the author, throughout his piece, to make experiment of a style and diction, different from what are usual in modern Tragedy. Over-wrought ornaments, and pompous versification, he thought, ill suited to the manners of those early times, in which the action of his Tragedy is supposed to have passed. In a word, he was of opinion, that the language of simplicity would best accord with the subject and the characters: but whether a plain, intelligible, and unaffected style, would be acceptable to the public taste, was what he had still to learn. The experiment has been made; and the author retires with the satisfaction of having, at least, intended well.</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE,</head>
            <byline>By THOMAS VAUGHAN, Esq.</byline>
            <sp>
               <stage>The Speaker Mr. BANNISTER, jun. in the Character of a distressed and disappointed Poet, peeping in at the door, looks round the house.</stage>
               <l>ARE you all seated—may I venture in?</l>
               <stage>Noise behind.</stage>
               <l>Hush—be quiet—stop your unfriendly din—</l>
               <l>Whilst I—with more than common grief oppress'd,</l>
               <l>A tale unfold—just bursting from my breast.</l>
               <stage>Advancing, points to the Pit doors.</stage>
               <l>But first—are both your pit doors shut, I pray?</l>
               <l>Or noise will drown, my strictures on the play,</l>
               <stage>Noise from front boxes opening doors and calling places.</stage>
               <l>Do you hear—how very hard my case is—</l>
               <l>Instead of bravo, bravo—places—places— <stage>mimicking.</stage>
               </l>
               <l>Your seat, my Lord, is here—your La'ship's there,</l>
               <l>Indeed it quite distracts both bard and player.</l>
               <l>Truce then with your confounded clank of keys,</l>
               <l>And tell these fair disturbers of our ease,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>At church,</hi> perhaps, 'tis no such mighty crime,</l>
               <l>But <hi>here</hi>—quite vulgar to be out of time.</l>
               <stage>Noise from front boxes repeated.</stage>
               <l>Again—why sure the devil's in the clown,</l>
               <l>Do pray Sir Harry knock that fellow down.— <stage>pointing.</stage>
               </l>
               <l>And you, ye Gods—it were a dreadful shock,</l>
               <l>If thrown from thence—a Critic's head is rock.— <stage>the pit.</stage>
               </l>
               <l>So keep your centres, and my bus'ness know;</l>
               <l>I am a bard, as these my <hi>Acts</hi> will shew.</l>
               <stage>Pulling out plays from each coat pocket.</stage>
               <l>But then the managers—aye! there's the curse</l>
               <l>Which makes us <hi>patient bear</hi> the sad reverse,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="vi" facs="4"/>To hear, they've several pieces to peruse,</l>
               <l>And when I call, all answer they refuse?</l>
               <l>But say, is't fit, that mine be laid aside,</l>
               <l>To gratify their present author's pride?</l>
               <l>Who comes with nature, and such idle stuff,</l>
               <l>As please my friends above there well enough—</l>
               <stage>the galleries.</stage>
               <l>When I, more bold and daring, quit all rules,</l>
               <stage>In the pompous burlesque of Tragedy.</stage>
               <l>And scorn to draw from Classics and the Schools;</l>
               <l>But bid the dreadful surges from a grave,</l>
               <l>To sink the merchant "in the bankrupt wave."</l>
               <l>Or when I long for fair Aurora's light,</l>
               <l>"I am witch-ridden by the hag of night."</l>
               <l>Thus always keep <hi>sublimity</hi> in eye,</l>
               <l>And sometimes hand in hand—<hi>simplicity.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>New traps, new passages for ever raise,</l>
               <l>With starts and attitudes to gain your praise,</l>
               <l>Try every incident of trick and art,</l>
               <l>To mend, at once, the drama and the heart.</l>
               <l>Such is <hi>my</hi> style, and such each nervous line,</l>
               <l>Which all my friends who read pronounce divine;</l>
               <l>And yet these hostile doors their barriers keep,</l>
               <l>And all <hi>my</hi> labours—in my pockets sleep. <stage>Pointing to them.</stage>
               </l>
               <l>Revenge my cause, assert each critic right,</l>
               <l>And damn, with me, the author of to-night,</l>
               <l>Whose play, tho' yet <hi>unknown, untried, unseen,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Has felt in paragraphs an author's spleen.</l>
               <l>But hark!—I'll tell you a secret—'twas I,</l>
               <l>Who drew the shaft, and forg'd th' envenom'd lie,</l>
               <l>To crush this simple nature which he boasts,</l>
               <l>Drawn from the manners of the northern coasts;</l>
               <l>For should <hi>his</hi> hope your generous plaudits meet,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I</hi> shall be found aboard—the <hi>Lighter Fleet.</hi>
               </l>
               <stage>Advances forward and kneels.</stage>
               <l>Then hear a malefactor in blank verse,</l>
               <l>Nor be led <hi>captive,</hi> by his Gothick Erse,</l>
               <l>But urge my vengeance, in the cat-call's curse.</l>
               <stage>Going stops, and looks around the house.</stage>
               <l>
                  <pb n="vii" facs="5"/>Yet, hold; methinks my words seem lost in air,</l>
               <l>And smiles of candour for the bard declare;</l>
               <l>For here no <hi>secret influence</hi> e'er was known,</l>
               <l>But merit triumphs <hi>in herself alone</hi>
               </l>
               <l>As all who know ye, must in this agree,</l>
               <l>A British audience <hi>ever</hi> will be free.</l>

               <l>And Syren Muses tempted with a song;</l>
               <l>Fame, like another Circe, beck'ning stood,</l>
               <l>Waved her fair hand, and bade him brave the flood.</l>
               <l>Who could resist, when thus she shewed her charms,</l>
               <l>Soothed his fond hopes, and wooed him to her arms?</l>
               <l>Half-rigg'd, half mann'd, and leaky, as you find,</l>
               <l>He tricked his frigate out, and brav'd the wind.</l>
               <l>Your partial favour still may swell his sails,</l>
               <l>And fill his vessel with propitious gales;</l>
               <l>Though peppered with small shot, and tempest tossed,</l>
               <l>You still may land him on this golden coast;</l>
               <l>Convinced that those the surest path pursue,</l>
               <l>Who trust their <hi>all</hi> to candour and to you.</l>
