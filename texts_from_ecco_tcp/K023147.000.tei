            <head>INTRODUCTION
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IN the Reign of Queen ANNE,
(which notwithstanding those
happy Times which succeeded,
every Englishman may remem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber)
thou may'st possibly, gentle
Reader, have seen a certain Ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nerable
Person who frequented
the Outside of the Palace of St.
James's, and who by the Gravity
of his Deportment and Habit,
was generally taken for a decay'd
Gentleman of Spain. His stature
was tall, his visage long, his
complexion olive, his brows were
<pb n="2" facs="3"/>
black and even, his eyes hollow
yet piercing, his nose inclin'd to
Aquiline, his beard neglected and
mix'd with grey: All this con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tributed
to spread a solemn Me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lancholy
over his countenance.
Pythagoras was not more silent,
Pyrrho more motionless, nor
Zeno more austere. His Wig
was as black and smooth as the
plumes of a Raven, and hung
as strait as the hair of a River-God
rising from the water. His
Cloak so compleatly covered his
whole person, that whether or
no he had any other cloaths
(much less any linnen) under it,
I shall not say; but his sword
appear'd a full yard behind him,
and his manner of wearing it
was so stiff, that it seem'd grown
to his Thigh. his whole figure
<pb n="3" facs="4"/>
was so utterly unlike any thing of
this world, that it was not na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tural
for any man to ask him a
question without blessing himself
first, Those who never saw a
<hi>Jesuit,</hi> took him for one, and
others believed him some <hi>High
Priest of the Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But under this macerated form
was conceal'd a Mind replete
with Science, burning with a
Zeal of benefiting his fellow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>creatures,
and filled with an
honest conscious Pride, mix'd
with a scorn of doing or suffering
the least thing beneath the dig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity
of a Philosopher. Accord<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ingly
he had a soul that would
not let him accept of any offers
of Charity, at the same time
that his body seem'd but too
much to require it. His lodging
<pb n="4" facs="5"/>
was in a small chamber up four
pair of stairs, where he regularly
payed for what he had when he
eat or drank, and he was often
observed wholly to abstain from
both. He declin'd speaking to
any one, except the Queen, or
her first Minister, to whom he
attempted to make some appli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cations;
but his real business or
intentions were utterly unknown
to all men. Thus much is cer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain,
that he was obnoxious to
the Queen's Ministry; who either
out of Jealousy or Envy, had
him spirited away, and carried
abroad as a dangerous person,
without any regard to the known
Laws of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>One day, as this Gentleman
was walking about dinner-time
alone in the Mall, it happen'd
<pb n="5" facs="6"/>
that a Manuscript dropt from
under his cloak, which my ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vant
pick'd up, and brought to
me. It was written in the Latin
tongue, and contain'd many
most profound Secrets, in an
unusual turn of reasoning and
style. The first leaf was inscri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bed
with these words, <hi>Codicillus,
seú Liber Memorialis, Martini
Scribleri.</hi> The Book was of so
wonderful a nature, that it is in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>credible
what a desire I conceiv'd
that moment to be acquainted
with the Author, who I clearly
perceiv'd was some great Philoso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pher
in disguise. I several times
endeavour'd to speak to him,
which he as often industriously
avoided. At length I found an
opportunity (as he stood under
the Piazza by the Dancing-room
<pb n="6" facs="7"/>
in St. James's) to acquaint him
in the Latin tongue, that his
Manuscript was fallen into my
hands: and saying this, I pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sented
it to him, with great En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>comiums
on the learned Author.
Hereupon he took me aside,
survey'd me over with a fix'd
attention, and opening the clasps
of the Parchment cover, spoke
(to my great surprize) in English,
as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">" Courteous stranger, who<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever
thou art, I embrace thee
as my best friend; for either
the Stars and my Art are de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceitful,
or the destin'd time
is come which is to manifest
Martinus Scriblerus to the
world, and thou the person
chosen by fate for this task.
What thou seest in me is a
<pb n="7" facs="8"/>
body exhausted by the labours
of the mind. I have found
in Dame Nature not indeed an
unkind, but a very coy Mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tress:
Watchful nights, anxi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous
days, slender meals, and
endless labours, must be the
lot of all who pursue her,
through her labyrinths and
meanders. My first vital air
I drew in this Island (a soil
fruitful of Philosophers) but
my complexion is become
adust, and my body arid, by
visiting lands (as the Poet has
it) <hi>alio sub sole calentes.</hi> I
have, through my whole life,
passed under several disguises
and unknown names, to skreen
my self from the envy and
malice which mankind ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>press
against those who are
<pb n="8" facs="9"/>
possessed of the <hi>Arcanum
Magnum.</hi> But at present I
am forc'd to take Sanctuary
in the British Court, to avoid
the Revenge of a cruel Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niard
who has pursued me al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most
through the whole ter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>raqueous
globe. Being about
four years ago in the City of
Madrid in quest of natural
knowledge, I was informed
of a Lady who was marked
with a Pomegranate upon the
inside of her right Thigh,
which blossom'd, and, as it
were, seem'd to ripen in the
due season. Forthwith was
I possessed with an insatiable
curiosity to view this wonder<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful
Phaenomenon. I felt the
ardour of my passion encrease
as the season advanced, till in
<pb n="9" facs="10"/>
the month of July I could no
longer contain. I bribed her
Duenna, was admitted to the
Bath, saw her undress'd, and
the wonder display'd. This
was soon after discovered by
the husband, who finding
some letters I had writ to the
Duenna, containing expres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions
of a doubtful meaning,
suspected me of a crime most
alien from the Purity of my
Thoughts. Incontinently I
left Madrid by the advice of
friends, have been pursued,
dogg'd, and way-laid through
several Nations, and even now
scarce think my self secure
within the sacred walls of this
Palace. It has been my good
fortune to have seen all the
grand Phaenomena of Nature,
<pb n="10" facs="11"/>
excepting an Earthquake, which
I waited for in Naples three
years in vain; and now by
means of some British Ship
(whose Colours no Spaniard
dares approach) I impatiently
expect, a safe passage to Ja<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>maica,
for that benefit. To
thee my Friend, whom Fate
has marked for my Historio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>grapher,
I leave these my
Commentaries, and others of
my works, No more—be
faithful and impartial."</q>
            </p>
            <p>He soon after performed his
promise, and left me the Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mentaries,
giving me also further
lights by many Conferences; when
he was unfortunately snatch'd
away (as I before related) by the
jealousy of the Queen's Ministry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="12"/>
Tho' I was thus to my eternal
grief depriv'd of his conversation,
he for some years continued his
Correspondence, and communi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cated
to me many of his Projects
for the benefit of mankind. He
sent me some of his Writings, and
recommended to my care the
recovery of others, straggling a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bout
the world, and assumed by
other men. The last time I heard
from him was on occasion of his
Strictures on the Dunciad: since
when, several years being elaps'd,
I have reason to believe this ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cellent
Person is either dead, or
carry'd by his vehement thirst of
knowledge into some remote, or
perhaps undiscover'd Region of
the world. In either case, I think
it a debt no longer to be delay'd,
to reveal what I know of this
<pb n="12" facs="13"/>
Prodigy of Science, and to give
the History of his life, and of his
extensive merits to mankind; in
which I dare promise the Reader,
that whenever he begins to think
any one Chapter dull, the style
will be immediately changed in
the next.</p>

how he was begot, what Care was
taken of him before he was born, and
what Prodigies attended his Birth.</head>
            <p>IN the City of Munster in Germany,
lived a grave and learned Gentle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man,
by Profession an Antiquary; who
among all his invaluable Curiosities,
esteemed none more highly, than a Skin
of the true Pergamenian Parchment,
which hung at the upper-end of his
hall. On this was curiously traced the
ancient Pedigree of the <hi>Scribleri,</hi> with
all their Alliances and collateral Relati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons
<pb n="2" facs="15"/>
(among which were reckon'd Alber<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tus
Magnus, Paracelsus Bombastus, and
the famous Scaligers in old time Princes
of Verona) and deduced even from the
Times of the Elder Pliny to Cornelius
Scriblerus: For such was the name of
this venerable Personage; whose glory
it was, that by the singular Virtue of
the Women, not one had a Head of a
different Cast from his family.</p>
            <p>His wife was a Lady of singular
beauty, whom not for that reason only
he espoused, but because she was un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doubted
daughter either of the great
Scriverius, or of Gaspar Barthius. It
happen'd on a time, the said Gaspar
made a visit to Scriverius at Harlem,
taking with him a comely Lady of his
acquaintance who was skilful in the
Greek Tongue, of whom the learned
Scriverius became so enamour'd, as to
inebriate his friend, and be familiar
with his Mistress. I am not ignorant
of what <note place="bottom" n="*">Columesius relates this from Isaac Vossius, in his Opuscul. p. 102.</note>Columesius affirms, that the
<pb n="3" facs="16"/>
learned Barthius was not so overtaken
but he perceiv'd it; and in Revenge
suffer'd this unfortunate Gentlewoman
to be drowned in the Rhine at her re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn.
But Mrs. Scriblerus (the issue
of that Amour) was a living proof of
the falsehood of this Report. Dr. Cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nelius
was further induced to his mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riage,
from the certain information that
the aforesaid Lady, the mother of his
wife, was related to Cardan on the fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther's
side, and to Aldrovandus on the
mother's: Besides which, her Ances<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tors
had been professors of Physick,
Astrology, or Chymistry, in German
Universities, from generation to gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ration.</p>
            <p>With this fair Gentlewoman had our
Doctor lived in a comfortable Union
for about ten years: But this our sober
and orderly pair, without any natural
infirmity, and with a constant and fre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quent
compliance to the chief duty of
conjugal life, were yet unhappy, in that
Heaven had not blessed them with any
issue. This was the utmost grief to
the good man; especially considering
<pb n="4" facs="17"/>
what exact Precautions and Methods
he had used to procure that Blessing:
for he never had cohabitation with his
spouse, but he ponder'd on the Rules of
the Ancients, for the generation of
Children of Wit. He ordered his diet
according to the prescription of Galen,
confining himself and his wife for al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most
the whole first year to <note place="bottom" n="†">Galen Lib. de Cibis boni &amp; mali succi. cap. 3.</note>Goat's
Milk and Honey. It unfortunately
befel her, when she was about four
months gone with child, to long for
somewhat which that author inveighs
against, as prejudicial to the understand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
of the Infant: This her husband
thought fit to deny her, affirming, it
was better to be childless, than to be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>come
the Parent of a Fool. His Wife
miscarried; but as the Abortion proved
only a female Faetus, he comforted
himself, that had it arrived to perfecti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on,
it would not have answer'd his ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count;
his heart being wholly fixed
upon the learned Sex. However he
<pb n="5" facs="18"/>
disdained not to treasure up the Em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bryo
in a Vial, among the curiosities of
his family.</p>
            <p>Having discovered that Galen's pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scription
could not determine the sex,
he forthwith betook himself to Ari<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stotle.
Accordingly he with-held the
nuptial embrace when the wind was
in any point of the South; this <note place="bottom" n="‖">Arist. 14. Sect. Prob. 5.</note> Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thor
asserting that the grossness and
moisture of the southerly winds occasi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
the procreation of females, and not
of males. But he redoubled his dili<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gence
when the wind was at West, a
wind on which that great Philosopher
bestowed the Encomiums of Fatner of
the earth, Breath of the Elysian Fields,
and other glorious Elogies. For our
learned man was clearly of opinion, that
the Semina out of which Animals are
produced, are Animalcula ready form<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed,
and received in with the Air.<note place="bottom" n="†">Religion of Nature, Sect. 5. Parag. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Under these regulations, his wife, to
his unexpressible joy, grew pregnant a
<pb n="6" facs="19"/>
second time; and, (what was no small
addition to his happiness) he just then
came to the possession of a considerable
Estate by the death of her Uncle, a
wealthy Jew who resided at London.
This made it necessary for him to take
a journey to England; nor would the
care of his posterity let him suffer his
Wife to remain behind him. During
the voyage, he was perpetually taken
up on the one hand, how to employ his
great Riches; and on the other, how
to educate his Child. He had already
determin'd to set apart several annual
Sums, for the recovery of <hi>Manuscripts,</hi>
the effosson of <hi>Coins,</hi> the procuring of
<hi>Mummies</hi>; and for all those curious dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>coveries
by which he hoped to become
(as himself was wont to say) a second
<hi>Peireskius.</hi> He had already chalked
out all possible schemes for the improve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
of a male child, yet was so far
prepar'd for the worst that could hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pen,
that before the nine months were
expired, he had composed two Trea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tises
of Education; the one he called
<pb n="7" facs="20"/>
               <hi>A Daughter's Mirrour,</hi> and the other
<hi>A Son's Monitor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is all we can find relating to
Martinus, while he was in his Mother's
womb, excepting that he was enter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tained
there with a Consort of Musick
once in twenty four hours, according to
the Custom of the Magi: and that on
a <note place="bottom" n="‖">Ramsey's Cyrus.</note> particular day, he was observed to
leap and kick exceedingly, which was
on the first of April, the birth-day of
the great <hi>Basilius Valentinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Truth of this, and every pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceding
Fact, may be depended upon,
being taken literally from the Memoirs.
But I must be so ingenuous as to own,
that the Accounts are not so certain of
the exact time and place of his birth.
As to the first, he had the common
frailty of old men, to conceal his age:
as to the second, I only remember to
have heard him say, that he first saw
the light in St. Giles's Parish. But in
the investigation of this point, Fortune
hath favoured our diligence. For one
<pb n="8" facs="21"/>
day as I was passing by the <hi>Seven Dials,</hi>
I overheard a dispute concerning the
place of Nativity of a great Astrologer,
which each man alledged to have been
in his own street. The circumstances
of the time, and the description of the
person, made me imagine it might be
that universal Genius whose life I am
writing. I returned home, and having
maturely considered their several argu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments,
which I found to be of equal
weight, I quieted my curiosity with
this natural conclusion, that he was born
in some point common to all the seven
streets; which must be that on which
the Column is now erected. And it is
with infinite pleasure that I since find
my Conjecture confirmed, by the fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowing
passage in the Codicil to Mr.
Neale's Will.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">
                  <hi>I appoint my Executors to engrave the
following Inscription on the Column in the
Center of the seven Streets which I erec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted.</hi> 
                  <q>LOC. NAT. INCLUT. PHI<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>LOS.
MAR. SCR.</q>
               </q>
               <pb n="9" facs="22"/>
But Mr. Neale's Order was never per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formed,
because the Executors durst
not administer.</p>
            <p>Nor was the Birth of this great man
unattended with Prodigies: He him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self
has often told me, that on the night
before he was born, Mrs. Scriblerus
dream'd she was brought to bed of a
huge <hi>Ink-horn,</hi> out of which issued
several large streams of Ink, as it had
been a fountain. This dream was by
her husband thought to signify, that the
child should prove a very voluminous
Writer. Likewise a <note place="bottom" n="*">Virgil's Laurel Donat.</note>
               <hi>Crab-tree</hi> that
had been hitherto barren, appeared on
a sudden laden with a vast quantity of
Crabs: This sign also the old gentle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man
imagined to be a prognostic of the
acuteness of his Wit. A great swarm
of <note place="bottom" n="†">Plato, Lucan, &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>Wasps</hi> play'd round his Cradle
without hurting him, but were very
troublesome to all in the room besides:
This seemed a certain presage of the ef<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fects
of his Satire. A Dunghill was
<pb n="10" facs="23"/>
seen within the space of one night to be
covered all over with <hi>Mushroom:</hi> This
some interpreted to promise the infant
great fertility of fancy, but no long
duration to his works: but the Father
was of another opinion.</p>
            <p>But what was of all most wonderful,
was a thing that seemed a monstrous
<hi>Fowl,</hi> which just then dropt through
the sky-light, near his wife's apartment.
It had a large body, two little dispro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>portioned
wings, a prodigious tail, but
no head. As its colour was white, he
took it at first sight for a Swan, and
was concluding his son would be a
Poet: but on a nearer view, he pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceived
it to be speckled with black, in
the form of letters; and that it was in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed
a Paper kite which had broke its
leash by the impetuosity of the wind.
His back was armed with the Art
Military, his belly was filled with Phy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sick,
his wings were the wings of Quarles
and Withers, the several Nodes of his
voluminous tail were diversify'd with
several branches of Science; where the
Doctor beheld with great joy a knot of
<pb n="11" facs="24"/>
Logick, a knot of Metaphysick, a knot
of Casuistry, a knot of Polemical Divi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity,
and a knot of Common Law, with
a <hi>Lanthorn</hi> of <hi>Jacob Behmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There went a Report in the family,
that as soon as he was born he uttered
the voice of nine several animals: he
cry'd like a Calf, bleated like a Sheep,
chattered like a Mag-pye, grunted like
a Hog, neighed like a Foal, croaked
like a Raven, mewed like a Cat, gab<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bled
like a Goose, and bray'd like an
Ass. And the next morning he was
found playing in his bed with two
Owls, which came down the chimney.
His Father greatly rejoyced at all these
signs, which betokened the variety of
his Eloquence, and the extent of his
Learning; but he was more particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larly
pleased with the last, as it nearly
resembled what happen'd at the birth
of <note place="bottom" n="*">Vid. Eustat. in Odyss. l. 12. ex Alex. Pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phio. &amp; Leo. Allat. de patr. Hom. pag. 45.</note>Homer.</p>

            <p>NO sooner was the cry of the In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fant
heard, but the old gentle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man
rushed into the Room, and snatch<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
it in his arms, examin'd every limb
with attention. He was infinitely
pleas'd to find, that the Child had the
Wart of Cicero, the wry Neck of Alex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ander,
knots upon his legs like Marius,
and one of them shorter than the other
like Agesilaus. The good Cornelius
also hoped he would come to stammer
like Demosthenes, in order to be as elo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quent;
and in time arrive at many o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
Defects of famous men. He held
the child so long, that the Midwife
grown out of all patience, snatch'd it
from his arms, in order to swaddle it.
<q rend="inline">' Swaddle him? (quoth he) far be it

to manacle and shackle him hand
and foot? Is this what you call to be
free-born? If you have no regard to
his natural Liberty, at least have some
to his natural Faculties. Behold
with what agility he spreadeth his
Toes, and moveth them with as great
variety as his Fingers! a power,
which in the small circle of a year
may be totally abolish'd, by the e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>normous

animals turn with great advantage to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards
the sonorous object) may, by
the ministry of some accursed Nurse,
for ever lye flat and immoveable.

all this while fretting at her husband's
discourse, at last broke out to this pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose.
<q rend="inline">' My dear, I have had many dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>putes
with you upon this subject be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore
I was a month gone: We have
but one child, and can not afford to
throw him away upon experiments.
I'll have my boy bred up like other
gentlemen, at home, and always un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der
my own eye."</q> All the Gossips
with one voice, cry'd, Ay, ay; but
Cornelius broke out in this manner.
<q rend="inline">' What, bred at home? Have I taken
all this pains for a creature that is to
lead the inglorious life of a Cabbage,
to suck the nutritious juices from the
spot where he was first planted? No;
to perambulate this terraqueous Globe
is too small a Range; were it per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mitted,
he should at least make the
Tour of the whole System of the Sun.
Let other Mortals pore upon Maps,
and swallow the legends of lying tra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vellers;
the son of Cornelius shall
make his own Legs his Compasses;
with those he shall measure Conti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nents,
<pb n="15" facs="28"/>
Islands, Capes, Bays, Streights,
and Isthmus's: He shall himself
take the altitude of the highest moun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tains,
from the piek of Derby to the

the top of Taurus, Imaus, Cau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>casus,
and the famous Ararat where
Noah's Ark first moor'd, he may take
a flight view of the snowy Riphaeans;
nor would I have him neglect Athos
and Olympus, renowned for poetical
fictions. Those that vomit fire will
deserve a more particular attention:
I will therefore have him observe
with great care Vesuvius, Aetna, the
burning mountain of Java, but chiefly
Hecla the greatest rarity in the Nor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thern
Regions. Then he may like<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wise
contemplate the wonders of the
Mephitick cave. When he has div'd
into the bowels of the earth, and sur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vey'd
the works of Nature under
ground, and instructed himself fully
in the nature of Vulcanos, Earth<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quakes,
Thunders, Tempests and
Hurricanes, I hope he will bless the
world with a more exact survey of
<pb n="16" facs="29"/>
the deserts of Arabia and Tartary,
than as yet we are able to obtain:
Then will I have him cross the seven
Gulphs, measure the currents in the
fifteen famous Streights, and search
for those fountains of fresh water that
are at the bottom of the Ocean."</q>—At these last words Mrs. Scriblerus fell
into a trembling: the description of
this terrible Scene made too violent an
impression upon a woman in her con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dition,
and threw her into a strong hys<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>teric

            <head>Shewing what befel the Doctor's Son
and his Shield, on the Day of the
Christ'ning.</head>
            <p>THE day of the Christ'ning be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
come, and the house filled
with Gossips, the Levity of whose Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versation
<pb n="17" facs="30"/>
suited but ill with the Gra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vity
of Dr. Cornelius, he cast about
how to pass this day more agreeably
to his Character; that is to say, not
without some <hi>Profitable Conference,</hi> nor
wholly without observance of some
<hi>Ancient Custom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He remembred to have read in The<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ocritus,
that the Cradle of Hercules was
a Shield; and being possess'd of an an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tique
<hi>Buckler</hi> which he held as a most
inestimable Relick, he determined to
have the infant laid therein, and in
that manner brought into the Study,
to be shown to certain learned men of
his acquaintance.</p>
            <p>The regard he had for this Shield,
had caused him formerly to compile a
Dissertation concerning it, proving
from the several properties, and parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cularly
the colour of the Rust, the ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>act
chronology thereof.</p>
            <p>With this Treatise, and a moderate
supper, he proposed to entertain his
Guests; tho' he had also another de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sign,
to have their assistance in the cal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culation
of his Son's <hi>Nativity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="31"/>
He therefore took the Buckler out
of a Case (in which he always kept it
least it might contract any modern
rust), and entrusted it to his House<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>maid,
with orders, that when the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pany
was come she should lay the
Child carefully in it, cover'd with a
mantle of blue Sattin.</p>
            <p>The Guests were no sooner seated,
but they entered into a warm Debate
about the <hi>Triclinium</hi> and the manner
of <hi>Decubitus</hi> of the Ancients, which
Cornelius broke off in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This day, my Friends, I purpose to ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hibit
my son before you; a Child not
wholly unworthy of Inspection, as he is
descended from a Race of Virtuosi. Let
the Phisiognomists examine his features;
let the Chirographists behold his Palm;
but above all let us consult for the cal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culation
of his Nativity. To this end,
as the child is not vulgar, I will not pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent
him unto you in a vulgar manner.
He shall be cradled in my Ancient Shield,
so famous through the Universities of
Europe. You all know how I purchas'd
that invaluable piece of Antiquity at the</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="32"/>
               <hi>great (though indeed inadequate) expence
of all the Plate of our family, how hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pily
I carry'd it off, and how trium<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phantly
I transported it hither, to the
inexpressible grief of all Germany. Hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>py
in every circumstance, but that it broke
the heart of the great Melchior Insipi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dus!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he stopp'd his Speech, upon
sight of the Maid, who enter'd the
room with the Child: He took it in
his arms and proceeded:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold then my Child, but first behold
the Shield: Behold this Rust,—or
rather let me call it this precious Aerugo,—behold
this beautiful Varnish of
Time,—this venerable Verdure of
so many Ages—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In speaking these words, he slowly
lifted up the Mantle, which cover'd it,
inch by inch; but at every inch he un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>covered,
his cheeks grew paler, his hand
trembled, his nerves failed, till on sight
of the whole the Tremor became uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versal:
The Shield and the Infant both
dropt to the ground, and he had only
<pb n="20" facs="33"/>
strength enough to cry out, <hi>O God!
my Shield, my Shield!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Truth was, the Maid (extream<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly
concern'd for the reputation of her
own cleanliness, and her young master's
honour) had scoured it as clean as her
Andirons.</p>
            <p>Cornelius sunk back on a chair, the
Guests stood astonished, the infant
squawl'd, the maid ran in, snatch'd it
up again in her arms, flew into her mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tresses
room, and told what had hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pen'd.
Down stairs in an instant hur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ried
all the Gossips, where they found
the Doctor in a Trance: Hungary wa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter,
Hartshorn, and the confus'd noise
of shrill voices, at length awaken'd
him: when opening his eyes, he saw
the Shield in the hands of the House<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>maid.
<hi>O Woman! Woman! he cry'd
(and snatch'd it violently from her) was
it to thy ignorance that this Relick owes
its ruin? where, where is the beautiful
Crust that cover'd thee so long? where
those Traces of Time, and</hi> Fingers <hi>as it
were of Antiquity? Where all those beau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tiful
obscurities, the cause of much de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lightful</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="34"/>
               <hi>disputation, where doubt and
curiosity went hand in hand and eternal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly
exercised the speculations of the learn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed?
All this the rude Touch of an igno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rant
woman hath done away! The</hi> curi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous
Prominence <hi>at the belly of that
figure, which some taking for the</hi> Cus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pis
<hi>of a sword, denominated a Roman
Soldier; others accounting the</hi> Insignia
Virilia<hi>, pronounc'd to be one of the</hi> Dii
Termini<hi>; behold she hath cleaned it in
like shameful sort, and shown to be the
head of a Nail. O my Shield! my
Shield! well may I say with Horace,</hi>
non bene relicta Parmula.</p>
            <p>The Gossips, not at all inquiring in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to
the cause of his sorrow, only asked
if the Child had no hurt? and cry'd,
<hi>Come, come, all is well; what has the
woman done but her duty? a tight clean<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly
wench I warrant her; what a stir a
man makes about a</hi> Bason<hi>, that an hour

               <pb n="22" facs="35"/>
               <hi>broke off.</hi> The learned Gentlemen,
who till now had stood speechless, here<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>upon
looking narrowly on the Shield,
declar'd their Assent to this latter opi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nion;
and desir'd Cornelius to be com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>forted,
assuring him it was a <hi>Sconce</hi> and
no other. But this, instead of com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>forting,
threw the Doctor into such a
violent Fit of passion, that he was car<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ried
off groaning and speechless to bed;
where, being quite spent, he fell into
a kind of slumber.</p>

            <head>Of the Suction and Nutrition of the
Great <hi>Scriblerus</hi> in his Infancy, and
of the first Rudiments of his Learn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing.</head>
            <p>AS soon as Cornelius awaked, he
rais'd himself on his elbow, and
casting his eye on Mrs. Scriblerus,
spoke as follows. <hi>Wisely was it said
by Homer, that in the Cellar of Jupiter
are two barrels, the one of good, the other</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="36"/>
               <hi>of evil, which he never bestows on mortals
separately, but constantly mingles them
together. Thus at the same time hath
Heav'n bless'd me with the birth of a
Son, and afflicted me with the scouring
of my Shield. Yet let us not repine at
his Dispensations, who gives and who
takes away; but rather join in prayer,
that the Rust of Antiquity which he hath
been pleas'd to take from my Shield, may
be added to my Son; and that so much
of it as it is my purpose he shall contract
in his Education, may never be destroy'd
by any Modern Polishing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He cou'd no longer bear the sight
of the Shield, but order'd it should be
remov'd for ever from his eyes. It
was not long after purchas'd by Dr.
Woodward, who, by the assistance of
Mr. Kemp incrusted it with a new
Rust, and is the same whereof a Cut
hath been engraved, and exhibited to
the great Contentation of the learned.</p>
            <p>Cornelius now began to regulate the
Suction of his Child. Seldom did there
pass a day without disputes between
him and the Mother, or the Nurse,
<pb n="24" facs="37"/>
concerning the nature of Aliment.
The poor woman never dined but he
denied her some dish or other, which
he judg'd prejudicial to her milk. One
day she had a longing desire to a piece
of beef, and as she stretch'd her hand
towards it, the old gentleman drew it
away, and spoke to this effect. <hi>Had'st
thou read the Ancients, O Nurse, thou
would'st prefer the welfare of the Infant
which thou nourishest, to the indulging
of an irregular and voracious Appetite.
Beef, it is true, may confer a Robustness
on the limbs of my son, but will hebetate
and clogg his Intellectuals.</hi> While he
spoke this, the Nurse look'd upon him
with much anger, and now and then
cast a wishful eye upon the Beef—<hi>Passion (continu'd the Doctor, still hold<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
the dish) throws the mind into too
violent a fermentation; it is a kind of
Fever of the soul, or, as Horace expresses
it, a</hi> Short Madness. <hi>Consider Woman,
that this day's Suction of my son may
cause him to imbibe many ungovernable
Passions, and in a manner spoil him for
the temper of a Philosopher. Romulus</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="38"/>
               <hi>by sucking a Wolf, became of a fierce and
savage disposition; and were I to breed
some Ottoman Emperor or Founder of a
Military Commonwealth, perhaps I might
indulge thee in this carnivorous Appetite.</hi>—What,
interrupted the Nurse, Beef
spoil the understanding? that's fine in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed—how
then could our Parson
preach as he does upon Beef, and Pud<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ding
too, if you go to that? Don't tell
me of your Ancients, had not you al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most
kill'd the poor babe with a dish
of Daemonial black Broth?—<hi>Lacede<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monian
black Broth, thou would'st say,
(reply'd Cornelius) but I cannot allow
the surfeit to have been occasioned by that
diet, since it was recommended by the
Divine Lycurgus. No, Nurse, thou
must certainly have eaten some meats of
ill digestion the day before, and that was
the real cause of his disorder. Consider
Woman, the different Temperaments of
different Nations: What makes the
English Phlegmatick and melancholy but
Beef? what renders the Welch so hot
and cholerick, but cheese and leeks? the
French derive their levity from their</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="39"/>
               <hi>Soups, Frogs, and Mushrooms: I would
not let my Son dine like an Italian, lest
like an Italian he should be jealous and
revengeful: The warm and solid diet of
Spain may be more beneficial, as it might
indue him with a profound Gravity, but
at the same time he might suck in with
their food their intolerable Vice of Pride.
Therefore Nurse, in short, I hold it re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quisite
to deny you at present, not only Beef,
but likewise whatsoever any of those Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
eat.</hi> During this speech, the
Nurse remain'd pouting and marking
her plate with the knife, nor would
she touch a bit during the whole din<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner.
This the old Gentleman obser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ving,
order'd that the Child, to avoid
the risque of imbibing ill humours,
should be kept from her breast all that
day, and be fed with Butter mix'd
with Honey, according to a Prescripti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
he had met with somewhere in
Eustathius upon Homer. This in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed
gave the Child a great looseness,
but he was not concern'd at it, in the
opinion that whatever harm it might
do his body, would be amply recom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>penced
<pb n="27" facs="40"/>
by the improvements of his un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derstanding.
But from thenceforth
he insisted every day upon a particular
Diet to be observed by the Nurse; un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der
which having been long uneasy,
she at last parted from the family, on
his ordering her for dinner the <hi>Paps</hi> of
a <hi>Sow</hi> with Pig; taking it as the high<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>est
indignity, and a direct Insult upon
her Sex and Calling.</p>
            <p>Four years of young Martin's life
pass'd away in squabbles of this nature.
Mrs. Scriblerus consider'd it was now
time to instruct him in the fundamen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tals
of Religion, and to that end took
no small pains in teaching him his <hi>Cate<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chism:</hi>
But Cornelius look'd upon this
as a tedious way of Instruction, and
therefore employ'd his head to find out
more pleasing methods, the better to
induce him to be fond of learning.
He would frequently carry him to the
<hi>Puppet-show,</hi> of the Creation of the
world, where the Child with exceeding
delight gain'd a notion of the History
of the Bible. His first rudiments in
profane history were acquired by see<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="41"/>
of <hi>Raree-shows,</hi> where he was
brought acquainted with all the Princes
of Europe. In short the old Gentle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man
so contriv'd it, to make every
thing contribute to the improvement
of his knowledge, even to his very
Dress. He invented for him a Geo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>graphical
suit of cloaths, which might
give him some hints of that Science,
and likewise some knowledge of the
Commerce of different Nations. He
had a French Hat with an African
Feather, Holland Shirts and Flanders
Lace, English Cloth lin'd with Indian
Silk, his Gloves were Italian, and his
Shoes were Spanish: He was made to
observe this, and daily catechis'd there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>upon,
which his Father was wont to
call <hi>Travelling at home.</hi> He never
gave him a Fig or an Orange but he
obliged him to give an account from
what Country it came. In Natural
history he was much assisted by his
Curiosity in <hi>Sign-Posts,</hi> insomuch that
he hath often confess'd he owed to
them the knowledge of many Creatures
which he never found since in any Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thor,
<pb n="29" facs="42"/>
such as White Lions, Golden

found them mention'd by Kercherus,

of all these Improvements, a stop was
put to his learning the <hi>Alphabet,</hi> nor
would he let him proceed to Letter D,
till he could truly and distinctly pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nounce
C in the ancient manner, at
which the Child unhappily boggled for
near three months. He was also o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blig'd
to delay his learning to <hi>write,</hi>
having turn'd away the Writing Master
because he knew nothing of Fabius's
Waxen Tables.</p>

Cornelius having read, and seriously
weigh'd the methods by which the fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mous
Montaigne was educated, and re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>solving
in some degree to exceed them,
resolv'd he should speak and learn no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing
but the learned Languages, and
especially the Greek; in which he
constantly eat and drank, according to
Homer. But what most conduced to
his easy attainment of this Language,
was his love of Ginger-bread; which
his Father observing, caused it to be
stampt with the Letters of the Greek
Alphabet; and the child the very first
day eat as far as Iota. By this parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cular
application to this language above
the rest, he attain'd so great a profi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cience
therein, that Gronovius inge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nuously
confesses he durst not confer
with this child in Greek at eight years
old; and at fourteen he composed a
Tragedy in the same language, as the
younger <note place="bottom" n="*">Plin. Epist. Lib. 7.</note>Pliny had done before him.</p>
            <p>He learn'd the Oriental Languages
of Erpenius who resided some time
<pb n="31" facs="44"/>
with his father for that purpose. He
had so early a Relish for the Eastern
way of writing, that even at this time
he composed (in imitation of it) the
<hi>Thousand and One Arabian Tales,</hi> and
also the <hi>Persian Tales,</hi> which have been
since translated into several languages,
and lately into our own with particular
elegance, by Mr. Ambrose Philips. In
this work of his Childhood, he was
not a little assisted by the historical

            <head>A Dissertation upon Play-things.</head>
            <p>HERE follow the Instructions
of Cornelius Scriblerus concern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
the Plays and Play-things to be
used by his son Martin.</p>
            <q rend="inline">
               <p>' <hi>Play</hi> was invented by the <hi>Lydians</hi>
as a remedy against <hi>Hunger.</hi> So<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phocles
says of Palamedes, that he
invented <hi>Dice</hi> to serve sometimes in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stead
of a dinner. It is therefore
<pb n="32" facs="45"/>
wisely contrived by Nature, that
Children, as they have the keenest
<hi>Appetites,</hi> are most addicted to <hi>Plays.</hi>
From the same cause, and from the
unprejudic'd and incorrupt simplicity
of their minds it proceeds, that the
Plays of the Ancient Children are
preserv'd more entire than any other
of their Customs. In this matter I
would recommend to all who have
any concern in my Son's Education,
that they deviate not in the least from
the primitive and simple Antiquity.</p>
               <p>' To speak first of the <hi>Whistle,</hi> as it
is the first of all Play-things. I will
have it exactly to correspond with the
ancient <hi>Fistula,</hi> and accordingly to
be compos'd, <hi>septem paribus disjuncta
cicutis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>' I heartily wish a diligent search
may be made after the true <hi>Crepita<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culum</hi>
or <hi>Rattle</hi> of the Ancients, for
that (as <hi>Archytas Tarentinus</hi> was of
opinion) kept the children from break<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
Earthen Ware. The <hi>China</hi> Cups
in these days are not at all the safer
for the modern <hi>Rattles</hi>; which is an
<pb n="33" facs="46"/>
evident proof how far their <hi>Crepita<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cula</hi>
exceeded ours.</p>
               <p>' I would not have Martin as yet to
scourge a <hi>Top,</hi> till I am better in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formed
whether the <hi>Trochus</hi> which
was recommended by <hi>Cato</hi> be really
our present <hi>Top,</hi> or rather the <hi>Hoop</hi>
which the boys drive with a stick.
Neither <hi>Cross</hi> and <hi>Pile,</hi> nor <hi>Ducks</hi>
and <hi>Drakes</hi> are quite so ancient as
<hi>Handy-dandy,</hi> tho' Marcobius and St.
Augustine take notice of the first, and
Minutius Foelix describes the latter;
but <hi>Handy-dandy</hi> is mention'd by
Aristotle, Plato, and Aristophanes.</p>
               <p>' The Play which the Italians call
<hi>Cinque,</hi> and the French <hi>Mourre,</hi> is ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>treamly
ancient; it was play'd at by
<hi>Hymen</hi> and <hi>Cupid</hi> at the Marriage of
<hi>Psyche,</hi> and term'd by the Latins,
<hi>digitis micare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>' Julius Pollux describes the <hi>Omilla</hi>
or <hi>Chuck farthing:</hi> tho' some will
have our modern <hi>Chuck-farthing</hi> to
be nearer the <hi>Aphetinda</hi> of the An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cients.
He also mentions the <hi>Ba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>silinda,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="47"/>
or <hi>King I am</hi>; and <hi>Myinda,</hi>
or <hi>Hoopers-Hide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>' But the <hi>Chytindra</hi> described by the
same Author is certainly not our
<hi>Hot-cockle</hi>; for that was by pinching
and not by striking; tho' there are
good authors who affirm the <hi>Ratha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pygismus</hi>
to be yet nearer the modern
<hi>Hot-cockle.</hi> My son Martin may
use either of them indifferently, they
being equally antique.</p>
               <p>' <hi>Building of Houses,</hi> and <hi>Riding up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
Sticks</hi> have been used by children
in all ages, <hi>Aedificare casas, equitare
in arundine longa.</hi> Yet I must doubt
whether the Riding upon Sticks did
not come into use after the age of
the <hi>Centaurs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>' There is one Play which shews the
gravity of ancient Education, call'd
the <hi>Acinetinda,</hi> in which children
contended who could longest <hi>stand
still.</hi> This we have suffer'd to pe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rish
entirely; and if I might be al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowed
to guess, it was certainly first
lost among the <hi>French.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="48"/>
' I will permit my Son to play at
<hi>Apodidiascinda,</hi> which can be no o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
than our <hi>Puss in a Corner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>' Julius Pollux in his ninth book
speaks of the <hi>Melolouthe</hi> or the <hi>Kite</hi>;
but I question whether the Kite of
Antiquity was the same with ours:
And tho' the <gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 word" rend="content:〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉">
                     <desc>foreign</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Quail<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fighting</hi>
is what is most taken notice
of, they had doubtless <hi>Cock-matches</hi>
also, as is evident from certain ancient
Gems and Relievo's.</p>
               <p>' In a word, let my son Martin dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port
himself at any Game truly An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tique,
except one, which was inven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted
by a people among the Thracians,
who hung up one of their Compani<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons
in a Rope, and gave him a Knife
to cut himself down; which if he
fail'd in, he was suffer'd to hang till
he was dead; and this was only
reckon'd a sort of joke. I am ut<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terly
against this, as barbarous and
cruel.</p>
               <p>' I cannot conclude, without taking
notice of the beauty of the <hi>Greek</hi>
names, whose Etymologies acquaint
<pb n="36" facs="49"/>
us with the nature of the sports; and
how infinitely, both in sense and
sound, they excel our barbarous names
of Plays.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>junctions
of Dr. Cornelius, he yet con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>descended
to allow the Child the use of
some few modern Play-things; such
as might prove of any benefit to his
mind, by instilling an early notion of
the sciences. For example, he found
that <hi>Marbles</hi> taught him <hi>Percussion</hi> and
the <hi>Laws of Motion</hi>; <hi>Nut-crackers</hi> the
use of the <hi>Leaver</hi>; <hi>Swinging</hi> on the
ends of a Board, the <hi>Balance</hi>; <hi>Bottle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>screws,</hi>
the <hi>Vice</hi>; <hi>Whirligigs</hi> the <hi>Axis</hi>
and <hi>Peritrochia</hi>; <hi>Bird-cages,</hi> the <hi>Pul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly</hi>;
and <hi>Tops</hi> the <hi>Centrifugal</hi> motion.</p>
            <p>Others of his sports were farther
carry'd to improve his tender soul even
in Virtue and Morality. We shall on<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly
instance one of the most useful and
instructive, <hi>Bob-cherry,</hi> which teaches
at once two noble Virtues, Patience
and Constancy; the first in adhering
to the pursuit of one end, the latter in
bearing a disappointment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="50"/>
Besides all these, he taught him as
a diversion, an odd and secret manner
of <hi>Stealing,</hi> according to the Custom
of the Lacedaemonians; wherein he
succeeded so well, that he practised it
to the day of his death.</p>

            <p>NOR was Cornelius less careful in
adhering to the rules of the pu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rest
Antiquity, in relation to the <hi>Exer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cises</hi>
of his Son. He was stript, pow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der'd,
and anointed, but not constantly
bath'd, which occasion'd many heavy
complaints of the Laundress about dir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tying
his linnen. When he play'd at

and Stockings; because the <hi>Discoboli</hi>

<pb n="38" facs="51"/>
contended for modern Sports and com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon
Customs, but this was his constant
reply, <hi>Let a Daughter be the care of her
Mother, but the Education of a Son
should be the delight of his Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was about this time, he heard to
his exceeding content, that the <hi>Har<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pastus</hi>
of the Ancients was yet in use
in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and known there by
the name of <hi>Hurling.</hi> He was sensible
the common <hi>Foot-ball</hi> was a very im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perfect
imitation of that exercise; and
thought it necessary to send Martin in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to

ancient and manly part of the <hi>Gymna<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sticks.</hi>
The poor boy was so unfortu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nate

This Cornelius look'd upon but as a
slight ailment, and promis'd his Mother
he would instantly cure it: He slit a
green Reed, and cast the knife upward,
then tying the two parts of the Reed
to the disjointed place, pronounced

<hi>Dancing (quoth Cornelius) I much ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prove,

            <p>The poor Lady was at last enur'd to
bear all these things with a laudable

seized with a new thought. He had
met with a saying, that <q rend="inline">' <hi>Spleen, Gar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter,</hi>
and <hi>Girdle</hi> are the three impe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diments
to the <hi>Cursus.</hi>'</q> Therefore
Pliny (lib. xi. cap. 37.) says, that such
as excel in that exercise have their
<hi>Spleen</hi> cauteriz'd. <hi>My son (quoth Cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nelius)
runs but heavily; therefore I
will have this operation performed upon
him immediately. Moreover it will cure
that immoderate Laughter to which I
perceive he is addicted: For laughter
(as the same author hath it, ibid.) is
caused by the bigness of the Spleen.</hi> This
design was no sooner hinted to Mrs.
Scriblerus, but she burst into tears,
<pb n="41" facs="54"/>
wrung her hands, and instantly sent to
his Brother Albertus, begging him for
the love of God to make haste to her
husband.</p>
            <p>Albertus was a discreet man, sober
in his opinions, clear of Pedantry, and
knowing enough both in books and in
the world, to preserve a due regard for
whatever was useful or excellent, whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
ancient or modern: If he had not
always the authority, he had at least
the art, to divert Cornelius from many
extravagancies. It was well he came
speedily, or Martin could not have
boasted the entire Quota of his Viscera.
<hi>What does it signify (quoth Albertus)
whether my Nephew excels in the</hi> Cursus
<hi>or not? Speed is often a symptom of Cow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ardice,

gravely; <hi>If it be so, I will defer the

such methods of Education as modern bar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>barity

Then my son might have heard
the Philosophers dispute in the Porticos of
the Palestra and at the same time form'd
his Body and his Understanding. It is

(said Cornelius very warmly) and to prove

the ancient manner. I can play some

Cornelius, undress'd as he was, jumps
out into his Balcony, his Lyra in hand,
in his slippers, with his breeches hang<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
down to his ankles, a stocking up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
his head, and a waistcoat of mur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rey-colour'd
sattin upon his body: He
touch'd his Lyra with a very unusual
sort of an Harpegiatura, nor were his
hopes frustrated. The odd Equipage,
the uncouth Instrument, the strange<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
of the Man and of the Musick,
drew the ears and eyes of the whole
Mob that were got about the two fe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>male
Champions, and at last of the
Combatants themselves. They ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proach'd
the Balcony, in as close atten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
as Orpheus's first Audience of Cat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tle,
or that of an Italian Opera when
some favourite Air is just awaken'd.
This sudden effect of his Musick en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>couraged
him mightily, and it was ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serv'd
he never touch'd his Lyre in such
a truly chromatick and enharmonick
manner as upon that occasion. The
mob laugh'd, sung, jump'd, danc'd, and
us'd many odd gestures, all which he
<pb n="48" facs="61"/>
judg'd to be caused by his various strains
and modulations. <hi>Mark (quoth he) in
this, the power of the Ionian, in that,
you see the effect of the Aeolian.</hi> But in
a little time they began to grow rio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tous,
and threw stones: Cornelius then
withdrew, but with the greatest air of
Triumph in the world. <hi>Brother (said
he) do you observe I have mixed unawares
too much of the</hi> Phrygian<hi>; I might
change it to the</hi> Lydian<hi>, and soften their

what must it not have done in those

            <p>COrnelius having (as hath been
said) many ways been disappoin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted
in his attempts of improving the
bodily Forces of his son, thought it now
high time to apply to the Culture of
his Internal faculties. He judg'd it
proper in the first place to instruct him
in <hi>Rhetorick.</hi> But herein we shall not
need to give the Reader any account of
his wonderful progress, since it is already
known to the learned world by his
Treatise on this subject: I mean the
admirable Discourse <gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 span" rend="content:〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉">
                  <desc>foreign</desc>
               </gap>, which he
wrote at this time but conceal'd from
his Father, knowing his extreme par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tiality
for the Ancients. It lay by him
conceal'd, and perhaps forgot among
the great multiplicity of other Writings,
till about the year 1727, he sent it us
to be printed, with many additional ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>amples
drawn from the excellent live
<pb n="50" facs="63"/>
Poets of this present age. We proceed
therefore to <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Metaphysick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The wise Cornelius was convinced,
that these being <hi>Polemical</hi> Arts, could
no more be learned alone, than Fencing
or Cudgel-playing. He thought it
therefore necessary to look out for some
Youth of pregnant parts, to be a sort of
humble Companion to his son in those
studies. His good fortune directed him
to one of most singular endowments,
whose name was Conradus Crambe,
who by the father's side was related to
the <hi>Crouches</hi> of Cambridge, and his mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
was Cousin to Mr. <hi>Swan,</hi> Game<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ster
and Punster of the City of London.
So that from both parents he drew a
natural disposition to sport himself with
<hi>Words,</hi> which as they are said to be
the counters of wise Men, and ready<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>money
of Fools, Crambe had great
store of cash of the latter sort. Happy
Martin in such a Parent, and such a
Companion! What might not he at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chieve
in Arts and Sciences.</p>
            <p>Here I must premise a general obser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vation
of great benefit to mankind.
<pb n="51" facs="64"/>
That there are many people who have
the use only of one Operation of the
Intellect, tho' like short-sighted men
they can hardly discover it themselves:
They can form <hi>single apprehensions,</hi> but
have neither of the other two faculties,
the <hi>judicium</hi> or <hi>discursus.</hi> Now as it
is wisely order'd, that people depriv'd
of one sense have the others in more
perfection, such people will form single
Ideas with a great deal of vivacity; and
happy were it indeed if they would
confine themselves to such, without
forming <hi>judicia,</hi> much less <hi>argumen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cornelius quickly discover'd, that
these two last operations of the intel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lect
were very weak in Martin, and al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most
totally extinguish'd in Crambe;
however he used to say that Rules of
Logick are Spectacles to a purblind un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derstanding,
and therefore he resolv'd
to proceed with his two Pupils.</p>
            <p>Martin's understanding was so total<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly
immers'd in <hi>sensible objects,</hi> that he
demanded examples from Material
things of the abstracted Ideas of Lo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gick:
<pb n="52" facs="65"/>
As for Crambe, he contented
himself with the Words, and when he
could but form some conceit upon
them, was fully satisfy'd. Thus Crambe
would tell his Instructor, that All
men were not <hi>singular</hi>; that Individu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ality
could hardly be praedicated of
any man, for it was commonly said that
a man <hi>is</hi> not the same he <hi>was,</hi> that
madmen are <hi>beside themselves,</hi> and drun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ken
men <hi>come to themselves</hi>; which
shows, that few men have that most
valuable logical endowment, Individu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ality.
Cornelius told Martin that a
shoulder of mutton was an individual,
which Crambe deny'd, for he had seen
it cut into commons: That's true
(quoth the Tutor) but you never saw
it cut into shoulders of mutton: If it
could (quoth Crambe) it would be the
most lovely individual of the Univer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sity.
When he was told, a <hi>substance</hi>
was that which was <hi>subject to accidents</hi>;
then Soldiers (quoth Crambe) are the
most substantial people in the World.
Neither would he allow it to be a good
definition of <hi>accident,</hi> that it could be
<pb n="53" facs="66"/>
               <hi>present or absent without the destruction
of the subject</hi>; since there are a great
many accidents that destroy the sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject,
as burning does a house, and death
a man. But as to that, Cornelius in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formed
him, that there was a <hi>natural
death,</hi> and <hi>a logical death</hi>; that though
a man after his natural death was not
capable of the least parish-office, yet
he might still keep his Stall amongst
the logical praedicaments.</p>
            <p>Cornelius was forc'd to give Martin
sensible images; thus calling up the
Coachman he ask'd him what he had
seen at the Bear-garden? the man an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swer'd
he saw two men fight a prize;
one was a fair man, a Sergeant in the
Guards, the other black, a Butcher;
the Sergeant had red breeches, the
Butcher blue; they fought upon a Stage
about four o'clock, and the Sergeant
wounded the Butcher in the leg. <hi>Mark
(quoth Cornelius) how the fellow runs
through the praedicaments. Men,</hi> Sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stantia;
<hi>two,</hi> quantitas; <hi>fair and black,</hi>
qualitas; <hi>Sergeant and Butcher,</hi> relatio;
<hi>wounded the other,</hi> actio &amp; passio; <hi>fight<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="67"/>
situs; <hi>Stage,</hi> ubi; <hi>two a Clock,</hi>
quando; <hi>blue and red Breeches,</hi> habitus.
At the same time he warn'd Martin,
that what he now <hi>learn'd</hi> as a Logician,
he must <hi>forget</hi> as a natural Philosopher;
that tho' he now taught them that ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cidents
inher'd in the subject, they
would find in time there was no such
thing; and that colour, taste, smell,
heat, and cold, were not in the things
but only phantasms of our brains. He
was forc'd to let them into this secret,
for Martin could not conceive how a
habit of dancing inher'd in a dancing<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>master,
when he did not dance; nay,
he would demand the Characteristicks
of Relations: Crambe us'd to help him
out by telling him, a Cuckold, a losing
gamester, a man that had not din'd, a
young heir that was kept short by his
father, might be all known by their
countenance; that, in this last case,
the Paternity and Filiation leave very
sensible impressions in the <hi>relatum</hi> and
<hi>correlatum.</hi> The greatest difficulty was,
when they came to the Tenth Praedi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cament:
Crambe affirmed, that his
<pb n="55" facs="68"/>
               <hi>Habitus</hi> was more a substance than he
was; for his cloaths could better subsist
without him, than he without his
cloaths.</p>
            <p>Martin suppos'd an <hi>Universal Man</hi>
to be like a Knight of a Shire or a Bur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gess
of a Corporation, that represented
a great many Individuals. His Father
ask'd him, if he could not frame the
Idea of an Universal Lord Mayor?
Martin told him, that never having seen
but one Lord Mayor, the Idea of that
Lord Mayor always return'd to his
mind; that he had great difficulty to
abstract a Lord Mayor from his Fur,
Gown, and Gold Chain; nay, that the
horse he saw the Lord Mayor ride up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
not a little disturb'd his imagination.
On the other hand Crambe, to show
himself of a more penetrating genius,
swore that he could frame a conception
of a Lord Mayor not only without his
Horse, Gown, and Gold Chain, but
even without Stature, Feature, Colour,
Hands, Head, Feet, or any Body;
which he suppos'd was the abstract of
a Lord Mayor. Cornelius told him
<pb n="56" facs="69"/>
that he was a lying Rascal; that an
<hi>Universale</hi> was not the object of imagi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nation,
and that there was no such
thing in reality, or <hi>a parte Rei.</hi> But I
can prove (quoth Crambe) that there
are <hi>Clysters a parte Rei,</hi> but <hi>clysters</hi> are
<hi>universales</hi>; <hi>ergo.</hi> Thus I prove my
Minor. <hi>Quod aptum est inesse multis,</hi>
is an <hi>universale</hi> by definition: but every
clyster before it is administred has that
quality; therefore every clyster is an
<hi>universale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He also found fault with the Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vertisements,
that they were not strict
logical <hi>definitions:</hi> In an advertise<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
of a Dog stol'n or stray'd, he said
it ought to begin thus, <hi>An irrational a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nimal</hi>
of the <hi>Genus caninum,</hi> &amp;c. Cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nelius
told them, that though those ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vertisements
were not fram'd according
to the exact rules of logical definitions,
being only <hi>descriptions</hi> of things <hi>numero
differentibus,</hi> yet they contain'd a faint
image of the <hi>praedicabilia,</hi> and were
highly subservient to the common pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poses
of life; often discovering things
that were lost, both animate and ina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nimate.

            <p>Though I'm afraid I have transgress'd
upon my Reader's patience already, I
cannot help taking notice of one thing
more extraordinary than any yet men<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion'd;
which was Crambe's <hi>Treatise
of Syllogisms.</hi> He suppos'd that a Phi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>losopher's
brain was like a great Forest,
where Ideas rang'd like animals of se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veral
kinds; that those Ideas copulated,
and engender'd Conclusions; that
when those of different Species copu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>late,
they bring forth monsters or absur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dities;
that the <hi>Major</hi> is the male, the
<hi>Minor</hi> the female, which copulate by
the Middle Term, and engender the
Conclusion. Hence they are call'd the
<hi>praemissa,</hi> or <hi>Predecessors</hi> of the Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clusion;
and it is properly said by Lo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gicians

Propositions are Persons of quali<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty;
and therefore in Logick they are
said to be of the first <hi>Figure.</hi> Singu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lar
Propositions are Private persons, and
therefore plac'd in the third or last
figure, or rank. From those principles
all the rules of Syllogisms naturally
follow.<list>

                  <item>IX. An hypothetical proposition is only

            <p>Crambe us'd to value himself upon

might see the propriety of the expres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion,
<hi>such a one has a barren imaginati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on</hi>;
and how common it is for such
people to <hi>adopt</hi> conclusions that are not
the issue of their premisses? therefore
as an Absurdity is a <hi>Monster,</hi> a Falsity
is a <hi>Bastard</hi>; and a true conclusion that
followeth not from the premisses, may
properly be said to be <hi>adopted.</hi> But
then what is an Enthymem? (quoth
Cornelius.) Why, an Enthymem (re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ply'd
Crambe) is when the Major is
indeed married to the Minor, but the
Marriage <hi>kept secret.</hi>

            <p>METAPHYSICKS were a large field
in which to exercise the Weapons <hi>Lo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gick</hi>
had put into their hands. Here
Martin and Crambe us'd to engage like
any prize fighters, before their Father,
and his other Learned companions of
the Symposiacks. And as Prize fight<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ers
will agree to lay aside a buckler or
some such defensive weapon, so would
Crambe promise not to use <hi>simpliciter

would part with <hi>materialiter &amp; forma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liter:</hi>
But it was found, that without

            <p>This brings into my mind a Project
to banish Metaphysicks out of Spain,
which was suppos'd might be effectu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ated
by this method: That no-body
should use any Compound or Decom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pound
of the Substantial Verbs but as
they are read in the common conjuga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions:
for every body will allow, that
if you debar a Metaphysician from <hi>ens,</hi>
               <hi>essentia, entitas, subsistentia,</hi> &amp;c. there
is an end of him.</p>
            <p>Crambe regretted extremely, that
<hi>Substantial Forms,</hi> a race of harmless
beings which had lasted for many years,
and afforded a comfortable subsistance
to many poor Philosophers, should be
now hunted down like so many Wolves,
without the possibility of a retreat.
He consider'd that it had gone much
harder with them than with <hi>Essences,</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="77"/>
which had retir'd from the <hi>Schools</hi> into
the <hi>Apothecaries Shops,</hi> where some of
them had been advanc'd into the de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gree
of <hi>Quintessences.</hi> He thought there
should be a retreat for poor <hi>substantial
Forms,</hi> amongst the Gentle-ushers at
court; and that there were indeed <hi>sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stantial
forms,</hi> such as <hi>forms of Prayer,</hi>
and <hi>forms of Government,</hi> without which,
the things themselves could neyer long
subsist. He also us'd to wonder that
there was not a reward for such as could

            <head>ANATOMY.</head>
            <p>COrnelius, it is certain, had a most
superstitious veneration for the
Ancients; and if they contradicted each
other, his Reason was so pliant and
ductile, that he was always of the
opinion of the last he read. But
he reckon'd it a point of honour never
to be vanquish'd in a dispute; from
<pb n="65" facs="78"/>
which quality he acquir'd the title of
the <hi>Invincible Doctor.</hi> While the Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fessor
of Anatomy was demonstrating
to his son the several kinds of <hi>Intestines,</hi>
Cornelius affirm'd that there were only
two, the <hi>Colon</hi> and the <hi>Aichos,</hi> accord<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
to Hippocrates, who it was impos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sible
could ever be mistaken. It was
in vain to assure him this error proceed<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed
from want of accuracy in dividing
the whole Canal of the Guts: Say
what you please (he reply'd) this is
both mine and Hippocrates's opinion.
You may with equal reason (answer'd
the Professor) affirm that a man's Liver
hath five Lobes, and deny the Circula<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
of the blood. Ocular demonstra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
(said Cornelius) seems to be on
your side, yet I shall not give it up:
Show me any viscus of a human body,
and I will bring you a Monster that
differs from the common rule in the
structure of it. If Nature shews such
variety in the same age, why may she
not have extended it further in several
ages? Produce me a man now of the
age of an Antidiluvian; of the strength
<pb n="66" facs="79"/>
of Sampson, or the size of the Giants.
If in the whole, why not in parts of
the body, may it not be possible the
present generation of men may differ
from the Ancients? The Moderns
have perhaps lengthen'd the channel
of the guts by Gluttony, and diminish'd
the liver by hard drinking. Though
it shall be demonstrated that modern
blood circulates, yet I will still believe
with Hippocrates, that the blood of
the Ancients had a flux and reflux from
the heart, like a Tide. Consider how
Luxury hath introduced new diseases,
and with them not improbably alter'd
the whole Course of the Fluids. Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sider
how the current of mighty Rivers,
nay the very channels of the Ocean are
changed from what they were in an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cient
days; and can we be so vain to
imagine, that the Microcosm of the
human body alone is exempted from
the fate of all things? I question not
but plausible Conjectures may be made
even as to the Time when the blood
first began to circulate.—Such dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>putes
as these frequently perplex'd the
<pb n="67" facs="80"/>
Professor to that degree, that he would
now and then in a passion leave him in
the middle of a Lecture, as he did at
this time.</p>
            <p>There unfortunately happen'd soon
after, an unusual accident, which re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tarded
the prosecution of the studies of
Martin. Having purchased the body
of a Malefactor, he hir'd a Room for
its dissection near the Pest-fields in St.
Giles's, at a little distance from Tyburn
Road. Crambe (to whose care this bo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dy
was committed) carry'd it thither
about twelve a clock at night in a Hack<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney-coach,
few House-keepers being
very willing to let their lodgings to such
kind of Operators. As he was softly
stalking up stairs in the dark, with the
dead man in his arms, his burthen had
like to have slipp'd from him, which
he (to save from falling) grasp'd so hard
about the belly that it forced the wind
through the <hi>Anus,</hi> with a noise exactly
like the <hi>Crepitus</hi> of a living man.
Crambe (who did not comprehend how
this part of the Animal Oeconomy could
remain in a dead man) was so terrify'd,
<pb n="68" facs="81"/>
that he threw down the body, ran up
to his master, and had scarce breath to
tell him what had happen'd. Martin
with all his Philosophy could not pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vail
upon him to return to his post.
You may say what you please (quoth
Crambe) no man alive ever broke wind
more naturally; nay, he seemed to be
mightily relieved by it. The rolling
of the corps down stairs made such a
noise that it awak'd the whole house.
The maid shriek'd, the landlady cry'd
out Thieves; but the Landlord, in his
shirt as he was, taking a candle in one
hand and a drawn sword in the other,
ventur'd out of the Room. The maid
with only a single petticoat ran up stairs,
but spurning at the dead body, fell up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
it in a swoon. Now the Landlord
stood still and list'ned, then he look'd
behind him, and ventur'd down in this
manner one stair after another, 'till he
came where lay his maid, as dead, up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
another corps unknown. The wife
ran into the street and cry'd out Mur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der!
the Watch ran in, while Martin
and Crambe, hearing all this uproar,
<pb n="69" facs="82"/>
were coming down stairs. The Watch
imagin'd they were making their escape,
seiz'd them immediately, and carried
them to a neighbouring Justice; where,
upon searching them, several kind of
knives and dreadful weapons were found
upon them. The Justice first examin'd
Crambe. What is your Name? says
the Justice. I have acquir'd (quoth
Crambe) no great Name as yet; they
call me Crambe or Crambo, no mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter
which, as to my self; though it
may be some dispute to posterity.—What
is yours and your Masters pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fession?<hi>—It is our business to imbrue
our hands in blood; we cut off the heads,
and pull out the hearts of those that never
injur'd us; we rip up big-belly'd women,
and tear children limb from limb.</hi> Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tin
endeavour'd to interrupt him; but
the Justice being strangely astonish'd
with the frankness of Crambe's Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fession,
order'd him to proceed; upon
which he made the following Speech.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it please your Worship, as touch<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
the body of this man, I can answer
each head that my accusers alledge against</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="83"/>
               <hi>me, to a hair. They have hitherto talk'd
like num-sculls without brains; but if
your Worship will not only give ear, but
regard me with a favourable eye, I will
not be brow-beaten by the supercilious
looks of my adversaries, who now stand
cheek by jowl by your Worship. I will
prove to their faces, that their foul mouths
have not open'd their lips without a fal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sity;
though they have shewed their teeth
as if they would bite off my nose. Now,
Sir, that I may fairly slip my Neck out
of the collar, I beg this matter may not
be slightly skin'd over. Tho' I have no
man here to back me, I will un-bosom
my self, since Truth is on my side, and
shall give them their bellies full, though
they think they have me upon the hip.
Whereas they say I came into their lodg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings,
with arms, and murder'd this man
without their Privity, I declare I had
not the least Finger in it; and since
I am to stand upon my own legs, nothing
of this matter shall be left till I set it
upon a right foot. In the vein I am in,
I cannot for my heart's blood and guts
bear this usage: I shall not spare my</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="84"/>
               <hi>lungs to defend my good name: I was
ever reckon'd a good liver; and I think
I have the bowels of compassion. I ask
but justice, and from the crown of my
head to the soal of my foot I shall ever
acknowledge my self your Worship's hum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble
Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Justice stared, the Landlord and
Landlady lifted up their eyes, and Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tin
fretted, while Crambe talk'd in this
rambling incoherent manner; till at
length Martin begg'd to be heard. It
was with great difficulty that the Ju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stice
was convinc'd, till they sent for
the Finisher of human laws, of whom
the Corps had been purchas'd; who
looking near the left ear, knew his own
work, and gave Oath accordingly.</p>
            <p>No sooner was Martin got home,
but he fell into a passion at Crambe.
<hi>What Daemon, he cry'd, hath possessed thee
that thou will never forsake that imper<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinent
custom of punning? Neither my
council nor my example have thus misled
thee; thou governest thy self by most erro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neous
Maxims.</hi> Far from it (answers
Crambe) my life is as orderly as my
<pb n="72" facs="85"/>
Dictionary, for by my Dictionary I or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der
my life. I have made a Kalendar
of radical words for all the seasons,
months, and days of the year: Every
day I am under the dominion of a cer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain
Word: but this day in particular
I cannot be misled, for I am govern'd
by one that rules all sexes, ages, con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ditions,
nay all animals rational and ir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rational.
Who is not govern'd by the

Dice are rat-led, Swine and Nobility are

grove-led. And that I may not be te<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dious—Which
thou art (reply'd Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tin,
stamping with his foot) which thou
art, I say, beyond all human toleration—Such an unnatural, unaccountable,
uncoherent, unintelligible, unprofita<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble—There
it is now! (interrupted
Crambe) this is your Day for <hi>Uns.</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="86"/>
Martin could bear no longer—however
composing his Countenance, Come hi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther—he cry'd, there are five pounds,
seventeen shillings and nine pence: thou
hast been with me eight months, three
weeks, two days, and four hours. Poor
Crambe upon the receipt of his Salary,
fell into tears, flung the money upon
the ground, and burst forth in these
words: <hi>O Cicero, Cicero! if to pun be
a crime, 'tis a crime I have learned from
thee: O Bias, Bias! if to pun be a
crime, by thy example was I bias'd.</hi>
Whereupon Martin, (considering that
one of the greatest of Orators, and even
a Sage of Greece had punned,) hesit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted,
relented, and re-instated Crambe
in his Service.</p>

            <head>How <hi>Martin</hi> become a grat Critick.</head>
            <p>IT was a most peculiar Talent in
Martinus, to convert every Trifle
into a serious thing, either in the way
<pb n="74" facs="87"/>
of Life, or in Learning. This can no
way be better exemplify'd, than in the
effect which the Puns of Crambe had
on the Mind and Studies of Martinus,
He conceiv'd, that somewhat of a like
Talent to this of Crambe, of <hi>assembling
parallel sounds,</hi> either <hi>syllables,</hi> or <hi>words,</hi>
might conduce to the Emendation and
Correction of <hi>Ancient Authors,</hi> if ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ply'd
to their Works, with the same
<hi>diligence,</hi> and the same <hi>liberty.</hi> He re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>solv'd
to try first upon Virgil, Horace,
and Terence; concluding, that if the
<hi>most correct</hi> Authors could be so served
with any reputation to the Critick, the
amendment and alteration of <hi>all the
rest</hi> wou'd easily follow; whereby a
new, a vast, nay boundless Field of

There will also be added the Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>presentation,
which on occasion of one
distemper which was become almost e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pidemical,
he thought himself oblig'd
to lay before both Houses of Parliament,

out of this kingdom.</p>
            <p>He next proceeded to an Enquiry

according to the Jewish Doctrines,

               <hi>Queen
Esther,</hi> with a <hi>Display</hi> of her <hi>Case</hi> at

            <p>But being weary of all practice on
<hi>foetid Bodies,</hi> from a certain niceness of
Constitution, (especially when he at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tended
Dr. Woodward thro' a Twelve-months
course of Vomition) he deter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mined
to leave it off entirely, and to ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ply
himself only to diseases of the <hi>Mind.</hi>
He attempted to find out Specificks for
<pb n="77" facs="90"/>
all the <hi>Passions</hi>; and as other Physi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cians
throw their Patients into sweats,
vomits, purgations, &amp;c. he cast them
into Love, hatred, hope, fear, joy, grief,
&amp;c. And indeed the great Irregu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larity
of the Passions in the English
Nation, was the chief motive that in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duced
him to apply his whole studies,
while he continued among us, to the
Diseases of the Mind.</p>
            <p>To this purpose he directed, in the
first place, his late acquir'd skill in <hi>Ana<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tomy.</hi>
He consider'd <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi>
as certain Habits which proceed from
the natural Formation and Structure of
particular parts of the body. A Bird
flies because it has Wings, a Duck
swims because it is web-footed: and
there can be no question but the Adun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>city
of the pounces, and beaks of the
Hawks, as well as the length of the
fangs, the sharpness of the teeth, and
the strength of the crural and Masseter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>muscles
in Lions and Tygers, are the
cause of the great and habitual Immo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rality
of those Animals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="91"/>
Ist, He observ'd that the Soul and
Body mutually operate upon each o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther,
and therefore if you deprive the
Mind of the outward Instruments
whereby she usually expresseth that
Passion, you will in time abate the
Passion itself, in like manner as Ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stration
abates Lust.</p>
            <p>2dly, That the Soul in mankind ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>presseth
every Passion by the Motion of
some particular <hi>Muscles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3dly, That all Muscles grow stronger
and thicker by being <hi>much us'd</hi>; there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore
the habitual Passions may be dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerned
in particular persons by the
<hi>strength</hi> and <hi>bigness</hi> of the Muscles us'd
in the expression of that Passion.</p>
            <p>4thly, That a Muscle may be
strengthen'd or weakn'd by weakning
or strength'ning the force of its Anta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gonist.
These things premis'd, he
took notice,</p>
            <p>That <hi>Complaisance, humility, assent,</hi>
               <hi>approbation,</hi> and <hi>civility,</hi> were express'd
by nodding the head and bowing the
body forward: on the contrary, <hi>dissent,</hi>

               <pb n="79" facs="92"/>
were mark'd by tossing the head, and
bending the body backwards: which

Latins rightly express'd by the words
<hi>adnuere</hi> and <hi>abnuere.</hi> Now he observ'd
that complaisant and civil people had
the Flexors of the head very strong;
but in the proud and insolent there was
a great over-balance of strength in the
Extensors of the Neck and the Muscles
of the Back, from whence they per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>form
with great facility the motion of
<hi>tossing,</hi> but with great difficulty that of
<hi>bowing,</hi> and therefore have justly ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quir'd
the Title of <hi>stiff-neck'd:</hi> In or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der
to reduce such persons to a just
balance, he judg'd that the pair of
Muscles call'd <hi>Recti interni,</hi> the Mas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>toidal,
with other flexors of the head,
neck, and body must be strengthen'd;

and the Extensors of the Spine, weak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>en'd;
For which purpose Nature her<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self

            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="93"/>
Contrary to this, is the pernicious
Custom of Mothers who abolish the
natural Signature of Modesty in their
Daughters by teaching them <hi>tossing</hi> and
<hi>bridling,</hi> rather than the bashful pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture
of <hi>stooping,</hi> and <hi>hanging down the
head.</hi> Martinus charg'd all husbands
to take notice of the <hi>Posture of the
Head</hi> of such as they courted to Matri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mony,
as that upon which their future
happiness did much depend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flatterers,</hi> who have the flexor Mus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cles
so strong that they are always bow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
and cringing, he suppos'd might in
some measure be corrected by being
ty'd down upon a Tree by the back,
like the children of the Indians; which
doctrine was strongly confirm'd by his
observing the strength of the <hi>levatores
Scapulae:</hi> This Muscle is call'd the
Muscle of <hi>patience,</hi> because in that af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fection
of Mind people shrug and raise
up the shoulder to the tip of the ear.
This Muscle also he observed to be ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceedingly
strong and large in <hi>Henpeck'd
Husbands,</hi> in <hi>Italians,</hi> and in <hi>English
Ministers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="94"/>
In pursuance of his Theory, he sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pos'd
the <hi>Constrictors</hi> of the <hi>Eye-lids,</hi>
must be strengthen'd in the supercili<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous,
the <hi>abductors</hi> in drunkards and con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>templative
men, who have the same
steddy and grave motion of the eye.
That the <hi>buccinatores</hi> or blowers up of
the <hi>cheeks,</hi> and the <hi>dilators</hi> of the <hi>Nose,</hi>
were too strong in Cholerick people;
and therefore Nature here again direc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted
us to a remedy, which was to cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rect
such extraordinary dilatation by
<hi>pulling by the Nose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rolling amorous Eye, in the
Passion of Love, might be corrected by
frequently looking thro' glasses. Imper<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinent
fellows that jump upon Tables,
and cut capers, might be cur'd by relax<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
medicines apply'd to the <hi>Calves</hi> of
their <hi>legs,</hi> which in such people are too
strong.</p>
            <p>But there were two Cases which he
reckon'd extremely difficult. First,
<hi>Affectation,</hi> in which there were so
many Muscles of the bum, thighs, bel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly,
neck, back, and the whole body, all
<pb n="82" facs="95"/>
in a false tone, that it requir'd an im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>practicable
multiplicity of applications.</p>
            <p>The second case was immoderate
<hi>Laughter:</hi> When any of that risible
species were brought to the Doctor, and
when he consider'd what an infinity of
Muscles these laughing Rascals threw
into a convulsive motion at the same
time; whether we regard the spasms
of the Diaphragm and all the muscles
of respiration, the horrible <hi>rictus</hi> of the
mouth, the distortion of the lower jaw,
the crisping of the nose, twinkling of
the eyes, or sphaerical convexity of the
cheeks, with the tremulous succussion
of the whole human body: when he
consider'd, I say, all this, he used to cry
out <hi>Casus plane deplorabilis!</hi> and give
such Patients over.</p>

            <head>The Case of a young Nobleman at Court,
with the Doctor's Prescription for
the same.</head>
            <p>AN eminent Instance of Martinus's
Sagacity in discovering the Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tempers
of the Mind, appear'd in the
case of a young Nobleman at Court,
who was observ'd to grow extremely
affected in his speech, and whimsical in
all his behaviour. He began to ask
odd questions, talk in verse to himself,
shut himself up from his friends, and be
accessible to none, but Flatterers, Poets,
and Pickpockets; till his Relations and
old Acquaintance judged him to be so
far gone, as to be a fit Patient for the
Doctor.</p>
            <p>As soon as he had heard and exami<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ned
all the symptoms, he pronounced
his distemper to be <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His friends assured him that they had
with great care observ'd all his motions,
<pb n="84" facs="97"/>
and were perfectly satisfy'd there was
no Woman in the case. Scriblerus
was as positive that he was desperately
in love with some person or other.
<hi>How can that be? (said his Aunt, who
came to ask the advice) when he converses
almost with none but himself?</hi> Say you
so? he replied, why then he is in love
with Himself, one of the most com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon
cases in the world. I am asto<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nish'd,
people do not enough attend this
Disease, which has the same causes and
symptoms, and admits of the same cure,
with the other: especially since here
the case of the Patient is the more help<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>less
and deplorable of the two, as this
unfortunate passion is more blind than
the other. There are people who dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cover
from their very youth a most a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>morous
inclination to themselves;
which is unhappily nurs'd by such
Mothers, as with their good will, wou'd
never suffer their children to be <hi>cross'd
in love.</hi> Ease, luxury, and idleness,
blow up this flame as well as the other:
Constant opportunities of conversation
with the person beloved, (the greatest
<pb n="85" facs="98"/>
of incentives) are here impossible to be
prevented. Bawds and Pimps in the
other love, will be perpetually doing
kind offices, speaking a good word for
the party, and carry about Billet doux.
Therefore I ask you, Madam, if this
Gentleman has not been much frequen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted
by Flatterers, and a sort of people
who bring him dedications and verses?
<hi>O Lord! Sir, (quoth the Aunt) the
house is haunted with them.</hi> There it
is, (reply'd Scriblerus) those are the
bawds and pimps that go between a
man and himself. Are there no civil
Ladies, that tell him he dresses well,
has a gentlemanly air, and the like?
<hi>Why truly Sir, my Nephew is not auk<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward</hi>—Look you Madam, this is
a misfortune to him: In former days
these sort of lovers were happy in one
respect, that they never had any Rivals,
but of late they have all the Ladies so—Be pleased to answer a few ques<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
more. Whom does he generally
talk of? Himself, quoth the Aunt.
Whose wit and breeding does he most
commend? His own, quoth the Aunt.
<pb n="86" facs="99"/>
Whom does he write letters to? Him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self.
Whom does he dream of? All
the dreams I ever heard were of him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self.
Whom is he ogling yonder?
Himself in his looking-glass. Why
does he throw back his head in that
languishing posture? Only to be blest
with a smile of himself as he passes by,
Does he ever steal a kiss from himself,
by biting his lips? <hi>Oh continually, till
they are perfect vermilion.</hi> Have you
observ'd him to use Familiarities with
any body? <hi>With none but himself: he
often embraces himself with folded arms,
he claps his hand often upon his hip, nay
sometimes thrusts it into—his breast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam, said the Doctor, all these
are strong symptoms, but there remain
a few more. Has this amorous gentle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man
presented himself with any Love<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>toys;
such as gold Snuff-boxes, repea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ting
Watches, or Tweezer-cases? those
are things that in time will soften the
most obdurate heart. <hi>Not only so, (said
the Aunt) but he bought the other day a
very fine brilliant diamond Ring for his
own wearing.—</hi>Nay, if he has accep<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted
<pb n="87" facs="100"/>
of this Ring, the intrigue is very
forward indeed, and it is high time for
friends to interpose. Pray Madam, a
word or two more—Is he jealous that
his acquaintance do not behave them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves
with respect enough? will he
bear jokes and innocent freedoms?
<hi>By no means; a familiar appellation
makes him angry; if you shake him a
little roughly by the hand, he is in a rage;
but if you chuck him under the chin he
will return you a box on the ear.</hi>—Then
the case is plain: he has the true
Pathognomick sign of Love, <hi>Jealously</hi>;
for no body will suffer his mistress to
be treated at that rate. Madam, upon
the whole this Case is extreamly dange<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous.
There are some people who are
far gone in this passion of self-love, but
then they keep a <hi>very secret Intrigue</hi>
with themselves, and hide it from all
the world besides. But this Patient
has not the least care of the Reputati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
of his Beloved, he is downright scan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dalous
in his behaviour with himself;
he is enchanted, bewitch'd, and almost
<pb n="88" facs="101"/>
past cure. However let the following
methods be try'd upon him.</p>
            <p>First, let him *** <hi>Hiatus.</hi> ***
Secondly, let him wear a Bob-wig.
Thirdly, shun the Company of flatter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ers,
nay of ceremonious people, and of
all Frenchmen in general. It would
not be a miss if he travel'd over Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land
in a Stage-coach, and made the
Tour of Holland in a Track-scoute.
Let him return the Snuff-boxes, Twee<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>zer-cases,
(and particularly the Dia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mond
Ring) which he has receiv'd
from himself. Let some knowing
friend represent to him the many vile
Qualities of this Mistress of his: let
him be shewn that her Extravagance,
Pride, and Prodigality will infallibly
bring him to a morsel of bread: Let it
be prov'd, that he has been False to
himself, and if Treachery is not a suf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficient
cause to discard a Mistress, what
is? In short let him be made to see
that no mortal besides himself either
loves or can suffer this Creature. Let
all Looking-glasses, polish'd Toys, and
even clean Plates beremoved from him,
<pb n="89" facs="102"/>
for fear of bringing back the admired
object. Let him be taught to put off
all those tender airs, affected smiles,
languishing looks, wanton tosses of the
head, coy motions of the body, that
mincing gait, soft tone of voice, and all
that enchanting woman-like behaviour,
that has made him the charm of his
own eyes, and the object of his own a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doration.
Let him surprize the Beauty
he adores at a disadvantage, survey him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self
naked, divested of artificial charms,
and he will find himself a forked strad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ling
Animal, with bandy legs, a short
neck, a dun hide, and a pot-belly. It
would be yet better if he took a strong
purge once a week, in order to contem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plate
himself in that condition: at
which time it will be convenient to
make use of the Letters, Dedications,
&amp;c. abovesaid. Something like this
has been observ'd by Lucretius and o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thers
to be a powerful remedy in the
case of Women. If all this will not
do, I must e'en leave the poor man to
his destiny. Let him <hi>marry himself,</hi>
and when he is condemn'd eternally to
<pb n="90" facs="103"/>
himself, perhaps he may run to the
next pond to get rid of himself, the
Fate of most violent Self-lovers.</p>

            <head>How <hi>Martinus</hi> endeavoured to find out
the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and of his Cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>respondence
with the <hi>Free-Thinkers.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN this Design of Martin to investi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gate
the Diseases of the Mind, he
thought nothing so necessary as an En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quiry
after the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi>; in
which at first he labour'd under great
uncertainties. Sometimes he was of
opinion that it lodg'd in the Brain,
sometimes in the Stomach, and some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>times
in the Heart. Afterwards he
thought it absurd to confine that sove<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reign
Lady to one apartment, which
made him infer that she shifted it ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cording
to the several functions of life:
The Brain was her Study, the Heart
her State-room, and the Stomach her
Kitchen. But as he saw several Offices
<pb n="91" facs="104"/>
of life went on at the same time, he
was forc'd to give up this Hypothesis
also. He now conjectured it was more
for the dignity of the Soul to perform
several operations by her little Ministers,
the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> from whence it was
natural to conclude, that she resides in
different parts according to different In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clinations,
Sexes, Ages, and Professions.
Thus in Epicures he seated her in the
mouth of the Stomach, Philosophers
have her in the Brain, Soldiers in their
Heart, Women in their Tongues, Fid<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lers
in their Fingers, and Rope-dancers
in their Toes. At length he grew fond
of the <hi>Glandula Pinealis,</hi> dissecting
many Subjects to find out the different
Figure of this Gland, from whence he
might discover the cause of the diffe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rent
Tempers in mankind. He sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pos'd
that in factious and restless-spirit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed
people he should find it sharp and
pointed, allowing no room for the Soul
to repose herself; that in quiet Tem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pers
it was flat, smooth, and soft, af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fording
to the Soul as it were an easy
cushion. He was confirm'd in this by
<pb n="92" facs="105"/>
observing, that Calves and Philosophers,
Tygers and Statesmen, Foxes and Shar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pers,
Peacocks and Fops, Cock-Spar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rows
and Coquets, Monkeys and Play<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ers,
Courtiers and Spaniels, Moles and
Misers, exactly resemble one another
in the conformation of the <hi>Pineal
Gland.</hi> He did not doubt likewise to
find the same resemblance in Highway<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>men
and Conquerors: In order to sa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tisfy
himself in which, it was, that
he purchased the body of one of the
first Species (as hath been before rela<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted)
at Tyburn, hoping in time to have
the happiness of one of the latter too,
under his Anatomical knife.</p>
            <p>We must not omit taking notice here
that these Enquiries into the <hi>Seat</hi> of
the <hi>Soul</hi> gave occasion to his first cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>respondence
with the society of <hi>Free-Thinkers,</hi>
who were then in their infan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cy
in England, and so much taken with
the promising endowments of Martin,
that they order'd their Secretary to

                  <p>IT is with unspeakable joy we have
heard of your Inquisitive Geni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>us,
and we think it great pity that it
should not be better employed, than in
looking after that Theological Non-en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tity
commonly call'd the <hi>Soul:</hi> Since
after all your enquiries, it will appear
you have lost your labour in seeking
the Residence of such a Chimera, that
never had being but in the brains of
some dreaming Philosophers. Is it not
<hi>Demonstration</hi> to a person of your Sense,
that since <hi>you cannot find it,</hi> there is <hi>no
such thing?</hi> In order to set so hopeful
a Genius right in this matter, we have
sent you an answer to the ill-grounded
Sophisms of those crack-brain'd fellows,
and likewise an easy <hi>mechanical Expla<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nation</hi>
of <hi>Perception</hi> or <hi>Thinking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One of their chief Arguments is,
<pb n="94" facs="107"/>
that <hi>Self-consciousness</hi> cannot inhere in
any system of Matter, because all mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter
is made up of several distinct beings,
which never can make up one indivi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dual
thinking being.</p>
                  <p>This is easily answer'd by a familiar
instance. In every <hi>Jack</hi> there is a <hi>meat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>roasting</hi>
Quality, which neither resides
in the Fly, nor in the Weight, nor in
any particular wheel of the Jack, but
is the result of the whole composition:
So in an Animal, the Self-consciousness
is not a real Quality inherent in one Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
(any more than meat-roasting in
a Jack) but the result of several Modes
or qualities in the same subject. As
the fly, the wheels, the chain, the
weight, the cords, &amp;c. make one Jack,
so the several parts of the body make
one Animal. As perception or consci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ousness
is said to be inherent in this A<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nimal,
so is meat-roasting said to be in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>herent
in the Jack. As sensation, rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>soning,
volition, memory, &amp;c. are the
several Modes of thinking; so roasting
of beef, roasting of mutton, roasting
of pullets, geese, turkeys, &amp;c. are the
<pb n="95" facs="108"/>
several modes of meat-roasting. And
as the general Quality of meat-roasting,
with its several modifications as to beef,
mutton, pullets, &amp;c. does not inhere
in any one part of the Jack; so nei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
does consciousness, with its seve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral
modes of sensation, intellection,
volition, &amp;c. inhere in any one, but is
the result from the mechanical compo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sition
of the whole Animal.</p>
                  <p>Just so, the Quality or disposition in
a Fiddle to play tunes, with the seve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral
modifications of this <hi>tune-playing</hi>
quality in playing of Preludes, Sara<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bands,
Jigs, and Gavotts, are as much
real qualities in the Instrument, as the
thought or the imagination is in the
mind of the Person that composes them.</p>
                  <p>The Parts (say they) of an animal
body are perpetually chang'd, and the
fluids which seem to be subject of con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sciousness,
are in a perpetual circulati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on;
so that the same individual parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cles
do not remain in the Brain; from
whence it will follow, that the idea of
Individual Consciousness must be con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stantly
translated from one particle of
<pb n="96" facs="109"/>
matter to another, whereby the parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cle
A, for example, must not only be
conscious, but conscious that it is the
same being with the particle B that
went before.</p>
                  <p>We answer, this is only a fallacy of
the imagination, and is to be understood
in no other sense than that maxim of
the English Law, that the <hi>King never
dies.</hi> This power of thinking, self<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>moving,
and governing the whole Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chine,
is communicated from every
Particle to its immediate Successor;
who, as soon as he is gone, immediate<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly
takes upon him the Government,
which still preserves the Unity of the
whole System.</p>
                  <p>They make a great noise about this
Individuality: how a man is conscious
to himself that he is the same Indivi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dual
he was twenty years ago; notwith<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>standing
the flux state of the Particles
of matter that compose his body. We
think this is capable of a very plain an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swer,
and may be easily illustrated by a
familiar example.</p>
                  <p>Sir John Cutler had a pair of black
<pb n="97" facs="110"/>
worsted stockings, which his maid darn'd
so often with silk, that they became
at last a pair of silk, stockings. Now
supposing those stockings of Sir John's
endued with some degree of Conscious<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
at every particular darning, they
would have been sensible, that they
were the same individual pair of stock<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings
both before and after the darning;
and this sensation would have continued
in them through all the succession of
darnings; and yet after the last of all,
there was not perhaps one thread left
of the first pair of stockings, but they
were grown to be silk stockings, as was
said before.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is affirm'd, that eve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry
animal is conscious of some indivi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dual
self-moving, self-determining prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciple;
it is answer'd, that as in a House
of Commons all things are determin'd
by a <hi>Majority,</hi> so it is in every Animal
system. As that which determines the
House is said to be the reason of the
whole assembly; it is no otherwise with
thinking Beings, who are determin'd
by the greater force of several particles;
<pb n="98" facs="111"/>
which, like so many unthinking Mem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bers,
compose one thinking System.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is likewise objected,
that Punishments cannot be just that
are not inflicted upon the same indivi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dual,
which cannot subsist without the
notion of a spiritual substance. We
reply, that this is no greater difficulty
to conceive, than that a Corporation,
which is likewise a flux body, may be
punished for the faults, and liable to
the debts, of their Predecessors.</p>
                  <p>We proceed now to explain, by the
structure of the Brain, the several
Modes of thinking. It is well known
to Anatomists that the Brain is a <hi>Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>geries</hi>
of Glands, that separate the fi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner
parts of the blood, call'd Animal
Spirits; that a Gland is nothing but a
canal of a great length, variously in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>torted
and wound up together. From
the Arietadion and Motion of the Spi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rits
in those Canals, proceed all the
different sorts of Thoughts: Simple I<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deas
are produced by the motion of the
Spirits in one simple Canal: when two
of these Canals disembogue themselves
<pb n="99" facs="112"/>
into one, they make what we call a
Proposition; and when two of these
propositional Chanels empty themselves
into a third, they form a Syllogism, or
a Ratiocination. Memory is perform'd
in a distinct apartment of the brain,
made up of vessels similar, and like si<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tuated
to the ideal, propositional, and
syllogistical vessels, in the primary parts
of the brain. After the same manner
it is easy to explain the other modes of
thinking; as also why some people
think so wrong and perversely, which
proceeds from the bad configuration of
those Glands. Some for example, are
born without the propositional or syl<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>logistical
Canals; in others that reason
ill, they are of unequal capacities; in
dull fellows, of too great a length,
whereby the motion of the spirits is re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tarded;
in trifling genius's, weak and
small: in the over-refining spirits, too
much intorted and winding; and so of
the rest.</p>
                  <p>We are so much persuaded of the
truth of this our Hypothesis, that we
have employ'd one of our Members, a

great Virtuoso at Nuremberg, to make
a sort of an Hydraulick Engine, in
which a chimical liquor resembling
Blood, is driven through Elastick cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nels
resembling Arteries and veins, by
the force of an Embolus like the heart,
and wrought by a pneumatick Machine
of the nature of the lungs, with ropes
and pullies, like the nerves, tendons and
muscles: And we are perswaded that
this our artificial Man will not only
walk, and speak, and perform most of
the outward actions of the animal life,
but (being wound up once a week)
will perhaps reason as well as most of
your Country Parsons.</p>

by <hi>Love:</hi> Love, that unnerves
the Vigour of the Hero, and softens
<pb n="103" facs="116"/>
the Severity of the Philosopher. It
chanced, that as Martin was walking
forth to inhale the fresh breeze of the
Evening, after the long and severe
Studies of the day, and passing through
the Western Confines of the famous
Metropolis of Albion, not far from the
proud Battlements of the Palace of
Whitehall, whose walls are embraced
by the silver Thames; his eyes were
drawn upwards by a large square piece
of Canvas, which hung forth to the view
of the passing Citizens. Upon it was
pourtrayed by some accurate pencil, the
Lybian Leopard more fierce than in his
native Desart; the mighty Lion, who
boasted thrice the bulk of the Nemaean
monster; before whom stood the little
Jackall, the faithful spy of the King of
beasts: Near these was placed, of two
Cubits high, the black Prince of Mono<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>motapa;
by whose side were seen the
glaring Cat-a-mountain, the quill-dar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ting
Porcupine, and the Man-mimick<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
Manteger. Close adjoining to this,
hung another piece of Canvas on which
was display'd the pourtrait of two Bo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hemian
<pb n="104" facs="117"/>
Damsels, whom Nature had as
closely united as the ancient Herma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phroditus
and Salmacis; and whom it
was as impossible to divide, as the
mingled waters of the gentle Thames
and the amorous Isis. While Martin
stood in a meditating posture, feasting
his eyes on this Picture, he heard on a
sudden the sonorous notes of a Clarion,
which seem'd of the purest crystal: In
an instant the passing multitude flock'd
to the sound, as when a Drum sum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mons
the straggling soldiers to the ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proaching
Battle. The youthful Vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tuoso,
who was in daily pursuit of the
Curiosities of Nature, was immediately
surrounded by the gazing throng. The
doors, for ever barr'd to the pennyless
populace, seem'd to open themselves at
his producing a silver Six-pence, which
(like Aeneas's golden bough) gain'd
him admission into that Scene of Won<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders.
He no sooner enter'd the first
apartment, but his nostrils were struck
with the scent of Carnage; broken
Bones and naked Carcasses bestrow'd
the floor. The majestick Lion rouz'd
<pb n="105" facs="118"/>
from his bed, and shook his brindled
Mane; the spotted Leopard gnash'd
his angry teeth, and walking to and fro,
in indignation rattled his chains. Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tin
with infinite pleasure heard the Hi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>story
of the several Monsters, which
was courteously open'd to him by a
Person of a grave and earnest mien;
whose frank behaviour and ready an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swers
discover'd him to have been long
conversant with different Nations, and
to have journey'd through distant Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gions.
By him he was informed, that
the Lion was hunted on the hills of
Lebanon, by the Basha of Jerusalem;
that the Leopard was nurs'd in the un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>inhabited
woods of Lybia; the Porcu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pine
came from the kingdom of Pres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter-John,
and the Manteger was a true
descendant of the celebrated Hanniman
the Magnificent. Sir, said Mr. Ran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dal
(for that was the name of the
Master of the Show) the whole World
cannot match these prodigies: twice
have I sail'd round the Globe; these
feet have travers'd the most remote and
barbarous nations; and I can with
<pb n="106" facs="119"/>
conscience affirm, that not all the De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sarts
of the four Quarters of the Earth
furnish out a more compleat sett of A<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nimals
than what are contain'd within
these walls. Friend, (answer'd Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tin)
bold is thy Assertion, and wonder<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful
is the knowledge of a Traveller.
But did'st thou ever risque thy self a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mong

hast thou ever heard the sagaci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous
Hyaena counterfeit the voice of a
shepherd, imitate the vomiting of a

<pb n="108" facs="121"/>
man to draw the dogs together, and
ev'n call a shepherd by his proper name?
Your Crocodile is but a small one, but
you ought to have brought with him
the bird Trochilos that picks his teeth
after dinner, at which the silly animal
is so pleased, that he gapes wide enough
to give the Ichneumon, his mortal e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nemy,
an entrance into his belly.
Your modern Ostriches are dwindled to
meer Larks in comparison with those
of the Ancients; theirs were equal in
stature to a man on horseback. Alas!
we have lost the chaste bird Porphyrion!
the whole Race was destroy'd by Wo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>men,
because they discover'd the infi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>delity
of wives to their husbands. The
Merops too is now no where to be found,
the only bird that flew backward by
the tail. But say, canst thou inform
me, what Dialect of the Greek is spo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ken
by the birds of Diomedes'island?
for it is from them only we can learn
the true pronunciation of that ancient
language.—Mr. Randal made no sa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tisfactory
answer to these demands, but
harangued chiefly upon modern Mon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sters,
<pb n="109" facs="122"/>
and seem'd willing to confine his
instances to the Animals of his own col<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lection,
pointing to each of them in
order with his Rod.</p>
            <p>After Martin had satisfy'd his curi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>osity
here, he was conducted into ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
Apartment. Just at the entrance
of the door appear'd a Negroe Prince.
His habiliments bespoke him royal;
his head was crown'd with the feather
of an Ostrich, his sable feet and legs
were interlaced with Purple and Gold,
spangled with the Diamonds of Corn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wall,
and the precious stones of Bristol.
Though his stature was of the lowest,
yet he behav'd himself with such an
Air of Grandeur, as gave evident to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kens
of his Regal Birth and Education.
He was mounted upon the lest Palfrey
in the Universe; a Palfrey whose na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tural
Beauty stood not in need of those
various colour'd Ribbons which braided
his Mane, and were interwoven with
his Tail. Again the chrystal Clarion
founded, and after several courteous
speeches between the black Prince and
Martin, our youthful Philosopher
<pb n="110" facs="123"/>
walk'd into the midst of the room, to
bless his sight with the most beautiful
Curiosity of Nature. On a sudden en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter'd
at another door the two Bohemi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>an
Sisters, whose common parts of Ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neration,
had so closely ally'd them,
that Nature seem'd here to have con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spired
with Fortune, that their lives
should run in an eternal Parallel.</p>
            <p>The Sun had twice eight times per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>form'd
his annual course, since their
Mother brought them into the world
with double pangs. Lindamira's eyes
were of a lively blue; Indamora's were
black and piercing. Lindamira's cheeks
might rival the blush of the morning;
in Indamora the Lilly overcame the
Rose. Lindamira's tresses were of the
paler Gold, while the locks of Inda<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mora
were black and glossy as the
Plumes of a Raven.</p>
            <p>How great is the power of Love in
human breasts! In vain has the Wise
man recourse to his Reason, when the
insinuating Arrow touches his heart,
and the pleasing poison is diffused
through his veins. But then how vio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lent,
<pb n="111" facs="124"/>
how transporting must that pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion
prove, where not only the Fire of
Youth, but the unquenchable Curiosi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty
of a Philosopher, pitch'd upon the
same object! For how much soever
our Martin was enamour'd on her as a
beautiful Woman, he was infinitely
more ravish'd with her as a charming
Monster. What wonder then, if his
gentle Spirit, already humaniz'd by a
polite Education to receive all soft im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pressions,
and fired by the sight of
those beauties so lavishly expos'd to his
view, should prove unable to resist at
once so pleasing a Passion, and so ami<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able
a Phaenomenon?</p>
            <p>Martin, who felt the true emotions
of Love, blush'd that the Object of
his flame should be so openly prostitu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted
to vulgar eyes. And though he
had been permitted to peruse her most
secret charms, yet his honourable pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion
was so strong, that it ran into the
extreme of bashfulness; so that at the
first interview he made no Overtures of
his Love. Pensive he return'd, and
flinging himself on his Couch, pass'd
<pb n="112" facs="125"/>
away the tedious hours of the night in
the utmost Inquietude. The rushy
Taper afforded a glimm'ring light, by
which he contemplated the tender lines
of Ovid; but alas! his Remedy of Love
was no cure for our unhappy Lover's
Anxiety! He closed the amorous vo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lume,
sigh'd, and casting his eyes a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>round
on the Books that adorned his
room, broke forth in this pathetic Apo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>strophe.</p>
            <p>O ye Spirits of Antiquity, who yet
live in those sacred leaves! why do I
make you conscious of my shame? Yet
why should I depreciate the noble Pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion
of Love, and call it Shame? your
Heroes have felt it, your Poets and O<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rators
have prais'd it. Were I ena<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mour'd
on some gaudy Virgin, did I
doat on vulgar Perfection, the Lustre
of an Eye, or the Rose of a Cheek;
with reason might I blush before you,
most learned Inquisitors into Nature!
most reverend Pliny, Aelian, and Al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>drovandus!
Yet sure you cannot disap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prove
of this, which is no wanton Pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion,
but excited by so unparallel'd a
<pb n="113" facs="126"/>
Production; a flame, that may not on<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly
justify itself to the Severity of a Phi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>losopher,
but even to the Avarice of a
Parent; since she who causes it carries
a most plentiful Fortune in the sole Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hibition
of her person. Heavens!
how I wonder at the Stupidity of man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kind,
who can affix the opprobrious
Name of Monstrosity to what is only
Variety of Beauty, and a Profusion of
generous Nature? If there are charms
in one face, one mouth, one body; if
there are charms in two eyes, two
breasts, two arms; are they not all re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doubled
in the Object of my Passion?
What tho'she be the common Gaze of
the multitude, and is follow'd about by
the stupid and ignorant; does she not
herein resemble the greatest Princes,
and the greatest Beauties? only with
this difference, that her Admirers are
more numerous, and more lasting.</p>
            <p>Thus sigh'd he away the melancholy
Night; but no sooner had Aurora,
with blushes in her cheeks (as consci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous
that she was just risen from the
embraces of Tithon) advanc'd through
<pb n="114" facs="127"/>
the purple gates of the east, but Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tin
rose: He rose indeed, but Melan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>choly,
the companion of his slumbers,
rose and wak'd with him. This was
the first day that he amused himself
with the gaudy Ornaments of the bo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dy;
that with secret pleasure he con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>templated
his Face, and the symmetry
of his limbs in a looking-glass. And
now forsaking his solitary apartment,
he walked directly to the habitation
that confined the Object of his desires.
But as it is observ'd that the Curious
never wander into the City to indulge
their thirst of knowledge'till about the
hours of eleven or twelve; the Morn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
has ever been the season of Repose
for all those Animals, who (trapann'd
by the frauds of Men) have been o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blig'd
to change their Woods and Wil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dernesses
for Lodgings in Cities at the
rate of four shillings a week. There<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore
Martin at this early hour was nei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
saluted by the sound of the Trum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pet,
nor were his eyes feasted as before
with the pleasing picture of his Mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stress;
but he walked to and fro before
<pb n="115" facs="128"/>
the door with folded arms, from the
hour of five to eleven, humming in a
low and melancholy tune.</p>
            <p>The Trumpet no sooner sounded,
but his heart leapt for joy, and a se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cond
six-pence gain'd him a second ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mittance
into her apartment. Yet this
day also, he only own'd his Passion in
the language of his Eyes: But alas!
this language is only understood by those
that love, and Lindamira remain'd still
ignorant of his Passion.</p>
            <p>In the mean time it was no small
cause of wonder to Mr. Randal, that
this Gentleman should come every day
to behold the same show. He, no less
covetous than the Guardian of a rich
Heiress, entertain'd a suspicion that
Martin had a design of stealing the La<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dies.
He thereupon issued out strict
Orders, not to admit our Lover on any
pretence whatsoever. What Torments
must this occasion in the raging feaver
of Love! Martin had now recourse to
Stratagem, and by a Bribe (which of<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ten
even the Ermine and Scarlet Robe
cannot resist) gain'd the Dwarf who
<pb n="116" facs="129"/>
kept the gates of the Show-room, to
promote his Amour. He promis'd to
convey a Letter to Lindamira the same
evening, if he would bring it him
when darkness favour'd his design, at
the apartment next the Monsters. Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tin
overjoy'd, hasted home, and after
having consulted all the Authors that
treat of Love, composed his Billet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doux,
and at the time appointed went
to entrust it to the hands of his Confi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dent.
Softly he stole up stairs, approach'd
the door, and gave a gentle rap; when
on a sudden a small hand was thrust
through a little hole at the bottom of
the door, whence issued an unintelli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gible,
squeaking voice. Martin con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cluding
it to be the Signal, delivered
his Epistle, and made his retreat unob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serv'd.
He was no sooner retir'd, but
Mr. Randal enter'd, and (as it was his
usual custom before he went to bed)
took a view if all were safe in the
Show-room. At his coming in, he
saw his Monkey exceedingly busy in
picking the Seal-wax by little bits from
a Letter, which he turn'd over and o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver
<pb n="117" facs="130"/>
with infinite satisfaction. Mr.
Randal, not thinking it a breach of
honour to pry into the secrets of his
own family, took the Letter from him,
and read as follows.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>To the most amiable LINDAMIRA,</head>
                  <p>WHile others, O darling of Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture,
look upon thee with the
eyes of Curiosity, I behold thee with
those of Love. Since I have been
struck with thy most astonishing
Charms, how have I call'd upon Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture
to make a new head, new arms,
and a new body to sprout from this
single Trunk of mine, and to double
every member, so to render me a
proper Mate for so lovely a Pair!
but think to how little purpose it will
be for thee to stay till Nature shall
form another of thy kind! In such
beauties she exhausts her whole art,
and cannot afford to be prodigal. Ages
must be numbred, nay perhaps some
Comet may vitrify this Globe on which
we tread, before we behold a Castor
<pb n="118" facs="131"/>
and a Pollux resembling the beauteous
Lindamira and Indamora. Nature
forms her wonders for the Wise, and
such a Master-piece she could design
for none but a Philosopher. Cease
then to display those beauties to the
prophane Vulgar, which were created
to crown the desires of</p>
                  <closer>
                     <signed>Your Passionate Admirer,

                  </closer>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>The Dwarf enter'd as he was read<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
the Letter, and perceiving his Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ster
mov'd with passion, immediately
fell on his knees and confess'd the
whole affair. Mr. Randal bent on re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venge,
caused him to hasten to Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tin's
house, with assurances that Lin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>damira
had read his Letter with infinite
satisfaction, and conjured him that he
would immediately favour her escape.
Martin overjoy'd at the news, flew thi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
on the Wings of Love. The per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fidious
Dwarf conducted him up stairs
in the dark, gently open'd the door,
<pb n="119" facs="132"/>
and bad him enter. How happy was
Martin in that instant, who thought
of nothing but leaping into the four
soft arms of his Mistress! when lo, on
a sudden he saw at the further end of
the Room two glitt'ring balls of Fire,
which roll'd to and fro in a most terri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble
manner. Immediately his ears were
invaded with horrid hissings and spit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tings,
the balls of Fire drew nearer
him, and the noise redoubled as he ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proach'd.
Our Philosopher bold and
resolute with love, ventur'd towards it;
when all at once he perceiv'd something
grasp him hard by the throat, and fix
as it were sharp lances in his cheek, so
that blood trickled amain down his chin.
Thrice Martin essay'd to free himself,
but vain were all his endeavours: till
at length, to save his life, he was for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ced
to betray his Intrigue, and alarm
the house with reiterated cries of Mur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der.
The apartment of the Bohemian
Beauties being the adjoining Room,
they were the first that enter'd with a
light to his assistance. Martin all bloody
as he was, a most fierce Cat-a-moun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain
<pb n="120" facs="133"/>
hanging at his chin, (which Mr.
Randal had maliciously placed there on
purpose) at the sight of Lindamira
forgot his distress. Ah, my Love! (he
cry'd) how like is thy fate to that of
Thisbe! who staying but a moment too
late, found, as she thought, her mise<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rable
Lover torn in pieces by a Savage
beast! The affrighted Damsels skriek'd
aloud, Mr. Randal with all his Reti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nue
rush'd into the room, and now e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very
hand conspired to free his under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jaw
from the sharp teeth of the enraged-Monster.
But the Lady, whose heart
melted at the piteous Spectacle, was so
zealous in this office of Humanity, that
the Cat-a-mountain, provok'd at her
good-natur'd diligence, leap'd furiously
on her, and wounded three of her hands
and her two noses, to such a barbarous
degree that she was not fit to be shown
publickly for the space of three weeks.
The generous Lover, more wounded
at this Spectacle than at all the scratches
he had himself receiv'd, charg'd the
monster again with the utmost Intre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pidity,
and rescued his mangled Mistress.
<pb n="121" facs="134"/>
Then (having taken her by the hand,
and given it a gentle grasp) he retreated
with his eye fixed upon her, and just
as he left the room (in a low and ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der
Accent) thus breath'd forth his
Soul. <hi>Behold, all this have I suffered
for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such, and so modest was the first
Declaration of Love, made on this e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>minent
occasion by our youthful Philo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sopher.
Nor was it ungently receiv'd by
the simple and innocent Lindamira;
who hitherto unus'd to the soft Protes<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tations
of adoring Slaves, had rather
been wonder'd at than belov'd; and re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceiv'd
but imperfect notions of that ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der
language, from the Addresses only
of the black Prince or the Dwarf.</p>
            <p>Martin, notwithstanding this unfor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tunate
adventure, still pursued his
wishes. His Letters were now no
more intercepted. Lindamira read
them, and behav'd like other courte<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous
dames when they receive those a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>morous
Testimonials; conceal'd them
from her Guardian, and return'd the
most engaging answers. In short, she
<pb n="122" facs="135"/>
was so far captivated, as to resolve no
longer to be gaz'd at like a publick
Beauty in her own Assembly; but re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tire
from the world, and become the
virtuous Mistress of a Family.</p>
            <p>But Fate had so ordain'd, that Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tin
was not more enamoured on Lin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>damira,
than Indamora was on Martin.
She, jealous that her Sister had the
greatest share in this conquest, resented
that an equal application had not been
made to herself. She teiz'd Lindami<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ra
to such a degree on this subject, as
made her promise to see Martin no
more. But then again might Indamo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ra
be deem'd the unhappiest of Women,
whom her Passion and Imprudence had
robb'd of the sight of her Lover. Yet
shame caused her to conceal those anxi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>eties
from her Sister. And let the Rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der
judge how unhappy the Nymph
must be, who was even depriv'd the
universal Relief of a <hi>Soliloquy.</hi> How<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever,
thus she thought, without being
allow'd to tell it to any Grove or pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ling
Stream.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="136"/>
Wretched Indamora! if Lindamira
must never more see Martin, Martin
shall never again bless the eyes of In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>damora:
Yet why do I say wretched?
since my Rival can never possess my
Lover without me. The pangs that
others feel in Absence, from the thought
of those Joys that bless their Rivals,
can never sting thy bosom; nor can
they mortify thee by making thee a
Witness, without giving thee at the
same time a share of their Endear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments.
Change then thy proceeding,
Indamora; thy Jealousy must act a new
and unheard-of part, and promote the
interest of thy Rival, as the only way
to the enjoyment of thy Lover.</p>
            <p>From that moment she studied by all
methods to advance her Sister's Amour,
and in that her own. And thus there
appeared in these three Lovers as ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>traordinary
a Conjunction of Passions
as of Persons: Love had reconcil'd
himself to his mortal foes, to Philoso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phy
in Martin, and to Jealousy in Inda<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mora.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="137"/>
And now flourish'd the Amour of
Martin; Success even prevented his
wishes; the Marriage was agreed on,
and the day appointed. Sunday was
the time when Mr. Randal's Absence
favour'd their hopes, who never on that
day, omitted taking the fresh air in the
fields: The key of the door he always
took with him. <hi>Crambe</hi> was ready
laid at a convenient distance, who ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>commodated
them with a ladder of
ropes. The ladder was thrown up, and
the Signal given at the window. Lin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>damira
hasten'd to the Alarm of Love,
when behold a new Disaster! As she
was getting out of the window, the
weight of her body on one side, and
that of Indamora's on the other, un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>luckily
caused them to stick in the mid<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>way:
Lindamira hung with her coats
stript up to the navel without, and In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>damora
in no less immodest posture
within. The <hi>Manteger,</hi> who for his
gentleness was allowed to walk at large
in the house, was so heighten'd at this
sight, that he rush'd upon Indamora
like a barborous Ravisher. Indamora
<pb n="125" facs="138"/>
cry'd aloud for help. Martin flew to
revenge this insolent attempt, of a Rape
on his wedding-day. The lustful Mon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ster,
driv'n from our double Lucrece,
fled into the middle of the room, pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sued
by the valorous and indignant
Martin. Three times the hot Mante<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ger,
frighted at the furious menaces of
his Antagonist, made a circle round the
chamber, and three times the swift-footed
Martin pursued him. He caught
up the <hi>Horn</hi> of a <hi>Unicorn,</hi> which lay
ready for the entertainment of the cu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rious
spectator, and brandishing it over
his head in airy circles, hurl'd it against
the hairy son of Hanniman; who
wrinkling his brown forehead, and
gnashing his teeth in indignation,
stoop'd low: The horny Lance just
raz'd his left shoulder, and stuck into
the tapestry hangings. Provok'd at this
the grinning Offspring of Hanniman
caught up the pointed <hi>Horn</hi> of an <hi>An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>telope,</hi>
and aim'd a blow against his un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dismay'd
Adversary. Our heroic Lo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver,
who held his hat before him like
a shield, receiv'd the weapon full on
<pb n="126" facs="139"/>
the Crown; it pierc'd the beaver, and
gave a small rent to his breeches. Then
the human Champion flung with mighty
violence the hinder <hi>foot</hi> of an <hi>Elk,</hi>
which hit the bestial Combatant full
on the nether jaw. He reel'd, but
soon recovering, and his skill in war
lying rather in the close fight than in
projectile weapons, he endeavour'd to
close with him: Forthwith assailing
him behind unawares, he clamber'd
up his back, and pluck'd up by the
roots a mighty grasp of hair—but
Martin soon dismounted him, and kept
him at a distance. Love not only in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spired
his breast with Courage, but gave
double strength to his sinews; he heav'd
up the <hi>hand</hi> of a prodigious <hi>Sea-Mon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ster</hi>;
which when the chatt'ring Cham<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pion
beheld, he no less furious, wielded
the pond'rous <hi>Thigh-bone</hi> of a <hi>Giant.</hi>
And now they stood oppos'd to each
other, like the dread Captain of the
sevenfold Shield and the redoubted
Hector. The Thigh-bone miss'd its
aim; but the hand of the Sea-Mon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ster
descended directly on the head of
<pb n="127" facs="140"/>
the Sylvian Ravisher. The Monster
chatter'd horribly; he stretch'd his
quiv'ring limbs on the floor; and eter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nal
sleep lock'd fast his eyelids.</p>
            <p>The Lady from the window, like
another Helen from the Trojan wall,
was witness of the Combat caused by
her own beauty. She saw with what
gracefulness her Hero enter'd the Lists,
admir'd his activity and courage in the
combat, and was a joyful witness of
his Triumph: She gave a spring from
the window, and with open arms and
legs embraced the neck and shoulders
of her Champion. Our Philosopher
receiv'd her with his face turn'd mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>destly
from her, and in that manner
convey'd her into the street. He call'd
a Chair with all haste, but no chairman
would take her; which oblig'd him
to bear his extraordinary burden till he
found a Coach, in which he carried
her off, and was happily united to her
that very evening, by a Reverend Cler<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gyman
in the Fleet, in the holy Bands
of Matrimony.</p>

            <p>BUT <hi>Nemesis,</hi> who delights in tra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versing
the best-laid designs of
Cupid, maliciously contrived the means
to make these three Lovers unhappy.
No sooner had the Master of the Show
receiv'd notice of their flight, but he
seiz'd on the Bohemian Ladies by a
<hi>Warrant</hi>; and not content with having
recover'd the Possession of them, re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>solv'd
to open all the Sluices of the
<hi>Law</hi> upon Martin. So he instantly
went to Council to advise upon all pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sible
methods of revenge.</p>
            <p>The first point he proceeded on was
the <hi>Property</hi> of his Monster, and the
question propounded was, <note place="bottom" n="1">
                  <hi>An Servi possint invitis Dominis Matrimonium con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trahere?</hi>
               </note>
               <q rend="inline">" Whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
<pb n="129" facs="142"/>
Slaves could marry without the
consent of their Master?"</q> To this
he was answer'd in the Affirmative,
but told at the same time, <q rend="inline"> " That <note place="bottom" n="2">
                     <hi>An Servus Matrimonio eximitur a Domini obsequio?</hi>
                  </note>
the Marriage did not exempt them
from Servitude."</q>
            </p>
            <p>This put him in no small hopes of
having Martin added to his <hi>Show,</hi> and
acquiring a property in his <hi>Bodily issue</hi>
by the Ladies. But his joy was soon
dash'd, when he was inform'd, that
since Martin was a Free Man, <note place="bottom" n="3">
                  <hi>An Liberi sequuntur conditionem Patris, an Matris?</hi>
               </note>

same, there being no slavery in Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then his Counsel judg'd it more ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>viseable
to plead for a <hi>Dissolution</hi> of the
<hi>Marriage,</hi> upon the impossibility of
Conjugal dues in the Wife. But then
the <hi>Canon Law</hi> allow'd a <hi>Triennal Co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>habitation,</hi>
which entirely ruin'd this
<pb n="130" facs="143"/>
Project also. Besides it was evident by
the same Law, that <q rend="inline">" Monstrosity could
not incapacitate from Marriage,"</q>
witness the Case of Hermaphrodites,
who are allow'd <q rend="inline">" <hi>Facultatem Conjugii,</hi> provided they <hi>make Election</hi> before

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It was next consulted whether Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tin
should not be permitted to <hi>take a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>way</hi>
his Wife? since upon his so doing
<q rend="inline">" he might be sued for a <hi>Rape</hi> upon

Rape."</q> But then again they consi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der'd,
that Martin might answer he
claim'd nothing but his own; and if
another person had fix'd herself to his
Wife, he must not for that cause be
debarr'd the use of his Property.</p>
            <p>Yet still, upon the same head of
Martin's possessing his spouse, a Suit
might be devis'd in the name of Lin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>damira,
<pb n="131" facs="144"/>
on this account; <note place="bottom" n="3">
                  <hi>Uxor non tenetur vivere cum viro Concubinam te<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nente.</hi>
               </note> That a

                  </note> Proofs."</q> To
this too it was reply'd, that the Law
order'd the Wife to <hi>reside</hi> with the <hi>Hus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>band</hi>
if there were sufficient security
given to expel the Concubine. So
Martin might say he was ready to ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>complish
his part of the Covenant, if
his wife would perform hers, and con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent
to the <note place="bottom" n="5">

an impossibility on the side of the
Wife, it could no way be exacted of
the Husband.</p>
            <p>At length Mr. Randal, being vext at
the heart, to have been so long and so
quaintly disappointed, determin'd to
commence a Suit against Martin for
<hi>Bigamy</hi> and <hi>Incest.</hi> Mean while he
left no Artifice or Address untry'd to
<pb n="132" facs="145"/>
perplex the unhappy Philosopher: He
even contriv'd with infinite cunning, to
alienate Indamora's affections from him;
and debauch'd her into an Intrigue with
a Creature, of his own, the black
Prince; whom he secretly caus'd to
marry her, while her Sister was <hi>asleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon Martin was reduc'd to turn
<hi>Plaintiff,</hi> and commenc'd a Suit in the
<hi>Spiritual Court</hi> against the black Prince,
for Cohabitation with his said wife.
He was advis'd to insist upon a new
Point, (viz.) <q rend="inline">" That Lindamira and
Indamora <hi>together</hi> made up but <hi>one</hi>
lawful wife."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Monster-master, further to di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stress
Martin, forc'd Lindamira to pe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tition
for Aliment, <hi>lite pendente:</hi> which
was no sooner allow'd her by the Court,
but he oblig'd her to alledge, that <q rend="inline">" it
was not sufficient to maintain both
herself and her Sister; and if her
Sister perish'd, she could not live
with the dead body about her."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Martin now began to repent that he
had not executed a resolution he for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merly
conceiv'd, of marrying <hi>Crambe</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="146"/>
to Indamora, as an Expedient to have
made all secure. Moreover, it was in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sisted
on, that the other also had a
right to <hi>Aliment,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">" because if Martin's
Wife should prove with child, the
said Sister must necessarily perform
the <hi>Offices</hi> of a <hi>wife,</hi> in contributing
to the <hi>Nutrition</hi> and <hi>Gestation</hi> of the
said child."</q> A Jury of Physicians
being impannel'd, declar'd, that as to
Nutrition they were doubtful, whether
any blood of Lindamira circulated
through Indamora: But as to Gestati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on,
it was evidently true. And upon
this, Martin was order'd to allow Ali<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
to both, the Black Prince appear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
<hi>insolvent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Court proceeded to the
Trial. And as both the Cause and
the Pleadings are of an extraordinary
Nature, we think sit here to insert
them at length.</p>
            <p>Dr. Penny-feather thus pleaded for
Martinus Scriblerus the Plaintiff.</p>

               <p>Dr. PENNY-FEATHER.</p>
               <p>" I appear before your Honour in
behalf of Martinus Scriblerus, Batch<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>elor
of Physick, in a Complaint a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gainst
Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw, com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monly
called the black Prince of
Monopotapa; Inasmuch as the said
Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw, hath malici<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ously,
forcibly, and unlawfully seiz'd,
ravish'd, and detain'd Lindamira-In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>damora,
the wife of the said Martin,
and the body of the said Lindamira-Indamora,
from time to time ever
since, hath wickedly, leudly, and
indecently us'd, handled, and evil
entreated. And in order to make
this his Villainy more lasting, hath
presum'd to marry this our Wife,
pretending to give his wickedness the
Sanction of a Law. And forasmuch
as the Adulterer doth not deny the
fact, but insists upon his said Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riage
as lawful, we cannot open the
Case more plainly to your Honour,
than by answering his Reasons,
which indeed, to mention, is to
confute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="148"/>
" He maintains no less an absurdity
than this, that <hi>One</hi> is <hi>Two</hi>; and that
Lindamira-Indamora, the individual
wife of the Plaintiff, is not one, but
two Persons: And that the said Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw
is not marry'd to
Lindamira, the wife of the said
Martin, but to his own lawful wife
Indamora, another individual Person
distinct from the said Lindamira,
tho' join'd to her by a strong Liga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
of Nature."</p>
               <p>In answer whereunto, we shall prove
three things: " <hi>First,</hi> that the said
Lindamira-Indamora, now our law<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful
wife, makes but one individual
person." </p>
               <p>" Secondly, that if they made two
individual persons, yet they consti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tute
but one wife." </p>
               <p>" <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that supposing they made
two individual persons, and two
wives, each lawfully marry'd to her
own husband, yet Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw
hath no right to detain
Lindamira our lawfully wedded wife,
<pb n="136" facs="149"/>
on pretence of being marry'd to In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>damora." </p>
               <p>As to the first point: " It will be
necessary to determine the <hi>constituent
Principle</hi> and <hi>Essence</hi> of <hi>Individuality,</hi>
which in respect of mankind, we take
to be one simple identical soul, in
one simple identical body. The in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dividuality,
sameness, or identity of
the body, is not determin'd (as some
vainly imagine) by one head, and a
certain number of arms, legs, and
other members; but in one simple,

               <p>" Let us search Profane History,
and we shall find Geryon with three
heads, and Briareus with an hundred
hands. Let us search Sacred Histo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry,
and we meet with one of the
sons of the Giants with six Fingers
to each Hand, and six Toes to each
Foot; yet none never accounted
Geryon or Briareus more than one
Person: and give us leave to say, the
wife of the said Geryon would have
had a good action against any women
<pb n="137" facs="150"/>
who should have espous'd themselves
to the two other heads of that Mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>narch.
The Reason is plain; be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause
each of these having but one

could be look'd upon but
as one single person."</p>
               <p>" In conformity to this, when we
behold this one member, we distin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guish
the Sex, and pronounce it a
<hi>Man,</hi> or a <hi>Woman</hi>; or, as the La<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tins
express it, <hi>unus Vir, una Mulier,
une Homme, une Femme, One Man,
One Woman.</hi> For the same Reason
Man and Wife are said to be one
Flesh, because united in that part
which constitutes the Sameness and
Individuality of each sex."</p>
               <p>" And as where there is but one
Member of Generation, there is but
one Body, so there can be but one
Soul; because the said Organ of Ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neration
is the Seat of the Soul; and
consequently where there is but one
such Organ, there can be but one
Soul. Let me here say without in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jury
to truth, that no Philosopher,
<pb n="138" facs="151"/>
either of the past or present age,
hath taken more pains to discover
where the Soul keeps her residence,
than the Plaintiff, the learned Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinus
Scriblerus: And after his most
diligent enquiries and experiments,
he hath been verily persuaded, that
the Organ of Generation is the true
and only <hi>Seat of the Soul.</hi> That this
part is seated in the middle, and near
the Center of the whole Body, is
obvious to your Honour's view.
From thence, like the Sun in the
Center of the world, the Soul dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>penses
her warmth and vital influ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence:
Let the Brain glory in the
Wisdom of the aged, the Science of
the learned, the Policy of the states<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man,
and the Invention of the witty;
the accidental Amusements and E<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manations
of the Soul, and mortal
as the Possessors of them! It is to
the Organs of Generation that we
owe Man himself; there the Soul is
employ'd in works suitable to the
Dignity of her Nature, and (as we
<pb n="139" facs="152"/>
may say) sits brooding over ages ye
unborn."</p>
               <p>" We need not tell your Honour,
that it has been the opinion of many
most learned Divines and Philoso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phers,
that the Soul, as well as Bo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dy,
is produc'd <hi>Ex Traduce.</hi> This
doctrine has been defended by argu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments
irrefragable, and accounts for
difficulties, without it, inexplicable.
All which arguments conclude with
equal strength, for the Soul's being
seated in the Organs of Generation.
For since the whole man, both Soul
and Body, is <hi>there</hi> form'd, and since
nothing can operate but where it <hi>is,</hi>
it follows that the Soul must reside
in that individual place, where she
exerts her generative and plastick
Powers."</p>
               <p>" This our Doctrine is confirm'd by
all those Experiments, which con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spire
to prove the absolute Dominion
which that part hath over the whole
Body. We see how many Women,
who are deaf to the perswasions of
the Eloquent, the insinuations of the
<pb n="140" facs="153"/>
Crafty, and the threats of the Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perious,
are easily govern'd by some
poor Logger-head, unfurnish'd with
the least art, but that of making
immediate application to this <hi>Seat
of the Soul.</hi> The impressions made
by the Ear are so distant, and trans<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mitted
thro' so many windings, that
they lose their Energy: But your
Honour, by immediately applying
to the Organ of Generation, acts like
a bold and wife Petitioner, who goes
strait to the <hi>very Throne</hi> and <hi>Judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment-Seat</hi>
of the Monarch."</p>
               <p>" And whereas it is objected, that
here are <hi>two Wills,</hi> and therefore <hi>two</hi>
different <hi>Persons</hi>; we answer, if
Multiplicity of Wills imply'd mul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tiplicity
of Persons, there are few
Husbands but what are guilty of
<hi>Poligamy,</hi> there being in the same
Woman great and notorious diversity
of Wills: A Point which we shall
not need to insist upon before any
marry'd person, much less of your
Honour's Experience."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="154"/>
" Thus have we made good our first
and principal Point; That if the wife
of the Plaintiff, Lindamira-Indamo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ra,
hath but <hi>one</hi> Organ of Genera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
she is but <hi>one individual Person,</hi>
in the truest and most proper sense of
Individuality. And that the matter
of Fact is so, we are willing to put
upon a fair Trial by a Jury of Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trons,
whom your Honour shall
think fit to nominate and appoint,
to inspect the body of the said Lin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>damira-Indamora."</p>
               <p>" <hi>Secondly,</hi> we are to prove, that
though Lindamira-Indamora were
<hi>two</hi> individual Persons, consisting
each of a Soul and Body, yet if they
have but one Organ of Generation,
they can constitute but one Wife.
For, from whence can the <hi>Unity</hi> of
any thing be denominated, but from
that which <hi>constitutes</hi> the <hi>Essence</hi> or
principal <hi>Use</hi> of it? Thus, if a Knife
or Hatchet have but one blade,
though two handles, it will properly
be denominated but one Knife, or
one Hatchet; inasmuch as it hath
<pb n="142" facs="155"/>
but one of that which constitutes
the Essence or principal Use of a
Knife or Hatchet. So if there were
not only one, but twenty <hi>Supposita
Rationalia</hi> with one common Organ
of Generation, that one System
would only make one Wife. Upon
the whole, let not a few Heads,
Legs, or Arms extraordinary, biass
your Honour's Judgment, and de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prive
the Plaintiff of his legal Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perty:
In which right our Client is
so strongly fortify'd, that allowing
both the former Propositions to be
false, and that there were two Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sons,
two Bodies, two Rational Souls,
yea, and two Organs of Generation,
yet would it still be plain in the
third place," </p>
               <p>" That the Defendant, Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw,
can have no Right
to detain from the Plaintiff, his law<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fully
wedded <hi>Wife,</hi> Lindamira.
For, abstracting from the <hi>Priority</hi>
of the marriage of our Client, by
which it would seem he acquir'd a
property in his Wife and <hi>all other</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="156"/>
                  <hi>Matter inseparably annex'd unto her,</hi>
it is evident Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw,
by his marriage to Indamora,
could never acquire any property in
Lindamira; nor can produce any
Cause why both of them should live
with himself, rather than with the
other? Therefore, we humbly hope
your Honour will order the body of
Our said Wife to be restor'd to us,
and due Censure past on the said
Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw."</p>

            <p>Dr. Penny-feather having thus end<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed
his Pleading, was thus answer'd by</p>

               <p>Dr. LEATHERHEAD.</p>
               <p>" I will not trouble your Honour
with any unnecessary Preamble, or
false Colours of Eloquence, which
Truth hath no need of, and which
would prove too thin a Veil for
Falsehood before the penetrating eyes
of your Honour. In answer there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore
to what our learned brother, Dr.
Penny-feather hath asserted, we
shall labour to demonstrate,"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="157"/>
" <hi>First,</hi> That though there were
but one Organ of Generation, yet
are there two distinct persons." </p>
               <p>" <hi>Secondly,</hi> That although there were
but one Organ of Generation, so far
would it be from giving the Plaintiff
any right to the body of Indamora,
the wife of Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw,
that it will subject the Plaintiff to the
penalty of Incest, or of Bigamy." </p>
               <p>" <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We doubt not to prove
that the said Lindamira-Indamora
hath two distinct parts of Generation." </p>
               <p>" And <hi>First</hi> we will show, that nei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
the individual Essence of man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kind,
nor the Seat of the Soul, doth
reside in the Organ of Generation;
and this first from Reason. For un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reasonable
indeed must it be, to
make that the Seat of the Rational
Soul, which alone sets us on a level
with beasts: or to conceive, that the
Essence of Unity and Individuality
should consist in that which is the
Source of Discord and Division. In
a word, what can be a greater ab<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>surdity,
than to affirm Bestiality to
<pb n="145" facs="158"/>
be the Essence of Humanity, Dark<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
the Center of Light, and Fil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thiness
the Seat of Purity?"</p>
               <p>" We could from the authority of
the mos eminent Philosophers of all
ages, confirm this our Assertion; few
of whom ever had the impudence to
degrade this Queen, the Rational
Soul, to the very lowest and vilest
Apartment, or rather Sink of her
whole Palace. But we shall produce
fill a greater Authority than these,
to manifest that personal Individua<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lity
did subsist, when there was no
such generative Carnality."</p>
               <p>" It hath been strenuously maintain'd
by many holy Divines (and particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larly
by Thomas Aquinas) that our
first Parents, in the state of Inno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cence,
did in no wife propagate their
species after the present common
manner of men and beasts: but that
the propagation at that time must
have been by Intuition, Coalition of
Ideas, or some pure and spiritual
manner, suitable to the dignity of
their station. And though the Sexes
<pb n="146" facs="159"/>
were distinguish'd in that State, yet
it is plain it was not by parts, such
as we have at present; since, if our
First Parents had any such, they
must have known it; And it is writ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ten,
that they discover'd them not
till after the Fall; when it is pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bable
those parts were the immediate
Excrescence of Sin, and only grew
forth to render them fitter com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>panions
for those a Beasts among
which they were driven."</p>
               <p>" It is a Maxim in Philosophy, that
<hi>Generatio unius est Corruptio alterius:</hi>
whence it is apparent that the Pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>radisaical
Generation was of a dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent
nature from ours, free from all
Corruption and Imbecility. This
is further corroborated by the Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thority
of those Doctors of the
Church who have asserted, that be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore
the Fall, Adam was endow'd
with a continual uninterrupted Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culty
of Generation; which can be
explain'd of no other than of that
<hi>Intuitive Generation</hi> above said: Since
it is well known to all, the least
<pb n="147" facs="160"/>
skill'd in Anatomy, that the present
(male) part of Generation is utterly
incapable of this continual Faculty."</p>
               <p>" We come now to our <hi>second</hi> point,
wherein the Advocate for the Plain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tiff
asserteth, that if there were two
persons, and one Organ of Generati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on,
this System would constitute but
one Wife. This will put the Plain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tiff
still in a worse condition, and
render him plainly guilty of Bigamy,
Rape, or Incest. For if there be
but one such Organ of Generation,
then both the persons of Lindamira
and Indamora have an equal pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perty
in it; and what is Indamora's
property cannot be dispos'd of with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out
her consent. We therefore
bring the whole to this short issue;
whether the Plaintiff <hi>Martinus
Scriblerus</hi> had the <hi>Consent</hi> of Inda<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mora,
or <hi>not?</hi> If he hath <hi>had</hi> her
consent, he is guilty of <hi>Bigamy</hi>; if
<hi>not,</hi> he is guilty of a <hi>Rape,</hi> or <hi>Incest,</hi>
or <hi>both.</hi>"</p>
               <p>" The Defendant, Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw,
having been lately
<pb n="148" facs="161"/>
baptiz'd, hath with singular modes<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty
abstain'd from Consummation
with his said Wife, until he shall be
satisfy'd from the opinion of your
Honour, his learned Judge, how
far in Law and Conscience he may
proceed: And therefore he cannot
affirm much, nor positively, as to the
structure of the Organ of Generation
of this his wife Indamora. Yet
make we no doubt, that it will upon
inspection appear, that the said Or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gan
is distinct from that of Linda<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mira:
Whereupon we crave to hear
the Report of the Jury of Matrons,
appointed to inspect the body of the
said gentlewoman."</p>
               <p>" And if the Matter of Fact be thus,
give me your Honour's permission
to repeat what hath been said by
the Advocate for the Plaintiff; to
wit, that <hi>Martinus Scriblerus,</hi>
Batchelor in Physick, by this his
Marriage with <hi>Lindamira,</hi> could, in
no wise, acquire any property in the
body of Indamora; not shew any
Cause why this duplicated Wife
<pb n="149" facs="162"/>
Lindamira-Indamora, should abide
with him, rather than with the De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fendant
Prince Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw
of Monomotapa."</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Jury of Matrons having made
their Report, and it appearing from
thence that the Parts of Generation in
Lindamira and Indamora were distinct;
the Judge took time to deliberate, and
the next Court-Day he spoke to this
effect.</p>
            <q rend="inline">
               <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
               <p>" I am of opinion that Lindamira
and Indamora are distinct persons,
and that both the Marriages are
good and valid: Therefore I order
you Martinus Scriblerus, Batchelor
in Physick, and you Ebn-Hai-Paw-Waw,
Prince of Monomotapa, to
cohabit with your wives, and to lie
in bed each on the side of his own
wife. I hope, Gentlemen, you will
seriously consider, that you are under
a stricter Tye than common Bro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thers-in-law;
that being, as it were,
Joint Proprietors of one common

Tenement, you will so behave as
good fellow-lodgers ought to do,
and with great modesty each to his
respective sister-in-law, abstaining
from all further Familiarities than
what Conjugal Duties do naturally
oblige you to. Consider also by
how small limits the Duty and the
Trespass is divided, lest, while ye dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>charge
the duty of Matrimony, <hi>ye</hi>
heedlessly slide into the sin of Adul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tery."</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Sentence pleas'd neither Party;
and Martin appeal'd from the Consisto<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry

the Sentence of the Consistory.</p>
            <p>It was at last brought before a <hi>Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mission</hi>
of <hi>Delegates</hi>; who, having
weigh'd the Case, revers'd the Sentence
of the inferior Courts, and disannull'd
the marriage, upon the following Rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sons:

and at the same time impossible

resolv'd to quit the King<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom.</p>
            <p>But we must not here neglect to
mention, that during the whole Course
of this Process, his continual Atten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dance
on the Courts in his own Cause,
and his invincible Curiosity for all that
past in the Causes of others, gave him
a wonderful insight into this Branch
of Learning, which must be confest to
have been so improved by the Moderns,
as beyond all comparison to exceed the
Ancients. From the day his first Bill
was filed, he began to collect <hi>Reports</hi>;
and before his Suit was ended, he had
time abundantly sufficient to compile a
very considerable Volume. His Anger
at his ill success caus'd him to destroy
the greatest part of these <hi>Reports</hi>; and
only to preserve such, as discover'd most
of the Chicanery and Futility of the
practice. These we have some hopes
to recover, if they were only mislaid at
his Removal; if not, the world will be
enough instructed to lament the loss,
by the only one now publick, viz.
The <hi>Case of</hi> Stradling <hi>and</hi> Stiles, <hi>in an</hi>

               <hi>Action concerning certain</hi> black <hi>and</hi>

            <p>We cannot wonder that he contrac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted
a violent Aversion to the <hi>Law,</hi> as
is evident from a whole Chapter of his
Travels. And perhaps his Disappoint<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
gave him also a Dis-inclination to
the <hi>Fair Sex,</hi> for whom on some oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>casions
he does not express all the Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spect
and Admiration possible. This
doubtless must be the Reason, that in
no part of his <hi>Travels</hi> we find him be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lov'd
by any <hi>strange Princess</hi>; nor
have we the least account that he ever
relaps'd into this Passion, except what
is mention'd in the Introduction, of the

            </p>
            <p>It was in the year 1699 that Martin
set out on his <hi>Travels.</hi> Thou wilt
certainly be very curious to know what
they were? It is not yet time to inform
thee. But what hints I am at liberty
to give, I will.</p>
            <p>Thou shalt know then, that in his
first Voyage he was carry'd by a pros<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perous
Storm, to a Discovery of the
<pb n="154" facs="167"/>
Remains of the ancient <hi>Pygmaean</hi> Em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pire.</p>
            <p>That in his second, he was as happily
shipwreck'd on the Land of the <hi>Giants,</hi>
now the most humane people in the
world.</p>
            <p>That in his third Voyage, he dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cover'd
a whole Kingdom of <hi>Philoso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phers,</hi>
who govern by the <hi>Mathematicks</hi>;
with whose admirable Schemes and
Projects he return'd to benefit his own
dear Country, but had the misfortune
to find them rejected by the envious
Ministers of <hi>Queen Anne,</hi> and himself
sent treacherously away.</p>
            <p>And hence it is, that in his fourth
Voyage he discovers a Vein of Melan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>choly
proceeding almost to a Disgust of
his Species; but above all, a mortal
Detestation to the whole flagitious Race
of <hi>Ministers,</hi> and a final Resolution
not to give in any <hi>Memorial</hi> to the <hi>Se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cretary
of State,</hi> in order to subject the
Lands he discover'd to the <hi>Crown</hi> of
<hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if, by these hints, the Reader
can help himself to a further discovery
<pb n="155" facs="168"/>
of the Nature and Contents of these
Travels, he is welcome to as much light
as they afford him; I am oblig'd by all
the tyes of honour not to speak more
openly.</p>
            <p>But if any man shall ever see such

Philosopher of Ultimate Causes,</hi> since by
a Sagacity peculiar to himself, he hath
discover'd Effects in their very Cause;
and without the trivial helps of Experi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments,
or Observations, hath been the
Inventor of most of the modern Systems
and Hypotheses.</p>
            <p>He hath enrich'd Mathematicks
with many precise and Geometrical
<hi>Quadratures</hi> of the <hi>Circle.</hi> He first
<pb n="158" facs="171"/>
discover'd the <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>Gravity,</hi> and the
intestine <hi>Motion</hi> of <hi>Fluids.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To him we owe all the observations
on the <hi>Parallax</hi> of the <hi>Pole-Star,</hi> and
all the new <hi>Theories</hi> of the <hi>Deluge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He it was, that first taught the right
use sometimes of the <hi>Fuga Vacui,</hi> and
sometimes of the <hi>Materia Subtilis,</hi> in
resolving the grand Phaenomena of Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture.</p>
            <p>He it was, that first found out the
<hi>Palpability</hi> of <hi>Colours</hi>; and by the de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>licacy
of his Touch, could distinguish
the different Vibrations of the hetero<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>geneous
Rays of Light.</p>
            <p>His were the Projects of <hi>Perpetuum
Mobiles, Flying Engines,</hi> and <hi>Pacing
Saddles</hi>; the Method of discovering the
<hi>Longitude,</hi> by <hi>Bomb-Vessels,</hi> and of in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>creasing
the <hi>Trade-Wind</hi> by vast plan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tations
of <hi>Reeds</hi> and <hi>Sedges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall mention only a few of his
Philosophical and Mathematical Works.<list>
                  <item>1. A compleat Digest of the Laws
of Nature, with a Review of those that
are obsolete or repealed, and of those
<pb n="159" facs="172"/>
that are ready to be renew'd and put in
force.</item>
                  <item>2. A Mechanical Explication of the
Formation of the Universe, according
to the Epicurean Hypothesis.</item>
                  <item>3. An Investigation of the Quantity
of real Matter in the Universe, with the
proportion of the specifick Gravity of
solid Matter to that of fluid.</item>
                  <item>4. Microscopical Observations of the
Figure and Bulk of the constituent
Parts of all fluids. A Calculation of
the proportion in which the Fluids of
the earth decrease, and of the period in
which they will be totally exhausted.</item>
                  <item>5. A Computation of the Duration
of the Sun, and how long it will last
before it be burn'd out.</item>
                  <item>6. A Method to apply the Force a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rising
from the immense Velocity of
<hi>Light</hi> to mechanical purposes.</item>
                  <item>7. An answer to the question of a
curious Gentleman; How long a <hi>New
Star</hi> was lighted up before its appear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance
to the Inhabitants of our earth?
To which is subjoin'd a Calculation,
how much the Inhabitants of the <hi>Moon</hi>
                     <pb n="160" facs="173"/>
eat for Supper, considering that they
pass a Night equal to fifteen of our
natural days.</item>
                  <item>8. A Demonstration of the natural
Dominion of the Inhabitants of the
Earth over those of the Moon, if ever
an intercourse should be open'd be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween
them. With a Proposal of a
<hi>Partition-Treaty,</hi> among the earthly
Potentates, in case of such discovery.</item>
                  <item>9. Tide-Tables, for a Comet, that is
to approximate towards the Earth.</item>
                  <item>10. The Number of the Inhabitants
of London determin'd by the Reports
of the Gold-finders, and the Tonnage
of their Carriages; with allowance for
the extraordinary quantity of the <hi>Ingesta</hi>
and <hi>Egesta</hi> of the people of England,
and a deduction of what is left under
dead walls, and dry ditches.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>It will from hence be evident, how
much all his Studies were directed to
the universal Benefit of Mankind.
Numerous have been his Projects to this
end, of which <hi>Two</hi> alone will be suf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficient
to show the amazing Grandeur
<pb n="161" facs="174"/>
of his Genius. The first was a Propo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sal,
by a general contribution of all
Princes, to pierce the first crust or <hi>Nu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cleus</hi>
of this our <hi>Earth,</hi> quite through,
to the next concentrical Sphere: The
advantage he propos'd from it was, to
find the <hi>Parallax</hi> of the <hi>Fixt Stars</hi>;
but chiefly to refute Sir Isaac Newton's
Theory of <hi>Gravity,</hi> and Mr. Halley's
of the <hi>Variations.</hi> The second was, to
build <hi>Two Poles</hi> to the <hi>Meridian,</hi> with
immense Light-houses on the top of
them; to supply the defect of Nature,
and to make the Longitude as easy to
be calculated as the Latitude. Both
these he could not but think very prac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticable,
by the Power of all the Poten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tates
of the World.</p>
            <p>May we presume after these to men<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
how he descended from the su<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blime
to the beneficial parts of Know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge,
and particularly his extraordinary
practice of <hi>Physick.</hi> From the Age;
Complexion, or Weight of the person
given, he contrived to prescribe at a dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>
               <gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">
                  <desc>illegible</desc>
               </gap>ance,
as well as at a Patient's bed-side.
He taught the way to many mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dern
<pb n="162" facs="175"/>
Physicians, to cure their Patients
by <hi>Intuition,</hi> and to others to cure <hi>with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out
looking on them at all.</hi> He projec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted
a Menstruum to dissolve the Stone,
made of Dr. Woodward's <hi>Universal
Deluge-water.</hi> His also was the device
to relieve Consumptive or Asthmatick
persons by bringing fresh Air out of
the Country to Town, by pipes of the
nature of the Recipients of Air-pumps:
And to introduce the Native air of a
man's country into any other in which
he should travel, with a seasonable In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tromission
of such Steams as were most
familiar to him; to the inexpressible
comfort of many Scotsmen, Laplan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders,
and white Bears.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Physiognomy,</hi> his penetration is
such, that from the <hi>Picture</hi> only of any
person, he can write his <hi>Life</hi>; and
from the features of the Parents, draw
the Portrait of any Child that is to be
born.</p>
            <p>Nor hath he been so enrapt in these
Studies, as to neglect the Polite Arts
of Painting, Architecture, Musick,
Poetry, &amp;c. It was he that gave the
<pb n="163" facs="176"/>
first hint to our modern <hi>Painters,</hi> to
improve the <hi>Likeness</hi> of their Portraits
by the use of such <hi>Colours</hi> as would
faithfully and constantly accompany the
<hi>Life,</hi> not only in its present state, but
in all its alterations, decays, age, and
death itself.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Architecture,</hi> he builds not with
so much regard to present symmetry or
conveniency, as with a Thought well
worthy a true lover of Antiquity, to
wit, the noble effect the Building will
have to posterity, when it shall fall and
become a Ruin.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Musick,</hi> I think Heidegger has
not the face to deny that he has been
much beholden to his Scores.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Poetry,</hi> he hath appear'd under a
hundred different names, of which we
may one day give a Catalogue.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Politicks,</hi> his Writings are of a
peculiar Cast, for the most part Iro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nical,
and the Drift of them often so
delicate and refin'd as to be mistaken
by the vulgar. He once went so far
as to write a Persuasive to people to
eat their own Children, which was so
<pb n="164" facs="177"/>
little understood as to be taken in ill
part. He has often written against
<hi>Liberty</hi> in the name of <hi>Freemen</hi> and
<hi>Algernoon Sydney,</hi> in vindication of the
Measures of <hi>Spain</hi> under that of <hi>Ra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>leigh,</hi>
and in praise of <hi>Corruption</hi> under
those of <hi>Cato,</hi> and <hi>Publicola.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, that at his last departure
from England, in the Reign of Queen
<hi>Anne,</hi> apprehending lest any of these
might be perverted to the Scandal of
the weak, or Encouragement of the
flagitious, he cast them all, without
mercy, into a Bog-house near <hi>St.
James</hi>'s. Some however have been
with great diligence recover'd, and
fish'd up with a hook and line by the
Ministerial Writers, which make at
present the great Ornaments of their
works.</p>
            <p>Whatever he judg'd beneficial to
Mankind, he constantly communica<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted
(not only during his stay among us,
but ever since his absence) by some
method or other in which Ostentation
had no part. With what incredible
Modesty he conceal'd himself, is known
<pb n="165" facs="178"/>
to numbers of those to whom he ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dress'd
sometimes Epistles, sometimes
Hints, sometimes whole Treatises, Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vices
to Friends, Projects to First Mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nisters,
Letters to Members of Parlia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,
Accounts to the Royal Society,
and innumerable others.</p>
            <p>All these will be vindicated to the
true Author, in the Course of these
Memoirs. I may venture to say they
cannot be unacceptable to any, but to
those, who will appear too much con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cern'd
as <hi>Plagiaries,</hi> to be admitted as
<hi>Judges.</hi> Wherefore we warn the pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lick,
to take particular notice of all
such as manifest any indecent Passion
at the appearance of this Work, as Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sons
most certainly involved in the
Guilt.</p>
