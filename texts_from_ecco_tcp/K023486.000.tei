            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>ISAIAH xi. 9.</bibl> They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
Mountain: For the Earth shall be full of
the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters
cover the Sea.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Passage of Scripture is understood,
by all Christian Interpreters, to refer
to the Days of the Gospel. The Prophet is
describing in the Context the Influence of the
<hi>Messiah</hi>'s Reign, extending thro' all Nature,
and producing universal Happiness. This, in
its full Accomplishment, doubtless, is yet fu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture,
and respects some more advanced Period
<pb n="2" facs="3"/>
of the Kingdom of God, foretold in other Pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sages
of the prophetick Writings; when true
Religion shall universally prevail, and the na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive
Tendency of the Gospel attain its entire
Effect. In the Prospect of this, the Prophet
seems to rise above himself, and celebrates those
happy Days in the most sublime, figurative
Strain of Eastern Poetry. He opens a beau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tiful
View of the State of the World, as a State
of returning Innocence. He represents all Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture
flourishing in Peace; Discord and Guile
abolished; the most hostile Natures reconciled,
and the most savage tamed and reformed. <hi>The
Wolf also shall dwell with the Lamb; and the
Leopard shall ly down with the Kid: And the
Calf and the young Lion, and the Fatling toge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther,
and a little Child shall lead them. And the
Cow and the Bear shall feed, their young Ones
shall ly down together; and the Lion shall eat
Straw like the Ox; and the sucking Child shall
play on the Hole of the Asp, and the weaned Child
shall put his Hand on the Cockatrice Den. They
shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy Moun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain:
For</hi> (assigning in the Text the Cause of
this great and happy Revolution) <hi>the Earth shall
be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Wa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters
cover the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="4"/>
UPON reading these Words, we must imme<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diately
perceive the great <hi>Encouragement</hi> they
give to all good Designs, for promoting Reli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gion
in the World. When we engage in this
Cause, we have the Comfort, not only of be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
engaged in a <hi>good</hi> Cause, but also in one
that will undoubtedly be <hi>successful.</hi> For we
are here assured, by the Divine Promise, that
Truth and Goodness shall at length prevail,
and the increasing Light and Influence of
Religion prove the Cause of general Order
and Happiness. It is a noble and animating
Thought, that, in such Designs, we co-ope<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rate
with God for advancing the Kingdom of
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and work upon his Plan with all
the Force of eternal Providence on our Side.
Nor ought we to be discouraged by those un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>favourable
Circumstances, which at present
seem to make against us. Tho' the Ignorance,
Superstition and Corruption that now fill so
much of the World, have a dark and mysterious
Aspect, it is not beyond the Power of that su<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>preme
Being, who brings Light out of Dark<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness,
to unravel all those perplexed Appearan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces,
and gradually to extricate Mankind from
the Labyrinth of Vice and Error. From the
<pb n="4" facs="5"/>
               <hi>present</hi> State of the World, it is not more un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>likely,
that the Gospel shall one Day be univer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sally
received, and exert its <hi>entire</hi> Influence on
the Hearts of Men; than <hi>once</hi> it was, that it
should reach <hi>so far,</hi> and demolish <hi>so much</hi> e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stablished
Superstition as it has <hi>already</hi> done.
At the Rise of Christianity, there was as great
a Disproportion betwixt the apparent human
Causes, and the Effect which has been <hi>actually</hi>
produced, as there is, in our Times, betwixt
the Circumstances of Religion in the World,
and the Effect which we <hi>farther</hi> expect. The
<hi>Sun of Righteousness</hi> having exerted its Influence
so far, in breaking thro' the thickest Darkness,
we may justly hope, that it is powerful enough
to dispel all remaining Obscurity, and that it
will ascend by Degrees to that <hi>perfect Day,</hi>
when <hi>Healing shall be under its Wings</hi> to all the
Nations. <hi>A little One shall become a Thousand,
and a small One a strong Nation: I the Lord will
hasten it in its Time</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Isa. lx. 22.</note>.</p>
            <p>BESIDES this <hi>Encouragement</hi> to our Endea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vours
for advancing Religion, there is to be
observed in the Text, a precise <hi>Connection</hi> mark<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="6"/>
betwixt the Increase of religious Knowledge
and the Happiness of Mankind. <hi>The Know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge
of the Lord filling the Earth,</hi> is distinctly
assigned as the <hi>Cause,</hi> why <hi>they shall not hurt nor
destroy in all God's holy Mountain.</hi> To this I
am principally to lead your Thoughts; as a Sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject
properly suited to the Occasion of our Meet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing,
and peculiarly <hi>necessary,</hi> as I conceive, to
be inculcated, in the present Times, which seem
to be waxing indifferent, more and more, to all
religious Principles. Whether Christianity shall
be propagated further or not, is treated as a
Matter of no great Concern to Mankind. O<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pinions
prevail, that moral Virtue may subsist,
with equal Advantage, independent of Religi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on.
For <hi>moral Principles</hi> great Regard is pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tended:
But <hi>Articles of religious Belief</hi> are
thought abstract Things; remote from Life;
Points of mere Speculation and Debate; of very
inconsiderable Influence on the Actions of
Men. The general Conduct of Mankind, it
is argued, will always proceed upon Principles
and Views of another Nature; and therefore,
religious Knowledge stands in no necessary
Connection with their Improvement or Hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piness.
Fact and Experience is alledged for
<pb n="6" facs="7"/>
this. Even amongst many, who would not be
ranged on the Side of Unbelief, this loose and
indifferent Spirit too much prevails; and hence,
the Profession of Religion amongst us is too
visibly sinking into Disrepute. How adverse
all this is to the Design which the present Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>course
is intended to recommend, needs not be
said. How adverse it is to the general Welfare
and most real Interests of Mankind, I hope,
shall be made evident to candid Minds.</p>
            <p>BY the <hi>Knowledge of the Lord,</hi> is not to be
understood the natural Knowledge of God only.
It is plain, the Prophet speaks of those Times
of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> when more enlarged Discoveries
should be made to Mankind of the Divine Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fections,
and of the Measures of the Divine Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ministration,
than mere unassisted Reason could
reach. Our natural Notices of God and Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ligion
are not laid aside by Christianity, but
cleared from Error, confirmed by higher Evi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dence,
and carried into a wider Field. In this
<hi>enlarged</hi> Sense of religious Knowledge, to make
its Importance to the Happiness of Mankind
appear, let us consider Man,<list>
                  <pb n="7" facs="8"/>
                  <item>I. As an <hi>Individual,</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>AND II. As a <hi>Member of Society.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. CONSIDERING Man, in his single Capa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>city,
as an <hi>Individual,</hi> our Inquiry shall here
begin, of what <hi>Importance</hi> it is to him to have
just and true Principles of religious Belief. This
divides itself unto two grand Branches: With
respect, first, to his <hi>Improvement;</hi> and next, to
his <hi>Consolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As to the real <hi>Improvement</hi> of Man; the
Advancement of his Nature in what is morally
valuable and useful; the Acquisition of such
Dispositions and Habits, as fit him for acting
his Part well on this Stage, and prepare him
for a higher State of Life and Action hereaf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter:
What Benefit does he receive, in these
Respects, from religious Knowledge and Belief?
It must be obvious, that all Increase of Know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge
is Improvement to the <hi>Understanding.</hi>
The further its Sphere extends, the more Ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jects
that are submitted to its View and Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>templation,
especially when those Objects are
of intrinsick <hi>Excellence,</hi> the more that under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>standing
Power, which is the Glory of Man,
<pb n="8" facs="9"/>
is in the Course of attaining its proper Strength
and Maturity. Hence <hi>Truth</hi> is justly said to be
<hi>the Food of the Soul.</hi> But were the Knowledge
of Religion merely speculative, tho' the Specu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lation
must be allowed to be noble, yet less
could be said of its Importance. We recom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mend
it to Mankind, as forming their <hi>Hearts.</hi>
Pure and exalted Conceptions of the Deity,
such as Religion gives us;‚ÄîThe universal Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
and righteous Governor of the Universe;‚Äîthe
Author of <hi>every good and perfect Gift;</hi> him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self
the Standard of unspotted Perfection and
Goodness;‚Äîconducting his whole Administra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
with an eternal Regard to Order, Virtue
and Truth;‚Äîever favouring the Cause, and
supporting the Interests of Righteousness, and
righteous Men;‚Äîand applying to this the whole
Force of Omnipotence, and the whole Art of
unerring Wisdom, from the Beginning to the
End of Things:‚ÄîSuch Conceptions of the Dei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty
naturally descend into the Heart; kindle in
it the <hi>Love</hi> of Goodness, and establish a Persua<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion
of its being our highest <hi>Interest.</hi> They
give a peculiar <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Fortitude</hi> to the
Mind in the Practice of Virtue; and they pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mote
a chearful <hi>Acquiescence</hi> in this supremely
<pb n="9" facs="10"/>
wise and righteous Administration, <hi>whatever</hi>
Trials and Sufferings may arise.</p>
            <p>ALL the Doctrines <hi>peculiar</hi> to Christian Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>velation
are great Improvements of what the
Light of Nature imperfectly suggests. A Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pensation
of Providence is made known to us,
particularly suited to the Exigencies of Man:
Calculated for recovering him from that cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rupt
and guilty State, into which, <hi>Experience</hi>
bears Witness that he is fallen, and restoring
him to a State of Integrity and Favour with his
Creator. The Method of carrying on this
great Plan is such as gives us the most affecting
Views of the <hi>Importance</hi> of Holiness and Good<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness,
and of the <hi>high Account</hi> in which it stands
with God. The Son of God appearing on the
Earth, and dying as a <hi>Propitiation for the Sins
of the World,</hi> that he might <hi>bring in everlasting
Righteousness</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Dan. ix. 24.</note>; that he might <hi>purge our Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sciences
from dead Works, to serve the living
God</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="‚Ä†">Heb. ix. 14.</note>; <hi>that he might redeem us from all Ini<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quity,
and purify unto himself a peculiar People,
zealous of good Works</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="‚Äñ">Tit. ii. 14.</note>. Such a gracious and
merciful Interposition of the Creator of the
<pb n="10" facs="11"/>
World, so distinguishing a Proof of his Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cern
for the moral Interests of Mankind, is
most proper to warm the Heart with <hi>Devoti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on;</hi>
and <hi>adds</hi> to the Cause of Goodness the
Force of every Motive from <hi>Gratitude</hi> and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>genuous
Affection. These Discoveries of the
Gospel have this further Effect, to establish an
unshaken Confidence in God. They afford
something to the Mind, on which it can lay
hold as the <hi>Security</hi> of its Hope; when, with
a Certainty far beyond that of mere <hi>abstract
Argument,</hi> it appeals to <hi>Matter of Fact;</hi> and
is taught to say, <hi>He that spared not his own Son,
but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not
with him also freely give us all Things</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Rom. viii. 32.</note>? Hence
the great Encouragement to the <hi>Repentance</hi> and
Reformation of Sinners, from the Hope of
Acceptance with God thro' JESUS CHRIST,
and from the Belief of a Divine Assistance
communicated to the Upright in Heart. Whilst
the Government of God is thus rendered most
<hi>amiable,</hi> placed in a Light most encouraging to
every virtuous Mind; there is, at the same
Time, something extremely <hi>awful</hi> and <hi>solemn</hi>
in the whole Doctrine of the <hi>Redemption.</hi> It
<pb n="11" facs="12"/>
naturally strikes the Mind with Reverence for
the Divine Law; pointing at some <hi>deep</hi> Malig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity
in Sin, some dreadful Consequences flow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
from it, <hi>unknown</hi> perhaps in their Causes,
and in their <hi>whole</hi> Extent, to the human Mind,
which moved the Creator of the World to de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>part
from the ordinary Laws of Providence,
and to undertake the Restoration of guilty Crea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tures,
by a Method so astonishing. Hence,
Mankind are <hi>awakened</hi> to serious Reflection.
Hence, such Views arise of the Laws under
which they are placed, and of the Ends of Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
they are bound to fulfil, as give <hi>Solemnity</hi>
to Virtue, and restrain them from trifling with
Life: Especially, when to this is joined the Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>covery
of <hi>Life and Immortality</hi> by the Gospel;
the Connection in which this Life stands with
a future eternal State, for which we are now
under Probation; in a Course of Discipline;
which, according as by Divine Assistance it
terminates in our Improvement in Virtue, or,
thro' our own Misconduct, leaves us in a cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rupt
unimproved State, will dismiss us to lasting
Abodes either of Punishment or Reward. This
is far above those faint interrupted Hopes, those
feeble ineffectual Reasonings, which mere na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tural
<pb n="12" facs="13"/>
Light suggests, concerning the future Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dition
of Mankind. Here we find, what alone
can be of any considerable Weight with Men
in Practice,‚Äîdirect Promise and Threatning,‚Äîan
authoritative Sanction given to a Law,‚Äîthe
Governor revealed,‚Äîand the Motives addressed
to Hope and Fear, urged home on the Mind
by, <hi>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> Nor are Cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstances
wanting to impress the <hi>Imagination</hi>
in the liveliest Manner. The Resurrection of
the Body, the Solemnity of a future Judgment,
the decisive Sentence, the final Separation, and
the everlasting Mansions of the Good and the
Bad, are all set forth in strong and affecting Co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lours.
In short, a great and magnificent <hi>Plan</hi>
of Divine Administration is in Part opened;
and nothing is omitted that may give Mankind
the deepest Sense of their being all the Subjects
of the <hi>moral Government</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>THE Bounds of this Discourse have allowed
me to give but an imperfect View of the great
Principles of Religion. From these Hints, how<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever,
we may recollect so much of the Christi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>an
Doctrine, as will be a sufficient Foundation
for an Appeal to every impartial Mind, whether
<pb n="13" facs="14"/>
the <hi>Knowledge,</hi> the real and firm <hi>Belief</hi> of these
Principles of Religion, be not strictly connected
with the <hi>Improvement</hi> of Man; and thereby of
the highest Importance to his <hi>Happiness.</hi> I rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son
now with those who admit, that to be vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tuous
and good is real Improvement and Hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piness.
Let them lay what Stress they will
upon Conscience, upon its natural Authority
within, and the Force and Evidence of its Dic<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tates:
Obstinate sure they must be, who will
not grant, that the natural Tendency of these
religious Principles is to <hi>support</hi> the Dictates,
and <hi>confirm</hi> the Authority of Conscience; to
<hi>awaken,</hi> on various Occasions, the most useful
Feelings; to provide <hi>additional</hi> Restraints from
Vice, and <hi>additional</hi> Motives to every Virtue.
Who dares say, that there is no Case in which
Conscience stands in real <hi>Need</hi> of such Assist<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance,
to <hi>direct,</hi> where there is so much Uncer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tainty
and Darkness; and to <hi>prompt,</hi> where
there is so much Feebleness and Irresolution,
and such a fatal Proneness to Vice and Folly?</p>
            <p>BUT how good soever the <hi>Tendency</hi> of reli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gious
Principles may be, their <hi>actual</hi> Significan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cy
and Influence on Life will still be called in
<pb n="14" facs="15"/>
Question. This <hi>Tendency</hi> is by various Causes
defeated: Betwixt the <hi>Belief</hi> of religious Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciples,
and correspondent <hi>Practice,</hi> it will be
said, that Experience shows there is no neces<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sary
Connection; nor can the Propagation of
the <hi>one</hi> at all assure us, that proportionable Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>provements
will follow in the <hi>other.</hi>‚ÄîThis is
in Part allowed: As we allow, that Knowledge
and Belief admit of various Degrees, before they
arrive at that Christian Faith, which the Scrip<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture
represents as certainly <hi>purifying the Heart.</hi>
But, tho' the Connection be not <hi>necessary</hi> be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>twixt
Knowledge and Practice, I hope it will
not be denied, that <hi>some</hi> Connection there is.
Here there is <hi>one</hi> Avenue to the Heart. If
the <hi>Tendency</hi> of religious Knowledge be good,
Wisdom must direct, and Duty oblige us to cul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tivate
it. For <hi>Tendency</hi> will, at least in <hi>some</hi>
Cases, become <hi>effectual;</hi> in <hi>more</hi> Cases, proba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bly,
than are taken notice of amidst the Hurry
of the World. Besides the <hi>known</hi> and <hi>distin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guished</hi>
Examples of true Religion and Virtue,
which, in every Age of Christianity, have shone,
more or less, as <hi>Lights of the World:</hi> How ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny
may there be, in the more <hi>silent</hi> Scenes of
Life, overlooked by superficial Observers of
<pb n="15" facs="16"/>
Mankind, on whose Hearts and Lives religious
Principles have a great and happy Influence?
Even on loose and giddy Minds, where they
are far from operating their full Effect, their
Influence is not altogether lost. Religious Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciples
are at least a <hi>Clog</hi> on Vice in its Career;
they stop it from going its <hi>full</hi> Length; and,
tho' they do not entirely reform the Mind, are
however the Means of preserving external Or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der,
and giving a Check to open Profligateness
and Dissolution of Manners. Men, that are
now <hi>bad,</hi> might probably have been <hi>worse</hi>
without them; and the World have suffered
more from their Licentiousness. Besides, they
often sow latent Seeds of Goodness in the
Heart, which proper Circumstances and Occa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions
ripen; when the Reformation of the Of<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fender,
perhaps, is not so conspicuous to the
World, as his former bad Manners have been.
From the <hi>native</hi> Tendency of religious Know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge
there is Reason to believe, that those
good Effects of it are not <hi>so rare,</hi> as some would
persuade us; especially, when we consider it
as accompanied with a <hi>Divine Blessing.</hi> By the
Nature and plain Tendency of a Thing, it is
more reasonable to judge of it, than to lay the
<pb n="16" facs="17"/>
               <hi>whole</hi> Stress on Observations drawn from a <hi>sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed</hi>
Experience, which often is narrow in its
Compass, and fallacious in its Conclusions.
One great Cause of the Tendency of Religion
being often defeated, certainly is, that the
Knowledge of Divine Things is not thoroughly
imbibed, nor the Belief of them fully received.
Were a just Sense and a firm Persuasion of them
more general amongst Men, we may rationally
hope their good Effects would more extensively
appear.</p>
            <p>I ADMIT indeed, that mere Knowledge will
prove unavailing against the Power of <hi>Temper</hi>
and settled <hi>Habits:</hi> These, 'tis said, govern the
Life of Men far more than religious Belief, and
will be too hard for all Principles whatever.
Perhaps this is said with Truth. But then we
ought to consider, that it is the Nature of Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ligion
to work itself gradually into the Affecti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons,
to acquire the <hi>Dominion</hi> of the Temper,
and so to give Rise to Habits of acting. Hence
the Perfection of religious Influence is, with
great Justice and Propriety, described in Scrip<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture,
by a <hi>new Heart and a new Spirit;</hi> when
the Mind is not involuntarily constrained by
<pb n="17" facs="18"/>
Principle, but Principle forms the inward Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stitution,
and becomes, in a Manner, the <hi>same</hi>
with Temper and Affection.</p>
            <p>BUT the <hi>actual</hi> Influence of Principle and
Belief on Mankind admits of further Illustra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
from <hi>uncontested</hi> Matter of Fact. They
who hold the good Influence of Christian Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciples
to be <hi>so inconsiderable,</hi> as to render the
Propagation of them of no great Importance,
will be at no Loss to give us Instances of cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rupt
and wrong Principles having had a <hi>great</hi>
Influence on the World. Loud Complaints
we hear from this Quarter, of the direful <hi>Ef<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fects</hi>
which <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> have
produced; how they have <hi>poisoned</hi> the Tempers,
and <hi>transformed</hi> the Manners of Men; and
have <hi>overcome</hi> the strongest Restraints of Law,
of Reason and Humanity.‚ÄîIs this then the
Case, that <hi>all</hi> Principles, <hi>except good ones,</hi> are
supposed to be of such mighty <hi>Energy?</hi> Strange!
that false Religion should do <hi>so much,</hi> and true
Religion <hi>so little.</hi>‚ÄîNo impartial Inquirer,
sure, can be of such an absurd Opinion. The
whole History of Mankind shows, that religi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous
Belief is no inconsiderable Principle of
<pb n="18" facs="19"/>
Action. The Mischief such Belief has done,
when misled, is indeed a good Argument to be
on our Guard against Error: But, as it is a
Proof of what Belief <hi>can</hi> do, it is an Argument
to hope the more from it, when rightly direct<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed.
The <hi>same</hi> Torrent that overflows and lays
waste a Country, when put out of its natural
Course, enriches the Soil, when it runs in its
proper Bed. If it be alledged, that <hi>Superstition</hi>
is the more powerful Principle, by falling in
with the weak and corrupt Propensities of
Mankind; it may be opposed to this, that
<hi>Truth</hi> has the Divine Blessing, and the Coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tenance
of Heaven, on its Side. Let us always
hope well of a Cause that is good in itself, and
beneficial to Mankind. Truth is mighty, and
will prevail. Let us spread the <hi>incorruptible
Seed</hi> as widely as we can, and trust in God, that
<hi>he will give the Increase.</hi> So much for the Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>portance
of religious Knowledge to every In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dividual,
in the Way of <hi>Improvement.</hi> Let us
next consider,</p>
            <p>2. WHAT it promises in the Way of <hi>Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>solation,</hi>
of Aid and Relief to Man, amidst the
Distresses of Life. Here it must be allowed by
<pb n="19" facs="20"/>
all, that Religion triumphs; and its valuable
Influence in this Respect, must be a strong
Argument to every benevolent Mind, for wish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
that Influence to be further spread thro'
the World. For, without religious Principle
and Hope, Man is a Creature <hi>miserable</hi> and
<hi>forlorn.</hi> He finds himself here a <hi>Stranger</hi> in a
wide World, where the Powers and Operations
of Nature are very imperfectly known; where
both the Causes and the Issues of Things are
wrapt up in much Darkness; where he is quite
at a Loss, or at best can form only an uncer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain
Guess, whence he comes; for what Pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose
he was brought unto this State of Being;
and whither he is to go, when he departs from
hence. What a <hi>disconsolate</hi> Situation is this to
a serious inquiring Mind! Even tho' it were in
a Man's Power to fill up the Hours of Life
with perpetual Amusement, void of Care; Life,
enjoyed on such Terms, would, upon Reflec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
appear <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>trifling:</hi> But how much
<hi>worse,</hi> when we consider the real Condition of
Man; a Being frail and feeble, beset with vari<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous
Dangers and Ills, and exposed to many a
melancholy Reflection, when he sees all Things
around him so transitory and decaying, and
<pb n="20" facs="21"/>
meets with <hi>Disappointment</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> with
<hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation,</hi> in all the Paths of Life!
In this distressed Condition, to reveal to him
such Discoveries of God, and his Administra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
as the Christian Religion affords, is to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veal
to him a <hi>Father</hi> and a <hi>Friend;</hi> is to let in
a Ray of most comforting Light upon the
Darkness of human Estate. He who was be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore
a destitute Orphan, wandering in the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hospitable
Desart, has now gained a Shelter
from the bitter and inclement Blast. He now
knows to <hi>whom</hi> to pray, and in <hi>whom</hi> to trust;
<hi>where</hi> to unbosom his Sorrows; from <hi>what</hi>
Hand to look for Relief. Certain it is, that
when the Heart bleeds, from some Wound of
recent Misfortune, there is nothing of equal
Efficacy with religious Comfort. It is of Power
to chear the darkest Hours, and to asswage the
deepest Woe, by the Belief of Divine Favour,
and the Prospect of happy Immortality. Here
the Mind expatiates with Joy; and, when be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reaved
of all its earthly Friends, solaces itself
with the Thoughts of <hi>One</hi> Friend that will never
forsake it. These Views have a greater and
better Effect on the Heart of a plain, but sin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cere
<hi>Christian,</hi> than all the Refinements of Phi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>losophy
<pb n="21" facs="22"/>
have on the <hi>Learned.</hi> Refined Reason<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings
may please and amuse the Mind when it is
at Ease; may, perhaps, help to relieve it, when
slightly touched with Sorrow; but when it is
torn with any sore Distress, they are <hi>cold</hi> and
<hi>feeble,</hi> compared with a direct <hi>Promise</hi> from the
Word of God. This is <hi>an Anchor to the Soul
both sure and stedfast.</hi> This has given <hi>Refuge and
strong Consolation</hi> to many a pious and virtuous
Soul, at a Time when mere <hi>Reasonings</hi> would
have proved utterly unavailing. Besides, that
they can never be so accommodated to the Bulk
of Mankind, as to be <hi>generally</hi> useful; this great
Disadvantage attends them, that they raise more
<hi>Perplexities</hi> in an <hi>inquiring</hi> Mind than it is in
their Power to resolve. Upon the Approach
of <hi>Death,</hi> especially, this will be felt; when, if
a Man thinks at all, his Anxiety must naturally
increase about the future Concerns of his Soul.
<hi>Then</hi> it is, that the great Importance of the
Discoveries of the Gospel will appear: Not
only <hi>Life and Immortality</hi> brought to Light,
but the Path opened that leads to Life: A <hi>Me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diator</hi>
discovered: <hi>Mercy</hi> proclaimed by the Go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernor
of the World, thro' this Mediator, to
the Frailties and Errors of those who are peni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tent,
<pb n="22" facs="23"/>
humble and sincere in Heart; and the
<hi>Presence</hi> of their Redeemer promised to con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duct
them thro' the Valley of the Shadow
of Death, to unseen Habitations of Rest and
Glory, where he hath prepared their Place.
Here is Ground for good Men's leaving the
World with <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> But in this
<hi>severe</hi> and <hi>trying</hi> Period, this <hi>labouring</hi> Hour
of Nature, how shall the wretched Man sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port
himself, who believes not, or knows not
the Hope of Religion?‚ÄîSecretly conscious to
himself, that he has not acted the Part he ought,
the Failings and Vices of his past Life arise be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore
him in sad Remembrance. He <hi>wishes</hi> to
exist after Death; and yet is <hi>afraid</hi> of that Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>istence.
The Governor of the World is <hi>un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>known.</hi>
His Mercy, for any thing that he can
tell, may be implored <hi>in vain;</hi> all is mysterious
Obscurity: And in the midst of endless Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plexities
and Doubts, the trembling Soul is for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ced
away from the Body.‚ÄîAs the Misfortunes
of Life must have been insupportable to such
a Man, so its End is bitter. His setting Sun
goes down in a dark Cloud; and the Night
of Death closes over his Head, full of Misery.
<hi>Having no Hope,</hi> and <hi>being without God,</hi> that
<pb n="23" facs="24"/>
is, without the Knowledge of God <hi>in the World,</hi>
are two Things most justly connected by the
Apostle, when he is describing the Misery of
the Heathen Nations<note place="bottom" n="*">Eph. ii. 12.</note>. Thus, by Means of
<hi>the Knowledge of the Lord,</hi> Man, considered as
an <hi>Individual,</hi> is both <hi>improved</hi> and <hi>comforted.</hi>
We are next to show,</p>
            <p n="2">II. WHAT Benefit he receives from this
Knowledge, as a <hi>Member of Society.</hi> This
Branch of the Subject is in Part anticipated, by
what has been already said. For all the <hi>Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>provement</hi>
that Man, as an <hi>Individual,</hi> receives
from religious Knowledge, redounds to the Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nefit
of the <hi>Publick.</hi> Society reaps the Fruits
of the Virtue of all its Members; and as <hi>each,</hi>
apart, is made better, the <hi>whole</hi> must propor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tionably
flourish. But, besides this, religious
Knowledge has a <hi>direct</hi> Tendency to improve
the social Intercourses of Men, and to assist
them in co-operating for common Good.</p>
            <p>FOR, first of all, it <hi>forms</hi> them for Society.
It <hi>civilizes</hi> Mankind. It tames the Fierceness
of their Passions, and wears off the Barbarity of
their Manners. Without some Notions of Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ligion,
<pb n="24" facs="25"/>
it is much to be questioned, whether any
regular Society ever subsisted, or could subsist,
in the World. All those who, in early Times,
attempted to reduce wandering and scattered
Men unto Society, found it necessary to begin
with some Institution of Religion: And the
wisest Legislators of old, thro' the whole Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gress
of their Systems of Government, treated
it as necessary and essential to Civil Polity. If
even those <hi>imperfect</hi> Forms of Religion, mixed
with so much Error, were important to Socie<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty;
<hi>how much more,</hi> that reasonable and true
Worship of God which the Gospel teaches?
True Religion introduces the Idea of regular
Subjection, by accustoming Mankind to the
<hi>Awe</hi> of superior Power, in the Deity, <hi>joined</hi>
with the <hi>Esteem</hi> of superior Wisdom and Good<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness.
It is, by its Natnre, an <hi>associating</hi> Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciple,
creating new and sacred Bonds of Union
amongst Men. Common Assemblies for reli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gious
Worship, and the joint Veneration of
one God; the Sense of being all, in common,
dependent on the same supreme Protection,
and bound by the same Ties to Duty, Sharers
of the same Benefits of Religion, and Expec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tants
of the same Reward; all this has a Ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dency
<pb n="25" facs="26"/>
to awaken the Sense of our friendly Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lation,
to knit us together, and strengthen our
mutual Connection.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, religious Knowledge assists in
preparing the Way for all useful and ornamen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tal
Improvements in Society. It has, in Fact,
been found, that, along with the Increase of
<hi>religious</hi> Light, <hi>Learning</hi> has flourished, and
useful <hi>Arts</hi> have been cultivated and advanced.
The true Knowledge of the Lord promotes a
<hi>free</hi> and <hi>manly</hi> Spirit. It teaches Men to think
for themselves, to form their Principles upon a
a fair Inquiry unto the Word of God; and not
to resign their Consciences implicitely to Men.
Hence, it is strongly connected with a Detesta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
of Oppression of every kind; and forms a
Taste for <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Laws.</hi> We see that ty<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rannical
Governments have taken the firmest
Root, in Nations blinded by <hi>Mahometan</hi> and
<hi>Pagan</hi> Darkness, where the Throne of Vio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lence
is <hi>supported</hi> by Ignorance and Error. In
the Christian World, as long as <hi>Popish</hi> Supersti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
reigned undisturbed, <hi>Darkness, Oppression</hi>
and <hi>Slavery</hi> were in its Train. For some Cen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turies,
the Cloud sat <hi>thick</hi> and <hi>deep</hi> over all <hi>Eu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rope,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="27"/>
and threatned a Relapse unto ancient Bar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>barity:
Till, at the auspicious Aera of the <hi>Refor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mation,</hi>
together with the true <hi>Knowledge of
the Lord, Learning, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Arts,</hi> began
to shine forth, and resume their Lustre. At
this Day, the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> is, in our own,
and some other States, the great Bulwark of
<hi>Liberty.</hi> The Promoters of arbitrary Power
know this well; and hence, it has been their
constant Aim to bear it down; and in place of
the <hi>Knowledge of the Lord,</hi> to establish an <hi>im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plicit</hi>
Submission to the Dictates of <hi>Men,</hi> in
Matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>BUT this is not the whole of that happy In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fluence
which religious Knowledge hath on
Society. It is not only subsidiary to its <hi>Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>provement,</hi>
but necessary to its <hi>Preservation.</hi>
It is the very <hi>Basis</hi> on which it rests. For re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ligious
Principle is what gives Mankind the
surest Hold of one another. That last and
greatest Pledge of Veracity, an <hi>Oath,</hi> without
which no Society can subsist, derives its whole
Authority from the Reverence of God, to
whom it is a solemn Appeal. Banish religious
Principle, and you loosen all the Bonds of So<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciety:
<pb n="27" facs="28"/>
You shake the fundamental Pillar of all
mutual Trust and Confidence amongst Men;
nay, you destroy the Security arising from
<hi>Laws</hi> themselves. For human Laws and hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man
Sanctions cannot extend to numberless
Cases, in which the Safety of Mankind is high<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly
concerned. They would be very ineffectual
Means of maintaining the Order and Peace of
Society, if there were no Checks upon Men,
from the Sense of Divine Legislation; if no Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lief
of Divine Rewards and Punishments were
to come in Aid, of what human Rewards and
Punishments so imperfectly provide for.</p>
            <p>INDEED, the Belief of Religion is of such
Importance to publick Welfare, that the most
expressive Description we could give of a Soci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ety,
in the utmost Circumstances of Disorder,
would be to say, There was no <hi>Fear of God</hi>
left amongst them.‚ÄîOur Imagination would
immediately conceive of them as loose and law<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>less;
abandoned to Rapine and Violence, to
Perfidy and Treachery; deceiving and deceived;
oppressing and opprest; consumed by intestine
Broils, and ripe for becoming a Prey to the first
Invader.‚ÄîOn the other hand, in order to any
<pb n="28" facs="29"/>
Society's flourishing in its highest <hi>Perfection</hi>
and <hi>Glory,</hi> we need only suppose the Belief of
Christian Principles prevailing in such a De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gree,
as to exert their <hi>entire</hi> Influence on the
Hearts and Lives of all its Members. <hi>Then</hi>
would the most amiable Scene open. We would
see the <hi>Causes</hi> of publick Disunion instantly re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>moved,
when Men were once formed to the
Pursuit of those higher Interests, which give
no Occasion to <hi>Competitions</hi> and <hi>Jealousies;</hi> and
warmed in Heart with that noble Spirit of <hi>Love</hi>
which our holy Religion breathes; and of
which it hath set before us such illustrious Ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>amples
in Almighty God, and our blessed Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deemer.
We would see the Principles of Chri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stian
Faith shedding over Families, Neighbour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hoods
and Communities; the comfortable In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fluences
of Unity and Peace, like the <hi>Dew of
Hermon, and the Dew that descendeth upon the
Mountains of Zion, where the Lord commandeth
the Blessing, even Life for evermore</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Psal. cxxxiii. 3.</note>. We
would see them inspiring private Faith and pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lick
Loyalty; restoring Sobriety of Manners
and Simplicity of Life; promoting in every
Man Contentment with his Lot, Resignation
<pb n="29" facs="30"/>
to Divine Appointment, continual Regard to
the Blessing of Heaven.‚ÄîWe may extol <hi>Riches</hi>
and <hi>Traffick;</hi> but, in Truth, the Prevalency
of such Principles of publick <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cord,</hi>
forms the real <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of a
Nation. In Proportion as these prevail, they
give us the Prospect of human Society rising
from that sad <hi>Degeneracy</hi> into which it is at
present sunk, and advancing, under the Bles<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sing
of Heaven, towards that happy Period,
when <hi>Nation shall not lift up their Sword against
Nation, nor War be learned any more</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Isa. ii. 4.</note>; <hi>when
there shall be nothing to hurt nor destroy in all
the holy Mountain of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To convince us yet further of the Impor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tance
of religious Knowledge to the Welfare
of Society, there is one Consideration which
deserves particular Attention. It is this; That
if <hi>good Seed</hi> be not sown in the Field, <hi>Tares</hi>
will infallibly arise. There is a strong <hi>Propen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion</hi>
in human Nature to Religion: A natural
Preparation of the Mind for receiving some
Impressions of religious Belief. In ignorant
and uncultivated Minds, <hi>Superstition</hi> or <hi>Enthu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>siasm</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="31"/>
never fail to graft themselves upon this
Root. Into what monstrous Forms <hi>these</hi> have
shot forth, and what various Mischiefs they
have produced in Society, is too well known.
But this is not the <hi>whole</hi> of the Danger. For
designing Men are seldom wanting to take <hi>Ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantage</hi>
of popular Weakness; and to <hi>improve</hi>
a superstitious Biass to their own ambitious and
interested <hi>Ends.</hi> Hence Superstition, in itself
a formidable Evil, threatens Consequences still
more formidable, when it is made the <hi>Tool</hi> of
Ambition and Interest. In this Way <hi>Popery</hi>
has become the Means of enslaving the People,
and exalting the Church to exorbitant Power;
and, like some baneful Planet, has shed most
malignant Influences both on the civil and re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ligious
Interests of Christian Society.</p>
            <p>As it is the <hi>Ignorance</hi> of true Religion which
gives Rise to those Evils, this furnishes us with
one strong Argument, for promoting the Know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge
of it in the World; that just and rational
Principles of Religion may fill up the <hi>Room</hi> in
Mens Minds, which Superstition will otherwise
usurp; and the Enemies of Society will make
their Advantage of. This brings the Case near<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>er
<pb n="31" facs="32"/>
to ourselves, by suggesting to us the Condi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
of that Part of our own Country, upon
which the <hi>Society for propagating Christian
Knowledge</hi> have chiefly bestowed their Care.
A Part of the Country, which may be consi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dered
as yet <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>uncivilized;</hi> where Society
has scarcely got beyond its <hi>Infant</hi> State; and
whither the Influence of Government and Or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der
has very imperfectly reached: Where the
Inhabitants, hitherto accustomed to no Subjec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
except a slavish Dependence on their Chief<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tains,
are inured to Rapine, totally negligent of
the Arts of Peace, and Strangers to cultivated
Life: Where the grossest <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Su<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perstition</hi>
have remarkably reigned, and have
nourished, as their <hi>proper</hi> Offspring, a blind At<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tachment
to some pernicious Notions of Go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernment,
artfully instilled into their Minds.
If ever the Aid of religious Knowledge was ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessary
to establish and assist Society, it must
be allowed to be necessary here: Especially, as
we know Popish Emissaries have not been want<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
among them, to sow their <hi>poisonous</hi> Prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciples;
and to foment that <hi>disaffected</hi> Spirit, the
violent Effects of which were felt a few Years
ago; when we saw them rushing, like a Torrent
<pb n="32" facs="33"/>
from their own bleak Mountains, to spread
Confusion and Terror through a peaceful
Land.‚ÄîIf so many of our Countrymen have
hitherto been not only <hi>useless,</hi> but even <hi>danger<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous</hi>
to the rest of the Society, ought not <hi>all</hi> wise
and good Men to encourage the Design of pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pagating
among them those Principles of true
religious Knowledge, which may <hi>reform</hi> them
from Barbarity, and <hi>unite</hi> them to the rest of
the Society? Regard to our own Safety and
Tranquility might alone recommend this De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sign,
tho' no <hi>higher</hi> Motive were applied to.
The Method, that is employed in carrying it
on, must be allowed to be incontestably proper;
the Establishment of <hi>Schools</hi> for the religious
Education of Youth, who must otherwise have
been void of all moral Culture, and of Course
have been the prepared Instruments of Vio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lence
and Cruelty. The good Designs of the
<hi>Legislature</hi> for introducing regular Govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,
Industry and Arts, into those Parts of the
Country, can never be pursued with Success, if
Endeavours be not <hi>early</hi> used, to root out bad
Principles, both of Religion and Government,
from their Minds, and to plant right ones in
their stead. The more directly to co-operate

            <p>THESE Considerations directly respect the
Good of Society. But, when we take the Ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gument
that has been treated, in its <hi>full</hi> Extent;
when we consider the Importance of religious

of every <hi>Individual,</hi> to their <hi>present</hi> Happi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness,
and their Preparation for <hi>future</hi> Glory, the
Motive for spreading that Knowledge through

Is it not an affecting Thought, that there should
be so many of our Fellow-creatures, nay of
our Countrymen, destitute of all those Bless<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings
which Man may receive from the Disco<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veries

Mankind pass their wretched Days,
scarcely rais'd a Degree above the <hi>Beasts that

and eternal Interests; for bringing so many Souls

the <hi>Society</hi> erected for this Purpose amongst

In an Undertaking of this Nature, where the
Field is so wide, and where so much yet remains
to be done, the charitable Assistance of all is
most necessary. Those especially who are <hi>rich

into their Hands by Providence of employing,
to the best Advantage, some of that Wealth
which they may well spare from the Pomp and
Superfluities of Life. This will be <hi>laying up

               <note place="bottom" n="*">1. Tim. vi. 19.</note>. This will be the Means of

the Regard for it <hi>at Home.</hi> They preserve,
at least, the <hi>Face of Seriousness</hi> amongst us, and
contribute to recall something of that <hi>Zeal</hi> which

<hi>seasonable</hi> now, when a Horror at <hi>Super<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stition</hi>

            <head>STATE
OF THE
SOCIETY in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
FOR
Propagating CHRISTIAN KNOW<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>LEDGE,
in the Year 1750.</head>
            <p>THIS SOCIETY took its Rise about the
Year 1700; and, in the Year 1709, was
erected into a Body corporate, by Letters pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tent
from her late Majesty Queen <hi>Anne.</hi> The
Intention was to promote the Knowledge of
Christianity thro' the remote Corners of the
Highlands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> miserably sunk in Dark<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
and in Ignorance; a Design, which every
one must acknowledge laudable, and worthy of
Encouragement.</p>
            <p>THIS Encouragement it met from many
pious and well-disposed Persons, who, from
<pb n="40" facs="40"/>
time to time, did, and do still contribute to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards
its Support, by charitable Donations, in
so much, that at present the Society finds itself
in Condition to maintain no fewer than 136
Schools, at which are educated to the Number
of 7000 Children of both Sexes.</p>
            <p>THE Directors use the Word <hi>educate,</hi> be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause
that comes up best to the Design of the
Society, which is, to instruct the Children, first
of all, in the Knowledge of Christianity, the
reformed Protestant Religion. 2<hi>dly,</hi> In Writ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing,
Orthography, Arithmetick and Church
Musick. 3<hi>dly,</hi> In the Knowledge of the <hi>Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lish</hi>
Tongue, and, if possible, to root out the
<hi>Irish</hi> altogether. And, <hi>lastly,</hi> To teach them
right Principles of Government, to instil a
Love of true Liberty and Affection to King
<hi>George.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH this Design did the Society set out,
with this Design does it still go on, and in this
Design it has, in some Measure, happily suc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceeded;
so that, from the Beginning of its E<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rection,
until now, (at the most moderate Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>putation)
it has been the Means of instructing
<pb n="41" facs="41"/>
50,000 Children, of both Sexes, in the Know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge
of Christianity. The first Step to intro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duce
Religion into the Heart, is to dispel the
Clouds of Ignorance in the Head.‚ÄîThe So<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciety
can do no more than Men can do; they
may endeavour to convey Knowledge into the
Head, but it is the Office of the supreme Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
to bring it home to the Heart.</p>
            <p>AND, sure, the Means which this Society
uses are of all others the most proper. They
are applied to the Minds of the Inhabitants,
when these Minds and these inhabitants are
young, and their Tempers, like the Willow,
are more easily bent any Way.‚ÄîIf they cannot
succeed at this Age, they never will at any;
and it is believed, that if this Method of re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>forming
the Highlands of <hi>Scotland</hi> proves a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bortive,
all other human Methods certainly will.</p>
            <p>SURE then, it cannot but be the Duty, and
must be the Interest of every good Man, of e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very
<hi>Briton,</hi> to encourage this Design;‚Äîtend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
so evidently to make us a happy,‚Äîa
free,‚Äîand an united Nation.‚ÄîReligion and
Liberty, and Industry and Joy, are Sisters, and
<pb n="42" facs="42"/>
never appear to such Advantage, as in Compa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny
with one another.‚ÄîWhile Superstition and
Slavery, and Idleness and Sulleness, are Spectres
the most hideous, and ought to have their
Dwelling not upon the Earth, but under it.</p>
            <p>THE Society obtained a new Patent in the
Year 1738, enabling them to instruct the Chil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dren,
under their Care, in the Knowledge of
Husbandry and Housewifery, Trade and Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nufacture,
or in such like manual Operations.
This they have already done in several remark<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able
Instances, and are desireous to do so in
more, as their Stock enables them. And they
apply the Benefactions made, either to the
Purposes of the first, or of the second Charter,
as the Donor is pleased to direct; so that now,
Religion and Industry go Hand in Hand,
strengthen and establish one another.</p>
            <p>AMONG the various Instances of Generosity
which the Year 1749 has produced, the Direc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tors
judge themselves bound to take particular
Notice of the two following, both from one
Country, that of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The one is the Li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berality
of an <hi>Irish</hi> Gentleman of Distinction,
who has not only paid into the Society 100 <hi>l.</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="43"/> 
               <hi>Sterl.</hi> towards the Support of Charity Schools
in the Islands of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but also caused
translate Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Call to the Unconverted,</hi>
&amp;c. into the <hi>Irish</hi> Language, (for the Use of
such as cannot learn <hi>English</hi>) under Direction
of this Society, and has given a very consider<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able
Sum, and engaged to pay what further
may be necessary for defraying the Expence of
it.‚ÄîThe Work is now finished, by the La<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bours
of a Reverend Member of the Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and will be printed without De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lay,
and distributed at the Sight of the Society.</p>
            <p>THE other is a Legacy, which the Society
has received from Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> Surgeon in <hi>Dub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lin,</hi>
for no less than 100 <hi>l. Sterl.</hi>‚Äîof which
they have now actually got Payment.‚ÄîTwo
Instances worthy to be imitated by all, (where
Circumstances will allow) who hope for that
melting Acknowledgement of the Saviour of
Sinners: <hi>In as much as ye have done those Things
to one of the least of my Brethren, ye have done
them unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BESIDES those Endeavours used by the So<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciety
to promote the Knowledge of true Reli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gion
at home, they have also in Conformity
<pb n="44" facs="44"/>
to a Clause in their first Patent, extended their
Care to Places abroad, particularly to the wild
and wandering <hi>Indians</hi> on the Borders of <hi>New
York, New Jersey</hi> and <hi>Pensilvania.</hi> The first
Attempt of this Kind was made in the Year
1731, and another and more successful one in
the Year 1741 and 1747. Of the Success of
this last Mission the World has had a printed
Account (under the Care of Dr. <hi>Doddridge</hi>)
in Mr. <hi>Brainard</hi>'s Journal. To this the Di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rectors

                     <p>INCLOSED you have the Journals of the
Society's two Missionaries, who diligent<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly
attend their respective Charges, and the
most of those, whom we charitably hoped
were the Subjects of a saving Change, con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinue
to adorn their Profession by a Behavi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>our
and exemplary Conversation.</p>
                     <p>MR. <hi>Brainard</hi>'s <hi>Indians</hi> are daily forming
themselves more and more into a civilized
<pb n="45" facs="45"/>
and orderly Society.‚ÄîThe Men cultivate
their Lands, the Women are learning to spin,
and they have, in a great Measure, abandon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed
that slothful Course of Life, which is so
natural to all <hi>Indians,</hi> that they are brought
off from it with the utmost Difficulty.</p>
                     <p>We have set up a Seminary of Learning
in <hi>New Jersey;</hi> and if the Society, by re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>commending
our Design to pious and chari<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>table
Persons, could procure us any Assist<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance,
it would doubtless be of extensive Ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vice
to the Interest of Religion in these
Parts. <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>By the two last Journals which the Society
have received from Mr. <hi>Brainard,</hi> it appears,
among other Things, that many of the <hi>Indi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ans</hi>
are grown extremely desirous of reading and
understanding the Word of God;‚ÄîFor that
End, says he, they attend an Evening School,
which the Schoolmaster has set up on Purpose.‚ÄîThe greater Part of the young People attend
this School also, and some that are 40 or 50
Years of Age; and it is hoped, that most of
them will, in a little Time, be able to read the
<pb n="46" facs="46"/>
Bible. The School is increasing, and the Chil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dren
make good Progress in their Learning.</p>
            <p>As to the College proposed to be erected in
<hi>New Jersey,</hi> the Society have done every Thing
in their Power to encourage it, and have set a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>part
the Sum of 30 <hi>l. Sterl.</hi> to be employed in
buying proper Books for the Students; so that,
in a little Time, there is reason to hope, that
there will be no more Reason for a Complaint,
so often made in these Parts, That <hi>the Harvest
is great, but the Labourers are few.</hi>‚ÄîNeither
can the Directors omit taking this Opportunity
of recommending this good Design to others.
The Thing indeed recommends itself, and must
do so to every Person, whose Heart is capable
of the least Tincture of Compassion for such
vast Numbers of poor forlorn <hi>Indians.</hi>‚ÄîNor
would such a Seminary answer a religious End
only, it would also serve a political View; for
sure, if from us Learning and good Manners
could be propagated thro' these Savages, it
would be a Mean of engaging them more firm<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly
in the <hi>British</hi> Interest. And if, along with
Learning and good Manners, true Religion
should take place among them, and they be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>come
<pb n="47" facs="47"/>
come Subjects, willing Subjects of the KING
of all Kings, what Joy would not this yield to
every sincere Christian?</p>
            <p>BY this Means, Streams would break out
in that vast Wilderness, and Rivers run in that
immense Desart.‚ÄîNay, the Desart would re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>joice
and blossom as the Rose; so that from the
Rising of the Sun unto where he goeth down,
a pure Offering should be offered unto the true
God.‚ÄîMen should be blessed in Jesus, and all
Nations call him Blessed.</p>
            <p>These are the Prayers of this Society, and
they are the Prayers of every true Christian.</p>
