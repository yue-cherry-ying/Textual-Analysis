            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>IT will be sufficient to say of this Edition, that the reader has here a much more correct and compleat copy of the <hi>DUNCIAD,</hi> than has hitherto ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pear'd: I cannot answer but some mistakes may have slipt into it, but a vast number of others will be pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vented, by the Names being now not only set at length, but justified by the authorities and reasons given. I make no doubt, the Author's own motive to use real rather than feign'd names, was his care to preserve the Innocent from any false Applications; whereas in the former editions which had no more than the Ini<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tial letters, he was made, by Keys printed here, to hurt the inoffensive; and (what was worse) to abuse his friends, by an impression at <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Commentary which attends this Poem was sent me from several hands, and consequently must be une<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>qually written; yet will have one advantage over most Commentaries, that it is not made upon Conjec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tures, or at a remote distance of Time: and the rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der cannot but derive one pleasure from the very <hi>Ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scurity</hi> of the persons it treats of, that it partakes of the nature of a <hi>Secret,</hi> which most people love to
<pb n="6" facs="6"/>
be let into, tho' the Men or the Things be ever so inconsiderable or trivial.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Persons</hi> it was judg'd proper to give some ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count: for since it is only in this Monument that they must expect to survive (and here survive they will, as long as the <hi>English</hi> tongue shall remain such as it was in the reigns of Queen <hi>ANNE</hi> and King <hi>GEORGE,)</hi> it seem'd but humanity to bestow a word or two upon each, just to tell what he was, what he writ, when he liv'd, and when he dy'd.</p>
            <p>If a word or two more are added upon the chief Offenders; 'tis only as a paper pinn'd upon the breast, to mark the Enormities for which they suffer'd; lest the Correction only should be remember'd, and the Crime forgotten.</p>
            <p>In some Articles, it was thought sufficient barely to transcribe from <hi>Jacob, Curl,</hi> and other writers of their own rank, who were much better acquainted with them than any of the Authors of this Comment can pretend to be. Most of them had drawn each other's Characters on certain occasions; but the few here inserted are all that could be saved from the general destruction of such works.</p>
            <p>Of the part of <hi>Scriblerus</hi> I need say nothing: his Manner is well enough known, and approv'd by all but those who are too much concern'd to be Judges.</p>

The <hi>Imitations</hi> of the <hi>Ancients</hi> are added, to gra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tify those who either never read, or may have forgot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ten them; together with some of the <hi>Parodies</hi> and Al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lusions to the most excellent of the <hi>Moderns.</hi> If from the frequency of the former any man think the Poem too much a <hi>Cento;</hi> our Poet will but appear to have done the same thing in jest which <hi>Boileau</hi> did in earnest; and upon which <hi>Vida, Fracastorius,</hi> and many of the most eminent <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, professedly va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lued themselves.</p>

            <head>A LETTER TO THE PUBLISHER, Occasioned by the first correct EDITION of the DUNCIAD.</head>
            <p>IT is with pleasure I hear that you have procu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>red a correct Copy of the DUNCIAD, which the many surreptitious ones have rendered so neces<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sary; and it is yet with more, that I am inform<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed it will be attended with a COMMENTARY: a Work so requisite, that I cannot think the Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thor himself would have omitted it, had he ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prov'd of the first Appearance of this Poem.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="9"/>
Such <hi>Notes</hi> as have occurr'd to me I herewith send you: You will oblige me by inserting them amongst those which are, or will be, transmitted to you by others; since not only the Author's friends, but even strangers, appear engag'd by hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manity, to some care of an orphan of so much ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nius and spirit, which its parent seems to have a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bandoned from the very beginning, and suffered to step into the world naked, unguarded, and unattended.</p>
            <p>It was upon reading some of the abusive papers lately publish'd, that my great regard to a person, whose friendship I esteem as one of the chief ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nours of my life, and a much greater respect to Truth than to him or any man living, engag'd me in Enquiries of which the inclos'd Notes are the fruit.</p>
            <p>I perceived, that most of these authors had been (doubtless very wisely) the first Aggressors. They had try'd till they were weary, what was to be got by railing at each other: no body was either concern'd, or surpriz'd, if this or that scribler was prov'd a dunce; but every one was curious to read what could be said to prove Mr. POPE one, and was ready to pay something for such a discovery: A stratagem which would they fairly own, might not only reconcile them to me, but screen
<pb n="10" facs="10"/>
them from the resentment of their lawful Superiors, whom they daily abuse, only (as I charitably hope) to get that <hi>by</hi> them, which they cannot get <hi>from</hi> them.</p>
            <p>I found this was not all: Ill success in that had transported them to Personal abuse, either of him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self, or (what I think he could less forgive) of his friends. They had call'd men of virtue and ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour Bad men, long before he had either leisure or inclination to call them Bad Writers: and some had been such old offenders, that he had quite for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gotten their persons as well as their slanders, till they were pleas'd to revive them.</p>
            <p>Now what had Mr. POPE done before, to in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cense them? He had publish'd those works which are in the hands of every body, in which not the least mention is made of any of them. And what has he done since? He has laugh'd and written the DUNCIAD. What has that said of them? A very serious truth which the publick had said before, that they were dull: And what it had no sooner said, but they themselves were at great pains to procure, or even purchase room in the prints, to testify under their hands to the truth of it.</p>
            <p>I should still have been silent, if either I had seen any inclination in my friend to be serious
<pb n="11" facs="11"/>
with such accusers, or if they had only meddled with his writings: since whoever publishes puts himself on his trial by his Country. But when his moral character was attack'd, and in a manner from which neither Truth nor Virtue can secure the most innocent, in a manner which though it annihilates the credit of the accusation with the just and impartial, yet aggravates very much the guilt of the accuser (I mean, by Authors <hi>without names)</hi> then I thought, since the danger was common to all, the concern ought to be so; and that it was an act of justice to detect the Authors, not only on this account, but as many of them are the same who for several years past, have made free with the greatest of names in Church and State, ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pos'd to the world the private misfortunes of Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>milies, abus'd all even to Women, and whose pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stituted papers (for one or other Party in the unhappy divisions of their Country) have insulted the Fallen, the Friendless, the Exil'd, and the Dead.</p>
            <p>Besides this, which I take to be a publick con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cern, I have already confess'd I had a private one. I am one of that number who have long lov'd and esteem'd Mr. POPE, and had often declared it was not his capacity or writings (which we ever thought the least valuable part of his character) but the honost, open, and beneficent man, that we most
<pb n="12" facs="12"/>
esteem'd and lov'd in him. Now if what these people say were believ'd, I must appear to all my friends either a fool or a knave, either impos'd on my self, or imposing on them: so that I am as much interested in the confutation of these ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lumnies, as he is himself.</p>
            <p>I am no Author, and consequently not to be sus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pected either of jealousy or resentment against any of the men, of whom scarce one is known to me by sight; and as for their writings, I have sought them (on this one occasion) in vain, in the closets and libraries of all my acquaintance. I had still been in the dark, if a Gentleman had not procur'd me (I suppose from some of themselves, for they are generally much more dangerous friends than enemies) the passages I send you. I solemnly protest I have added nothing to the malice or absurdity of them; which it behoves me to de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clare, since the vouchers themselves will be so soon and so irrecoverably lost. You may in some measure prevent it, by preserving at least their<note place="bottom" n="*">Which we have done in a List in the <hi>Appendix.</hi>
               </note> Titles, and discovering (as far as you can depend on the truth of your information) the names of the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceal'd authors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="13"/>
The first objection I have heard made to the Poem is, that the persons are too <hi>obscure</hi> for satire. The persons themselves, rather than allow the ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jection, would forgive the satire; and if one could be tempted to afford it a serious answer, were not all assassinates, popular insurrections, the insolence of the rabble without doors, and of domesticks with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>in, most wrongfully chastised, if the Meanness of offenders indemnified them from punishment? On the contrary, Obscurity renders them more dange<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous, as less thought of: Law can pronouce judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment only on open facts, Morality alone can pass censure on intentions of mischief; so that for secret calumny, or the arrow flying in the dark, there is no publick punishment left, but what a good Wri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter inflicts.</p>
            <p>The next objection is, that these sort of au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thors are <hi>Poor.</hi> That might be pleaded as an ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cuse at the Old Baily, for lesser crimes than De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>famation, (for 'tis the case of almost all who are try'd there) but sure it can be none, for who will pretend that the robbing another of his reputati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on supplies the want of it in himself? I question not but such authors are poor, and heartily wish the objection were removed by any honest liveli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hood. But Poverty is here the accident, not the subject: he who describes malice and villany to be
<pb n="14" facs="14"/>
pale and meagre, expresses not the least anger against Paleness or leanness, but against malice and villany. The Apothecary in <hi>Romeo</hi> and <hi>Juliet</hi> is poor, but is he therefore justified in vending poi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son? Not but Poverty itself becomes a just subject of satire, when it is the consequence of vice, prodigality, or neglect of one's lawful calling; for then it increases the publick burden, fills the streets and highways with Robbers, and the garrets with Clippers, Coiners, and Weekly Journalists.</p>
            <p>But admitting that two or three of these offend less in their morals, than in their writings: must Poverty make Nonsense sacred? If so, the fame of bad authors would be much better than that of all the good ones in the world; and not one of a hundred had ever been call'd by his right name.</p>
            <p>They mistake the whole matter: It is not cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity to encourage them in the way they follow, but to get 'em out of it: For Men are not bunglers because they are poor, but they are poor because they are bunglers.</p>
            <p>Is it not pleasant enough, to hear our authors crying out on the one hand, as if their persons and Characters were too sacred for Satire; and the publick objecting on the other, that they are too mean even for Ridicule? But whether bread or fame be their end, it must be allow'd, our author by
<pb n="15" facs="15"/>
and in this Poem, has mercifully given 'em a little of both.</p>
            <p>There are two or three, who by their <hi>rank</hi> and <hi>fortune</hi> have no benefit from the former objections (supposing them good) and these I was sorry to see in such company. But if without any provoca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, two or three gentlemen will fall upon one, in an affair wherein his interest and reputation are equally imbark'd, they cannot certainly, after they have been content to print themselves his <hi>enemies,</hi> com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plain of being put into the Number of them?</p>
            <p>Others, I'm told, pretend to have been once his <hi>Friends.</hi> Surely they are their enemies who say so, since nothing can be more odious than to treat a friend as they have done. But of this I can't persuade my self, when I consider the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stant and eternal aversion of all bad writers to a good one.</p>
            <p>Such as claim a merit from being his <hi>Admirers,</hi> I would gladly ask, if it lays him under a per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sonal obligation? at that rate he would be the most oblig'd humble servant in the world. I dare swear for these in particular, he never desir'd them to be his Admirers, nor promis'd in return to be theirs: that had truly been a sign he was of their acquain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tance; but would not the malicious world have suspected such an approbation of some motive worse
<pb n="16" facs="16"/>
than ignorance, in the Author of the <hi>Essay</hi> on <hi>Criticism?</hi> Be it as it will, the reasons of their Admiration and of his Contempt are equally sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sisting, for his works and theirs are the very same that they were.</p>
            <p>One therefore of their affertions I believe may be true, "That he has a contempt for their wri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tings." And there is another which would proba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bly be sooner allow'd by himself than by any good judge beside, "That his own have found too much success with the publick." But as it cannot consist with his modesty to claim this as a justice, it lies not on him, but entirely on the publick, to defend its own judgment.</p>
            <p>There remains what in my opinion might seem a better plea for these people, than any they have made use of. If Obscurity or Poverty were to exempt a man from satire, much more should Folly or Dulness, which are still more involuntary, nay as much so as personal Deformity. But even this will not help them: Deformity becomes an ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject of Ridicule when a man sets up for being handsome; and so must Dulness when he sets up for a Wit. They are not ridicul'd because Ridicule in itself is, or ought to be, a pleasure; but because it is just, to undeceive and vindicate the honest and unpretending part of mankind from Imposition, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause particular interest ought to yield to general,
<pb n="17" facs="17"/>
and a great number who are not naturally Fools ought never to be made so in complaisance to a few who are. Accordingly we find that in all ages, all vain pretenders, were they ever so poor or ever so dull, have been constantly the topicks of the most candid Satirists, from the <hi>Codrus</hi> of JUVENAL to the <hi>Damon</hi> of BOILEAU.</p>
            <p>Having mention'd BOILEAU, the greatest Poet and most judicious Critic of his age and country, admirable for his Talents, and yet perhaps more ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mirable for his Judgment in the proper application of them; I cannot help remarking the resemblance betwixt him and our Author in Qualities, Fame, and Fortune; in the distinctions shewn to them by their Superiors, in the general esteem of their E<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quals, and in their extended reputation amongst Foreigners; in the latter of which ours has met with the better fate, as he has had for his Transla<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tors persons of the most eminent rank and abilities in their respective nations<note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <hi>Essay on Criticism</hi> in <hi>French</hi> Verse by General <hi>Hamilton.</hi> The same in Verse also by Monsieur <hi>Roboton,</hi> Counsellor and Privy Secretary to King <hi>George</hi> I. after by the <hi>Abbe Reynel,</hi> in Verse, with Notes, <hi>Paris</hi> 1730. Rape of the Lock, in <hi>French, Paris</hi> 1728. in <hi>Italian</hi> Verse, by the Abbe <hi>Conti,</hi> a Noble <hi>Venetian:</hi> and by the Marquess <hi>Rangoni,</hi> Envoy Extraordinary from <hi>Modena</hi> to King <hi>George</hi> II. Others of his works by <hi>Salvini</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> &amp;c. his Essays and Dissertations on <hi>Homer</hi> in <hi>French, Paris</hi> 1728.</note> But the resemblance
<pb n="18" facs="18"/>
holds in nothing more, than in their being equally abus'd by the ignorant Pretenders to Poetry of their times; of which not the least memory will remain but in their own writings, and in the notes made upon them. What BOILEAU has done in almost all his poems, our Author has only in this: I dare answer for him he will do it in no more; and on his principle of attacking few but who had slander'd him, he could not have done it at all, had he been confin'd from censuring obscure and worthless persons, for scarce any other were his enemies. However, as the parity is so remarkable, I hope it will continue to the last; and if ever he shall give us an edition of this Poem himself, I may see some of 'em treated as gently (on their repentance or better merit) as <hi>Perault</hi> and <hi>Quinault</hi> were at last by BOILEAU.</p>
            <p>In one point I must be allow'd to think the character of our English Poet the more amiable.
<pb n="19" facs="19"/>
He has not been a follower of Fortune or Success; he has liv'd with the Great without flattery, been a friend to Men in power without pensions, from whom as he ask'd, so he receiv'd no favour, but what was done Him in his friends. As his Satires were the more just for being delay'd, so were his Pane<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gyricks; bestow'd only on such persons as he had familiarly known, only for such virtues as he had long observ'd in them, and only at such times as others cease to praise, if not begin to calumniate them, I mean when out of power, or out of fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shion <note place="bottom" n="†">As Mr. <hi>Wycherley,</hi> at the time the Town de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>claim'd against his book of Poems: Mr <hi>Walsh,</hi> after his death: Sir <hi>William Trumbull,</hi> when he had resign'd the office of Secretary of State: Lord <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> at his leaving <hi>England</hi> after the Queen's death: Lord <hi>Oxford</hi> in his last decline of Life: Mr. Secretary <hi>Crags</hi> at the end of the South-Sea Year, and after his death: Others only in <hi>Epitaphs.</hi>
               </note>. A Satire therefore on writers so notori<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous for the contrary practise, became no man so well as himself, as none (it is plain) was so little in their friendships, or so much in that of those whom they had most abus'd, namely the Greatest and Best of all Parties. Let me add a further rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son, that tho' ingag'd in their Friendships, he never espous'd their Animosities; and can almost singly
<pb n="20" facs="20"/>
challenge this honour, not to have written a line of any man, which thro' Guilt, thro' Shame, or thro' Fear, thro' variety of Fortune, or change of Inte<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rests, he was ever unwilling to own.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude with remarking what a pleasure it must be to every reader of Humanity, to see all along that our Author, in his very laughter, is not indulging his own ill-nature, but only punishing that of others. To his Poem those alone are capa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble of doing justice, who, to use the words of a great Writer, know how hard it is (with regard both to his subject and his manner) VETUSTIS DARE NOVITATEM, OBSOLETIS NITOREM, OBSCURIS LUCEM, FASTIDITIS GRATIAM.

            <head>MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS OF THE POEM.</head>
            <p>THIS Poem, as it celebrated the most grave and antient of things, Chaos, Night and Dul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, so is it of the most grave and antient kind. <hi>Homer</hi> (saith <hi>Aristotle)</hi> was the first who gave the <hi>Form,</hi> and (saith <hi>Horace)</hi> who adapted the <hi>Measure,</hi> to heroic poesy. But even before this, may be ra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tionally presumed from what the antients have left written, was a piece by <hi>Homer</hi> composed, of like nature and matter with this of our Poet. For of Epic sort it appeareth to have been, yet of matter surely not unpleasant, witness what is reported of it by the Learned Archbishop <hi>Eustatbius,</hi> in Odyss. k. And accordingly <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his poetic, chap. 4. doth further set forth, that as the Iliad and Odys<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sey
<pb n="24" facs="24"/>
gave example to Tragedy, so did this poem to Comedy its first Idaea.</p>
            <p>From these authors also it shou'd seem, that the He<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ro or chief personage of it was no less <hi>obscure,</hi> and his <hi>understanding</hi> and <hi>sentiments</hi> no less quaint and strange (if indeed not more so) than any of the actors in our poem. MARGITES was the name of this personage, whom Antiquity recordeth to have been <hi>Dunce the first;</hi> and surely from what we hear of him, not un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>worthy to be the root of so spreading a tree, and so numerous a posterity. The poem therefore celebrating him, was properly and absolutely a <hi>Dunciad;</hi> which tho' now unhappily lost, yet is its nature sufficiently known by the infallible tokens aforesaid. And thus it doth appear, that the first Dunciad was the first Epic poem, written by <hi>Homer</hi> himself, and anterior even to the Iliad or Odyssey.</p>
            <p>Now forasmuch as our Poet had translated those two famous works of <hi>Homer</hi> which are yet left, he did conceive it in some sort his duty to imitate that also which was lost: And was therefore induced to be stow on it the same Form which <hi>Homer</hi>'s is reported to have had, namely that of Epic poem, with a title also framed after the antient <hi>Greek</hi> manner, to wit, that of <hi>Dunciad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wonderful it is, that so few of the moderns have been stimulated to attempt some Dunciad! Since in
<pb n="25" facs="25"/>
the opinion of the multitude, it might cost less pain and oil than an imitation of the greater Epic. But possible it is also that, on due reflection, the maker might find it easier to paint a <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> a <hi>Brute</hi> or a <hi>Godfry,</hi> with just pomp and dignity heroic, than a <hi>Margites,</hi> a <hi>Codrus,</hi> a <hi>Fleckno,</hi> or a <hi>Tibbald.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We shall next declare the occasion and the cause which moved our Poet to this particular work. He lived in those days, when (after Providence had per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mitted the Invention of Printing as a scourge for the sins of the learned) Paper also became so cheap, and printers so numerous, that a deluge of Authors cover'd the land: Whereby not only the peace of the honest unwriting subject was daily molested, but unmerciful demands were made of his applause, yea of his money, by such as would neither earn the one, or deserve the other: At the same time, the Liberty of the Press was so unlimited, that it grew dangerous to refuse them either; For they would forthwith publish slan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders unpunish'd, the authors being anonymous; nay the immediate publishers thereof lay sculking under the wings of an Act of Parliament, assuredly intended for better purposes.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="26"/>
to dissuade the dull, and punish the malicious, <hi>the only way that was left.</hi> In that public-spirited view he laid the plan of this Poem, as the greatest service he was capable (without much hurt or being slain) to render his dear country. First, taking things from their Ori<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ginal, he considereth the Causes creative of such Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thors, namely <hi>Dulness</hi> and <hi>Poverty;</hi> the one born with them, the other contracted, by neglect of their pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>per talent thro' self-conceit of great abilities This truth he wrappeth in an <hi>Allegory,</hi>

            <p>A <hi>Person</hi> must next be fix'd upon to support this Action, who (to agree with the said design) must be such an one as is capable of being all three.

low Criticisms: He finds his Name to be <hi>Tibbald,</hi> and he becomes of course the Hero of the poem.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fable</hi> being thus according to best example one and entire, as contain'd in the proposition; the <hi>Machi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nery</hi> is a continued chain of Allegories, setting forth the whole power, ministry, and empire of Dulness, extended thro' her subordinate instruments, in all her various operations.</p>
            <p>This is branched into <hi>Episodes,</hi> each of which hath its Moral a part, tho' all conducive to the main end. The crowd assembled in the second book demonstrates the design to be more extensive than to bad Poets only, and that we may expect other Episodes, of the Patrons, Encouragers, or Paymasters of such authors, as occa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion shall bring them forth: And the third book, if well consider'd, seemeth to embrace the whole world. Each of the Games relateth to some or other vile class of writers: The first concerneth the Plagiary, to whom he giveth the name of <hi>More;</hi> the second the libellous Novellist, whom he styleth <hi>Eliza;</hi> the third the flat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tering Dedicator, the fourth the bawling Critic or noisy Poet, the fifth the dark and dirty Party-writer, and so of the rest; assigning to each some <hi>proper name</hi> or other, such as he could find.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Characters,</hi> the publick hath already ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>knowledg'd how justly they are drawn: The manners are so depicted, and the sentiments so peculiar to those
<pb n="29" facs="29"/>
to whom applied, that surely to transfer them to any other, or wiser, personages, would be exceeding dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficult: And certain it is, that every person concerned being consulted apart, hath readily owned the resem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blance of every portrait, his own excepted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Descriptions</hi> are singular; the <hi>Comparisons</hi> very quaint, the <hi>Narration</hi> various, yet of one colour▪ The purity and chastity of <hi>Diction</hi> is so preserved, that in the places most suspicious, not the <hi>words</hi> but only the <hi>images</hi> have been censured, and yet are those images no other than have been sanctified by Antient and Classical Authority, tho' (as was the manner of those good times,) not so curiously wrapped up: yea and commented upon by most grave Doctors, and ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proved Critics.</p>
            <p>As it beareth the name of <hi>Epic,</hi> it is thereby sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jected to such severe indispensable rules as are laid on all Neoterics, a strict imitation of the Antient; inso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>much that any deviation, accompanied with whatever poetic beauties, hath always been censured by the sound Critic. How exact that Imitation hath been in this piece, appeareth not only by its general structure, but by particular allusions infinite, many whereof have escaped both the commentator and poet himself; yea divers by his exceeding diligence are so alter'd and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terwoven with the rest, that several have already been

and more will be, by the ignorant abused, as altoge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther and originally his own.</p>
            <p>In a word, the whole poem proveth itself to be the work of our Author when his faculties were in full vigour and perfection: at that exact time when years have ripened the Judgment, without di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>minishing the Imagination; which by good critics is held to be punctually at <hi>forty.</hi> For, at that season it was that <hi>Virgil</hi> finish'd his <hi>Georgics;</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore</hi> at the like age composing his <hi>Arthurs,</hi> de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clared the same to be the very <hi>Acme</hi> and pitch of life for Epic poesy: tho' since he hath alter'd it to <hi>sixty,</hi> the year in which he published his <hi>Alfred. a.</hi> True it is, that the talents for <hi>Criticism,</hi> namely smartness, quick censure, vivacity of remark, certainty of asseve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ration, indeed all but acerbity, seem rather the gifts of Youth than of riper age: But it is far otherwise in <hi>Poetry;</hi> witness the works of Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> who beginning with Criticism, became after<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards such Poets as no age hath parallel'd.

Hereby thou may'st not only receive the delectation of Variety, but also arrive at a more certain judgment, by a grave and circumspect comparison of the Wit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nesses with each other, or of each with himself.

Forgive me therefore gentle reader, if (following learned example) I ever and anon be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>come tedious; allow me to take the same pain to find whether my author were good or bad, well or ill-natured, modest or arrogant; as another, whether his author were fair or brown, short or tall, or whether he wore a coat or a cassock?</p>

whom he never convers'd, and whose countenances he could not know, tho' turned against him: First again commencing with the high-voiced, and never-enough<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quoted</p>
            <p>
               <bibl>JOHN DENNIS;</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>Who in his reflections on the Essay on Criticism thus describeth him. <q rend="inline">A little affected hypocrite, who has nothing in his mouth but candour, truth, friendship, good nature, humanity, and magnanimi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty. He is so great a lover of falshood, that whenever he has a mind to calumniate his cotemporaries, he brands them with some defect which is just <hi>contrary to some good quality,</hi> for which all their <hi>friends and their acquaintance</hi> commend them. He seems to have a particular pique to <hi>People of Quality,</hi> and au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thors of that rank—He must derive his religion from <hi>St. Omer</hi>'s.</q>—But in the character of Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and his writings (printed by <hi>S. Popping</hi> 1716) he saith, <q rend="inline">"tho' he is a Professor of the worst religion, yet he <hi>laughs at it;"</hi>
               </q> but that, <q rend="inline">"nevertheless, he is a <hi>viru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lent Papist;</hi> and yet a <hi>Pillar</hi> for the <hi>Church of England.</hi>"</q> Of both which opinions</p>
            <p>
               <bibl>Mr. THEOBALD</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>seems also to be; declaring in <hi>Mist</hi>'s Journal of <hi>June</hi> 22, 1718: <q rend="inline">"That if he is not shrewdly abus'd, he made it his practice to cackle to <hi>both parties</hi> in
<pb n="52" facs="52"/>
their own sentiments."</q> But, as to his <hi>Pique</hi> against <hi>people of quality,</hi> the same Journalist doth not agree, but saith <hi>(May</hi> 8, 1728.) <q rend="inline">"he had by some means or other the <hi>acquaintance</hi> and <hi>friendship</hi> of the <hi>whole body of our Nobility.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>However contradictory this may appear, Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> and <hi>Gildon</hi> in the Character last cited, make it all plain, by assuring us: <q rend="inline">"That he is a creature that reconciles all contradictions: he is a beast, and a man: a Whig and a Tory: a writer (at one and the same time) of<note place="bottom" n="†">The names of two weekly Papers.</note> Guardians and Examiners, an assertor of liberty, and of the dispensing power of kings: a jesuitical professor of truth, a base, and a foul pretender to candour."</q> So that, upon the whole account, we must conclude him ei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther to have been a great hypocrite, or a very ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nest man; a terrible imposer upon both parties, or very moderate to either.</p>
            <p>Be it, as to the judicious reader shall seem good; Sure it is, he is little favour'd of certain authors whose wrath is perilous: For one declares he ought to have a <hi>price set on his head</hi> and to be hunted down as a <hi>wild beast.</hi>

The loftiest Heroicks, the lowest ballads, treatises against the state or church, satire on lords and ladies, raillery on wits and authors, squabbles with booksellers, or even full and true accounts of monsters, poysons, and murders: of any hereof was there nothing so good, nothing so bad, which hath not at one or other season been to him ascribed. If it bore no author's name, then lay he concealed; if it did, he father'd it on that author to be yet better concealed. If it resembled any of his styles, then was it evident; if it did not, then disguis'd he it on set purpose. Yea, even direct op<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>positions in religion, principles, and politicks, have equally been supposed in him inherent.

            <p>Doubtless most Commentators would hence take oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>casion to turn all to their Author's advantage; and from the testimony of his very enemies would affirm, That his Capacity was boundless, as well as his Imagina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion; that he was a perfect master of all Styles, and

The be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>loved seat of the Goddess is described, with her chief attendants and officers, her functions, opera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions, and effects. Then the poem hastes into the midst of things, presenting her on the evening of a Lord Mayor's day, revolving the long succession of her sons, and the glories past and to come. She fixes her eye on <hi>Tibbald</hi> to be the instrument of that great event which is the Subject of the poem. He is described pensive in his study, giving up the

cause, and apprehending the period of her empire from the old age of the present monarch <hi>Settle:</hi> Wherefore debating whether to betake himself to Law or Politicks, he raises an altar of proper books, and (making first his solemn prayer and declaration) purposes thereon to sacrifice all his unsuccessful wri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tings. As the pile is kindled, the Goddess behold<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the slame from her seat, flies in person and puts it out, by casting upon it the poem of <hi>Thule.</hi> She forthwith reveals berself to him, transports him to her Temple, unfolds her arts, and initiates him into her mysteries: then announcing the death of <hi>Settle</hi> that night, anoints, and proclaims him Successor.</p>

               <p>This Poem was writ in 1726. In the next year an imperfect Edition was published at Dublin, and re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>printed at London in 120. another at Dublin, and another at London in 8vo, and three others in 120. the same year. But there was no perfect Edition before that of London in 4to 1728-9, which was attended with the following Notes. We are will<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to acquaint Posterity that this Poem (as it here stands) was presented to King <hi>George</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> and his Queen, by the hands of Sir <hi>Robert Walpole,</hi> on the 12th of March, 1728-9.</p>

that "Temperance is the life of Study."

               <head>REMARKS on BOOK the SECOND.</head>
               <p>Two things there are, upon the supposition of which the very basis of all Verbal criticism is founded
<pb n="115" facs="112"/>
and supported: The first, that an author could never fail to use the <hi>best word,</hi> on every occasion: The se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cond, that a Critic cannot chuse but know, <hi>which that is?</hi> This being granted, whenever any word doth not fully content us, we take upon us to conclude, first that the author could <hi>never have us'd it,</hi> and secondly, that he must have used <hi>that very one</hi> which we con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jecture in its stead.</p>
               <p>We cannot therefore enough admire the learned <hi>Scriblerus,</hi> for his alteration of the text in the two last verses of the preceding book, which in all the former editions stood thus,
<q rend="inline">
                     <l>Hoarse thunder to the bottom shook the bog,</l>
                     <l>And the loud nation croak'd, <hi>God save King</hi> Log!</l>
                  </q>
He has with great judgment tranposed these two epi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thets, putting <hi>hoarse</hi> to the nation, and <hi>loud</hi> to the thunder: and this being evidently the true reading, he vouchsafed not so much as to mention the former; for which assertion of the just right of a Critic, he merits the acknowledgment of all sound commentators.</p>

<pb n="122" facs="119"/>
that he carried the Trade many lengths beyond what it ever before had arrived at, and that he was the envy and admiration of all his profession. He possess'd him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self of a command over all authors whatever; he caus'd them to write what he pleas'd; they could not call their very names their own. He was not only famous among these; he was taken notice of by the <hi>State,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Law,</hi> and received particular marks of distinction from each.</p>
               <p>It will be own'd that he is here introduc'd with all possible dignity; he speaks like the intrepid <hi>Diomed;</hi> he runs like the swift-footed <hi>Achilles;</hi> if he falls, 'tis like the beloved <hi>Nisus;</hi> and (what <hi>Homer</hi> makes to be the chief of all praises) he is <hi>favour'd of the Gods:</hi> He says but three words, and his prayer is heard; a

               <p>The tribute our author here pays him, is a grateful return for several unmerited obligations: Many weigh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty animadversions on the publick affairs, and many

               <p>After the other persons are disposed in their proper places of rest, the Goddess transports the King to her Temple, and there lays him to slumber with his head on her lap; a position of marvellous virtue, which causes all the visions of wild enthusiasts, projectors, politicians, inamorato's, castle-builders, chymists and poets. He is immediately carry'd on the wings of Fancy to the <hi>Elyzian</hi> shade, where on the banks of <hi>Lethe</hi> the souls of the dull are dipp'd by <hi>Bavius,</hi> before their entrance into this world. There he is met by the ghost of <hi>Set<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tle,</hi> and by him made acquainted with the wonders of the place, and with those which he is himself destin'd to perform. He takes him to a <hi>Mount of Vision,</hi> from whence he shews him the past triumphs of the Empire of Dulness, then the present, and lastly the fu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture:
<pb n="176" facs="173"/>
How small a part of the world was ever con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quered by <hi>Science,</hi> how soon those conquests were stop'd, and those very nations again reduced to her dominion. Then distinguishing the Island of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> shews by what aids, and by what persons, it shall be forthwith brought to her empire. These he causes to pass in review before his eyes, describing each by his proper figure, character, and qualifications. On a sudden the Scene shifts, and a vast number of Miracles and prodigies appear, utterly surprizing and unknown to the King himself, till they are explained to be the wonders of his own reign now commencing. On this subject <hi>Settle</hi> breaks into a congratulation, yet not unmix'd with concern, that his own times were but the types of these; He prophecies bow first the nation shall be over-run with Farces, Opera's, and Shows; and the throne of Dulness advanced over both the Theatres; Then how her sons shall preside in the seats of Arts and sciences, till in conclusion all shall return to their original Chaos▪ A scene, of which the present Action of the Dunciad is but a Type or Foretaste, giving a Glimpse or <hi>Pisgah-sight</hi> of the promis'd Fulnefs of her Glory; the Accomplishment whereof will, in all pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bability, hereafter be the Theme of many other and greater Dunciads.</p>

                     <hi>The Publisher.]</hi> Who he was is uncertain; but <hi>Edward Ward</hi> tells us in his preface to <hi>Durgen,</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">"that most judges are of opinion this preface is not of <hi>English</hi> extraction but <hi>Hibernian,</hi> &amp;c."</q> He means Dr. <hi>Swift,</hi> who whether publisher or not, may be said in a sort to be author of the poem: For when he, together with Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> (for reasons specify'd in the preface to their Miscellanies) determin'd to own the most trifling pieces in which they had any hand, and to destroy all that remain'd in their power, the first sketch of this poem was snatch'd from the fire by Dr. <hi>Swift,</hi> who persuaded his friend to proceed in it, and to him it was therefore inscribed. But the occa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion of printing it was as follows.</p>
                  <p>There was publish'd in those Miscellanies, a Treatise of the <hi>Bathos,</hi> or <hi>Art of Sinking in Poetry,</hi> in which was a chapter, where the species of bad writers were rang'd in classes, and initial letters of names prefix'd for the most part at random. But such was the num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber of poets eminent in that art, that some one or other took every letter to himself. All fell into so violent a fury, that for half a year or more the common News<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>papers (in most of which they had some property, as being hired writers) were filled with the most abusive falshoods and scurrilities they could possibly devise: A liberty no ways to be wonder'd at in those people, and in those papers, that, for many years, during the uncontrolled license of the press, had aspersed almost all the great characters of the age, and this with impu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity, their own persons and names being utterly se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cret and obscure. This gave Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> the thought, that he had now some opportunity of doing good, by <gap extent="1 word" rend="content:〈◊〉">
                        <desc>illegible</desc>
                     </gap> and dragging into light these common ene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mies of mankind; since to invalidate this universal slan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der, it sufficed to shew what contemptible men were the authors of it. He was not without hopes, that by manifesting the dullness of those who had only malice to recommend them, either the booksellers would not find their account in employing them, or the men themselves, when discovered, want courage to proceed in so unlawful an occupation. This it was that gave birth to the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> and he thought an happiness, that by the late flood of slander on himself, he had ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quired such a peculiar right over their names as was ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessary to his design.</p>

                  <hi>There is certainly nothing in his Style,</hi> &amp;c.] This irony had small effect in concealing the author. The <hi>Dunciad,</hi> imperfect as it was, had not been publish'd two days, but the whole town gave it to Mr. <hi>Pope.</hi>
               </note>. nothing in his style and manner of writing which can distinguish or discover him: For if it bears any resemblance to that of Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> 'tis not improbable but it might be done on purpose, with a view to have it pass for his. But by the frequency of his allusions to <hi>Virgil,</hi> and a labour'd (not to say af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fected) <hi>shortness</hi> in imitation of him, I should think him more an admirer of the <hi>Roman</hi> poet than of the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and in that not of the same taste with his friend.</p>

retired himself from all the avocations and pleasures of the world, to attend diligently to its correction and perfection; and six years more he intended to bestow upon it, as it should seem by this verse of <hi>Statius</hi> which was cited at the head of his manuscript,
<q rend="inline">

            <p>Hence also we learn the true title of the Poem; which with the same certainty as we call that of <hi>Homer</hi> the <hi>Iliad,</hi> of <hi>Virgil</hi> the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> of <hi>Camoens</hi> the <hi>Lusiad,</hi> of <hi>Voltaire</hi> the <note place="bottom" n="i">

            </p>
            <p>It is styled <hi>Heroic,</hi> as being <hi>doubly</hi> so; not only with respect to its nature, which according to the best rules of the ancients, and strictest ideas of the moderns, is critically such; but also with regard to the heroical disposition and high courage of the wri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter, who dar'd to stir up such a formidable, irritable, and implacable race of mortals.</p>
            <p>The time and date of the Action is evidently in the last reign, when the office of City poet expir'd
<pb n="237" facs="234"/>
upon the death of <hi>Elkanah Settle,</hi> and it is fix'd to the Mayoralty of Sir <hi>Geo. Thorold.</hi> But there may arise some obscurity in Chronology from the <hi>names</hi> in the poem, by the inevitable removal of some au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thors, and insertion of others, in their niches. For whoever will consider the unity of the whole design, will be sensible, that the <hi>Poem was not made for these Authors, but these Authors for the Poem:</hi> I should judge that they were clapp'd in as they rose, fresh and fresh, and chang'd from day to day; in like manner as when the old boughs wither, we thrust new ones into a chimney.</p>
            <p>I would not have the reader too much troubled or anxious, if he cannot decypher them; since when he shall have found them out, he will probably know no more of the persons than before.</p>
            <p>Yet we judg'd it better to preserve them as they are, than to change them for fictitious 'names, by which the satire would only be multiplied and applied to many instead of one. Had the Hero, for instance, been called <hi>Codrus,</hi> how many would have affirm'd him to have been Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Mr. <hi>D.</hi> Sir <hi>R. B,</hi> &amp;c. but now all that unjust scandal is saved by calling him <hi>Theobald,</hi> which by good luck happens to be the name of a real person.</p>
            <p>I am indeed aware, that this name may to some appear too mean for the Hero of an Epic Poem: But it is hoped, they will alter that opinion, when they find, that an author no less eminent than <hi>la Bruyere</hi> has honour'd him with frequent mention, and thought him worthy a place in his characters.</p>
