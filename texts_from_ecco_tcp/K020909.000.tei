I think your billet said you were alone. I now ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pect you will explain this mystery, by other means than tears and blushes.—Pray speak, and clear my doubts.</p>

                  <p>Your kindness has encouraged me. Your lordship knows my mother died while I was yet an in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fant, and that my father married soon again.—From that unhappy hour, I became an alien to his heart and person; under pretence of education, I was sent to school, where I received the honour of your lord<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship's frequent and friendly visits, and remain'd there 'till about two years since.—Wou'd I had never left it!</p>

                  <p>The taunts, the cruelties I met at home, are not to be describ'd. 'Till about six weeks since, there was a match proposed to me, with the most detesta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble of men which I, prostrate at my father's feet, and bathing them with tears, refused.</p>

                  <p>Every argument was used to persuade, every threat to terrify me, into compliance, but in vain. During this time of persecution, my father's ill health obliged him to visit Bath; I was permitted to attend him, upon promising to try to conquer my aversion to this hated marriage.—I promised any thing, to gain a respite.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>As you describe your situation, I cannot blame you.—But was it aversion to the match pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed, or prepossession for some other object, that ruled your will? I beg you will be sincere. Your blushes answer me.—But go on.</p>

                  <p>I do not mean, my lord, to hide a single thought; sincerity is the fair garb of virtue, and they who know no guilt, need no disguise. At Bath, I
<pb n="5" facs="9"/>
met a gentleman, whom I had known at school, his sister was my friend and favourite there, and, in my childish days, he used to call himself my lover.—Even then I thought him, as sure he is this moment, the most amiable of his sex.</p>

                  <p>This gentleman renew'd his former courtship, if I may be allow'd the term, while my first impres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions recurr'd with added strength.

                  <p>I received a billet from him, requesting me to see him when the family were retired to rest. My father had ordered every thing to be got ready for leaving Bath next day.</p>

                  <speaker>Emi.</speaker>
                  <p>He came, and while he uttered the tenderest vows of everlasting love, we heard a noise in my closet, to which he flew, and, on forcing it open, to our mutual astonishment, a gentleman rushed out. My dear, deceived, unhappy lover, called on him to draw; and, casting a look of rage, mix'd with con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tempt, at me, said, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Life is no longer worth my care, thy perfidy has made it hateful to me."</q> I threw myself between their swords, and scream'd so loud, that it brought my father, and all the family, into the room. At sight of him, my terror and con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fusion redoubled. I ran down stairs into the street, without knowing whither I went, or what to do. The night coach was setting off for London, at that moment; I got into it, without determining on any thing, but that I wou'd not return; and hither it has brought me.</p>

                  <p>Welcome to London, my dear Charles; but to what happy chance are we indebted for your return? I understood that you meant to pass a philo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sophical summer, at your seat in the west, in reading and retirement. But it grew dull, I suppose; it wou'd not do, Sir Charles; tho' you have not made a very long trial of it, I think, neither.</p>

                  <p>I have not indeed, my lord, made the smallest attempt towards the rational scheme you hint at. Thoughts of a very different nature have, for some time past, wholly occupied my mind, and left no room for any thing beside, but friendship, and Lord Belmont.</p>

                  <p>Lord Belmont is much yours. But from this sententious speech, and that grave countenance, I think I may, without being a conjuror, pronounce, that the gay and lively Sir Charles Somerville is on the point of matrimony with some well-jointur'd widow, or rich heiress; and that he is, at this very moment, making an exact calculation of the fortune he shall allot to his seventh son, by, and of that mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riage lawfully begotten.</p>

                  <p>Your servant, ladies—what, at work? you are a most indefatigable creature, niece Mary, and sometimes remind me of those industrious maid<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ens, that work'd beds and hangings, as I have heard my grandmother say; for those mechanical amuse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments were entirely out of fashion, before my youth was capable of instruction.</p>

                  <p>Your ladyship has given up your time to more abstruse and difficult employments, the study of the learned languages; but as every person may not have capacity, or inclination, to employ their minds in that way, I look upon works of fancy as pleasing and innocent amusements.</p>

                  <p>That's a bad phrase, niece; revels imply revelling, which is a term indecent for so young a lady to make use of. I declare, I was turned of twen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty, before I cou'd be prevail'd on to pronounce the word jollity; and then it was at the earnest intreaty of poor dear Mr. Feeble, that I wou'd give it utter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance. It was a dying request, for he expired of a galloping consumption, in a few hours after I had granted his desire.</p>

                  <p>There are some very odd whims come in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to my head about this girl, sister; she is quite a beauty, nay, seems accomplish'd too; a clergyman's daughter! that's the old story. But in short, Maria, I begin to think this wise brother of ours has his failings, like other men, and growing indolent, as they all do, chuses to bring his favourites near home: did you observe with what an enquiring eye he looked at you? He thought he might easily impose on poor aunt Bridget and me, but he is mistaken. Was this his fine present?</p>

                  <p>I grant the utmost; but still there is a somewhat that strikes upon my mind, and tells me there is mystery in this affair; and I am determin'd to find it out, if I can.</p>

                  <p>My dear Belmont, you have stated this argument quite wrong, it was not passion that tri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>umph'd over reason, but reason that subdued passion. I can now see, nay feel, what an abject wretch he must be, who trusts his happiness in a woman's pow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>er—damn'd, smiling mischiefs, all!—I will, hence<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>forth, see, and admire the pretty baubles, as I wou'd a fine piece of china, but no more attribute worth and honour to them, than maleability to that; for if my Emily cou'd deceive, there is no truth in woman.</p>

                  <p>By calling it common, my lord, you al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low it the general sense of mankind, which is, no doubt, founded on experience. I am therefore de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>termined to profit by it, so far as to retain my free<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom at least.

                  <p>That thought had quite escap'd me. I left a servant behind, whom I expect this night, in order to discover who my rival was; and also to find out what her father had done, or meant to do, with his unworthy, yet too lovely daughter: I fear he will use her cruelly, my lord.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, faith, my lord, I have always look'd upon chivalry as a very ridiculous science, and yet I begin to think it has its foundation in na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture, for I never yet heard of a damsel in distress, that I did not wish to relieve her.</p>

                  <p>Sir Charles, this affair is much too serious to jest with. You have asked my opinion, and, as a man of honour, and your friend, I now declare, I think your travelling scheme shou'd be entirely laid aside, until this mystery is properly explain'd. Not<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>withstanding your affected gaiety, I am certain you still love this lady.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>There again, your lordship is guilty of a small error, only mistaking the past for the present tense; say I did love her, if you please.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, Sir Charles, grant you no longer love, you are certainly a man of honour, and must therefore think it incumbent on you to clear a lady's character, which may possibly have suffered as much on your account, in the minds of others, as she has done in yours, from this unlucky accident.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>Wou'd to heaven that I cou'd clear her to my own heart, from all suspicion, with as much justice, as I can to the world, of what relates to me; in her whole conduct and behaviour towards me, she was purity herself, her soul seem'd even lovelier than her form, and cast a kind of glory round her beauty, which, while it awed, transported, raised, and chastis'd desire—yet she is false!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>

                  <p>Be that as it may, your lordship has con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vinc'd me that I shou'd not leave London for a few days; within that term, or never, a clue will certainly be found, to lead us thro' this maze; I therefore will abide the event; certain it can't be worse than what I fear.</p>

                  <p>I'll go instantly, and find out the fellow that sold it to me, and if he cannot prove my ring a thousand years old, at least, I'll give him a hundred strokes with my ratan, and get my fifty guineas again.</p>

                  <p>He, like many others, mistakes a passion for science, for the knowledge of it, and is, therefore, for ever liable to imposition. But we have all our failings, and let his pass. I think, Louisa, you gave up your opinion too tamely, I was in hopes we should

                  <p>Sir Charles, this is a language I am not us'd to hear; but lovers, like lunatics, have leave to rail, when the mad fit is on them: I think her inno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cent, and will defend her.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>My dear Lord Belmont, if I have in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jur'd you, by imagining you to be this unknown per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son's friend, therefore no longer mine, what apology, what atonement can I make?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, Sir Charles, you have wrong'd both truth and friendship; I never had a friend I dared to injure, or disclaim; yet, if it was not a vision that you saw, you are in some degree excuse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able—yet, why shou'd he come here?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>That is indeed a mystery—but as I cou'd not imagine he came to any one within these walls, except your lordship, I hope you'll pardon the frenzy of a man who thought himself aggriev'd in the most tender points, his love and friendship.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir Charles, your seeming motives for re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sentment were so strong, that I can readily forget the effects—I hope we are friends again—but let the
<pb n="37" facs="41"/>
conviction of your present error lead you to doubt, at least, the certainty of some former appearances.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>O, my too generous friend! let me be happy still in your esteem, but banish from my mind all thoughts of love. Her guilt is fully proved; she fled, that fatal night, from Bath, with her seducer. Curses blast him!</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>What reason have you to think so?— <stage>[aside]</stage> 'Tis plain he does not know she's here, nor can I now inform him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>My servant is return'd, and brings this sad account; he left her poor unhappy father setting out in pursuit of—I cannot name her, my once lovely Emily.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>In such a scene of complicated distress, may she not have fled for refuge to some friend? Why will you think the worst?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>O no, my lord, she had no friend to fly to; for sure he is the worst of foes, as well as vil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lains, that wou'd destroy her innocence. I doubt not but the wretch may abandon her to want and infamy.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot think that she is in his power. It is improbable that a well-educated maid shou'd take so rash a step, but on a certainty of marriage with the man she lov'd.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>I shou'd rejoice to think as you do; and were there but the slightest foundation for hope, wou'd gladly rest upon it. But all my doubts are at an end; I am therefore determined to quit England. but not 'till I have found the man, who has robbed me of my peace, and Emily. I'll go this moment in pursuit of him.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>I am very glad to see you, sir.</p>

                  <p>You were but a child, my lord, when I left London, on the death of my first wife.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>I am sorry, sir, not to have been better known to so near a relation. Pray how does my cousin Emily? I used to visit her often, while she was at school.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>South.</speaker>
                  <p>She is very well, my lord, and that's my greatest grief. If she had died with her mother, she wou'd have been happy, and so wou'd I.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>You will pardon me, sir, but that thought seems so very unnatural.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>South.</speaker>
                  <p>Not at all, not at all, my lord; she has been a plague to me, ever since she was born; and my present lady, Mrs. Southerne, always said she wou'd be so. And Mrs. Southerne, let me tell your lord<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship, is a parlous wise woman, and never was mista<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ken in her whole life; at least, I never thought her in the wrong, and therefore never contradicted her.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>I should be sorry to think Mrs. Southerne never err'd in judgment, for then my cousin must have verified this infallible lady's prediction.</p>

                  <speaker>South.</speaker>
                  <p>And so she has, my lord. I, like a careful father, as I was, and in regard to her poor mother's memory, provided a proper and convenient match for her; my neighbour Winterbottom, my lord, a man pretty near my own age, one that was fit to conduct and manage such a raw, headstrong chit, as she; a discreet person, let me tell you; and a great favourite of Mrs. Southerne's.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>You cou'd not surely think of marrying my cousin to a person as old as her father, sir?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>South.</speaker>
                  <p>Why not, why not, my lord, she made no objection to his years, but truly she dislik'd his fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mily and person, because he was not a fine smock-fac'd beau, and cou'd not trace his pedigree up to Adam, forsooth; a conceited undutiful minx as she was.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot blame my cousin's spirit, sir; her birth, youth, and fortune, entitle her to a very dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent match; but were she a beggar, sir, she had better serve, to earn her bread, than wed the man she hates.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>South.</speaker>
                  <p>Very fine, my lord; but stay 'till you hear the end of that high spirit.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>Whatever her conduct may have been, sir, I fear yours towards her, has justified it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>South.</speaker>
                  <p>No, no, I was too tender of her; when she got into the pouts, and cry'd and roar'd, I promised not to force her to this marriage; but if she wou'd be a dutiful child, and consent to it, I wou'd take her with me to Bath; she promis'd she wou'd try to obey me, and, in an ill hour, to Bath I brought her.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>And there, I suppose, she married the first man that ask'd her.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>South.</speaker>
                  <p>Worse, much worse than that: she sent a fine spark, a baronet, I think he was, to ask her for his wife, tho' she knew very well, that Mrs. Southerne
<pb n="40" facs="44"/>
had pass'd her word she shou'd marry Winterbottom; and did she think I wou'd make my lady a liar? No, no, I sent him a packing, and order'd madam to prepare for Southerne-hall directly.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>May I not presume to say, sir, that this proceeding was too violent?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>South.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray don't interrupt me, my lord, and you shall hear how this gentle lady behaved.—About eleven that night, when I was smoking my pipe, I heard her squall; I ran into her chamber, and there I found the knight, and another of her lovers, I sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose, tilting at each other; I beat down their passes with my crutch, the candle fell to the ground, and before the servants could bring light, madam and all were fled.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>Have you heard nothing of her since?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>South.</speaker>
                  <p>Not a syllable, nor wou'd I ever have en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quired about her, but that my lady's honour is en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gaged to Winterbottom. Now, if you can assist me to discover where she is, I'll bring a replevin for her, and carry her home directly. If Winterbottom will marry her, so—if not, I'll keep her close enough to prevent her bringing any farther disgrace on me, while I live, I warrant you.</p>

                  <p>Yes, her maid Sally, a forward young flirt, like her mistress, told the servants that his name was Freeman.</p>

                  <p>Now I beg, my lord, that you will send out immediately to all the inns and lodging-houses about town, to look for Emily; my servants shall go one way, yours another, and I think we can't well miss of her; though London is hugely grown; since I was here, that's certain.</p>

                  <p>You may be sure, sir, that I shall take every proper method for the service of my cousin; but it is
<pb n="41" facs="45"/>
not by a replevin, that her character is to be reco<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vered, though her person may. You, as her father, sir, are first bound to do her justice; to call the man who has wrong'd her to a strict account, and make him clear her fame by instant marriage.</p>

                  <p>What! I call any one to account! I fight for her! Not I, truly. I am a civil magistrate, the law is my weapon, and if I can reclaim her by that, I will.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>South.</speaker>
                  <p>Even what your lordship pleases; you shall be heartily welcome to dispose of her to whom you will for me. Try if you can make a match for her, suited to her birth and youth, since you don't ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prove of that I had proposed. But not a penny will I give to buy her a fop, or a coxcomb, or a title; yet if either of those fellows she went off with, will marry her without money, why I'll e'en give my con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent, that I may he no longer plagu'd with her; tho' I am very much afraid that Mrs. Southerne will be angry.</p>

                  <p>Miss Lawson, my uncle requests that you will not refuse such a trifle, as he offers; it is a thing of no sort of value, indeed, I think of neither use, nor ornament.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Loui.</speaker>
                  <p>Bless me, Miss Lawson, you are the very paragon of humility; tho' I confess I think you are right not to be teized with such a disagreeable animal; a thing, that by pretending to imitate human speech, puts one out of humour with the sound of our own voice, as much as a monkey does with our species; I hate parrots, and monkeys.</p>

                  <p>I shou'd be sorry to find fault with any thing you lik'd, sir, but I thought it was merely as a naturalist, that you kept such a number of parrots; I did not think it was for the pleasure of hearing them talk.</p>

I'll get you a very fine noesgay to-morrow, I'll pull my paul diack tulip for you; the root cost me twenty pounds, but you shall have it. Sure you won't be cruel to me now!

                  <p>I think he is himself a greater curiosity, than any in his collection, my lord, but I fancy he has a mind to dispose of them all together, and means to give a bargain of them to Miss Lawson.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>You wrong my uncle's taste; I have not heard of his proposing to marry any lady these five years. Before that time, he used to be generally in love twice a year, and had his summer and winter passions, which he constantly chang'd with his cloaths for the season.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Mar.</speaker>
                  <p>I am surpriz'd, my lord, that among such a variety of mistresses, he never found one that wou'd marry him; his person must have been tolerable, when he was young; his family and fortune unex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceptionable.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>Be assur'd, sister, that was not the case; but by the time he had brought the lady to think favour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ably of him, he began to discover some imperfection in her. Perhaps her nose was a hair's breadth longer or shorter than it shou'd be, according to the exact rules of proportion; a foot, or a finger, perhaps, disgusted him; on which, he immediately quitted his pursuit, and went in search of another model.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>I fancy, Louisa, that must be at all times a difficult matter to accomplish; a fine woman will, doubtless, captivate many, but there is something more than beauty, necessary to preserve her conquest over one.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Loui.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, so they say, my lord; but I pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>test I can't credit it. It is impossible, I think, for a woman to lose her power, while she retains her beauty.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Mar.</speaker>
                  <p>A moment's recollection must furnish you with such a number of instances to contradict your assertion, Louisa, that I'm afraid the argument will drop, on your conviction; and I shou'd like vastly to have it carried on.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Loui.</speaker>
                  <p>O! never fear, we'll keep it up; but I won't admit of odds; 'tis only with my brother I argue.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>Well then, I grant, that while beauty lasts, it will always have admirers. But these, Louisa, are but pageants to a conqueror; the triumph must be found at home, in the heartfelt love and esteem of a man of sense and honour.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Loui.</speaker>
                  <p>True, my lord, but that same beauty, that causes admiration and attention in other men, will necessarily preserve our husband's love.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>By no means, Louisa; possession damps the ardor of desire; merit alone can keep the flame alive, and hinder every wanton gale from blowing it abroad; that, like the vestal fire, must be preserv'd by constant watching.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Loui.</speaker>
                  <p>By your account, my lord, a married woman has just as bad a life as a vestal, if her whole time is to be spent in keeping one spark alive.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>
                  <p>I will allow her task is full as arduous, tho' more pleasing. Men are naturally inconstant; and a husband may sometimes see a woman fairer than his wife; but 'tis her fault, if in the whole circle, he can find one that so well deserves his love; whose temper, manners, conduct, and behaviour, are so much suited to his sentiments; who knows no wish or will, but to please him—these charms, the homeliest woman may acquire; without them, the fairest form that ever struck our eyes, cannot retain one heart.</p>

                  <p>Indeed, my lord, we are vastly obliged to you for this excellent lesson; and ought to think our<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves extremely happy in such a sensible and kind in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>structor.</p>

                  <p>Why, Jack, I thought you men of busi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness were more exact? Do you think I can't hold it 'till Monday, that you call upon me before the three days are out? This wou'd be enough to hurt a man's credit in the city; and why it shou'd not be deem'd a mark of insolvency, at this end of the town, I can't conceive.</p>

                  <speaker>E. Free.</speaker>
                  <p>As you seem to think a citizen has no ideas but what relate to trade, I shall, upon your own pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mises, explain my visit. When we have but a slight
<pb n="51" facs="55"/>
opinion of our debtor, and find him tardy, we think it necessary to observe his motions: but where a man of honour is concerned, tho' we may doubt his power, we don't suspect his principles, and therefore never watch his motions.</p>

                  <speaker>Y. Free.</speaker>

                  <speaker>E. Free.</speaker>
                  <p>You have drawn this sarcasm upon yourself, by presuming too hastily to explain my motives for this visit; the irksomness of which gives but a bad idea of your integrity. Those who act fairly, need not fear inspection.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Y. Free.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, brother, you seem to me quite on the <hi>qui vive,</hi> always in a disposition to quarrel, which is a mighty improper temper of mind to visit a lover in, who shou'd be all tun'd to harmony and joy.</p>

                  <p>The mind shou'd be at peace within itself, to feel those charming sensations; they must arise from conscious worth—not even the power of beauty can awake them, in mean, dishonest hearts; I there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore shou'd rejoice, that you were capable of feeling their happy influence.</p>

                  <p>Prithee, Harry, lay by the coxcomb, and tho' you don't act, speak at least, like a rational creature; what cou'd prevent your visiting the lady, all this evening; upon the plan I propos'd, and you agreed to?</p>

                  <speaker>Y. Free.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, really, Jack, you are so very impe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tuous, you won't give a man time to answer your
<pb n="52" facs="56"/>
why's, and your wherefores; but if it will satisfy you, I did wait on the lady, this very evening; and am, by her appointment, to see her again this night. I then hope to prevail on her to step into an hired equipage with me, and for the rest of my life, to drive in my own.</p>

                  <speaker>E. Free.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't understand you, sure; is she so ro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mantically smitten, that she can't wait a few days, 'till her friends and yours have adjusted matters for her honour and security? There can be no doubt, that my father will gladly receive her as his daughter, and make a proper settlement, since she is inclin'd to honour us with her alliance.—She cannot have had time to consult her friends.</p>

                  <p>No, truly, nor ever shall, with my con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent. Why, Jack, it is impossible you shou'd be so ignorant as you seem; you'll never be a rich man, that's certain. There are coups de maitres in trade, as well as love; and if a man has not courage to make a push, he will never make a fortune.—Consult her friends, ha, ha, ha!</p>

                  <p>I consider my attendance on your lordship at any hour, as one of the rational pleasures of a man

                  <p>You are extremely polite, Mr. Freeman, and I shall be glad of every opportunity to cultivate the friendship of a person, whose dealings, as a man, and manners, as a gentleman, I so much esteem.

                  <p>I am extremely oblig'd to your lordship; but my father now growing infirm, his health requires a recess from trouble and fatigue, and he passes most of the summer in the country; I therefore am confin'd.</p>

                  <p>Yes, my lord; but he is too fine a gen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tleman to follow it. The air of Lombard-street is too heavy for his constitution; he usually resides at this end of the town, has quitted business, and commenc'd fortune-hunter.</p>

                  <p>Well, madam, <stage>[<hi>to</hi> Emily]</stage> the story is but short. You had a very pretty maid at Bath.</p>

                  <speaker>Y. Free.</speaker>
                  <p>But I did, sir, nor was she in the least cruel; and by her appointment I was passing thro' your chamber into hers, at the very instant that gen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tleman <stage>[<hi>points to Sir</hi> Charles]</stage> and you came into the room. She pushed me into your closet, shut the door, and vanished. The rest you know too well.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>How cou'd you, sir, be so inhuman, to let my Emily suffer? O Belmont, I dare not look upon her.</p>

                  <p>Sir Charles, had your passion suffered you to have asked me then my errand, I shou'd have frankly own'd it; but while I had hopes of Lady Louisa. I could not, with any decency, have reveal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed these last particulars. And now, that I have done all in my power to set matters to rights, and atone my faults, I can only, in palliation of my behaviour, say, that it was not badness of heart, but dislike to a se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dentary life, which tempted me to leave my sphere, and soar at higher objects. In which, I am now sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sible, I have justly failed; and must encounter the deserved fate of those, whom vanity seduces from the situation of life provided for them.</p>

                  <p>The daring to confess we have been wrong, is not only the highest act of bravery, but the best security for our future amendment; and thus re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>claim'd, I am proud to embrace my brother.</p>

               </sp>

                  <speaker>Emi.</speaker>
                  <p>O, sir, I am too happy to have my conduct cleared, both to the world and you! And yet, how gladly wou'd I now recall the fond confession, which distraction wrung from my weak, sinking heart, and now o'erwhelms me with blushes and confusion.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Loui.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Sir Char.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not, my lord, presume to ask for Emily's forgiveness, nor dare I form a hope that she shou'd grant it.</p>

                  <p>Sir Charles, I do not wish to triumph over your humility, but beg you will allow me to indulge my own generosity, by assuring you, that thro' this whole affair I never once condemned, but pitied your mistake.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Why, what is all this about? If you like my niece, why don't you come and take her, and her pity, and her pardon together, and I'll give you a good five thousand pounds into the bargain. Come, brother, give her hand to Sir Charles, and let's make an end of it.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Bel.</speaker>

               <l>Deuce take me!—if I ha'nt forgot it quite.</l>
               <l>To see my name in first night's play-bill printed,</l>
               <l>A character quite new, in time quite stinted;</l>
               <l>An Epilogue, besides, to get by heart,</l>

               <l>Lest I should fret—for fretting spoils one's beauty,</l>
               <l>That, in obedience to the kind command,</l>
               <l>A suppliant to your favour, here I stand:</l>
               <l>And hope, instead of what had been prepar'd,</l>
               <l>Some nonsense of my own, may now be heard.</l>
