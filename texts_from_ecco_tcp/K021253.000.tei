            <head>PROLOGUE. SPOKEN BY MR. REDDISH.</head>
            <l>CRITICS, hark forward! noble game and new;</l>
            <l>A fine West Indian started full in view:</l>
            <l>Hot as the soil, the clime, which gave him birth,</l>
            <l>You'll run him on a burning scent to earth;</l>
            <l>Yet don't devour him in his hiding place,</l>
            <l>Bag him, he'll serve you for another chace;</l>
            <l>For sure that country has no feeble claim,</l>
            <l>Which swells your commerce, and supports your fame.</l>
            <l>And in this humble sketch, we hope you'll find,</l>
            <l>Some emanations of a noble mind;</l>
            <l>Some little touches, which, tho' void of art,</l>
            <l>May find perhaps their way into the heart.</l>
            <l>Another hero your excuse implores,</l>
            <l>Sent by your sister kingdom to your shores;</l>
            <l>Doom'd by Religion's too severe command,</l>
            <l>To fight for bread against his native land:</l>
            <l>A brave, unthinking, animated rogue,</l>
            <l>With here and there a touch upon the brogue;</l>
            <l>Laugh, but despise him not, for on his lip</l>
            <l>His errors lie; his heart can never trip.</l>
            <l>Others there are——but may we not prevail</l>
            <l>To let the gentry tell their own plain tale?</l>
            <l>Shall they come in? They'll please you, if they can;</l>
            <l>If not, condemn the bard——but spare the <hi>Man.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For speak, think, act, or write in angry times,</l>
            <l>A wish to please is made the worst of crimes;</l>
            <l>Dire slander now with black envenom'd dart,</l>
            <l>Stands ever arm'd to stab you to the heart.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="3"/>Rouse, Britons, rouse, for honour of your isle,</l>
            <l>Your old good humour; and be seen to smile.</l>
            <l>You say we write not like our fathers—true,</l>
            <l>Nor were our fathers half so strict as you,</l>
            <l>Damn'd not each error of the poets pen,</l>
            <l>But judging man, remember'd they were men.</l>
            <l>Aw'd into silence by the times abuse,</l>
            <l>Sleeps many a wise, and many a witty muse;</l>
            <l>We that for mere experiment come out,</l>
            <l>Are but the light arm'd rangers on the scout:</l>
            <l>High on Parnassus' lofty summit stands</l>
            <l>The immortal camp; there lie the chosen bands!</l>
            <l>But give fair quarter to us puny elves,</l>
            <l>The giants then will sally forth themselves;</l>
            <l>With wit's sharp weapons vindicate the age,</l>
            <l>And drive ev'n <hi>Arthur's</hi> magic from the <hi>Stage.</hi>

               <head>SCENE I. A MERCHANT's COMPTING HOUSE.</head>
               <stage>In an inner room, set off by glass doors, are discovered several clerks, employed at their desks. A writing table in the front room. <hi>STOCKWELL</hi> is discovered reading a letter; <hi>STUKELY</hi> comes gently out of the back room, and observes him some time before he speaks.</stage>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STUKELY.</speaker>
                  <p>HE seems disordered: some thing in that letter; and I'm afraid of an unpleasant sort. He has many ventures of great account at sea; a ship richly freighted for Barcelona; another for Lisbon; and others expected from Cadiz of still greater value. Besides these, I know he has many deep concerns in foreign bottoms, and under-writings to a vast amount. I'll accost him. Sir! Mr. Stockwell!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STOCKWELL.</speaker>
                  <p>Stukely!—Well, have you ship'd the cloths?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STUKELY.</speaker>
                  <p>I have, Sir; here's the bill of lading, and copy of the invoice: the assortments are all compared: Mr. Traffick will give you the policy upon Change.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STOCKWELL.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis very well; lay these papers by; and no more of business for a while. Shut the door Stukely; I have had long proof of your friendship and fidelity to me; a
<pb n="2" facs="6"/>
matter of most intimate concern lies on my mind, and, 'twill be a sensible relief to unbosom myself to you; I have just now been informed of the arrival of the young West Indian, I have so long been expecting; you know who I mean.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STUKELY.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Sir; Mr. Belcour, the young gentleman, who inherited old Belcour's great estates in Jamaica.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STOCKWELL.</speaker>
                  <p>Hush, not so loud; come a little nearer this way. This Belcour is now in London; part of his baggage is already arrived; and I expect him every minute. Is it to be wonder'd at, if his coming throws me into some agitation, when I tell you, Stukely, he is my son?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STUKELY.</speaker>
                  <p>Your son</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STOCKWELL.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, Sir, my only son; early in life I accompanied his grandfather to Jamaica as his clerk; he had an only daughter, somewhat older than myself; the mother of this gentleman; it was my chance (call it good or ill) to engage her affections: and, as the inferiority of my condition made it hopeless to expect her father's con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent; her fondness provided an expedient, and we were privately married; the issue of that concealed engage<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment is, as I have told you, this Belcour.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STUKELY.</speaker>
                  <p>That event, surely, discovered your connexion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STOCKWELL.</speaker>
                  <p>You shall hear. Not many days after our marriage old Belcour set out for England; and, during his abode here, my wife was, with great secresy, delivered of this son. Fruitful in expedients to disguise her situation, without parting from her infant, she contrived to have it laid and received at her door as a foundling. After some time her father returned, having left me here; in one of those favourable moments, that decide the for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tunes of prosperous men, this child was introduced; from that instant, he treated him as his own, gave him his name, and brought him up in his family.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <pb n="3" facs="7"/>
                  <speaker>STUKELY.</speaker>
                  <p>And did you never reveal this secret, either to old Belcour, or your son?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STOCKWELL.</speaker>
                  <p>Never.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STUCKELY.</speaker>
                  <p>Therein you surprise me; a merchant of your emi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nence, and a member of the British parliament, might surely aspire without offence to the daughter of a planter. In this case too, natural affection would prompt to a discovery.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STOCKWELL.</speaker>
                  <p>Your remark is obvious; nor could I have persisted in this painful silence, but in obedience to the dying in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>junctions of a beloved wife. The letter, you found me reading, conveyed those injunctions to me; it was dic<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tated in her last illness, and almost in the article of death; (you'll spare me the recital of it) she there con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jures me, in terms as solemn, as they are affecting, never to reveal the secret of our marriage, or withdraw my son, while her father surviv'd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STUKELY.</speaker>
                  <p>But on what motives did your unhappy lady found these injunctions?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STOCKWELL.</speaker>
                  <p>Principally, I believe, from apprehension on my ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count, lest old Belcour, on whom at her decease I wholly depended, should withdraw his protection: in part from consideration of his repose, as well knowing the discovery would deeply affect his spirit, which was haughty, vehement, and unforgiving: and lastly, in re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard to the interest of her infant, whom he had warmly adopted; and for whom, in case of a discovery, every thing was to be dreaded from his resentment. And, indeed, though the alteration in my condition might. have justified me in discovering myself, yet I always thought my son safer in trusting to the caprice than to the justice of his grand-father. My judgment has not suffered by the event; old Belcour is dead, and has be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>queathed his whole estate to him we are speaking of.</p>

                  <speaker>STUCKELY.</speaker>
                  <p>Now then you are no longer bound to secrecy.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>STOCKWELL.</speaker>
                  <p>True; but before I publickly reveal myself, I could wish to make some experiment of my son's disposition; this can be only done by letting his spirit take its course without restraint; by these means, I think I shall dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cover much more of his real character under the title of his merchant, than I should under that of his father.</p>

swarm of musquetoes, I proceeded a little too roughly to brush them away with my rattan; the sturdy rogues took this in dudgeon, and beginning to rebel, the mob chose different sides, and a furious scuffle ensued; in the course of which, my person and apparel suffered so much, that I was obliged to step into the first tavern to refit, before I could make my approaches in any decent trim.</p>

                  <p>The major, child, has travelled through various king<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doms and climates, and has more enlarged notions of fe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>male merit than falls to the lot of an English home-bred lover; in most other countries, no woman on your side forty would ever be named in a polite circle.</p>

                  <p>Right, Madam; I've been told that in Vienna they have coquets upon crutches and Venuses in their grand climateric; a lover there celebrates the wrinkles, not the dimples, in his mistress's face. The Major, I think, has served in the imperial army.</p>

                  <p>Are you piqu'd, my young Madam? Had my sister Louisa now yielded to the addresses of one of Major O'Flaherty's person and appearance, she would have had some excuse; but to run away, as she did, at the age of sixteen too, with a man of old Dudley's sort—</p>

                  <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                  <p>Was, in my opinion, the most venial trespass that ever girl of sixteen committed; of a noble family, an engaging person, strict honour, and sound understanding, what ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>complishment was there wanting in Captain Dudley, but that which the prodigality of his ancestors had deprived him of?</p>

                     </stage> So you have put on a red coat too, as well as your father; 'tis plain what value you set upon the good advice Sir Oliver used to give you; how often has he caution'd you against the army?</p>

                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>Had it pleased my grandfather to enable me to have obeyed his caution, I would have done it; but you well know how destitute I am; and 'tis not to be wonder'd at if I prefer the service of my king to that of any other master.</p>

                  <p>The distresses of your family, child, are quite out of the question at present; had Sir Oliver been pleased to consider them, I should have been well content;

You found me in a pretty snug retir'd way of life at Bologne, out of the noise and bustle of the world, and wholly at my ease; you, indeed, was upon the wing, with a fiery persecu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion at your back: but, like a true son of <hi>Loyola,</hi> you had then a thousand ingenious devices to repair your fortune; and this your native country was to be the scene of your performances: fool that I was, to be in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veigled into it by you; but thank Heaven, our partner<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship is revocable: I am not your wedded wife, praised be my stars! for what have we got, whom have we gull'd but ourselves; which of all your trains has taken fire; even this poor expedient of your bookseller's shop seems abandoned, for if a chance customer drops in, who is there, pray, to help him to what he wants?</p>

                  <p>Captain Dudley, good morning to you.</p>

                  <speaker>DUDLEY.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. Fulmer, I have borrow'd a book from your shop; 'tis the sixth volume of my deceased friend Tristram: he
<pb n="18" facs="22"/>
is a flattering writer to us poor soldiers; and the divine story of Le Fevre, which makes part of this book, in my opinion of it, does honour not to its author only, but to human nature.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>FULMER.</speaker>
                  <p>He is an author I keep in the way of trade, but one I never relish'd; he is much too loose and profligate for my taste.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>DUDLEY.</speaker>
                  <p>That's being too severe: I hold him to be a moralist in the noblest sense; he plays indeed with the fancy, and some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>times perhaps too wantonly; but while he thus designedly masks his main attack, he comes at once upon the heart; refines, amends it, softens it; beats down each selfish barrier from about it, and opens every sluice of pity and benevolence.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>FULMER.</speaker>
                  <p>We of the catholic persuasion are not much bound to him.—Well, Sir, I shall not oppose your opinion; a fevourite author is like a favourite mistress; and there you know, Captain, no man likes to have his taste arraigned.</p>

                  <p>Upon my word, Sir, I don't know what a man likes in that case; 'tis an experiment I never made.</p>

                  <p>I guess'd as much; I laid it at no less: why 'tis a wearisome time; 'tis an apprenticeship to a profession, fit only for a patriarch. But preferment must be closely follow'd: you never could have been so far behind-hand in the chace, unless you had palpably mistaken your way. You'll pardon me, but I begin to perceive you have lived in the world, not with it.</p>

                  <p>It may be so; and you perhaps can give me better council. I'm now soliciting a favour; an exchange to a company on full pay; nothing more; and yet I meet a thousand bars to that; tho', without boasting, I should think the certificate of services, which I sent in, might have purchased that indulgence to me.</p>

                  <p>No wife? I'm heartily sorry for it; for then she's his mistress; and that I take to be the more desperate case of the two: pray, Madam, wasn't there a lady just now turn'd into your house? 'Twas with her I wish'd to speak.</p>

                  <speaker>FULMER.</speaker>
                  <p>Poverty, disappointment, and all the distresses attendant thereupon: sorrow enough of all conscience: I soon found how it was with him by his way of living, low enough of all reason; but what I overheard this morning put it out of all doubt.</p>

                  <speaker>BELCOUR.</speaker>
                  <p>What did you overhear this morning?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>FULMER.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, it seems he wants to join his regiment, and has been beating the town over to raise a little money for that purpose upon his pay; but the climate, I find, where he is going is so unhealthy, that nobody can be found to lend him any.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>BELCOUR.</speaker>
                  <p>Why then your town is a damn'd good-for-nothing town; and I wish I had never come into it.</p>

                  <speaker>FULMER.</speaker>
                  <p>That's what I say, Sir; the hard-heartedness of some folks is unaccountable. There's an old Lady Rusport, a near relation of this gentleman's; she lives hard by here, opposite to Stockwell's, the great merchant; he sent to her a begging, but to no purpose; though she is as rich as a Jew, she would not furnish him with a farthing.</p>

                  <speaker>O'FLAHERTY.</speaker>
                  <p>Faith and troth, Master Dudley, you may say that; 'tis thirty years, come the time, that I have followed the trade, and in a pretty many countries—Let me see—In the war before last I serv'd in the Irish Brigade, d'ye see; there after bringing off the French monarch, I left his service, with a British bullet in my body, and this ribband in my button-hole. Last war I followed the fortunes of the German eagle, in the corps of grenadiers; there I had my belly-full of fighting, and a plentiful scarcity of every thing else. After six and twenty engagements, great and small, I went off with this gash on my scull, and a kiss of the empress queen's sweet hand, (Heaven bless it) for my pains: since the peace, my dear, I took a little turn with the Confederates there in Poland—but such another set of madcaps!—by the Lord Harry, I never knew what it was they were scuffling about.</p>

                  <speaker>DUDLEY.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, Major, I won't add another action to the list, you shall keep your promise with Lady Rusport; she re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quires me to leave London; I shall go in a few days, and you may take what credit you please from my compliance.</p>

                  <p>Give me your hand, my dear boy, this will make her my own; when that's the case, we shall be brothers you know, and we'll share her fortune between us.</p>

                  <speaker>DUDLEY.</speaker>
                  <p>Not so, Major; the man who marries Lady Rusport will have a fair title to her whole fortune without division.

                  <speaker>O'FLAHERTY.</speaker>
                  <p>Upon the best grounds in the world; first I think she will comply, because she is a woman; secondly, I am per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>suaded she won't hold out long, because she's a widow; and thirdly, I make sure of her, because I've married five wives and never failed yet; and, for what I know, they're all alive and merry at this very hour.</p>

                  <speaker>DUDLEY.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, Sir, go on and prosper; if you can inspire Lady Rusport with half your charity, I shall think you deserve all her fortune; at present, I must beg your excuse: good morning to you.</p>

                  <p>A good sensible man, and very much of a soldier; I did not care if I was better acquainted with him: but 'tis an awkward kind of a country for that; the English, I ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serve, are close friends, but distant acquaintance. I suspect the old lady has not been over generous to poor Dudley: I shall give her a little touch about that; upon my soul I know but one excuse a person can have for giving nothing, and that is, like myself, having nothing to give.</p>

                  <p>Well, I vow, my dear Charles, that is delightfully said, and deserves my very best curtesy: your flattery, like a rich jewel, has a value not only from its superior lustre, but from its extraordinary scarceness: I verily think this is the only civil speech you ever directed to my person in your life.</p>

                  <p>Nay, now you relapse again: don't you know if you keep well with a woman on the great score of beaury, she'll never quarrel with you on the trifling article of good sense? But any thing serves to fill up a dull yawning hour with an insipid cousin; you have brighter moments, and warmer spirits for the dear girl of your heart.</p>

                  <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, wherefore do I not? since you never allowed me a place in yours: but go, Sir, I have no right to stay you; go where your heart directs you, go to the happy, the distinguished fair one.</p>

                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>Now, by all that's good, you do me wrong: there is no such fair one for me to go to, nor have I an acquaintance amongst the sex, yourself excepted, which answers to that description.</p>

                  <p>O, Charles, give me your hand; if I have offended you, I ask you pardon; you have been long acquainted with my temper, and know how to bear with its infirmities.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>Thus, my dear Charlotte, let us seal our reconciliation <stage>kissing her hand.</stage> Bear with thy infirmities! By Heaven, I know not any one failing in thy whole composition, ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cept that of too great a partiality for an undeserving man.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                  <p>And you are now taking the very course to augment that failing. A thought strikes me: I have a commission that you must absolutely execute for me: I have immediate oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>casion for the sum of two hundred pounds; you know my fortune is shut up till I am of age: take this paltry box; it contains my ear-rings, and some other bawbles I have no use for; carry it to our opposite neighbour, Mr. Stock<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>well; I don't know where else to apply; leave it as a de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posit in his hands, and beg him to accomodate me with the sum.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>Dear Charlotte, what are you about to do? How can you possibly want two hundred pounds?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                  <p>How can I possibly do without it, you mean? Doesn't every lady want two hundred pounds? Perhaps I have lost it at play; perhaps I mean to win as much to it; perhaps I want it for two hundred different uses.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>Pooh! pooh! all this is nothing; don't I know you never play?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                  <p>You mistake; I have a spirit to set not only this trifle, but my whole fortune upon a stake; therefore make no wry faces, but do as I bid you: you will find Mr. Stock<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>well a very honourable gentleman.</p>

                  <speaker>O'FLAHERTY.</speaker>
                  <p>Let me see; i'faith a comely personage: by his fur cloak I suppose he was in the Russian service, and by the gold chain round his neck I should guess he had been honoured with the order of St. Catharine.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>LADY RUSPORT.</speaker>
                  <p>No, no; he meddled with no St Catharines: that's the habit he wore in his mayoralty; Sir Stephen was Lord Mayor of London; but he is gone, and has left me a poor, weak, solitary widow behind him.</p>

                  <p>By all means, then, take a strong, able, hearty man to repair his loss: if such a plain fellow as one Dennis O'Flaherty can please you, I think I may venture to say, without any disparagement to the gentleman in the fur-gown there—</p>

                  <p>That's true; she cannot be a woman of honour, and Dudley is an unconscionable young rogue to think of keeping one fine girl in pay, by raising contributions on another; he shall therefore give her up; she is a dear, bewitching, mischievous, little devil; and he shall posi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tively give her up.</p>

                  <p>It is obvious, Miss Rusport, that your charms will suffer no impeachment by the absence of these superficial orna<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments; but they should be seen in the suite of a woman of fashion, not as creditors to whom you are indebted for your appearance, but as subservient attendants, which help to make up your equipage.</p>

                  <p>I have only to request, Madam, that you will allow Mr. Belcour, a young gentleman, in whose happiness I parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cularly interest myself, to have the honour of delivering you the box of jewels.</p>

                  <speaker>STOCKWELL.</speaker>
                  <p>I flatter myself you will not find him totally undeserving your good opinion; an education, not of the strictest kind, and strong animal spirits, are apt sometimes to betray him into youthful irregularities; but an high principle of ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour, and an uncommon benevolence, in the eye of candor, will, I hope, atone for any faults, by which these good qualities are not impaired.</p>

                  <speaker>CHARLOTTE.</speaker>
                  <p>Nor need you, Mr. Stockwell: I shall be studious to deserve his friendship; and, though I have long since un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>alterably placed my affections on another, I trust, I have not left myself insensible to the merits of Mr. Belcour; and hope that neither you nor he will, for that reason, think me less worthy your good opinion and regards.</p>

<pb n="57" facs="61"/>
to the charter of my colony, not by a jury of En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>glish spinsters: truth is, I've given away your jewels; caught with a pair of sparkling eyes, whose lustre blinded their's, I served your property, as I shou'd my own, and lavish'd it away; let me not totally despair of your for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>giveness: I frequently do wrong, but never with impu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity; if your displeasure is added to my own, my punish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment will be too severe.

I take your jewels for the present, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause I know there is no other way of reconciling you to yourself; but If I give way to your spirit in one point, you must yield to mine in another; remember I will not keep more than the value of my own jewels: there is no need to be pillaged by more than one woman at a time, Sir.</p>

                  <p>The sister! So, so; he has imposed upon her too— this is an extraordinary visit truly. Upon my soul the assurance of some folks is not to be accounted for.</p>

                  <p>We, that are poor, Louisa, shou'd be cautious; for this reason I wou'd guard you against Belcour; at least till I can unravel the mystery of Miss Rusport's diamonds; I was disappointed of finding him at Mr. Stockwell's, and am now going in search of him again: he may intend honourably, but I confess to you I am stagger'd; think no more of him, therefore, for the present: of this be sure, while I have life, and you have honour, I will pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tect you, or perish in your defence.</p>

                  <p>Think of him no more! Well, I'll obey; but if a wand'ring uninvited thought should creep by chance into my bosom, must I not give the harmless wretch a shelter? Oh! yes; the great artificer of the human heart knows every thread he wove into its fabric, nor puts his work to harder uses than it was made to bear: my wishes then,
<pb n="66" facs="70"/>
my guiltless ones I mean, are free; How fast they spring within me at that sentence! Down, down, ye busy crea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tures! Whither wou'd you carry me? Ah! there is one amongst you, a forward, new intruder, that in the like<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness of an offending, generous man, grows into favour with my heart. Fye, fye upon it! Belcour pursues, insults me; yet such is the fatality of my condition, that what shou'd rouse resentment, only calls up love.</p>

                  <p>True; I do know your situation, your real one, Miss Dudley, and am resolv'd to snatch you from it; 'twill be a meritorious act; the old Captain shall rejoice; Miss Rusport shall be made happy; and even he, even your beloved brother, with whose resentment you threaten me, shall in the end applaud and thank me: Come, thou'rt a dear enchanting girl, and I'm determin'd not to live a minute longer without thee.</p>

                  <p>Yes, with the same facility that you bestow'd upon me Miss Rusport's diamonds. For shame! for shame! was that a manly story?</p>

                  <speaker>LOUISA.</speaker>
                  <p>Do so; restore her own jewels to her, which I suppose you kept back for the purpose of presenting others to her of a greater value; but for the future, Mr. Belcour, when you wou'd do a galant action to that lady, don't let it be at my expence.</p>

                  <p>Oh, Sir; make no excuse. I think you have not found me forward to pry into the secrets of your pleasures and pursuits; 'tis not my disposition; but there are times, when want of curiosity, wou'd be want of friendship.</p>

                  <p>To the lady the most penitent submission I can make is justly due, but in the execution of an act of justice it never shall be said my soul was swayed by the least particle of fear: I have received a challenge from her brother; now tho' I wou'd give my fortune, almost my life itself, to purchase her happiness, yet I cannot abate her one scruple of my honour; I have been branded with the name of villain.</p>

                  <p>Yes, Sir, these are your honest landlord and land<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lady, now in custody for defrauding this gentleman of certain diamonds intended to have been presented to your sister.

                  <p>Had you been as silent heretofore, Madam, it would have saved you some trouble; but we don't want your confession. This letter, which you wrote to Mr. Bel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cour, will explain your design; and these diamonds, which of right belong to Miss Rusport, will confirm your guilt: the law, Mrs. Fulmer, will make you speak, tho' I can't.

                  <p>Hold a moment: Mr. Stockwell, you are a gentle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man that knows the world, and a member of parlia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment; we shall not attempt to impose upon you; we know we are open to the law, and we know the ut<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most it can do against us. Mr. Belcour has been ill used to be sure, and so has Miss Dudley; and, for my own part, I always condemn'd the plot as a very foolish plot, but it was a child of Mrs. Fulmer's brain, and she would not be put out of conceit with it.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. FULMER.</speaker>

                  <p>Most readily, Mr. Stockwell; a quarrel well made up, is better than a victory hardly earned. Give me your hand, Belcour; o' my conscience you are too honest for the country you live in. And now, my dear lad, since peace is concluded on all sides, I have a discovery to make to you, which you must find out for yourself, for deuce take me if I rightly comprehend it, only that your aunt Rusport is in a conspiracy against you, and a vile rogue of a lawyer, whose name I forget, at the bottom of it.</p>

                  <p>Miss Dudley, I have solicited this audience to repeat to you my penitence and confusion: How shall I atone? What reparation can I make to you and vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tue?</p>

                  <p>To me there's nothing due, nor any thing demanded of you but your more favourable opinion for the future, if you should chance to think of me: Upon the part of virtue I'm not empower'd to speak, but if hereafter, as you range thro' life, you shou'd surprize her in the person of some wretched female, poor as myself and not so well protected, enforce not your advantage, compleat not your licentious triumph, but raise her, rescue her from shame and sorrow, and reconcile her to herself again.</p>

As I now cease to view you in that false light I lately did, can you, and in the fulness of your bounty will you, cease also to reflect upon the libertine addresses I have paid you, and look upon me as your reform'd, your rational admirer?</p>

                  <speaker>LOUISA.</speaker>
                  <p>Are sudden reformations apt to last; and how can I be sure the first fair face you meet will not ensnare affections so unsteady, and that I shall not lose you lightly as I gain'd you?</p>

                  <speaker>BELCOUR.</speaker>
                  <p>Because tho' you conquer'd me by surprize, I have no inclination to rebel; because since the first moment that I saw you, every instant has improv'd you in my eyes, because by principle as well as passion I am un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>alterably yours, in short there are ten thousand causes for my love to you, would to Heaven I could plant one in your soft bosom that might move you to return it!</p>

Why you shameless hussey!—But I won't condescend to waste a word upon you.—You, Sir, you, Mr. Stockwell, you fine, sanctified, fair-dealing man of conscience, is this the principle you trade upon? Is this your neighbourly system, to keep a house of recep<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion for run-away daughters, and young beggarly fortune-hunters?</p>
