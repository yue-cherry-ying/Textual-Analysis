            <l>WHO shall decide, when Doctors dis-agree,</l>

            <l>You hold the word from Jove to Momus giv'n,</l>
            <l>That Man was made the standing Jest of Heav'n,</l>
            <l>And Gold but sent to keep the Fools in play,</l>
            <l>For half to heap, and half to throw away.</l>

            <l>But I, who think more highly of our Kind,</l>
            <l>(And surely Heav'n and I are of a mind)</l>
            <l>Opine, that Nature, as in duty bound,</l>
            <l>Deep hid the shining Mischief under ground:</l>
            <l>But when, by Man's audacious Labor won,</l>
            <l>Flam'd forth this Rival to its Sire the Sun,</l>
            <l>Then, in plain prose, were made two sorts of men,</l>
            <l>To squander some, and some to hide agen.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>Like Doctors thus, when much Dispute has past,</l>
            <l>We find our Tenets just the same at last:</l>
            <l>Both fairly owning Riches in effect</l>
            <l>No Grace of Heav'n, or Token of th' Elect;</l>
            <l>Giv'n to the Fool, the Mad, the Vain, the Evil,</l>

            <l>'Tis thus we riot, while who sow it, starve.</l>
            <l>What Nature wants (a phrase I much distrust)</l>
            <l>Extends to Luxury, extends to Lust;</l>

            <l>Behold Sir Balaam now a man of spirit,</l>
            <l>Ascribes his gettings to his parts and merit,</l>
            <l>What late he call'd a Blessing, now was Wit,</l>
            <l>And God's good providence, a lucky Hit.</l>
            <l>Things change their titles as our manners turn,</l>
            <l>His Compting-house imploy'd the Sunday-morn;</l>
            <l>Seldom at church, ('twas such a busy life)</l>
            <l>But duly sent his family and wife.</l>
            <l>There (so the Dev'l ordain'd) one Christmas-tide,</l>
            <l>My good old Lady catch'd a cold, and dy'd.</l>

            <l>A Nymph of Quality admires our Knight;</l>
            <l>He marries, bows at Court, and grows polite:</l>
            <l>Leaves the dull Cits, and joins (to please the fair)</l>
            <l>The well-bred Cuckolds in St. James's air:</l>
            <l>First, for his son a gay commission buys,</l>
            <l>Who drinks, whores, fights, and in a duel dies.</l>

His daughter flaunts a Viscount's tawdry wife,</l>

            <l>In Britain's Senate he a seat obtains,</l>

            <l>My Lady falls to Play: so bad her chance,</l>
            <l>He must repair it; takes a bribe from France;</l>
            <l>The House impeach him; Co * *. by harangues,</l>
            <l>The Court forsakes him, and Sir Balaam hangs:</l>
            <l>Wife, son, and daughter, Satan! are thy prize,</l>
            <l>And sad Sir Balaam curses God and dies.</l>
