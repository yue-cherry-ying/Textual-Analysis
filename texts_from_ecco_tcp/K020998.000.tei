               <head>ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST EPISTLE.</head>
               <p>Introduction.—Design of the Poem to remove prejudices which obstruct the cultivation of Epic writing.—Origin of Poetry.—Honors paid to its infancy.—Homer the first Poet remaining.—Difficulty of the question why he had no Successor in Greece.—Remark of a celebrated Writer, that as Criticism flourishes Poetry declines.— Defence of Critics.—Danger of a bigoted acquiescence in critical Systems—and of a Poet's criticising his own works.—Advantages of Friendship and study of the higher Poets.</p>

            <l>Yet seiz'd that honor'd name, the Poet's Friend.</l>

Of the several authors who have written on Epic Poetry, many of the most celebrated are more likely to confound and depress, than to enlighten and exalt the young Poetical Student. The Poetics of Scaliger, which are little more than a laboured panegyric of Virgil, would lead him to regard the Aeneid as the only standard of perfection; and the more elegant and ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>complished Vida inculcates the same pusillanimous lesson, though in spirited and harmonious verse.</p>

                  <p>A Critic, who lately rose to great eminence in our own country, has endeavoured by a more singular method to damp the ardour of inven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive Genius, and to annihilate the hopes of all who would aspire to the praise of originality in this higher species of poetical composition. He has attempted to establish a Triumvirate in the Epic world, with a perpetuity of dominion. Every reader who is conversant with modern criticism will perceive that I allude to the following passage in the fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mous Dissertation on the sixth Book of Virgil:—"Just as Virgil ri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>valled Homer, so Milton emulated both of them. He found Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mer possessed of the province of Morality; Virgil of Politics; and nothing left for him but that of Religion. This he seized, as aspiring to share with them in the government of the Poetic world: and, by means of the superior dignity of his subject, hath gotten to the head of that Triumvirate, which took so many ages in forming. these are the three species of the Epic Poem; for its largest sphere is <hi>human action,</hi> which can be considered but in a <hi>moral,</hi> political, or religious view: and these the three <hi>Makers</hi>; for each of their Poems was struck out at a heat, and came to perfection from its first essay. Here then the grand scene was closed, and all farther improvements of the Epic at an end."</p>
                  <p>I apprehend that few critical remarks contain more <hi>absurdity</hi> (to use the favourite expression of the author I have quoted) than the preceding lines. Surely Milton is himself a proof that <hi>human action</hi> is not the largest sphere of the Epic Poem; and as to Virgil, his most passionate admirers must allow, that in subject and design he is much less of an original than Camoens or Lucan. But such a critical statute of limita<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, if I may call it so, is not less pernicious than absurd. To dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>figure the sphere of Imagination with these capricious and arbitrary zones is an injury to science. Such Criticism, instead of giving spirit
<pb n="121" facs="120"/>
and energy to the laudable ambition of a youthful Poet, can only lead him to start like Macbeth at unreal mockery, and to exclaim, when he is invited by Genius to the banquet, "The Table's full."</p>

                  <p>I have ventured to suppose that Greece produced no worthy successor of Homer, and that her exploits against the Persians were not celebrated by any Poet in a manner suitable to so sublime a subject;—yet an author named Chaerilus is said to have recorded those triumphs of his country in verse, and to have pleased the Athenians so highly as to obtain from them a public and pecuniary reward. He is supposed to have been a cotemporary of the historian Herodotus. But from the general silence of the more early Greek writers concerning the merit of this Poet, we may, I think, very fairly conjecture that his compositions were not many degrees su<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perior to those of his unfortunate namesake, who frequented the court of Alexander the Great, and is said to have sung the exploits of his Sove<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reign, on the curious conditions of receiving a piece of gold for every good verse, and a box on the ear for every bad one. The old Scholiast on Horace, who has preserved this idle story, concludes it by saying, that the miserable Bard was beat to death in consequence of his contract. Some eminent modern Critics have indeed attempted to vindicate the reputation of the more early Chaerilus, who is supposed to be confounded, both by Horace himself, and afterwards by Scaliger, with the Chaerilus rewarded by Alexander. Vossius <note place="bottom" n="*">De Historicis Graecis.</note>, in particular, appears a warm advo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cate in his behalf, and appeals to various fragments of the ancient Bard
<pb n="122" facs="121"/>
preserved by Aristotle, Strabo, and others, and to the testimony of Plu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tarch in his favour. But on consulting the fragments he has referred to, they rather fortify than remove my conjecture. The scrap preserved by Aristotle in his Rhetoric is only half a verse, and quoted without any commendation of its author. The two citations in Strabo amount to little more. The curious reader may also find in Athenaeus an Epitaph on Sardanapalus, attributed to this Poet; who is mentioned by the same author as peculiarly addicted to the grosser excesses of the table.—Let us now return to that Chaerilus whom Horace has "damn'd to everlasting fame." The judicious and elegant Roman Satirist seems remarkably un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>just, in paying a compliment to the poetical judgment of his patron Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gustus, at the expence of the Macedonian hero. Alexander appears to have possessed much more poetical spirit, and a higher relish for poetry, than the cold-blooded Octavius. It is peculiarly unfair, to urge his li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berality to a poor Poet as a proof that he wanted critical discernment, when he had himself so thoroughly vindicated the delicacy of his taste, by the enthusiastic Bon-mot, that he had rather be the Thersites of Homer than the Achilles of Chaerilus.</p>

                  <p>Though Bossu is called "the best explainer of Aristotle, and one of the most learned and judicious of modern critics," by a writer for whose opinions I have much esteem, I cannot help thinking that his celebrated Essay on Epic Poetry is very ill calculated either to guide or to inspirit a young Poet. The absurdity of his advice concerning the mode of forming the fable, by chusing a moral, inventing the incidents, and then searching history for names to suit them, has been sufficiently exposed: and as to his leading idea, concerning the design of Homer in the composition of the Iliad and Odyssey, I apprehend most poetical readers must feel that he is pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bably mistaken; for it is a conjectural point, and placed beyond the pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sibility of decision. Perhaps few individuals differ more from each other in their modes of thinking, by the force of education and of na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tional manners, than a modern French Critic and an early Poet of Greece; yet the former will often pretend, with the most decisive air,
<pb n="123" facs="122"/>
to lay open the sensorium of an ancient Bard, and to count every link in the chain of his ideas. Those who are most acquainted with the move<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments of imagination, will acknowledge the steps of this airy power to be so light and evanescent in their nature, that perhaps a Poet himself, in a few years after finishing his work, might be utterly unable to recol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lect the exact train of thought, or the various minute occurrences which led him to the general design, or directed him in the particular parts of his poem. But, in spite of the interval of many hundred centuries, the decisive magic of criticism can call up all the shadows of departed thought that ever existed in his brain, and display, with a most asto<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nishing clearness, the precise state of his mind in the moment of com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position.</p>
                  <p>"Homere," says Bossu, "<note place="bottom" n="*">Livre i. chap. 8.</note>voyoit les Grecs pour qui il écri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>voit, diviséz en autant d'etats qu'ils avoient de villes considerables: chacune faisoit un corps à part &amp; avoit sa forme de gouvernement inde<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pendamment de toutes les autres. Et toute-fois ces etats differens etoient souvent obligéz de se reünir comme en un seul corps contre leurs enne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mis communs. Voila sans doute deux sortes de gouvernemens bien dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferens, pour etre commodement reunis en un corps de morale, &amp; en un seul poëme.</p>
                  <p>"Le poëte en a donc fait deux fables separées. L'une est pour toute la Grece reünie en un seul corps, mais composée de parties independantes les unes des autres, comme elles etoient en effect; &amp; l'autre est pour chaque etat particulier, tels qu'ils etoient pendant la paix, sans ce premier rap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port &amp; sans la necesseté de se reünir.</p>
                  <p>"Homere a donc pris pour le fond de sa fable, cette grande verité, que la Mesintelligence des princes ruine leurs propres etats."</p>
                  <p>On the Odyssey Bossu remarks, "Que la verité qui sert de fond à cette fiction, &amp; qui avec elle compose la fable, est, que l'absence d'une personne hors de chez soi, ou qui n'a point l'oeil à ce qui s'y fait, y cause de grands desordres <note place="bottom" n="†">Livre i. chap. 10.</note>."</p>
                  <p>On the mature consideration of these two moral axioms, the Critic supposes the sublime Bard to have begun his respective Poems; for Homer, continues he, "<note place="bottom" n="‡">Livre i. chap. 13.</note> n'avoit point d'autre dessein que de former
<pb n="124" facs="123"/>
agreablement les moeurs de ses Citoïens, en leur proposant, comme dit Horace, ce qui est utile ou pernicieux, ce qui est honnete ou ce qui ne l'est pas: — il n'a entrepris de raconter aucune action particuliere d'Achille ou d'Ulysse. Il a fait la fable et le dessein de ses poemes, sans penser à ces princes; &amp; ensuite il leur a fait l'honneur de donner leurs noms aux heros qu'il avoit feints."</p>
                  <p>The preceding remarks of this celebrated Critic have been frequently admired as an ingenious conjecture, which most happily illustrates the real purpose of Homer. To me they appear so much the reverse, that if I ventured to adopt any decided opinion on a point so much darkened by the clouds of antiquity, I should rather incline to the idea which Bossu affects to explode, and suppose the Poems of Homer intended panegyrics on the very princes whom the Critic affirms he never thought of while he was designing the works which have made them immortal.</p>
                  <p>There is a striking passage on this subject in a dialogue of Plato, which I shall enlarge upon, for two reasons: 1st, As it proves that the latter persuasion concerning the purpose of Homer was enter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tained at Athens; and 2dly, Because it gives me a pleasing oppor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tunity of supporting the learned Madame Dacier against an ill-grounded censure of a late English critic. In her Preface to the Odyssey, she asserts that the judgment of antiquity decided in favor of the Iliad; and she appeals to part of the sentence in Plato to which I have alluded, as a proof of her assertion. Mr. Wood, in a note to the Introduction of his Essay on Homer, endeavours to shew the insufficiency of this proof; and still farther, to convince us that Madame Dacier was utterly mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>taken in her sense of the passage to which she appealed. If he ventures to contradict this learned lady, he does not however insult her with that insolent pertness with which she is frequently treated in the notes to Pope's Homer; and which, for the honour of our English Poet, I will not suppose to be his. But though Mr. Wood endeavours to sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port his opinion by argument, I apprehend that he is himself mistaken, and that Madame Dacier is perfectly right in understanding the words of Socrates in their literal sense, without the least mixture of irony. It is true, indeed, that the aim of Socrates, in the course of the dialogue, is to ridicule the presumption and ignorance of the sophist Hippias, in the
<pb n="125" facs="124"/>
most ironical manner; but the particular speech on Which Madame Dacier founds her opinion, is a plain and simple address to Eudicus, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore he enters on his debate with the Sophist. It turns on the most simple circumstance, the truth of which Eudicus could hardly be ig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>norant of, namely, the sentiments of his own father concerning the Poems of Homer. As these sentiments are such as I believe most ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mirers of the ancient Bard have entertained on the point in question, I perfectly agree with Madame Dacier in thinking that Socrates means to be literal and serious, when he says to Eudicus, <gap rend="content:〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉">

" I have heard your father Apemantus say, that the Iliad of Homer was a finer poem than his Odyssey, and as far surpassed it in excellence as the virtue of Achilles surpassed the virtue of Ulysses; for those two poems, he said, were purposely composed in honour of those two heroes: the Odyssey, to shew the virtues of Ulysses; the Iliad, those of Achilles." Plato's Lesser Hippias, translated by Syden<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ham, page 13.</p>
                  <p>Let us now return to Bossu; whose opinion concerning the purpose of Homer we may venture to oppose, supported as it is by an ingenious interpretation of some ambiguous passages in the Poetics of Aristotle; and this opposition may be grounded, not so much on the sentence which I have quoted from Plato, as on the probable conduct of Epic compo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sition in the early ages of poetry. In such periods as produced the talents of Virgil and of Dryden, when all the arts of refined flattery were perfectly understood, we can easily conceive that they might both be tempted to compliment the reigning monarch under the mask of such heroic names as history could supply, and their genius accommodate to their purpose. We find accordingly, that the Roman Bard is supposed to have drawn a flattering portrait of his Emperor in the character of Aeneas, and that the English Poet has, with equal ingenuity, enwrapt the dissolute Charles the Second in the Jewish robes of King David. But in so rude an age as we must admit that of Homer to have been; when the Poet was certainly more the child of Nature than of Art; when he had no history to consult, perhaps no patron to flatter, and no critics
<pb n="126" facs="125"/>
to elude or obey; in such an age, may we not more naturally conjecture, that poetical composition was neither laboured in its form, nor deep in its design? that, instead of being the slow and systematic product of po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>litical reasoning, it was the quick and artless offspring of a strong and vivifying fancy, which, brooding over the tales of tradition, soon raised them into such life and beauty, as must satisfy and enchant a warlike and popular audience, ever ready to listen with delight to the heroic feats of their ancestors.</p>
                  <p>If the learned Bossu appears unfortunate in his system concerning the purpose of Homer, he may be thought still more so in his attempt to analyze the Divinities of Virgil; for, to throw new light on the conven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of the Gods, in the opening of the tenth Aeneid, he very seriously informs us, that "<note place="bottom" n="*">Book v. chap. I.</note>Venus is divine mercy, or the love of God towards virtuous men; and Juno his justice."</p>
                  <p>I cannot conclude these very free strictures on a celebrated author, without bearing a pleasing testimony to the virtues of the man.—Bossu is allowed by the biographers of his country to have been remarkable for the mildest manners and most amiable disposition; totally free from that imperious and bigotted attachment to speculative opinions, which the science he cultivated is so apt to produce. He endeared himself to Boileau by a generous act of friendship, that led to an intimacy between them, which was dissolved only by the death of the former, in 1680.</p>

                  <p>As it requires much leisure to examine, and more skill to unravel an intricate hypothesis, twisted into a long and laboured chain of quotation and argument, the Disserta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion on the sixth Book of Virgil remained for some time unrefuted. The public very quietly acquiesced in the strange position of its author, "That Aeneas's adventure to the infernal shades, is no other than a figurative description of his initiation into the Mysteries; and particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larly a very exact one of the spectacles of the Eleusinian." At length a superior but anonymous Critic arose, who, in one of the most judicious
<pb n="127" facs="126"/>
and spirited essays that our nation has produced on a point of classical literature, completely overturned this ill-founded edifice, and exposed the arrogance and futility of its assuming architect. The Essay I allude to is entitled "Critical Observations on the Sixth Book of the Aeneid;" printed for Elmsly, 1770: and as this little publication is, I believe, no longer to be purchased, the curious reader may thank me for transcribing a few of its most striking passages.</p>
                  <p>Having ridiculed, with great spirit and propriety, Warburton's gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral idea of the Aeneid as a political institute, and his ill-supported asser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, that both the ancient and modern poets afforded Virgil a pattern for introducing the Mysteries into this famous episode, the author pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceeds to examine how far the Critic's hypothesis of initiation may be supported or overthrown by the text of the Poet. "It is," says he, "from extrinsical circumstances that we may expect the discovery of Virgil's allegory. Every one of these circumstances persuades me, that Virgil described a real, not a mimic world, and that the scene lay in the Infernal Shades, and not in the Temple of Ceres.</p>

Whatever was animated (I appeal to every reader of taste) what<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever was terrible, or whatever was pathetic, evaporates into lifeless allegory.

The end of philosophy is truth; the end of poetry is pleasure.

But should a grave Doctor lay out fourscore pages in explaining away the sense and spirit of Virgil, I should have every inducement to believe that Virgil's soul was very different from the Doctor's.</p>

                  <p>Having shewn, in this spirited manner, how far the hypothesis of the Critic is inconsistent with particular passages, and with the general character of the Poet, the Essayist proceeds to alledge "two simple
<pb n="130" facs="129"/>
reasons, which persuade him that Virgil has not revealed the secret of the Eleusinian mysteries: the first is <hi>his ignorance,</hi> and the second <hi>his discretion.</hi>" The author then proves, by very ingenious historical arguments, 1st, That it is probable the Poet was never initiated him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self; and, 2dly, That if he were so, it is more probable that he would not have violated the laws both of religion and of honour, in betraying the secret of the Mysteries; particularly, as that species of profanation is mentioned with abhorrence by a cotemporary Poet.

When Horace composed the Ode which contains the preceding passage, "the Aeneid (continues my author) and particularly the sixth Book, were already known to the public <note place="bottom" n="*">Donat. in Virgil. Propert. l.ii. el. xxv. v. 66.</note>. The detestation of the wretch who reveals the Mysteries of Ceres, though expressed in general terms, must be applied by all Rome to the author of the sixth Book of the Aeneid. Can we seriously suppose that Horace would have branded with such wanton infamy one of the men in the world, whom he loved and honoured the most <note place="bottom" n="†">Hor. l.i. od. 3. l.i. serm. v. ver. 39, &amp;c.</note>?</p>
                  <p>"Nothing remains to say, except that Horace was himself ignorant of his friend's allegorical meaning; which the Bishop of Gloucester has since revealed to the world. It may be so; yet, for my own part, I should be very well satisfied with understanding Virgil no better than Horace did."</p>
                  <p>Such is the forcible reasoning of this ingenious and spirited writer. I have been tempted to transcribe these considerable por<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions of his Work, by an idea (perhaps an ill-founded one) that the circulation of his little Pamphlet has not been equal to its merit. But if it has been in any degree neglected by our country, it has not escaped
<pb n="131" facs="130"/>
the researches, or wanted the applause, of a learned and judicious fo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reigner. Professor Heyne, the late accurate and accomplished Editor of Virgil, has mentioned it, in his Comments to the sixth Book of the Aeneid, with the honour it deserves. He remarks, indeed, that the Author has censured the learned Prelate with some little acrimony; "Paullo acrius quam velis." But what lover of poetry, unbiassed by personal connection, can speak of Warburton without some marks of indignation? If I have also alluded to this famous Commentator with a contemptuous asperity, it arises from the persuasion that he has sullied the page of every Poet whom he pretended to illustrate; and that he frequently degraded the useful and generous profession of Criticism into a mean instrument of personal malignity: or (to use the more forcible language of his greatest antagonist) that he "invested himself in the high office of Inquisitor General and Supreme Judge of the Opinions of the Learned; which he assumed and exercised with a ferocity and despotism without example in the Republic of Letters, and hardly to be paralleled among the disciples of Dominic <note place="bottom" n="*">Letter to Warburton by a late Professor, &amp;c. page 9. 2d edition.</note>." It is the just lot of tyrants to be detested; and of all usurpers, the literary despot is the least excusable, as he has not the common tyrannical plea of necessity or interest to alledge in his behalf; for the prevalence of <hi>his edicts</hi> will be found to sink in proportion to the arbitrary tone with which they are pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nounced. The fate of Warburton is a striking instance of this impor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tant truth. What havock has the course of very few years produced in that pile of imperious criticism which he had heaped together! Many of his notes on Shakespeare have already resigned their place to the superior comments of more accomplished Critics; and perhaps the day is not far distant, when the volumes of Pope himself will cease to be a repository for the lumber of his friend. The severest enemies of Warburton must indeed allow, that several of his remarks on his Poeti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cal Patron are entitled to preservation, by their use or beauty; but the greater part, I apprehend, are equally destitute of both: and how far the Critic was capable of disgracing the Poet, must be evident to every reader who recollects that the nonsense in the Essay on Criticism, where
<pb n="132" facs="131"/>
Pegasus is made to <hi>snatch a grace,</hi> which is justly censured by Dr. War<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ton, was first introduced into the poem by an arbitrary transposition of the editor.</p>
                  <p>Though arrogance is perhaps the most striking and characteristical defect in the composition of this assuming Commentator, he had cer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tainly other critical failings of considerable importance; and it may possibly be rendering some little service to the art which he professed, to investigate the peculiarities in this singular writer, which conspire to plunge him in the crowd of those <hi>evanescent critics</hi> (if I may use such an expression) whom his friend Pope beheld in so clear a vision, that he seems to have given us a prophetical portrait of his own Commentator.

I shall therefore hazard a few farther observations, not only on this famous Critic of our age and country, but on the two greater names of antiquity, to each of whom he has been declared superior by the partial voice of enthusiastic friendship. I wish not to offend his most zealous adherents; and, though I cannot but consider him as a literary usurper, I speak of him as a great Historian said of more exalted tyrants, sine ira et studio, quorum causas procul habeo.—There seem to be three natural endowments requisite in the formation of an accomplished critic;—strong understanding, lively imagination, and refined sensibility. The first was the characteristic of Aristotle, and by the consent of all ages he is al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowed to have possessed it in a superlative degree. May I be pardoned for the opinion, that he enjoyed but a very moderate portion of the <hi>other two?</hi> I would not absolutely say that he had neither Fancy nor Feeling; but that his imagination was <hi>not brilliant,</hi> and that his sensibility was not exquisite, may I think be fairly presumed from the general tenor of his prose; nor does the little relique of his poetry contradict the idea. The two qualities in which Aristotle may be supposed defective, were the very two which peculiarly distinguish Longinus; who certainly wanted not understanding, though he might not possess the philosophi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cal
<pb n="133" facs="132"/>
sagacity of the Stagyrite. When considered in every point of view, he appears the most consummate character among the Critics of anti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quity. If Warburton wore any resemblance to either of these mighty names, I apprehend it must be to the former, and perhaps in imagina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion he was superior to Aristotle; but, of the three qualities which I have ventured to consider as requisite in the perfect Critic, I conceive him to have been miserably deficient in the last, and certainly the most essential of the three; for, as the great Commentator of Horace has phi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>losophically and truly remarked, in a note to that Poet, "Feeling, or Sentiment, is not only the surest, but the sole ultimate arbiter of works of genius <note place="bottom" n="*">Notes on the Epistle to Augustus, ver. 210.</note>." A man may possess an acute understanding and a lively imagination, without being a sound Critic; and this truth perhaps can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not be more clearly shewn than in the writings of Warburton. His understanding was undoubtedly acute, his imagination was lively; but Imagination and Sentiment are by no means synonymous; and he cer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tainly wanted those finer feelings which constitute accuracy of discern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, and a perfect perception of literary excellence. In consequence of this defect, instead of seizing the real sense and intended beauties of an author, he frequently followed the caprices of his own active fancy, which led him in quest of secret meanings and mysterious allusions; these he readily found, and his powers of understanding enabled him to dress them up in a plausible and specious form, and to persuade many readers that he was (what he believed himself to be) the restorer of ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nuine Criticism. As a farther proof that he was destitute of refined sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sibility, I might alledge the peculiarity of his diction, which, as Dr. Johnson has very justly remarked, is coarse and impure. Perhaps it may be found, that in proportion as authors have enjoyed the quality which I suppose him to have wanted, they have been more or less dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinguished by the ease, the elegance, and the beauty of their language: were I required to fortify this conjecture by examples, I should produce the names of Virgil and Racine, of Fenelon and Addison—that Addi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son, who, though insulted by the Commentator of Pope with the names of an indifferent Poet and a worse Critic, was, I think, as much superior to his insulter in critical taste, and in solidity of judgment, as he con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fessedly
<pb n="134" facs="133"/>
was in the harmony of his style, and in all the finer graces of beautiful composition.</p>

                  <p>These, and the six subse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quent lines, allude to the following passage in Dr. Warton's Essay on Pope. "I conclude these reflections with a remarkable fact. In no polished nation, after Criticism has been much studied, and the rules of writ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing established, has any very extraordinary work ever appeared. This has visibly been the case in Greece, in Rome, and in France, after Aristotle, Horace, and Boileau had written their Arts of Poetry. In our own country, the rules of the Drama, for instance, were never more com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pletely understood than at present; yet what uninteresting, though faultless, Tragedies have we lately seen? so much better is our judgment than our execution. How to account for the fact here mentioned, ade<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quately and justly, would be attended with all those difficulties that await discussions relative to the productions of the human mind, and to the delicate and secret causes that influence them; whether or no the natural powers be not confined and debilitated by that timidity and cau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion which is occasioned by a rigid regard to the dictates of art; or whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther that philosophical, that geometrical, and systematical spirit so much in vogue, which has spread itself from the sciences even into polite lite<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rature, by consulting only <hi>reason,</hi> has not diminished and destroyed <hi>sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timent,</hi> and made our poets write from and to the <hi>head,</hi> rather than the heart; or whether, lastly, when just models, from which the rules have necessarily been drawn, have once appeared, succeeding writers, by vainly and ambitiously striving to surpass those just models, and to shine and surprise, do not become stiff and forced, and affected in their thoughts and diction." Warton's Essay, page 209, 3d edition.—I admire this ingenious and modest reasoning; but, for the honour of that severer art, which this pleasing writer has the happy talent to enliven and embellish, I will venture to start some doubts concerning the fact itself for which he endeavours to account. Perhaps our acquaintance with those writ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings of Greece and Rome, which were subsequent to Aristotle and Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>race, is not sufficiently perfect to decide the point either way in respect
<pb n="135" facs="134"/>
to those countries. But with regard to France, may we not assert, that her poetical productions, which arose after the publication of Boileau's Didactic Essay, are at least equal, if not superior, to those which pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceded that period? If the Henriade of Voltaire is not a fine Epic poem, it is allowed to be the best which the French have to boast; not to mention the dramatic works of that extraordinary and universal author. If this remarkable fact may indeed be found true, I should rather suppose it to arise from the irritable nature of the poetic spirit, so peculiarly averse to restraint and controul. The Bard who could gallop his Pegasus over a free and open plain, might be eager to engage in so pleasing an exercise; but he who observed the direction-posts so thickly and so per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versely planted, that, instead of assisting his career, they must probably occasion his fall, would easily be tempted to descend from his steed, and to decline the course. Let me illustrate this conjecture by a striking fact, in the very words of the Poet just mentioned, who was by no means deficient in poetical confidence, and who has left us the following anec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dote of himself, in that pleasing little anonymous work entitled, Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mentaire Historique sur les Oeuvres de l' Auteur de la Henriade. "Il lut un jour plusieurs chants de ce poeme chez le jeune Président de Maisons, son intime ami. On l'impatienta par des objections; il jetta son manuscrit dans le feu. Le Président Hénaut l'en retira avec peine. "Souvenez vous (lui dit Mr. Hénaut) dans une de ses lettres, que c'est moi qui ai sauvé la Henriade, et qu'il m'en a couté une belle paire de manchettes."</p>
                  <p>To return to the Essay on Pope.—I rejoice that the amiable Critic has at length obliged the public with the conclusion of his most engaging and ingenious work: he has the singular talent to instruct and to please even those readers who are most ready to revolt from the opinion which he endeavours to establish; and he has in some degree atoned for that excess of severity which his first volume discovered, and which sunk the reputation of Pope in the eyes of many, who judge not for themselves, even far below that mortifying level to which he meant to reduce it. Had Pope been alive, to add this spirited essay to the bundle of writ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ings against himself which he is said to have collected, he must have felt, that, like the dagger of Brutus, it gave the most painful blow, from the character of the assailant:

There is nothing in Boileau's admirable Didactic Essay so liable to ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jection as the whole passage concerning Epic poetry. His patronage of the old Pagan divinities, and his oblique recommendation of Classical heroes, are alike exceptionable. Even a higher name than Boileau has failed in framing precepts for the Epic Muse. The maxims delivered by Tasso himself, in his Discourse on Epic poetry, are so far from perfect, that an agreeable and judicious French critic has very justly said of him, "S'il eût mis sa theorie en pratique, son poeme n'auroit pas tant de charmes <note place="bottom" n="*">Marmontel Poetique Françoise.</note>." I am not so vain as to think of succeeding in the point where these immortal authors have failed; and I must beg my reader to remember, that the present work is by no means intended as a code of laws for the Epic poet; it is not my design
<q>To write receipts how poems may be made.</q>
For I think the writer who would condescend to frame this higher spe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cies of composition according to the exact letter of any directions what<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever, may be most properly referred to that admirable receipt for an Epic poem with which Martinus Scriblerus will happily supply him. My serious desire is to examine and refute the prejudices which have pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duced, as I apprehend, the neglect of the Heroic Muse: I wish to kindle in our Poets a warmer sense of national honour, with ambition to excel in the noblest province of poesy. If my essay should excite that gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous enthusiasm in the breast of any young poetic genius, so far from wishing to confine him by any arbitrary dictates of my own imagination, I should rather say to him, in the words of Dante's Virgil,

                  <p>Parthenius, say the Commentators, was a disciple of Dionysius of Alexandria, who flourished under Nero and Trajan. Erycius, the author of the inscription, is supposed to have lived in the same age. Among the modern adversaries of Homer, the French are most remarkable for their severity and injustice: nor is it surprising, that the nation which has displayed the faintest sparks of Epic fire, should be the most solici<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tous to reduce the oppressive splendor of this exalted luminary. The most depreciating remarks on genius, in every walk, are generally made by those who are the least able to prove its rivals; and often, perhaps, not so much from the prevalence of envious malignity, as from the want of vivid and delicate perception. The merits and the failings of Homer were agitated in France with all the heat and acrimony of a theological dispute. Madame Dacier distinguished herself in the contest by her uncommon talents and erudition: she combated for the Grecian Bard with the spirit of Minerva defending the Father of the Gods. It must however be confest, that she sometimes overstepped the modesty of wisdom, and caught, unwarily, the scolding tone of Juno. It is indeed amusing, to observe a people, who pique themselves on their extreme po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liteness, and censure Homer for the gross behaviour of his Gods, engag<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing among themselves in a squabble concerning this very Poet, with all the unrefined animosity of his Olympian Synod. In the whole contro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versy there is nothing more worthy of remembrance and of praise, than the lively elegance and the pleasing good-humour of Mr. de la Motte, who, though not one of the most exalted, was certainly one of the most amiable, characters in the literary world; and made a generous return to the severity of his female antagonist, by writing an ode in her praise.
<pb n="141" facs="140"/>
Voltaire has pointed out, with his usual spirit, the failings of La Motte in his Abridgement of the Iliad; but he has frequently fallen himself into similar defects, and is equally unjust to Homer, against whom he has levelled the most bitter sarcasms, both in prose and verse. Voltaire at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tacking Homer, is like Paris shooting his arrow at the heel of Achilles: the two Poets are as unequal as the two ancient Warriors; yet Homer, like Achilles, may have his vulnerable spot; but with this happy dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ference, that although the shaft of ridicule, which is pointed against him, may be tinged with venom, its wound cannot be mortal. Perhaps no better answer can be made to all those who amuse themselves with writing against Homer, than the following reply of Madame Dacier to the Abbé Terrasson, who had attacked her favourite Bard in two abusive volumes:—"Que Monsieur l'Abbé Terrasson trouve Homere sot, ridi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cule, extravagant, ennuyeux, c'est son affaire, le public jugera si c'est un defaut à Homere de deplaire à M. l'Abbé Terrasson, ou à M. l'Abbé Terrasson de ne pas gouter Homere."</p>

                  <p>I mean not to injure the dignity of Pindar by this assertion. Though Quinctilian, in drawing the character of the Grecian Lyric Poets, has given him high pre-emi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nence in that choir, we may, I think, very fairly conjecture that some odes of Alcaeus and Stesichorus were not inferior to those of the Theban Bard, who is said to have been repeatedly vanquished in a poetical contest by his female antagonist Corinna. The absurd jealousy of our sex con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerning literary talents, has led some eminent writers to question the merits of Corinna, as Olearius has observed, in his Dissertation on the fe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>male Poets of Greece. But her glory seems to have been fully established
<pb n="142" facs="141"/>
by the public memorial of her picture, exhibited in her native city, and adorned with a symbol of her victory. Pausanias, who saw it, supposes her to have been one of the handsomest women of her time; and the ingenuity of some Critics imputes her success in the poetical contest to the influence of her beauty. They have taken some liberties less par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>donable with her literary reputation, and, by their curious comments on a single Greek syllable, made the sublime Pindar call his fair rival <hi>a Sow,</hi> though the unfortunate word <gap rend="content:〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉">

Time has left us only a few diminutive scraps of Corinna's Poetry; but Plutarch, in his Treatise on the Glory of the Athenians, has preserved one of her critical Bon-mots, which may deserve to be repeated. That author asserts, that Corinna instructed Pindar in his youth, and advised him to adorn his composition with the embellish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments of fable. The obedient Poet soon brought her some verses, in which he had followed her advice rather too freely; when his Tutress, smiling at his profusion, <gap rend="content:〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉">

Finding it ill received by his countrymen, he retired to Rhodes, where he is conjectured to have polished and completed his Work, supporting himself by the profession of Rhetoric, and receiving from the Rhodians the freedom of their city. He at length returned, with considerable honour, to the place of his birth, succeeding Eratosthenes in the care of the Alexan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>drian Library, in the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes, who ascended the throne of Egypt in the year before Christ 246. That prince had been
<pb n="143" facs="142"/>
educated by the famous Aristarchus, and rivalled the preceding sove<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reigns of his liberal family in the munificent encouragement of learning. Apollonius was a disciple of the poet Callimachus; but their connection ended in the most violent enmity, which was probably owing to some degree of contempt expressed by Apollonius for the light compositions of his master. The learned have vainly endeavoured to discover the particulars of their quarrel.— The only Work of Apol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lonius which has descended to modern times, is his Poem, in four Books, on the Argonautic expedition. Both Longinus and Quintilian have assigned to this Work the mortifying character of Mediocrity; but there lies an appeal from the sentence of the most candid and en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lightened Critics to the voice of Nature; and the merit of Apollonius has little to apprehend from the decision of this ultimate judge. His Poem abounds in animated description, and in passages of the most ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der and pathetic beauty. How finely painted is the first setting forth of the Argo! and how beautifully is the wife of Chiron introduced, holding up the little Achilles in her arms, and shewing him to his father Peleus as he sailed along the shore! But the chief excellence in our Poet, is the spirit and delicacy with which he has delineated the passion of love in his Medea. That Virgil thought very highly of his merit in this particular is sufficiently evident from the minute exactness with which he has copied many tender touches of the Grecian Poet. Those who compare the third Book of Apollonius with the fourth of Virgil, may, I think, perceive not only that Dido has some features of Medea, but that the two Bards, however different in their reputation, resembled each other in their genius; and that they both excel in deli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cacy and pathos.</p>

                  <p>Scaliger appears to be the most extravagant of all the Critics who have lavished their undistinguish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing encomiums on Virgil, by asserting that he alone is entitled to the name of Poet. Poetices, lib. iii. c. 2. — Though the opinion of Spence, and other modern Critics, concerning the character of Aeneas, considered as an allegorical portrait of Augustus, seems to gain ground, yet it might perhaps be easy to overturn the ingenious conjectures
<pb n="144" facs="143"/>
and the fanciful reasoning by which that idea has been supported. This attempt would have the sanction of one of the most judicious Commentators of Virgil; for the learned Heyne expressly rejects all allegorical interpretation, and thinks it improbable that a Poet of so correct a judgment could have adopted a plan which must necessarily contract and cramp his powers. He even ventures to assert, that if the character of Aeneas was delineated as an allegorical portrait of Augustus, the execution of it is unhappy. The strongest argument which has been adduced to support this conjecture, is founded on the ingenious interpretation of the following passage in the opening of the third Georgic:
<q>
                        <l>Primus ego in patriam mecum, modo vita supersit,</l>
                        <l>Aonio rediens deducam vertice Musas:</l>

                        <l>Et viridi in campo templum de marmore ponam</l>
                        <l>Propter aquam, tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat</l>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These lines, in which Virgil expresses his intention of dedicating a temple to Augustus, have been considered as the <hi>noblest allegory of ancient Poetry</hi>
                     <note place="bottom" n="*">Hurd's Horace, vol.ii. page 44.</note>; and the great Critic who first started the idea, has expatiated, in the triumph of his discovery, on the <hi>mysterious</hi> beauties they contain: but the whole of this hypothesis is unfortunately built upon the rejec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of three verses, which are pronounced unworthy of the Poet, and which, though found in every MS. the Critic claims a right of re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>moving. A licence so extraordinary cannot even be justified by the talents of this accomplished writer; for if the less elegant passages of the ancient Poets might be removed at pleasure, their compositions would be exposed to the caprice of every fantastic commentator. The obvious and literal interpretation not only renders this violence unne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessary, but is more agreeable to the judgment of the Poet and the man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ners
<pb n="145" facs="144"/>
of his age. The custom of erecting real temples was so familiar to antiquity, that a Roman would never have suspected the edifice was to be raised only with poetical materials. We may even conjecture, from a line of Statius, that the Poet himself had a temple erected to his memory; and, without any breach of probability, we may admit his intention of giving his living Emperor such a testimony of his gra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>titude. This adulation, though shocking to us, was too generally justified by example to oblige the Poet to palliate it by a fiction. He had before acquiesced in the divinity of his Imperial Patron, and had expressed the idea in its full sense.</p>

                  <p>Having made such an invocation in the beginning of his Work, was his <hi>delicacy</hi> afterwards to be shocked, and oblige him to pay a compliment under the disguise of an obscure conceit? for that allegory must be allowed to be obscure, which had remained through so many ages unexplained. The unfortunate rejected lines, for whose elegance we do not contend, may at least be rescued from impropriety by a li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>teral interpretation of the preceding passage; for, dismiss the conjectured allegory, and the chief objections against them remain no longer. If the phraseology be peculiar, it is at least supported by concurring MSS. The adjective <hi>ardens</hi> is sometimes undoubtedly joined to a word that does not denote a substance of heat or flame, as the Critic himself ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mits in the case of <hi>ardentes hostes,</hi> to which we may add the <hi>verbum ardens</hi> of Cicero. As to the line which is said to contain the most glaring note of illegitimacy,
<q>Tithoni primâ quot abest ab origine Caesar,</q>
many reasons might induce the Poet to use the name of Tithonus, which at this distance of time it is not easy for us to conjecture. Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps
<pb n="146" facs="145"/>
he chose it to vary the expression of <hi>Assaraci Proles,</hi> which he had adopted in the preceding lines. The absurdity of the subject-matter, and the place in which it is introduced, that are insisted on as the prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cipal objections, arise solely from the allegorical hypothesis: without it the construction will be plain and natural. The Poet expresses his intention of erecting a temple to Augustus, and expatiates on the mag<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nificence with which it was to be adorned: he then returns to his pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent poetical subject;
<q>
                        <hi>Interea</hi> Dryadum sylvas saltusque sequamur:</q>
and, having dwelt a little on that, to avoid too long a digression, very naturally resumes the praises of the Emperor, by alluding to the sublimer song which he intended to devote to him <hi>hereafter.</hi>

                     </q>
Perhaps the important position that gave rise to this conjecture, and to others of a similar complexion, "that the propriety of allegorical com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position made the distinguished pride of ancient poetry," is as question<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able as the conjecture itself; and a diligent and judicious perusal of the ancient Poets might convince us, that simplicity was their genuine character, and that many of their allegorical beauties have originated in the fertile imagination of their commentators. Aristarchus, indeed, the celebrated model of ancient criticism, rejected with great spirit the alle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gorical interpretations of Homer, as we are informed by Eusthathius; but the good Archbishop of Thessalonica, who, like some modern pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lates, had a passion for allegory, censures the great Critic of Alexandria for his more simple mode of construction, and supposes it an injury to the refined beauties and profound wisdom of the Poet. <q>

                  <p>There is hardly any emi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nent personage of antiquity who has suffered more from detraction, both
<pb n="147" facs="146"/>
in his literary and moral character, than the poet Lucan. His fate, indeed, seems in all points to have been peculiarly severe. His early death, at an age when few Poets have even laid the foundation of their capital work, is itself sufficient to excite our compassion and regret; but to perish by the envious tyranny of Nero, may be considered as a blessing, when compared with the more cruel misfortune of being branded with infamy in the immortal pages of Tacitus. As I am per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>suaded that the great Historian has inadvertently adopted the grossest calumny against our Poet, I shall most readily assign my reasons for thinking so. It may first be proper to give a short sketch of Lucan's life.—He was the son of Anneus Mela, the youngest brother of Seneca; and though born at Corduba, was conveyed to Rome at the age of eight months: a circumstance, as his more indulgent critics observe, which sufficiently refutes the censure of those who consider his language as provincial. At Rome he was educated under the Stoic Cornutus, so warmly celebrated by his disciple Persius the Satirist, who was the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timate friend of our Poet. In the close of his education Lucan is said to have passed some time at Athens. On his return to Rome he rose to the office of Quaestor, before he had attained the legal age. He was afterwards inrolled among the Augurs; and married a lady of noble birth, of whose amiable character I shall speak more at large in a subse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quent note. Lucan had for some time been admitted to familiarity with Nero, when the Emperor chose to contend for poetical honours by the public recital of a poem he had composed on Niobe; and some verses of this imperial production are supposed to be preserved in the first Satire of Persius. Lucan had the hardiness to repeat a poem on Orpheus, in competition with that of Nero; and, what is more remark<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able, the judges of the contest were just and bold enough to decide against the Emperor. From hence Nero became the persecutor of his success<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful rival, and forbade him to produce any poetry in public. The well-known conspiracy of Piso against the tyrant soon followed; and Taci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tus, with his usual sarcastic severity, concludes that Lucan engaged in the enterprize from the poetical injuries he had received: a remark which does little credit to the candour of the Historian; who might have found a much nobler, and, I will add, a more probable motive for his conduct, in the generous ardor of his character, and his passionate adora<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
<pb n="148" facs="147"/>
of freedom. In the sequel of his narration, Tacitus alledges a charge against our Poet, which, if it were true, must lead us to detest him as the most abject of mankind. The Historian asserts, that Lucan, when accused of the conspiracy, for some time denied the charge; but; corrupted at last by a promise of impunity, and desirous to atone for the tardiness of his confession, accused his mother Atilla as his accomplice. This circumstance is so improbable in itself, and so little consonant to the general character of Lucan, that some writers have treated it with contempt, as a calumny invented by Nero to vilify the object of his envious abhorrence. But the name of Tacitus has given such an air of authority to the story, that it may seem to deserve a more serious dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cussion, particularly as there are two subsequent events related by the same Historian, which have a tendency to invalidate the accusation so injurious to our Poet. The events I mean are, the fate of Annaeus, and the escape of Atilla, the two parents of Lucan. The former died in consequence of art accusation brought against him, after the death of his son, by Fabius Romanus, who had been intimate with Lucan and forged some letters in his name, with the design of proving his father concerned in the conspiracy. These letters were produced to Nero, who sent them to Annaeus, from an eager desire, says Tacitus, to get possession of his wealth. From this fact two inferences may be drawn, according to the different lights in which it may be considered:—If the accusation against Annaeus was just, it is clear that Lucan had not betrayed his fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, and he appears the less likely to have endangered by his confession the life of a parent, to whom he owed a still tenderer regard:—If Annaeus was not involved in the conspiracy, and merely put to death by Nero for the sake of his treasure, we may the more readily believe, that the tyrant who murdered the father from avarice, might calumniate the son from envy. But the escape of Atilla affords us the strongest reason to conclude that Lucan was perfectly innocent of the abject and unnatural treachery, of which Tacitus has supposed him guilty. Had the Poet really named his mother as his accomplice, would the vindic<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive and sanguinary Nero have spared the life of a woman, whose family he detested, particularly when other females were put to death for their share in the conspiracy? That Atilla was not in that number, the Historian himself informs us in the following remarkable sentence,
<pb n="149" facs="148"/>
Atilla mater Annaei Lucani, sine absolutione, sine supplicio, dissimulata; thus translated by Gordon: "The information against Atilla, the mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther of Lucan, was dissembled; and, without being cleared, she escaped unpunished."</p>
                  <p>The preceding remarks will, I hope, vindicate to every candid mind the honour of our Poet; whose firmness and intrepidity of character are indeed very forcibly displayed in that picture of his death which Tacitus himself has given us. I shall present it to the English reader in the words of Gordon: — Lucan, "while his blood issued in streams, perceiving his feet and hands to grow cold and stiffen, and life to retire by little and little to the extremities, while his heart was still beating with vital warmth, and his faculties no wise impaired, recollected some lines of his own, which described a wounded soldier expiring in a manner that resembled this. The lines themselves he rehearsed; and they were the last words he ever uttered." The Annals of Tacitus, Book xv. — The critics differ concerning the verses of the Pharsalia which the author quoted in so memorable a manner. I shall transcribe the two passages he is supposed to have repeated, and only add that Lipsius contends for the latter.</p>

                  <p>Such was the death of Lucan, before he had completed his twenty<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>seventh year. If his character as a man has been injured by the Histo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rian, his poetical reputation has been treated not less injuriously by the Critics. Quintilian, by a frivolous distinction, disputes his title to be classed among the Poets; and Scaliger says, with a brutality of language disgraceful only to himself, that he seems rather to <hi>bark</hi> than to <hi>sing.</hi> But these insults may appear amply compensated, when we remember, that in the most polished nations of modern Europe the most elevated and poetic spirits have been his warmest admirers; that in France he was idolized by Corneille, and in England translated by Rowe.—The severest censures on Lucan have proceeded from those who have unfairly compared his language to that of Virgil: but how unjust and absurd is such a comparison! it is comparing an uneven block of porphyry, taken rough from the quarry, to the most beautiful super<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sicies of polished marble. How differently should we think of Virgil as a poet, if we possessed only the verses which he wrote at that period of life when Lucan composed his Pharsalia! In the disposition of his subject, in the propriety and elegance of diction, he is undoubtedly far inferior to Virgil: but if we attend to the bold originality of his design, and to the vigour of his sentiments; if we consider the Pharsalia as the
<pb n="151" facs="150"/>
rapid and uncorrected sketch of a young poet, executed in an age when the spirit of his countrymen was broken, and their taste in literature corrupted, it may justly be esteemed as one of the most noble and most wonderful productions of the human mind.</p>

                  <p>Pompey, after his defeat at Pharsalia, proceeded to Lesbos, as he had left his wife Cornelia to the protection of that island; which received the unfortunate hero with a sublime generosity. The Lesbians entreated him to remain amongst them, and promised to defend him. Pompey expressed his gratitude for their fidelity, but declined the offer, and embarked with Cornelia. The concern of this gallant people on the departure of their amiable guest is thus described by Lucan:

                  <q>Let Argentaria on your canvass shine.]</q>
                  <p>Polla Argentaria was the daughter of a Roman Senator, and the wife of Lucan. She is said to have transcribed and corrected the three first books of the Pharsalia, after the death of her husband. It is much to be regretted that we possess not the poem which he wrote on the merits of this amiable and accomplished woman; but her name is immortalized by two surviving Poets of that age. The veneration which she paid to the memory of her husband, is recorded by Martial; and more poetically described in that pleasing and elegant little production of Statius, <hi>Genethliacon Lucani,</hi> a poem which I the more readily commend, as I may be thought by some readers un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>just towards its author, in omitting to celebrate his Thebaid. I confess, indeed, the miscellaneous poems of Statius appear to me his most va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>luable work: in most of these there is much imagination and sentiment, in harmonious and spirited verse. The little poem which I have men<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tioned, on the anniversary of Lucan's birth, is said to have been written at the request of Argentaria. The Author, after invoking the poetical deities to attend the ceremony, touches with great delicacy and spirit on the compositions of Lucan's childhood, which are lost, and the Phar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>salia, the production of his early youth; he then pays a short compli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment to the beauty and talents of Argentaria, laments the cruel fate which deprived her so immaturely of domestic happiness; and concludes with the following address to the shade of Lucan:

The Reader will pardon my recurring to this subject, as it is pleasing to make use of every argument which may remove so odious and unjust a stain from a manly and exalted character.</p>

                  <p>The poetry of Provence contains many spirited satires against the enormities of the Clergy. The most remarkable, is the bold invective of the Troubadour Guillaume Fi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gueira, in which he execrates the avarice and the cruelty of Rome. The Papal cause found a female Poet to defend it: Germonda of Montpellier composed a poetical reply to the satire of Figueira. See MILLOT's Hist. des Troubadours, vol. ii. p. 455.</p>

                  <p>There never was a cen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tury utterly destitute of ingenious and elegant Poets, says the learned Polycarp Leyser, after having patiently traced the obscure progress of Latin poetry through all the dark ages. Indeed the merit of some Latin Poets, in a period that we commonly suppose involved in the grossest barbarism, is singularly striking; many of these are of the Epic kind, and, as they describe the manners and customs of their respective times, a complete review of them might form a curious and entertaining work. I shall briefly mention such as appear most worthy of notice.</p>
                  <p>Abbo, a Parisian monk, of the Benedictine order, wrote a poem on the siege of Paris by the Normans and the Danes, at which he was pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent, in the year 886: it is printed in the second volume of Duchesne's Script.Francorum; and, though it has little or no poetical merit, may be regarded as an historical curiosity. The following lines, addressed to the city of Paris, in the beginning of the work, may serve as a specimen of its language:
<q>
                        <l>Dic igitur praepulchra polis, quod Danea munus</l>
                        <l>Libavit tibimet, soboles Plutonis amica,</l>
                        <l>Tempore quo praesul domini et dulcissimus heros</l>
                        <l>Gozlinus temet pastorque benignus alebat!</l>
                        <l>Haec inquit, miror, narrare potest aliquisne?</l>
                        <l>Nonne tuis idem vidisti oculis? refer ergo:</l>
                        <l>Vidi equidem, jussisque tuis parebo libenter.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Leyser has confounded this Poet with another of this name; but Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bricius has corrected the mistake, in his Bibliotheca Latina mediae et infimae Aetatis.</p>
                  <p>Guido, Bishop of Amiens from the year 1058 to 1076, wrote an Heroic poem on the exploits of William the Conqueror, in which, according to Ordericus Vitalis, he imitated both Virgil and Statius. William of Apulia composed, at the request of Pope Urban the IId, a poem, in five books, on the actions of the Normans in Sicily, Apulia, and Calabria, to the death of Robert Guiscard their prince; addressing
<pb n="157" facs="156"/>
his work to the son of that hero. It was written between the years 1080 and 1099; first printed in 1582, 4to; and again in Muratori's Script. Ital. Du Cange, in his Notes to the Alexiad of the Princess Anna Comnena, has illustrated that history by frequent and long quota<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions from William of Apulia; but though the learned Critic gives him the title of Scriptor Egregius, his poetry appears to me but a few de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>grees superior to that of the Monk Abbo, whom I have just mentioned. The Reader may judge from the following passage, which I select not only as a specimen of the Author's style, but as it shews that the wives of these martial Princes shared with them in all the perils of war.</p>
                  <q>

                  <p>The Princess Comnena has also celebrated the fortitude which this Heroine, whose name was Gaita, displayed in the battle; and it is re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>markable, that the royal female Historian describes the noble Amazon. more poetically than the Latin Poet.</p>
                  <p>Gualfredo, an Italian, who succeeded to the bishoprick of Siena in the year 1080, and died in 1127, wrote an Heroic poem on the expedition of Godfrey of Boulogne, which is said to be still preserved in MS. at Siena. I believe Gualfredo is the first Poet, in point of time, who treated of the happy subject of the Crusades; which was afterwards em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bellished by two very elegant writers of Latin verse, Iscanus and Gun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, of whom I shall presently speak, and at length received its highest honour from the genius of Tasso. There is also an early Latin poem on this subject, the joint production of two writers, named Fulco and Aegi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dius, whom the accurate Fabricius places in the beginning of the 13th. century; the title of the work is Historia. Gestorum Viae: nostri Tem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poris Hierosolymitanae. It is printed in the fourth volume of Duchesne's Script. Franc. and with considerable additions in the third volume of
<pb n="158" facs="157"/>
Anecdota Edmundi Martene. I transcribe part of the opening of this poem, as the curious reader may have a pleasure in comparing it with that of Tasso.

I will only add the portrait of Godfrey:
<q>

                     </q>
The poem closes with the capture of Jerusalem.</p>
                  <p>Laurentius of Verona, who flourished about the year 1120, wrote an Heroic poem, in seven books, entitled, Rerum in Majorica Pisanorum. Edidit Ughellus, tom. 3. Italiae sacrae.</p>
                  <p>But in merit and reputation, these early Latin Poets of modern time are very far inferior to Philip Gualtier de Chatillon, who seems to have been the first that caught any portion of true poetic spirit in Latin verse. He was Provost of the Canons of Tournay <note place="bottom" n="*">Fabricius calls him Episcopus Magalonensis. Bib. Lat. tom. ii. p. 255.</note> about the year 1200, according to Mr. Warton, who has given some specimens of his style in the second Dissertation prefixed to his admirable History of English Poetry. I shall therefore only add, that the best edition of his Alexandreid, an Heroic
<pb n="159" facs="158"/>
poem in ten books on Alexander the Great, was printed at Leyden, 4to, 1558.</p>
                  <p>The superior merit of Josephus Iscanus, or Joseph of Exeter, has been also displayed by the same judicious Encomiast, in the Dissertation I have mentioned; nor has he failed to commemorate two Latin Epic Poets of the same period, and of considerable merit for the time in which they lived—Gunther, and William of Bretagny; the first was a German monk, who wrote after the year 1108, and has left various historical and poetical works; particularly two of the Epic kind—Solymarium, a poem on the taking of Jerusalem by Godfrey of Bulloign; and another, entitled Ligurinus, on the exploits of the Emperor Frederick Barba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rossa, which he completed during the life of that Prince. The first was never printed; of the latter there have been several editions, and one by the celebrated Melancthon, in 1569. That his poetical merit was considerable in many respects, will appear from the following verses, in which he speaks of himself.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Hoc quoque me famae, si desint caetera, solum</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>William of Bretagny was preceptor to Pierre Charlot, natural son of Philip Augustus, King of France, and addressed a poem to his pupil, entitled Karlotis, which is yet unpublished; but his greater work, called Philippis, an Heroic poem in twelve books, is printed in the collections of Duchesne and Pithaeus; and in a separate 4to volume, with a copious commentary by Barthius. Notwithstanding the praises bestowed on this Author by his learned Commentator, who prefers him to all his contemporaries, he appears to me inferior in poetic spirit to his three rivals, Gualtier de Chatillon, Iscanus, and Gunther. Yet his work is by no means despicable in its style, and may be considered as a valuable picture of the times in which he lived; for he was himself engaged in many of the scenes which he describes. His profest design is to cele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brate the exploits, of Philip Augustus; and he closes his poem with the
<pb n="160" facs="159"/>
death of that Monarch, which happened in 1223. He addresses his work, in two separate poetical dedications, to Lewis, the successor of Philip, and to Pierre Charlot his natural son, who was Bishop of Noyon in 1240, and died 1249, He seems to have been excited to this compo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sition by the reputation of Gualtier's Alexandreid; to which he thus alludes, in the verses addressed to Lewis:

                  <p>He takes occasion also, in two other parts of his poem, to pay a liberal compliment to Gualtier, to whom, in poetical ability, he confesses himself inferior; but this inferiority his admirer Barthius will not allow. Of their respective talents the reader may judge, who will compare the passage which Mr. Warton has cited from the Alexandreid, with the following lines, in which William of Bretagny uses the very simile of his predecessor, comparing his hero Philip to a young lion.</p>

As a specimen of his descriptive power, I select the following lines, which form part of a long description of a Goblet presented to the King on his accession:

Leland mentions him by the name of Gulielmus de Canno, and Pits calls him Poetarum sui temporis apud nostrates facile Princeps; but I do not find that his Work was ever printed; nor do the several biographical writers who speak of him, inform us where it ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ists in MS.</p>
                  <p>In Italy the Latin language is supposed to have been cultivated with still greater success, and the restoration of its purity is in great measure ascribed to Albertino Mussato, whose merits were first displayed to our country by the learned author of the Essay on Pope.—Mussato was a Paduan, of high rank and great talents, but unfortunate. He died in exile, 1329, and left, besides many smaller Latin pieces, an Heroic Poem, De Gestis Italorum post Henricum VII. Caesarem, seu de Obsi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dione Domini Canis Grandis de Verona circa maenia Paduanae civitatis et Conflictu ejus.—Quadrio, from whom I transcribe this title, says it is printed in the tenth volume of Muratori. Vossius, who speaks of him as an Historian, asserts that he commanded in the war which is the subject of his Poem.</p>
                  <p>In a few years after the death of Mussato, Petrarch received the laurel at Rome, for his Latin Epic poem, entitled Africa; a performance which has sunk so remarkably from the high reputation it once obtained, that the great admirer and encomiast of Petrarch, who has published three entertaining quarto volumes on his life, calls it "Un ouvrage sans chaleur, sans invention, sans interet, qui n'a pas meme le merite de la versification &amp; du style, &amp; dont il est impossible de soutenir la lecture.— I must observe, however, that Tasso, in his Essay on Epic Poetry, bestows a very high encomium on that part of Petrarch's Latin poem in which he celebrates the loves of Sophonisba and Masinissa; and indeed the censure of this amiable French writer, who in other points has done ample justice to the merits of Petrarch, appears to me infinitely too severe. There are many passages in this neglected Poem conceived with great force and imagination, and expressed with equal elegance of lan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guage.

                  <p>With Petrarch I may close this cursory review of the neglected authors who wrote Heroic poems in Latin, during the course of the dark ages.—A peculiar circumstance induces me to add another name to the preceding list. John, Abbot of Peterborough, in the reign of Edward the Third, wrote an Heroic poem, entitled Bellum Navarrense, 1366, de Petro rege Aragoniae, &amp; Edwardo Principe. This per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formance, containing five hundred and sixty verses, is said to be pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>served in MS. in the Bodleian Library; and I have thought it worthy of notice, because it treats of the very subject on which Dryden informs us he had once projected an Epic poem.</p>
                  <p>Of the many Latin compositions of the Epic kind, which later times have produced, the Christiad of Vida, the Sarcotis of Massenius, and the Constantine of Mambrun, appear to me the most worthy of regard; but even these are seldom perused: and indeed the Poet, who in a polished age prefers the use of a dead language to that of a living one, can only expect, and perhaps only deserves, the attention of a few curious se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>questered students.</p>

                  <q>Thy daring Dante his wild Vision sung.]</q>
                  <p>Dante Allighieri was born at Florence, in May 1265, of an ancient and honourable family. Boccacio, who lived in the same period, has left a very curious and entertaining Treatise, on the Life, the Studies, and Manners of this extraordinary Poet; whom he regarded as his master, and for whose memory he pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fessed the highest veneration. This interesting biographer relates, that Dante, before he was nine years old, conceived a passion for the lady whom he has immortalized in his singular Poem. Her age was near his own; and her name was Beatrice, the daughter of Folco Portinari, a noble citizen of Florence. Of this fair one the best accounts are ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scure. Some refining commentators have even denied her corporeal exist<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence; affirming her to be nothing more or less than Theology. But we may question if Theology was ever the mistress of so young a lover. The passion of Dante, however, like that of his successor Petrarch, seems to have been of the chaste and Platonic kind, according to the account he has himself given of it, in one of his early productions, entitled Vita Nuova; a mixture of mysterious poetry and prose, in which he mentions both the origin of his affection and the death of his mistress, who, according to Boccacio, died at the age of twenty-four. The same author asserts, that Dante fell into a deep melancholy in consequence of this event, from which his friends endeavoured to raise him; by per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>suading him to marriage. After some time he followed their advice, and repented it; for he unfortunately made choice of a lady who bore some resemblance to the celebrated Xantippe. The Poet, not possessing the patience of Socrates, separated himself from her with such vehement expressions of dislike, that he never afterwards admitted her to his pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sence, though she had borne him several children.—In the early part of his life he gained some credit in a military character; distinguishing himself by his bravery in an action where the Florentines obtained a signal victory over the citizens of Arezzo. He became still more emi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nent by the acquisition of civil honours; and at the age of thirty-five he rose to be one of the chief magistrates of Florence, when that dignity was conferred by the suffrages of the people. From this ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>altation
<pb n="167" facs="166"/>
the Poet himself dated his principal misfortunes, as appears from the fragment of a letter quoted by Lionardo Bruni; one of his early biographers, where Dante speaks of his political failure with that liberal frankness which integrity inspires.—Italy was at that time dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tracted by the contending factions of the Ghibellins and the Guelphs: the latter, among whom Dante took an active part, were again divided into the Blacks and the Whites. Dante, says Gravina, exerted all his influence to unite these inferior parties; but his efforts were ineffectual, and he had the misfortune to be unjustly persecuted by those of his own faction. A powerful citizen of Florence, named Corso Donati, had taken measures to terminate these intestine broils, by introducing Charles of Valois, brother to Philip the Fair, King of France. Dante, with great vehemence, opposed this disgraceful project, and obtained the banishment of Donati and his partizans. The exiles applied to the Pope (Boniface the VIIIth) and by his assistance succeeded in their design. Charles of Valois entered Florence in triumph, and those who had opposed his admission were banished in their turn. Dante had been dispatched to Rome as the ambassador of his party, and was re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turning, when he received intelligence of the revolution in his native city. His enemies, availing themselves of his absence, had procured an iniquitous sentence against him, by which he was condemned to banish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, and his possessions were confiscated. His two enthusiastic bio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>graphers, Boccacio acid Manetti, express the warmest indignation against this injustice of his country. Dante, on receiving the intelligence, took refuge in Siena, and afterwards in Arezzo, where many of his party were assembled. An attempt was made to surprize the city of Florence, by a small army which Dante is supposed to have attended: the design miscarried, and our Poet is conjectured to have wandered to various parts of Italy, till he found a patron in the great Can della Scala, Prince of Verona, whom he has celebrated in his Poem. The high spirit of Dante was ill suited to courtly dependence; and he is said to have lost the favour of his Veroneze patron by the rough frankness of his beha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>viour. From Verona he retired to France, according to Manetti; and Boccacio affirms that he disputed in the Theological Schools of Paris with great reputation. Bayle questions his visiting Paris at this period of his life, and thinks it improbable, that a man, who had been one of
<pb n="168" facs="167"/>
the chief magistrates of Florence, should condescend to engage in the public squabbles of the Parisian Theologists; but the spirit both of Dante, and the times in which he lived, sufficiently account for this ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ercise of his talents; and his residence in France at this season is con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>firmed by Boccacio, in his life of our Poet, which Bayle seems to have had no opportunity of consulting.</p>
                  <p>The election of Henry Count of Luxemburgh to the empire, in November 1308, afforded Dante a prospect of being restored to his na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive city, as he attached himself to the interest of the new Emperor, in whose service he is supposed to have written his Latin treatise De Monarchia, in which he asserted the rights of the Empire against the encroachments of the Papacy. In the year 1311, he instigated Henry to lay siege to Florence; in which enterprize, says one of his Biographers, he did not appear in person, from motives of respect towards his native city. The Emperor was repulsed by the Florentines; and his death, which happened in the succeeding year, deprived Dante of all hopes concerning his re-establishment in Florence.</p>
                  <p>After this disappointment, he is supposed to have passed some years in roving about Italy in a state of poverty and distress, till he found an honourable establishment at Ravenna, under the protection of Guido Novello da Polenta, the lord of that city, who received this illustrious exile with the most endearing liberality, continued to protect him through the few remaining years of his life, and extended his munifi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cence to the ashes of the Poet.</p>
                  <p>Eloquence was one of the many talents which Dante possessed in an eminent degree. On this account he is said to have been employed on fourteen different embassies in the course of his life, and to have suc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceeded in most of them. His patron Guido had occasion to try his abilities in a service of this nature, and dispatched him as his ambassador to negociate a peace with the Venetians, who were preparing for hosti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lities against Ravenna. Manetti asserts that he was unable to procure a public audience at Venice, and returned to Ravenna by land, from his apprehensions of the Venetian fleet; when the fatigue of his journey, and the mortification of failing in his attempt to preserve his generous patron from the impending danger, threw him into a fever, which ter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>minated in death on the 14th of September 1321. He died, however,
<pb n="169" facs="168"/>
in the palace of his friend, and the affectionate Guido paid the most ten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der regard to his memory. This magnificent patron, says Boccacio, commanded the body to be adorned with poetical ornaments, and, after being carried on a bier through the streets of Ravenna by the most illus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trious citizens, to be deposited in a marble coffin. He pronounced him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self the funeral oration, and expressed his design of erecting a splendid monument in honour of the deceased: a design which his subsequent misfortunes rendered him unable to accomplish. At his request, many epitaphs Were written on the Poet: the best of them, says Boccacio, by Giovanni del Virgilio of Bologna, a famous author of that time, and the intimate friend of Dante. Boccacio then cites a few Latin verses, not worth transcribing, six of which are quoted by Bayle as the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position of Dante himself, on the authority of Paul Jovius. In 1483 Bernardo Bembo, the father of the celebrated Cardinal, raised a hand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>some monument over the neglected ashes of the Poet, with the following inscription:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Exigua tumuli Danthes hic sorte jacebas</l>
                     <l>Squallenti nulli cognita paene situ;</l>
                     <l>At nunc marmoreo subnixus conderis arcu,</l>
                     <l>Omnibus et cultu splendidiore nites:</l>
                     <l>Nimirum Bembus, Musis incensus Etruscis,</l>
                     <l>Hoc tibi, quem in primis hae coluere, dedit.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Before this period the Florentines had vainly endeavoured to obtain the bones of their great Poet from the city of Ravenna. In the age of Leo the Xth they made a second attempt, by a solemn application to the Pope, for that purpose; and the great Michael Angelo, an enthusiastic admirer of Dante, very liberally offered to execute a magnificent mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nument to the Poet. The hopes of the Florentines were again unsuc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessful. The particulars of their singular petition may be found in the notes to Condivi's Life of Michael Angelo.</p>
                  <p>The person and manners of Dante are thus represented by the descrip<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive pen of Boccacia:—"Fu adunque questo nostro Pceta di Mezzana statura; e poichè alla matura età fu pervenuto, andò alquanto gravetto, ed era il suo andar grave, e mansueto, di onestissimi panni sempre vestito,

e nel poto fu modestissimo.—Though Dante is described as much inclined to melancholy, and his genius particularly delighted in the gloomy and sublime, yet in his early period of life he seems to have possessed all the lighter graces of sprightly composition, as appears from the following airy and sportive sonnet:</p>

                  <p>These lively verses were evidently written before the Poet lost the object of his earliest attachment, as she is mentioned by the name of Bice. At what time, and in what place, he executed the great and sin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gular work which has rendered him immortal, his numerous Commen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tators seem unable to determine. Boccacio asserts, that he began it in his thirty-fifth year, and had finished seven Cantos of his Inferno before his exile; that in the plunder of his house, on that event, the begin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ning
<pb n="171" facs="170"/>
of his poem was fortunately preserved, but remained for some time neglected, till its merit being accidentally discovered by an intelligent Poet named Dino, it was sent to the Marquis Maroello Malespina, an Italian nobleman, by whom Dante was then protected. The Marquis restored these lost papers to the Poet, and intreated him to proceed in a work which opened in so promising a manner. To this incident we are probably indebted for the poem of Dante, which he must have continued
<pb n="172" facs="171"/>
under all the disadvantages of an unfortunate and agitated life. It does not appear at what time he completed it perhaps before he quitted Ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rona, as he dedicated the Paradise to his Veronese patron.—The Critics have variously accounted for his having called his poem Comedia. He gave it that title, said one of his sons, because it opens with distress, and closes with felicity. The very high estimation in which this production was held by his country, appears from a singular institution. The re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>public of Florence, in the year 1373, assigned a public stipend to a per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son appointed to read lectures on the poem of Dante: Boccacio was the first person engaged in this office; but his death happening in two years after his appointment, his Comment extended only to the seventeen first Cantos of the inferno. The critical dissertations that have been written on Dante are almost as numerous as those to which Homer has given birth: the Italian, like the Grecian Bard, has been the subject of the highest panegyric, and of the grossest invective. Voltaire has spoken of him with that precipitate vivacity, which so frequently led that lively Frenchman to insult the reputation of the noblest writers. In one of his entertaining letters, he says to an Italian Abbé, "Je fais grand cas du courage, avec lequel vous avez osé dire que Dante etoit un fou, et son ouvrage un monstre—Le Dante pourra entrer dans les biblio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>theques des curieux, mais il ne sera jamais lu." But more temperate and candid Critics have not been wanting to display the merits of this origi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nal Poet. Mr. Warton has introduced into his last volume on English Poetry, a judicious and spirited summary of Dante's performance. We have several versions of the celebrated story of Ugolino; but I believe no entire Canto of Dante has hitherto appeared in our language, though his whole work has been translated into French, Spanish, and Latin verse. The three Cantos which follow, were translated a few years ago, to oblige a particular friend. The Author has since been solicited to execute an entire translation of Dante; but the extreme inequality of this Poet would render such a work a very laborious undertaking, and it appears very doubtful how far such a version would interest our country. Perhaps the reception of these Cantos may discover to the Translator the sentiments of the public. At all events, he flatters himself that the ensuing portion of a celebrated poem may afford some pleasure from its novelty, as he has endeavoured to give the English reader an idea of
<pb n="173" facs="172"/>
Dante's peculiar manner, by adopting his triple rhyme; and he does not recollect that this mode of versification has ever appeared before in our language; it has obliged him of course to make the number of trans<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lated lines correspond exactly with those of the original. The diffi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culties attending this metre will sufficiently shew themselves, and obtain some degree of indulgence from the intelligent and candid reader.</p>

                        <l>Vidi gente alla riva d'un gran fiume;</l>

                        <l>Com'io discerno per lo fioco lume.</l>
                        <l>Ed egli a me: Le cose ti fien conte,</l>
                        <l>Quando noi fermerem li nostri passi</l>
                        <l>Su la trista riviera d'Acheronte.</l>
                        <l>Allor con gli occhi vergognosi e bassi</l>
                        <l>Temendo, no 'l mio dir gli fusse grave,</l>
                        <l>Infino al fiume di parlar mi trassi.</l>
                        <l>Ed ecco verso noi venir, per nave,</l>
                        <l>Un vecchio bianco, per antico pelo,</l>
                        <l>Gridando, Guai à voi anime prave:</l>
                        <l>Non isperate mai veder lo cielo:</l>
                        <l>I' vegno, per menarvi all' altra riva</l>

                        <l>Più lieve legno convien, che ti porti.</l>

                        <l>IN the mid season of this mortal strife,</l>
                        <l>I found myself within a gloomy grove,</l>
                        <l>Far wandering from the ways of perfect life:</l>
                        <l>The place I know not, where I chanc'd to rove,</l>
                        <l>It was a wood so wild, it wounds me sore</l>
                        <l>But to remember with what ills I strove:</l>
                        <l>Such still my dread, that death is little more.</l>
                        <l>But I will tell the good which there I found.</l>
                        <l>High things 'twas there my fortune to explore:</l>
                        <l>Yet how I enter'd on that secret ground</l>
                        <l>I know not to explain; so much in sleep</l>
                        <l>My mortal senses at that hour were drown'd.</l>
                        <l>But when I reach'd the bottom of a steep,</l>
                        <l>That rose to terminate the dreary vale,</l>
                        <l>Which made cold terrors thro' my bosom creep,</l>
                        <l>I look'd on high, where breath'd a purer gale,</l>
                        <l>And saw the summit glisten with that ray</l>
                        <l>Which leads the wand'rer safe o'er hill and dale.</l>
                        <l>This soon began to chase those fears away,</l>
                        <l>Which held my struggling spirit bound so fast</l>
                        <l>During that night of darkness and dismay:</l>
                        <l>And, as th' exhausted wretch, by fortune cast</l>
                        <l>Safe from the stormy deep upon the shore,</l>
                        <l>Turns to survey the perils he has past,</l>
                        <l>So turn'd my soul, ere yet its dread was o'er,</l>
                        <l>Back to contemplate that mysterious strait</l>
                        <l>Where living mortal never past before.</l>

                           <pb n="177" facs="176"/>Arising soon from this repose elate,</l>
                        <l>Up the rough steep my journey I begin,</l>
                        <l>My lower foot sustaining all my weight.</l>
                        <l>Here, while my toilsome way I slowly win,</l>
                        <l>Behold a nimble Panther springs to sight!</l>
                        <l>And beauteous spots adorn his motley skin:</l>
                        <l>He at my presence shew'd no signs of fright,</l>
                        <l>But rather strove to bar my doubtful way;</l>
                        <l>I often turn'd, and oft resolv'd on flight.</l>
                        <l>'Twas now the chearful hour of rising day;</l>
                        <l>The sun advanc'd in that propitious sign</l>
                        <l>Which first beheld his radiant beams display</l>
                        <l>Creation's charms, the work of love divine!</l>
                        <l>So that I now was rais'd to hope sublime,</l>
                        <l>By these bright omens of a fate benign,</l>
                        <l>The beauteous Beast and the sweet hour of prime.</l>
                        <l>But soon I lost that hope; and shook yet more</l>
                        <l>To see a Lion in this lonely clime:</l>
                        <l>With open jaws, athirst for human gore,</l>
                        <l>He rush'd towards me in his hungry ire;</l>
                        <l>Air seem'd to tremble at his savage roar.</l>
                        <l>With him, enflam'd with every fierce desire,</l>
                        <l>A famish'd She-wolf, like a spectre, came;</l>
                        <l>Beneath whose gripe shall many a wretch expire.</l>
                        <l>Such sad oppression seiz'd my sinking frame,</l>
                        <l>Such horror at these strange tremendous sights,</l>
                        <l>My hopes to climb the hill no longer aim;</l>
                        <l>But, as the wretch whom lucre's lust incites,</l>
                        <l>In the curst hour which scatters all his wealth,</l>
                        <l>Sinks in deep sorrow, dead to all delights,</l>

                        <l>Driven by this Beast, who crept on me by stealth.</l>

                        <l>A manly figure my glad eyes survey'd,</l>
                        <l>Whose voice was like the whisper of a lute.</l>

                        <l>Rest from their labours. I alone prepare</l>
                        <l>To meet new toil, both from my dreary road,</l>
                        <l>And pious wish to paint in worthy phrase</l>

                        <l>Kind Poet (I began, with trembling awe)</l>

                        <l>Nor into scenes too hard my weakness draw!</l>
                        <l>Thy Song declares, the Chief of pious fame</l>
                        <l>Appear'd among the blest, retaining still</l>
                        <l>His mortal senses and material frame;</l>
                        <l>Yet, if the great Opposer of all ill</l>

                        <l>Most worthy he appear'd, in Reason's view,</l>

                        <l>I'm not Aeneas, nor the holy Paul:</l>
                        <l>Of this unworthy I myself believe:</l>

                        <l>Now as a man who, shudd'ring on the brink</l>
                        <l>Of some great venture, sudden shifts his mind,</l>
                        <l>And feels his spirit from the peril shrink;</l>
                        <l>So, in this scene of doubt and darkness join'd,</l>
                        <l>Wavering I wasted thought in wild affright,</l>
                        <l>And the first ardour of my soul resign'd.</l>
                        <l>If thy faint words I understand aright,</l>

                        <l>By Terror's airy phantasies betray'd:</l>
                        <l>But, that such fears thy soul no more may soil,</l>
                        <l>I'll tell thee whence I came; at whose request;</l>
                        <l>When first I pitied thy uncertain toil.</l>
                        <l>From the suspended host in which I rest,</l>
                        <l>A lovely Spirit call'd me, fair as light;</l>
                        <l>Eager I waited on her high behest;</l>
                        <l>While eyes beyond the solar radiance bright,</l>
                        <l>And with the sweetness of an angel's tongue,</l>
                        <l>Thus her soft words my willing aid invite:</l>
                        <l>O ever gentle shade, from Mantua sprung!</l>
                        <l>Whose fame unfading on the earth shall last</l>

                        <l>My friend, whose love all base desire surpast,</l>
                        <l>In yon drear desart finds his passage barr'd,</l>
                        <l>And compass'd round with terrors stands aghast;</l>
                        <l>And much I fear, beset with dangers hard,</l>
                        <l>He may be lost beyond all friendly reach,</l>
                        <l>And I from heaven descend too late a guard.</l>

                        <l>My name is Beatrice: the heavenly quire</l>

                        <l>On thee my praises with delight shall dwell.</l>
                        <l>So spake this angel, in her heavenly strain.</l>
                        <l>Bright Fair, (I cry'd) who didst on earth excel</l>
                        <l>All that e'er shone beneath the lunar sphere,</l>

                        <l>Had I e'en now perform'd the task I hear,</l>
                        <l>That swift performance I should think too slow:</l>
                        <l>Nor needs there more; your gracious will is clear:</l>
                        <l>Yet how you venture, I would gladly know,</l>

                        <l>What you require (she said, in kind reply)</l>
                        <l>I briefly will explain: how thus I dare,</l>
                        <l>Unconscious of alarm, these depths to try.</l>
                        <l>From these things only springs our fearful care,</l>

                        <l>Such am I form'd, by Heaven's most gracious will,</l>
                        <l>That torture cannot touch my purer frame,</l>

                        <l>And I his safety to thy care commend.</l>
                        <l>Lucia, the friend of all whom ills oppress,</l>
                        <l>Me, where I sate with pensive Rachel, sought,</l>

                        <l>Whom Love to rise above the vulgar taught?</l>

                        <l>Never was mind, intent on worldly cares,</l>

                        <l>I then (my mind with error still disgrac'd)</l>
                        <l>Exclaim'd—O Sire! what may this trouble mean?</l>
                        <l>What forms are these, by sorrow so debas'd?—</l>
                        <l>He soon reply'd—Behold, these bounds between,</l>
                        <l>All who without or infamy or fame</l>
                        <l>Clos'd the blank business of their mortal scene!</l>
                        <l>They join those angels, of ignoble name,</l>
                        <l>Who not rebell'd, yet were not faithful found;</l>
                        <l>Without attachment! self alone their aim!</l>
                        <l>Heaven shuts them out from its unsullied bound;</l>
                        <l>And Hell refuses to admit this train,</l>
                        <l>Lest e'en the damn'd o'er these their triumph sound.—</l>
                        <l>O Sire! (said I) whence then this grievous pain,</l>
                        <l>That on our ears their lamentations grate?—</l>
                        <l>This (he reply'd) I will in brief explain:</l>
                        <l>These have no hope that death may mend their fate;</l>
                        <l>And their blind days form so confus'd a mass,</l>
                        <l>They pine with envy of each other's state:</l>
                        <l>From earth their name has perish'd, like the grass;</l>
                        <l>E'en Mercy views them with a scornful eye.</l>
                        <l>We'll speak of them no more: Behold! and pass!—</l>
                        <l>I look'd, and saw a banner rais'd on high,</l>
                        <l>That whirl'd, unconscious of a moment's stand,</l>
                        <l>With rapid circles in the troubled sky:</l>
                        <l>Behind it, driven by Fate's supreme command,</l>
                        <l>Came such a host! I ne'er could have believ'd</l>
                        <l>Death had collected so complete a band.</l>
                        <l>When now I had the forms of all perceiv'd,</l>
                        <l>I saw the shade of that ignoble priest,</l>
                        <l>Of sovereign power by indolence bereav'd.</l>
                        <l>Instant I knew, from every doubt releas'd,</l>

                  <head>NOTE V. VERSE 127.</head>
                  <q>The gay Boccacio, tempts th' Italian Muse.</q>
                  <p>Boccacio was almost utterly unknown to our country as a Poet, when two of our most accomplished Critics restored his poetical reputation.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Tyrwhitt, to whom Chaucer is as deeply indebted as a Poet can be to the judgment and erudition of his commentator, has given a sketch of Boccacio's Theseida, in his introductory discourse to the Canterbury Tales; and Mr. Warton has enriched the first volume of his History of English Poetry with a considerable specimen of this very rare Italian Epic poem, of which our country is said to possess but a single copy.—The father of Boccacio was an Italian merchant, a native of Certaldo, near Florence, who in his travels attached himself to a young woman of Paris; and our Poet is supposed to have been the illegitimate offspring of that connection. He was born in 1313, and educated as a student of the canon law; but a sight of Virgil's tomb, according to Filippo Villani, his most ancient Biographer, made him resolve to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>linquish his more irksome pursuits, and devote himself entirely to the Muses. His life seems to have been divided between literature and love, as he was equally remarkable for an amorous disposition, and a passionate attachment to study. His most celebrated mistress was Mary of Arragon, the natural daughter of Robert, King of Naples, the gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous and enthusiastic patron of Petrarch. To this lady, distinguished by the name of The Fiammetta, Boccacio addressed his capital poem, the Theseida; telling her, in an introductory letter, that it contained many allusions to the particular circumstances of their own secret attachment. In his latter days he retired to Certaldo, and died there in the year 1475, of a disorder supposed to have arisen from excessive application. Few authors have rendered more essential service to the republic of let<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters than Boccacio, as he not only contributed very much to the improvement of his native language, but was particularly instrumental in promoting the revival of ancient learning: a merit which he shared with Petrarch. The tender and generous friendship which subsisted between these two engaging authors, reflects the highest honour on both; and their letters to each other may be ranked among the most interesting productions of that period. Boccacio composed, according
<pb n="199" facs="198"/>
to Quadrio, no less than thirty-four volumes. His Novels are univer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sally known: his Poetical Works are as follow: 1. La Theseida in Ottava Rima. 2. L'Amorosa Visione in Terza Rima. 3. Il Filostrato in Ottava Rima. 4. Il Ninfale Fiesolano in Ottava Rima.—He piqued himself on being the first Poet who sung of martial subjects in Italian verse; and he has been generally supposed the inventor of the Ottava Rima, the common Heroic measure of the Italian Muse; but Quadrio has shewn that it was used by preceding writers; and Pasquier, in his Recherches, has quoted two stanzas of Thibaud king of Navarre, writ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ten in the same measure, on Blanch queen of France, who died in 1252. The neglect into which the Poems of Boccacio had fallen ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pears the more striking, as he peculiarly prided himself on his poetical character; informing the world, by an inscription on his tomb, that Poetry was his favourite pursuit—Studium fuit alma Poesis, are the last words of the epitaph which he composed for himself.</p>

                  <q>She spoke exulting, and Trissino sung.</q>
                  <p>Giovanni Giorgio Trissino was born of a noble family in Vicenza, 1478: he was particularly dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinguished by a passion for Poetry and Architecture; and one of the very few Poets who have been rich enough to build a palace. This he is said to have done from a design of his own, under the direction of the cele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brated Palladio. He had the merit of writing the first regular tragedy in the Italian language, entitled Sophonisba; but in his Epic poem he is generally allowed to have failed, though some learned Critics (and Gravina amongst them) have endeavoured to support the credit of that performance. His subject was the expulsion of the Goths from Italy by Belisarius; and his poem consists of twenty-seven books, in blank verse. He addressed it to the Emperor Charles the Vth; and professes in his Dedication to have taken Aristotle for his preceptor, and Homer for his guide.</p>
                  <p>The reader will excuse a trifling anachronism, in my naming Trissino before Ariosto, for poetical reasons. The Italia Liberata of the former was first published in 1548; the Orlando Furioso, in 1515. Trissino died at Rome, 1550; Ariosto at Ferrara, 1533.</p>

                  <q>Of a poetic Sire the more poetic Son.</q>
                  <p>The reputation of Torquato Tasso has almost eclipsed that of his father Bernardo, who was himself a considerable Poet, and left two productions of the Epic kind, L'Amadigi, and Il Floridante: the latter remained unfinished at his death, but was afterwards published in its imperfect state by his son; who has spoken of his father's poetry with filial regard, in his different critical works. The Amadigi was written at the request of several Spanish Grandees, in the court of Charles the Vth, and first printed in Venice by Giolito, 1560. The curious reader may find an entertaining account of the Author's ideas in composing this work, among his Letters, volume the first, page 198. I cannot help remarking, that the letter referred to contains a simile which Torquato has introduced in the opening of his Jerusalem Delivered.</p>
                  <p>The Italians have formed a very pleasing and valuable work, by col<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lecting the letters of their eminent Painters; which contain much in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formation on points relating to their art. The letters of their Poets, if properly selected, might also form a few interesting volumes: as a proof of this, I shall insert a short letter of the younger Tasso, because it seems to have escaped the notice of his Biographers, and relates the remarkable circumstance of his having deliberated on five different subjects before he decided in favour of Goffredo:

The merits of Tasso are very ably defended against the injustice of French criticism, and particularly that of Boileau and Voltaire, in the well-known Letters on Chivalry and Romance. Indeed the genius of this injured Poet seems at length to triumph in the country where he was most insulted, as the French have lately attempted a poetical version of his Jerusalem.</p>
                  <p>I enter not into the history of Tasso, or that of his rival Ariosto, because the public has lately received from Mr. Hoole a judicious ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count of their lives, prefixed to his elegant versions of their respective Poems.</p>

                  <q>Shall gay Tassoni want his festive crown.</q>
                  <p>Alessandro Tassoni, the supposed inventor of the modern Heroi-comic Poetry, was born at Modena, 1565. His family was noble; but his parents dying during his infancy, left him exposed to vexatious law-suits, which absorbed a great part of his patrimony, and rendered him dependant. In 1599 he was engaged as Secretary to Cardinal Ascanio Colonna, whom he at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tended on an embassy into Spain. He was occasionally dispatched into Italy on the service of that Prelate, and in the course of one of these ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>peditions wrote his Observations on Petrarch. In 1605 he is supposed
<pb n="202" facs="201"/>
to have quitted the service of the Cardinal, and to have lived in a state of freedom at Rome, where, in 1607, he became the chief of a literary society, entitled Academia degli Umoristi. He was afterwards em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ployed in the service of Charles Emanuel, Duke of Savoy; which, after suffering many vexations in it, he quitted with a design of devoting himself to study and retirement. But this design he was induced to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>linquish, and to serve the Cardinal Lodovisio, nephew of Pope Gregory XV. from whom he received a considerable stipend. On the death of this patron, in 1632, he was recalled to his native city by Francis the First, Duke of Modena, and obtained an honourable esta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blishment in the court of that Prince. Age had now rendered him unable to enjoy his good fortune: his health declined in the year of his return, and he expired in April 1635. His genius was particularly dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed to lively satire; and the incidents of his life had a tendency to increase that disposition. After having passed many vexatious and un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>profitable years in the service of the Great, he had his portrait painted, with a fig in his hand; and Muratori supposes him to have written these two lines on the occasion:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Dextera cur ficum, quaeris, mea gestet inanem:</l>
                     <l>Longi operis merces haec fuit; aula dedit.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>His celebrated Poem, La Secchia rapita, was written, as he has him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self declared, in 1611; begun in April, and finished in October. It was circulated in MS. received with the utmost avidity, and first printed at Paris 1622. In a catalogue of the numerous editions of the Secchia, which Muratori has prefixed to his Life of Tassoni, he includes an English translation of it, printed 1715.</p>

                  <p>The famous Lope de Vega, frequently called the Shakespear of Spain, is perhaps the most fertile Poet in the annals of Parnassus; and it would be difficult to name any author, ancient or modern, so universally idolized while living by all ranks of people, and so magnificently rewarded by the liberality of the Great. He was the son of Felix de Vega and Francisca Fernandez,
<pb n="203" facs="202"/>
who were both descended from honourable families, and lived in the neighbourhood of Madrid. Our Poet was born in that city, on the 25th of November 1562. He was, according to his own expression, a Poet from his cradle; and, beginning to make verses before he had learned to write, he used to bribe his elder scholl-fellows with a part of his breakfast, to commit to paper the lines he had composed. Having lost his father while he was still a child, he engaged in a frolic, very natural to a lively boy, and wandered with another lad to various parts of Spain, till, having spent their money, and being conducted before a magistrate at Segovia, for offering to sell a few trinkets, they were sent home again to Madrid. Soon after this adventure, our young Poet was taken under the protection of Geronimo Manrique, Bishop of Avila, and began to distinguish himself by his dramatic compositions, which were received with great applause by the public, though their author had not yet completed his education; for, after this period, he became a member of the university of Alcala, where he devoted himself for four years to the study of philosophy. He was then engaged as Secretary to the Duke of Alva, and wrote his Arcadia in compliment to that patron; who is frequently mentioned in his Occasional Poems. He quitted that em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ployment on his marriage with Isabel de Urbina, a lady (says his friend and biographer Perez de Montalvan) beautiful without artifice, and vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tuous without affectation. His domestic happiness was soon interrupted by a painful incident:—Having written some lively verses in ridicule of a person who had taken some injurious freedom with his character, he re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceived a challenge in consequence of his wit; and happening, in the duel which ensued, to give his adversary a dangerous wound, he was obliged to fly from his family, and shelter himself in Valencia. He re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sided there a considerable time; but connubial affection recalled him to Madrid. His wife died in the year of his return. His affliction on this event led him to relinquish his favourite studies, and embark on board the Armada which was then preparing for the invasion of England. He had a brother who served in that fleet as a lieutenant; and being shot in an engagement with some Dutch vessels, his virtues were cele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brated by our afflicted Poet, whose heart was peculiarly alive to every generous affection. After the ill success of the Armada, the disconsolate Lope de Vega returned to Madrid, and became Secretary to the Marquis
<pb n="204" facs="203"/>
of Malpica, to whom he has addressed a grateful Sonnet. From the service of this Patron he passed into the household of the Count of Lemos, whom he celebrates as an inimitable Poet. He was once more induced to quit his attendance on the Great, for the more inviting com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>forts of a married life. His second choice was Juana de Guardio, of noble birth and singular beauty. By this lady he had two children; a son, who died in his infancy, and a daughter, named Feliciana, who survived her father. The death of his little boy is said to have has<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tened that of his wife, whom he had the misfortune to lose in about seven years after his marriage. Having now experienced the precari<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ousness of all human enjoyments, he devoted himself to a religious life, and fulfilled all the duties of it with the most exemplary piety; still continuing to produce an astonishing variety of poetical compositions. His talents and his virtues procured him many unsolicited honours. Pope Urban the VIIIth sent him the Cross of Malta, with the title of Doctor in Divinity, and appointed him to a place of profit in the Apostolic Chamber; favours for which he expressed his gratitude by dedicating his Corona Tragica (a long poem on the fate of Mary Queen of Scots) to that liberal Pontiff. In his seventy-third year he felt the approaches of death, and prepared himself for it with the ut<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most composure and devotion. His last hours were attended by many of his intimate friends, and particularly his chief patron the Duke of Sessa, whom he made his executor; leaving him the care of his daughter Feliciana, and of his various manuscripts. The manner in which he took leave of those he loved was most tender and affecting. He said to his Disciple and Biographer, Montalvan, That true fame consisted in being good; and that he would willingly exchange all the applauses he had received, to add a single deed of virtue to the actions of his life. Having given his dying benediction to his daughter, and performed the last ceremonies of his religion, he expired on the 25th of August 1635.</p>
                  <p>The splendor of his funeral was equal to the respect paid to him while living.—His magnificent patron, the Duke of Sessa, invited the chief no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bility of the kingdom to attend it. The ceremony was prolonged through the course of several days; and three sermons in honour of the deceased were delivered by three of the most celebrated preachers. These
<pb n="205" facs="204"/>
are printed with the works of the Poet, and may be considered as curious specimens of the false eloquence which prevailed at that time. A vo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lume of encomiastic verses, chiefly Spanish, and written by more than a hundred and fifty of the most distinguished characters in Spain, was pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lished soon after the death of this lamented Bard. To this collection his friend and disciple Perez de Montalvan prefixed a circumstantial ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count of his life and death, which I have chiefly followed in the pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceding narrative. An ingenious Traveller, who has lately published a pleasing volume of Letters on the Poetry of Spain, has imputed the duel in which Lope de Vega was engaged to the gallantries of his first wife; but Montalvan's relation of that adventure clears the honor of the lady, whose innocence is still farther supported by a poem written in her praise by Pedro de Medina Medinilla: it is printed in the works of our Poet, who is introduced in it, under the name of Belardo, celebrating the ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cellencies and lamenting the loss of his departed Isabel.</p>
                  <p>Of the person and manners of Lope de Vega, his friend Montalvan has only given this general account:—that his frame of body was parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cularly strong, and preserved by temperance in continued health;—that in conversation he was mild and unassuming; courteous to all, and to women peculiarly gallant;—very eager when engaged in the business of his friends, and somewhat careless in the management of his own. Of his wealth and charity I shall have occasion to speak in a subsequent note. The chief expences in which he indulged himself were books and pictures; of the latter, he distributed a few as legacies to his intimate friends: to the Duke of Sessa, a fine portrait of himself; and to me, says Montalvan, another, painted when he was young, surrounded by dogs, monkies, and other monsters, and writing in the midst of them, without attending to their noise.—Of the honours paid to this extraor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dinary Poet, his Biographer asserts that no person of eminence visited Spain without seeking his personal acquaintance; that men yielded him precedence when they met him in the streets, and women saluted him with benedictions when he passed under their windows. If such ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mage can be deserved by the most unwearied application to poetry, Lope de Vega was certainly entitled to it. He declared that he con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stantly wrote five sheets a day; and his biographers, who have formed a calculation from this account, conclude the number of his verses to be
<pb n="206" facs="205"/>
no less than 21,316,000. His country has very lately published an ele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gant edition of his poems in 19 quarto volumes; his dramatic works are to be added to this collection, and will probably be still more volumi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nous. I shall speak only of the former.—Among his poems there are several of the Epic kind; the three following appear to me the most remarkable. 1. La Dragontea. 2. La Hermosura de Angelica. 3. La Jerusalem Conquistada. The Dragontea consists of ten cantos, on the last expedition and death of our great naval hero Sir Francis Drake, whom the Poet, from his excessive partiality to his country, considers as an ava<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ricious pirate, or rather, as he chuses to call him, a marine Dragon: and it may be sufficient to observe that he has treated him accordingly. The poem on Angelica seems to have been written in emulation of Ariosto, and it is founded on a hint in that Poet: it was composed in the early part of our Author's life, and contains many compliments to his sove<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reign Philip the IId: it consists of 20 cantos, and closes with Angeli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ca's being restored to her beloved Medoro. In his Jerusalem Conquistada he enters the lists with Tasso, whom he mentions in his preface as hav<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing sung the first part of the history which he had chosen for his subject. From the great name of Lope de Vega, I had some thoughts of present<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to the reader a sketch of this his most remarkable poem; but as an Epic Poet he appears to me so much inferior to Tasso, and to his coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tryman and cotemporary Ercilla, that I am unwilling to swell these extensive notes by an enlarged description of so unsuccessful a work: the Author has prophesied in the close of it, that, although neglected by his own age, it would be esteemed by futurity:—a singular proof that even the most favoured writers are frequently disposed to declaim against the period in which they live. If Lope de Vega could think himself neglected, what Poet may ever expect to be satisfied with popu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lar applause?—But to return to his Jerusalem Conquistada. Richard the Second of England, and Alphonso the Eighth of Castile, are the chief heroes of the poem; which contains twenty cantos; and closes with the unfortunate return of these confederate Kings, and the death of Saladin. It was first printed 1609, more than twenty years after the first appear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance of Tasso's Jerusalem.—One of the most amiable peculiarities in the character of Lope de Vega, is the extreme liberality with which he commends the merit of his rivals. In his Laurel de Apollo, he cele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brates
<pb n="207" facs="206"/>
all the eminent Spanish and Portugueze Poets; he speaks both of Camoens and Ercilla with the warmest applause. Among the most pleas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing passages in this poem is a compliment which he pays to his father, who was, like the father of Tasso, a Poet of considerable talents.</p>
                  <p>Among the smaller pieces of Lope de Vega, there are two particularly curious; a descriptive poem on the garden of his patron the Duke of Alva, and a sonnet in honour of the Invincible Armada: the latter may be considered as a complete model of Spanish bombast: "Go forth and burn the world," says the Poet, addressing himself to that mighty fleet; "my sighs will furnish your fails with a never-failing wind; and my breast will supply your cannon with inexhaustible fire."—Perhaps this may be equalled by a Spanish character of our Poet, with which I shall close my imperfect account of him. It is his friend and biogra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pher Montalvan, who, in the opening of his life, bestows on him the following titles: El Doctor Frey Lope Felix de Vega Carpio, Portento del Orbe, Gloria de la Nacion, Lustre de la Patria, Oracula de la Len<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gua, Centro de la Fama, Assumpio de la Invidia, Cuydado de la Fortuna, Fenix de los Siglos, Principe de los Versos, Orfeo de las Ciencias, Apolo de las Musas, Horacio de los Poetas, Virgilio de los Epicos, Homero de los Heroycos, Pindaro de los Lyricos, Sofocles de los Tra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gicos, y Terencio de los Comicos, Unico entre los Mayores, Mayor entre los Grandes, y Grande a todas Luzes, y en todas Materias.</p>

                  <p>Don Alonzo de Ercilla y Zuniga was equally distinguished as a Hero and a Poet; but this exalted character, notwithstanding his double claim to our regard, is almost to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tally unknown in our country, and I shall therefore endeavour to give the English reader the best idea that I can, both of his gallant life, and of his singular poem.—He was born in Madrid, on the 7th of August 1533, the third son of Fortun Garcia de Ercilla, who, though descended from a noble family, pursued the profession of the law, and was so remarkable for his talents, that he acquired the appellation of "The subtle Spaniard." The mother of our Poet was also noble, and from her he inherited his
<pb n="208" facs="207"/>
second title, Zuniga: Ercilla was the name of an ancient castle in Biscay, which had been long in the possession of his paternal ancestors. He lost his father while he was yet an infant, a circumstance which had, great influence on his future life; for his mother was received, after the de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cease of her husband, into the household of the Empress, Isabella, the wife of Charles the Vth, and had thus an early opportunity of introducing our young Alonzo into the palace. He soon obtained an appointment there, in the character of page to the Infant Don Philip, to whose service he devoted himself with the most heroic enthusiasm, though Philip was a master who little deserved so generous an attachment. At the age of fourteen, he attended that Prince in the splendid progress which he made, at the desire of his Imperial father, through the principal cities of the Netherlands, and through parts of Italy and Germany. This singular expedition is very circumstantially recorded in a folio volume, by a Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nish historian named Juan Christoval Calvete de Estrella, whose work affords a very curious and striking picture of the manners and ceremonies of that martial and romantic age. All the cities which were visited by the Prince contended with each other in magnificent festivity: the bril<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liant series of literary and warlike pageants which they exhibited, though they answered not their design of conciliating the affection of the sullen Philip, might probably awaken the genius of our youthful Poet, and excite his ambition to acquire both poetical and military fame. In 1551, he returned with the Prince into Spain, and continued there for three years; at the end of which he attended his royal master to England on his marriage with Queen Mary, which was celebrated at Winchester in the summer of 1554. At this period Ercilla first assumed the military character; for his sovereign received advice, during his residence at Lon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>don, that the martial natives of Aranco, a district on the coast of Chile, had revolted from the Spanish government, and dispatched an experienced officer, named Alderete, who attended him in England, to subdue the insurrection, investing him with the command of the rebellious pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vince. Ercilla embarked with Alderete; but that officer dying in his passage, our Poet proceeded to Lima. Don Hurtado de Mendoza, who commanded there as Viceroy of Peru, appointed his son Don Garcia to supply the place of Alderete, and sent him with a considerable force to oppose the Arancanians. Ercilla was engaged in this enterprize, and
<pb n="209" facs="208"/>
greatly distinguished himself in the obstinate contest which ensued. The noble character of the Barbarians who maintained this unequal struggle, and the many splendid feats of valour which this scene afforded, led our author to the singular design of making the war, in which he was himself engaged, the subject of an Heroic poem; which he entitled "La Araucana," from the name of the country. As many of his own par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticular adventures may be found in the following summary of his work, I shall not here enlarge on his military exploits; but proceed to one of the most mortifying events of his life; which he briefly mentions in the conclusion of his poem. After passing with great honour through many and various perils, he was on the point of suffering a disgraceful death, from the rash orders of his young and inconsiderate Commander. On his return from an expedition of adventure and discovery, to the Spanish city of Imperial, he was present at a scene of public festivity displayed there, to celebrate the accession of Philip the IId to the crown of Spain; at a kind of tournament, there arose an idle dispute between Ercilla and Don Juan de Pineda, in the heat of which the two disputants drew their swords; many of the spectators joined in the broil; and, a report arising that the quarrel was a mere pretence, to conceal some mu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinous design, the hasty Don Garcia, their General, committed the two antagonists to prison, and sentenced them both to be publicly beheaded. Ercilla himself declares, he was conducted to the scaffold before his pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cipitate judge discovered the iniquity of the sentence; but his innocence appeared just time enough to save him; and he seems to have been fully reinstated in the good opinion of Don Garcia, as, among the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plimentary sonnets addressed to Ercilla, there is one which bears the name of his General, in which he styles him the Divine Alonzo, and cele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brates both his military and poetical genius. But Ercilla seems to have been deeply wounded by this affront; for, quitting Chile, he went to Callao, the port of Lima, and there embarked on an expedition against a Spanish rebel, named Lope de Aguirre, who, having murdered his captain, and usurped the chief power, was perpetrating the most cruel enormities in the settlement of Venezuela. But Ercilla learned, on his arrival at Panama, that this barbarous usurper was destroyed; he therefore resolved, as his health was much impaired by the hard<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ships he had passed, to return to Spain. He arrived there in the twenty-ninth
<pb n="210" facs="209"/>
ninth year of his age; but soon left it, and travelled, as he himself in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>forms us, through France, Italy, Germany, Silesia, Moravia, and Pan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nonia; but the particulars of this expedition are unknown. In the year 1570 he appeared again at Madrid, and was married to Maria Bazan, a lady whom he contrives to celebrate in the course of his military poem. He is said to have been afterwards gentleman of the bed-chamber to the Emperor Rodolph the IId, a prince who had been educated at Madrid; but the connection of our Poet with this Monarch is very in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>distinctly recorded; and indeed all the latter part of his life is little known. In the year 1580 he resided at Madrid, in a state of retirement and poverty. The time and circumstances of his death are uncertain: it is proved that he was living in the year 1596, by the evidence of a Spanish writer named Mosquera, who, in a treatise of military discipline, speaks of Ercilla as engaged at that time in celebrating the victories of Don Alvaro Bazan, Marques de Santa Cruz, in a poem which has ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver appeared, and is supposed to have been left imperfect at his death. Some anecdotes related of our Poet afford us ground to hope that his various merits ware not entirely unrewarded. It is said, that in speak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to his sovereign Philip, he was so overwhelmed by diffidence that language failed him: "Don Alonzo! (replied the King) speak to me in writing."—He did so, and obtained his request. The Spanish His<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>torian Ovalle, who has written an account of Chile, in which he fre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently supports his narration by the authority of Ercilla, affirms that our Poet presented his work to Philip with his own hand, and received a recompence from the King. But in this circumstance I fear the His<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>torian was mistaken, as he supposes it to have happened on the return of Ercilla from Chile; and our Poet, in a distinct portion of his work, which was not published till many years after that period, expressly de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clares, in addressing himself to Philip, that all his attempts to serve him had been utterly unrequited. Ercilla left no legitimate family; but had some natural children, the most eminent of which was a daugh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter, who was advantageously married to a nobleman of Portugal.</p>
                  <p>In that elegant collection of Spanish Poets, "<hi>Parnaso Espan̄ol,</hi>" there is a pleasing little amorous poem, written by Ercilla in his youth, which is peculiarly commended by Lope de Vega; who has bestowed a very ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nerous encomium on our Poet, in his "<hi>Laurel de Apolo.</hi>" But the great
<pb n="211" facs="210"/>
and singular work which has justly rendered Ercilla immortal, is his Poem entitled Araucana, which was published in three separate parts: the first appeared in 1577; he added the second in the succeeding year; and in 1590 he printed a complete edition of the whole. It was applauded by the most eminent writers of Spain; and Cervantes, in speaking of Don Quixote's Library, has ranked it among the choicest treasures of the Castilian Muse. Voltaire, who speaks of Ercilla with his usual spirit and inaccuracy, has the merit of having made our Poet more gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rally known, though his own acquaintance with him appears to have been extremely slight; for he affirms that Ercilla was in the battle of Saint Quintin: a mistake into which he never could have fallen, had he read the Araucana. Indeed the undistinguishing censure which he passes on the poem in general, after commending one particular passage, suffi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciently proves him a perfect stranger to many subsequent parts of the work; yet his remark on the inequality of the Poet is just. Ercilla is certainly unequal; but, with all his defects, he appears to me one of the most extraordinary and engaging characters in the poetical world. Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps I am a little partial to him, from the accidental circumstance of having first read his poem with a departed friend, whose opinions are very dear to me, and who was particularly fond of this military Bard. However this may be, my idea of Ercilla's merit has led me to hazard the following extensive sketch of his Work: — it has swelled to a much larger size than I at first intended; for I was continually tempted to ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tend it, by the desire of not injuring the peculiar excellencies of this wonderful Poet. If I have not utterly failed in that desire, the English reader will be enabled to judge, and to enjoy an author, who, considering his subject and its execution, may be said to stand single and unparal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>leled in the host of Poets. His beauties and his defects are of so ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vious a nature, that I shall not enlarge upon them; but let it be re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>membered, that his poem was composed amidst the toils and perils of the most fatiguing and hazardous service, and that his verses were some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>times written on scraps of leather, from the want of better materials. His style is remarkably pure and perspicuous, and, notwithstanding the restraint of rhyme, it has frequently all the ease, the spirit, and the volu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bility of Homer. I wish not, however, to conceal his defects; and I have therefore given a very fair account of the strange episode he intro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duces
<pb n="212" facs="211"/>
concerning the history of Dido, which has justly fallen under the ridicule of Voltaire. I must however observe, as an apology for Ercilla, that many Bards of his country have considered it as a point of honour to defend the reputation of this injured lady, and to attack Virgil with a kind of poetical Quixotism for having slandered the chastity of so spotless a heroine. If my memory does not deceive me, both Lope de Vega and Quevedo have employed their pens as the champions of Dido. We may indeed very readily join the laugh of the lively Frenchman
<pb n="213" facs="212"/>
against our Poet on this occasion; but let us recollect that Ercilla has infinitely more Homeric spirit, and that his poem contains more genuine Epic beauties, than can be found in Voltaire.</p>
                  <p>Ercilla has been honoured with many poetical encomiums by the writers of his own country; and, as I believe the most elegant compli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment which has been paid to his genius is the production of a Spanish lady, I shall close this account of him with a translation of the Sonnet, in which she celebrates both the Hero and the Poet.</p>

                     <head>A SKETCH OF THE ARAUCANA.</head>
                     <p>THE Poem of Ercilla opens with the following exposition of his subject:
<q>
                           <l>I Sing not love of ladies, nor of sights</l>
                           <l>Devis'd for gentle dames by courteous knights,</l>
                           <l>Nor feasts, nor tourneys, nor that tender care</l>
                           <l>Which prompts the Gallant to regale the Fair;</l>
                           <l>But the bold deeds of Valor's fav'rite train,</l>
                           <l>Those undegenerate sons of warlike Spain,</l>
                           <l>Who made Arauco their stern laws embrace,</l>
                           <l>And bent beneath their yoke her untam'd race.</l>
                           <l>Of tribes distinguish'd in the field I sing;</l>
                           <l>Of nations who disdain the name of King;</l>
                           <l>Courage, that danger only taught to grow,</l>
                           <l>And challenge honour from a generous foe;</l>
                           <l>And persevering toils of purest fame,</l>
                           <l>And feats that aggrandize the Spanish name:</l>
                           <l>For the brave actions of the vanquish'd spread</l>
                           <l>The brightest glory round the victor's head.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He then addresses his work to his sovereign, Philip the Second, and devotes his first Canto to the description of that part of the new world which forms the scene of his action, and is called Arauco; a district in the province of Chile. He paints the singular character and various customs of its warlike inhabitants with great clearness and spirit. In many points they bear a striking resemblance to the ancient Germans, as they are drawn with a kind of poetical energy by the strong pencil of Tacitus. The first Canto closes with a brief account how this martial province was subdued by a Spanish officer named Valdivia; with an
<pb n="215" facs="214"/>
intimation that his negligence in his new dominion gave birth to those important exploits which the Poet proposes to celebrate.</p>

                        <head>CANTO II.</head>
                        <p>ERCILLA begins his Cantos much in the manner of Ariosto, with a moral reflection; sometimes rather too much dilated, but generally ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pressed in easy, elegant, and spirited verse.—The following lines faintly imitate the two first stanzas of his second Canto:
<q>
                              <l>Many there are who, in this mortal strife,</l>
                              <l>Have reach'd the slippery heights of splendid life:</l>
                              <l>For Fortune's ready hand its succour lent;</l>
                              <l>Smiling she rais'd them up the steep ascent,</l>
                              <l>To hurl them headlong from that lofty seat</l>
                              <l>To which she led their unsuspecting feet;</l>
                              <l>E'en at the moment when all fears disperse,</l>
                              <l>And their proud fancy sees no sad reverse.</l>
                              <l>Little they think, beguil'd by fair success,</l>
                              <l>That Joy is but the herald of Distress:</l>
                              <l>The hasty wing of time escapes their sight,</l>
                              <l>And those dark evils that attend his flight:</l>
                              <l>Vainly they dream, with gay presumption warm,</l>
                              <l>Fortune for them will take a steadier form;</l>
                              <l>She, unconcern'd at what her victims feel,</l>
                              <l>Turns with her wonted haste her fatal wheel.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>After blaming his countrymen for abusing their good fortune, the Poet celebrates, in the following spirited manner, the eagerness and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dignation with which the Indians prepared to wreak their vengeance on their Spanish oppressors:
<q>
                              <l>The Indians first, by novelty dismay'd,</l>
                              <l>As Gods rever'd us, and as Gods obey'd;</l>
                              <l>But when they found we were of woman born,</l>
                              <l>Their homage turn'd to enmity and scorn:</l>
                              <l>
                                 <pb n="216" facs="215"/>Their childish error, when our weakness show'd,</l>
                              <l>They blush'd at what their ignorance bestow'd;</l>
                              <l>Fiercely they burnt, with anger and with shame,</l>
                              <l>To see their masters but of mortal frame.</l>
                              <l>Disdaining cold and cowardly delay,</l>
                              <l>They seek atonement, on no distant day:</l>
                              <l>Prompt and resolv'd, in quick debate they join,</l>
                              <l>To form of deep revenge their dire design.</l>
                              <l>Impatient that their bold decree should spread,</l>
                              <l>And shake the world around with sudden dread,</l>
                              <l>Th' assembling Chieftains led so large a train,</l>
                              <l>Their ready host o'erspread th' extensive plain.</l>
                              <l>No summons now the soldier's heart requires;</l>
                              <l>The thirst of battle every breast inspires;</l>
                              <l>No pay, no promise of reward, they ask,</l>
                              <l>Keen to accomplish their spontaneous task;</l>
                              <l>And, by the force of one avenging blow,</l>
                              <l>Crush and annihilate their foreign foe.</l>
                              <l>Of some brave Chiefs, who to this council came,</l>
                              <l>Well may'st thou, Memory, preserve the name;</l>
                              <l>Tho' rude and savage, yet of noble soul,</l>
                              <l>Justly they claim their place on Glory's roll,</l>
                              <l>Who robbing Spain of many a gallant son,</l>
                              <l>In so confin'd a space such victories won;</l>
                              <l>Whose fame some living Spaniards yet may spread,</l>
                              <l>Too well attested by our warlike dead.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Poet proceeds to mention, in the manner of Homer, but in a much shorter catalogue, the principal chieftains, and the number of their respective vassals.</p>
                        <p>Uncouthly as their names must sound to an English ear, it seems ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessary to run through the list, as these free and noble-minded savages act so distinguished a part in the course of the poem.—Tucapel stands first; renowned for the most inveterate enmity to the Christians, and leader of three thousand vassals: Angol, a valiant youth, attended by four thousand: Cayocupil, with three; and Millarapue, an elder chief,
<pb n="217" facs="216"/>
with five thousand: Paycabi, with three thousand; and Lemolemo, with six: Maregnano, Gualèmo, and Lebopia, with three thousand each: Elicura, distinguished by strength of body and detestation of servitude, with six thousand; and the ancient Colocolo with a superior number: Ongolmo, with four thousand; and Puren, with six; the fierce and gigantic Lincoza with a still larger train. Peteguelen, lord of the valley of Arauco, prevented from personal attendance by the Christians, dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>patches six thousand of his retainers to the assembly: the most distin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guished of his party are Thomè and Andalican. The Lord of the mari<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>time province of Pilmayquen, the bold Caupolican, is also unable to appear at the opening of the council. Many other Chieftains attended, whose names the Poet suppresses, lest his prolixity should offend. As they begin their business in the style of the ancient Germans, with a plentiful banquet, they soon grow exasperated with liquor, and a vio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lent quarrel ensues concerning the command of the forces for the pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jected war: an honour which almost every chieftain was arrogant enough to challenge for himself. In the midst of this turbulent debate, the ancient Colocolo delivers the following harangue, which Voltaire prefers (and I think with great justice) to the speech of Nestor, on a similar occasion, in the first Iliad.</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>Assembled Chiefs! ye guardians of the land!</l>
                           <l>Think not I mourn from thirst of lost command,</l>
                           <l>To find your rival spirits thus pursue</l>
                           <l>A post of honour which I deem my due.</l>
                           <l>These marks of age, you see, such thoughts disown</l>
                           <l>In me, departing for the world unknown;</l>
                           <l>But my warm love, which ye have long possest,</l>
                           <l>Now prompts that counsel which you'll find the best.</l>
                           <l>Why should we now for marks of glory jar?</l>
                           <l>Why wish to spread our martial name afar?</l>
                           <l>Crush'd as we are by Fortune's cruel stroke,</l>
                           <l>And bent beneath an ignominious yoke,</l>
                           <l>Ill can our minds such noble pride maintain,</l>
                           <l>While the fierce Spaniard holds our galling chain.</l>
                           <l>Your generous fury here ye vainly shew;</l>
                           <l>Ah! rather pour it on th' embattled foe!</l>
                           <l>
                              <pb n="218" facs="217"/>What frenzy has your souls of sense bereav'd?</l>
                           <l>Ye rush to self-perdition, unperceiv'd.</l>
                           <l>'Gainst your own vitals would ye lift those hands,</l>
                           <l>Whose vigor ought to burst oppression's bands?</l>
                           <l>If a desire of death this rage create,</l>
                           <l>O die not yet in this disgraceful state!</l>
                           <l>Turn your keen arms, and this indignant flame,</l>
                           <l>Against the breast of those who sink your fame,</l>
                           <l>Who made the world a witness of your shame.</l>
                           <l>Haste ye to cast these hated bonds away,</l>
                           <l>In this the vigor of your souls display;</l>
                           <l>Nor blindly lavish, from your country's veins,</l>
                           <l>Blood that may yet redeem her from her chains.</l>
                           <l>E'en while I thus lament, I still admire</l>
                           <l>The fervor of your souls; they give me fire:</l>
                           <l>But, justly trembling at their fatal bent,</l>
                           <l>I dread some dire calamitous event;</l>
                           <l>Lest in your rage Dissention's frantic hand</l>
                           <l>Should cut the sinews of our native land.</l>
                           <l>If such its doom, my thread of being burst,</l>
                           <l>And let your old compeer expire the first!</l>
                           <l>Shall this shrunk frame, thus bow'd by age's weight,</l>
                           <l>Live the weak witness of a nation's fate?</l>
                           <l>No: let some friendly sword, with kind relief,</l>
                           <l>Forbid its sinking in that scene of grief.</l>
                           <l>Happy whose eyes in timely darkness close,</l>
                           <l>Sav'd from that worst of sights, his country's woes!</l>
                           <l>Yet, while I can, I make your weal my care,</l>
                           <l>And for the public good my thoughts declare.</l>
                           <l>Equal ye are in courage and in worth;</l>
                           <l>Heaven has assign'd to all an equal birth:</l>
                           <l>In wealth, in power, and majesty of soul,</l>
                           <l>Each Chief seems worthy of the world's controul.</l>
                           <l>These gracious gifts, not gratefully beheld,</l>
                           <l>To this dire strife your daring minds impell'd.</l>
                           <l>But on your generous valor I depend,</l>
                           <l>That all our country's woes will swiftly end.</l>
                           <l>
                              <pb n="219" facs="218"/>A Leader still our present state demands,</l>
                           <l>To guide to vengeance our impatient bands;</l>
                           <l>Fit for this hardy task that Chief I deem,</l>
                           <l>Who longest may sustain a massive beam:</l>
                           <l>Your rank is equal, let your force be try'd,</l>
                           <l>And for the strongest let his strength decide.</l>
                        </q>
                        <p>The Chieftains acquiesce in this proposal; which, as Voltaire justly observes, is very natural in a nation of savages. The beam is produced, and of a size so enormous, that the Poet declares himself afraid to specify its weight. The first Chieftains who engage in the trial support it on their shoulders five and six hours each; Tucapel fourteen; and Lincoza more than double that number; when the assembly, considering his strength as almost supernatural, is eager to bestow on him the title of General; but in the moment he is exulting in this new honour, Caupolican arrives without attendants. His person and character are thus described by the Poet:
<q>
                              <l>Tho' from his birth one darken'd eye he drew</l>
                              <l>(The viewless orb was of the granate's hue)</l>
                              <l>Nature, who partly robb'd him of his sight,</l>
                              <l>Repaid this failure by redoubled might.</l>
                              <l>This noble youth was of the highest state;</l>
                              <l>His actions honour'd, and his words of weight:</l>

                        <p>This accomplished Chieftain is received with great joy by the assem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bly; and, having surpassed Lincoza by many degrees in the trial, is in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vested with the supreme command. He dispatches a small party to at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tack a neighbouring Spanish fort: they execute his orders, and make

a vigorous assault. After a sharp conflict they are repulsed; but in the moment of their retreat Caupolican arrives with his army to their sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port. The Spaniards in despair evacuate the fort, and make their escape in the night: the news is brought to Valdivia, the Spanish Commander in the city of Conception;—and with his resolution to punish the Bar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>barians the canto concludes.</p>

He does not scruple to assert, that the enmity of the Indians arose from the avaricious severity of their Spanish oppressors; and he accuses Valdivia on this head, though he gives him the praise of a brave and gallant officer.—This Spaniard, on the first intelligence of the Indian insurrection, dispatched his scouts from the city where he commanded. They do not return. Pressed by the impa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tient gallantry of his troops, Valdivia marches out:—they soon discover the mangled heads of his messengers fixed up as a spectacle of terror on the road. Valdivia deliberates what measures to pursue. His army en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>treat him to continue his march. He consents, being piqued by their insinuations of his disgracing the Spanish arms. An Indian ally brings him an account that twenty thousand of the confederated Indians are waiting to destroy him in the valley of Tucapel. He still presses forward; ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rives
<pb n="221" facs="220"/>
in sight of the fort which the Indians had destroyed, and engages them in a most obstinate battle; in the description of which, the Poet introduces an original and striking simile, in the following manner:
<q>
                              <l>The steady pikemen of the savage band,</l>
                              <l>Waiting our hasty charge, in order stand;</l>
                              <l>But when th' advancing Spaniard aim'd his stroke,</l>
                              <l>Their ranks, to form a hollow square, they broke;</l>
                              <l>An easy passage to our troop they leave,</l>
                              <l>And deep within their lines their foes receive;</l>
                              <l>Their files resuming then the ground they gave,</l>
                              <l>Bury the Christians in that closing grave.</l>
                              <l>As the keen Crocodile, who loves to lay</l>
                              <l>His silent ambush for his finny prey,</l>
                              <l>Hearing the scaly tribe with sportive sound</l>
                              <l>Advance, and call a muddy darkness round;</l>
                              <l>Opens his mighty mouth, with caution, wide,</l>
                              <l>And, when th' unwary fish within it glide,</l>
                              <l>Closing with eager haste his hollow jaw,</l>
                              <l>Thus satiates with their lives his rav'nous maw:</l>
                              <l>So, in their toils, without one warning thought,</l>
                              <l>The murd'rous foe our little squadron caught</l>
                              <l>With quick destruction, in a fatal strife,</l>
                              <l>From whence no Christian soldier 'scap'd with life.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such was the fate of the advanced guard of the Spaniards. The Poet then describes the conflict of the main army with great spirit:—ten Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niards distinguish themselves by signal acts of courage, but are all cut in pieces. The battle proceeds thus:
<q>
                              <l>The hostile sword, now deeply dy'd in blood,</l>
                              <l>Drench'd the wide field with many a sanguine flood;</l>
                              <l>Courage still grows to form the fierce attack,</l>
                              <l>But wasted vigor makes the combat slack:</l>
                              <l>No pause they seek, to gain exhausted breath,</l>
                              <l>No rest, except the final rest of death:</l>
                              <l>
                                 <pb n="222" facs="221"/>The wariest combatants now only try</l>
                              <l>To snatch the sweets of vengeance ere they die.</l>
                              <l>The fierce disdain of death, and scorn of flight,</l>
                              <l>Give to our scanty troop such wond'rous might,</l>
                              <l>The Araucanian host begin to yield;</l>
                              <l>They quit with loss and shame the long-fought field:</l>
                              <l>They fly; and their pursuers shake the plain</l>
                              <l>With joyous shouts of Victory and Spain.</l>
                              <l>But dire mischance, and Fate's resistless sway,</l>
                              <l>Gave a strange issue to the dreadful day.</l>

                              <l>As thus he speaks, his eager steps advance,</l>
                              <l>And 'gainst the Spanish Chief he points his lance;</l>
                              <l>To lead his kindred fugitives from flight,</l>
                              <l>Singly he dares to tempt th' unequal fight:</l>
                              <l>Against our circling arms, that round him shine,</l>
                              <l>Eager he darts amidst the thickest line,</l>
                              <l>Keen as, when chaf'd by summer's fiery beam,</l>
                              <l>The young stag plunges in the cooling stream.</l>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Poet proceeds to relate the great agility and valor displayed by Lantaro, for such is the name of this gallant and patriotic Youth: and, as Ercilla has a soul sufficiently heroic to do full justice to the virtues of an enemy, he gives him the highest praise. Having mentioned on the occasion many heroes of ancient history, he exclaims:
<q>
                              <l>Say, of these famous Chiefs can one exceed</l>
                              <l>Or match this young Barbarian's noble deed?</l>
                              <l>Vict'ry for them, her purpose unexplor'd,</l>
                              <l>Tempted by equal chance their happy sword:</l>
                              <l>What risk, what peril did they boldly meet,</l>
                              <l>Save where Ambition urg'd the splendid feat;</l>
                              <l>Or mightier Int'rest fir'd the daring mind,</l>
                              <l>Which makes a Hero of the fearful Hind?</l>
                              <l>Many there are who with a brave disdain</l>
                              <l>Face all the perils of the deathful plain,</l>
                              <l>
                                 <pb n="224" facs="223"/>Who, fir'd by hopes of glory, nobly dare,</l>
                              <l>Yet fail the stroke of adverse chance to bear;</l>
                              <l>With animated fire their spirit shines,</l>
                              <l>Till the short splendor of their day declines;</l>
                              <l>But all their valor, all their strength expires,</l>
                              <l>When fickle Fortune from their side retires.</l>
                              <l>This youthful Hero, when the die was cast,</l>
                              <l>War's dire decree against his country past,</l>
                              <l>Made the stern Power the finish'd cause resume,</l>
                              <l>And finally reverse the cruel doom:</l>
                              <l>He, by his efforts in the dread debate,</l>
                              <l>Forc'd the determin'd will of adverse Fate,</l>
                              <l>From shouting Triumph rush'd the palm to tear,</l>
                              <l>And fix'd it on the brow of faint Despair.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Caupolican, leading his army back to the charge, in consequence of Lantaro's efforts in their favour, obtains a complete victory. The Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niards are all slain in the field, except their Commander Valdivia, who flies, attended only by a priest; but he is soon taken prisoner, and con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ducted before the Indian Chief, who is inclined to spare his life; when an elder savage, called Leocato, in a sudden burst of indignation, kills him with his club.</p>
                        <p>All the people of Arauco assemble in a great plain to celebrate their victory: old and young, women and children, unite in the festival; and the trees that surround the scene of their assembly are decorated with the heads and spoils of their slaughtered enemies.</p>
                        <p>They meditate the total extermination of the Spaniards from their country, and even a descent on Spain. The General makes a prudent speech to restrain their impetuosity; and afterwards, bestowing just ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plause on the brave exploit of the young Lantaro, appoints him his lieu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tenant. In the midst of the festivity, Caupolican receives advice that a party of fourteen Spanish horsemen had attacked some of his forces with great havoc. He dispatches Lantaro to oppose them.</p>

                        <p>A PARTY of fourteen gallant Spaniards, who had set forth from the city of Imperial to join Valdivia, not being apprized of his unhappy fate, are surprized by the enemy where they expected to meet their Comman<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der;—they defend themselves with great valor. They are informed by a friendly Indian of the fate of Valdivia. They attempt to retreat; but are surrounded by numbers of the Araucanians:—when the Poet intro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duces the following instance of Spanish heroism, which I insert as a curious stroke of their military character:
<q>
                              <l>Here, cried a Spaniard, far unlike his race,</l>
                              <l>Nor shall his abject name my verse debase,</l>
                              <l>Marking his few associates march along,</l>
                              <l>O that our band were but a hundred strong!</l>
                              <l>The brave Gonsalo with disdain replied:</l>
                              <l>Rather let two be sever'd from our side,</l>
                              <l>Kind Heaven! that Memory may our feats proclaim</l>
                              <l>And call our little troop The Twelve of Fame!</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>They continue to fight with great bravery against superior numbers, when Lantaro arrives with a fresh army against them. Still undaunted, they only resolve to sell their lives as dear as possible. Seven of them are cut to pieces.—In the midst of the slaughter a furious thunder and hail storm arises, by which incident the surviving seven escape. The tempest is described with the following original simile:
<q>
                              <l>Now in the turbid air a stormy cloud</l>

                        <p>The few Spaniards that escape take refuge in a neighbouring fort; which they abandon the following day on hearing the fate of Valdivia. Lan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>taro returns, and receives new honors and new forces from his General, to march against a Spanish army, which departs from the city of Penco under the command of Villagran, an experienced officer, to revenge the death of Valdivia. The departure of the troops from Penco is de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scribed, and the distress of the women.—Villagran marches with expe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dition towards the frontiers of Arauco. He arrives at a dangerous pass, and finds Lantaro, with his army of 10,100 Indians, advantageously posted on the heights, and waiting with great steadiness and discipline to give him battle.</p>

                        <p>LANTARO with great difficulty restrains the eager Indians in their post on the rock. He suffers a few to descend and skirmish on the lower ground, where several distinguish themselves in single combat. The Spaniards attempt in vain to dislodge the army of Lantaro by an attack of their cavalry:—they afterwards fire on them from six pieces of cannon.</p>

                        <p>The Indians, undismayed by a dreadful slaughter, gain possession of the cannon.—Villagran makes a short but spirited harangue to his flying soldiers.

                           <l>THE valiant mind is privileg'd to feel</l>
                           <l>Superior to each turn of Fortune's wheel;</l>

                           <l>So thought the noble Villagran, our Chief,</l>
                           <l>Who chose that death should end his present grief,</l>
                           <l>And smooth the horrid path, with thorns o'erspread,</l>
                           <l>Which Destiny condemn'd his feet to tread.</l>

                        <p>With the preceding encomium on the spirit of this unfortunate officer the Poet opens his 6th Canto. Thirteen of the most faithful soldiers of Villagran, perceiving their Leader fallen motionless under the fury of his enemies, make a desperate effort to preserve him.—Being placed again on his horse by these generous deliverers, he recovers from the blow which had stunned him; and by singular exertion, with the assist<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance of his spirited little troop, effects his escape, and rejoins his main army; whom he endeavours in vain to lead back against the triumphant Araucanians. The pursuit becomes general, and the Poet describes the horrid massacre committed by the Indians on all the unhappy fugitives that fell into their hands.—The Spaniards in their flight are stopt by a narrow pass fortified and guarded by a party of Indians. Villagran forces the rude entrenchment in person, and conducts part of his army safe through the pass; but many attempting other roads over the moun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tainous country, are either lost among the precipices of the rocks, or pursued and killed by the Indians.</p>

                        <p>LANTARO is recalled from his victorious exploits, to assist at a general assembly of the Indians, in the valley of Arauco. The dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent Chieftains deliver their various sentiments concerning the war, after their Leader Caupolican has declared his design to pursue the Spaniards with unceasing vengeance. The veteran Colocolo proposes a plan for their military operations. An ancient Augur, named Puche<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>calco, denounces ruin on all the projects of his countrymen, in the name of the Indian Daemon Eponamon. He recites the omens of their destruction. The fierce Tucapel, provoked to frenzy by this gloomy prophet, strikes him dead in the midst of his harangue, by a sudden blow of his mace. Caupolican orders the murderous Chieftain to be led to instant death. He defends himself with success against numbers who attempt to seize him. Lantaro, pleased by this exertion of his wonderful force and valour, intreats the General to forgive what had passed; and, at his intercession, Tucapel is received into favour. Lan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>taro then closes the business of the assembly, by recommending the plan proposed by Colocolo, and intreating that he may himself be entrusted with a detached party of five hundred Indians, with which he engages to reduce the city of Santiago. His proposal is accepted. The Chief<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tains, having finished their debate, declare their resolutions to their people; and, after their usual festivity, Caupolican, with the main army, proceeds to attack the city of Imperial.</p>

                        <p>THE Poet opens this Canto with an apology for a miracle, which he thinks it necessary to relate, as it was attested by the whole Indian army; and, though it does not afford him any very uncommon or sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lime

<q>
                              <l>When to the city's weak defenceless wall</l>
                              <l>Its foes were rushing, at their trumpet's call,</l>
                              <l>The air grew troubled with portentous sound,</l>
                              <l>And mournful omens multiplied around;</l>
                              <l>With furious shock the elements engage,</l>
                              <l>And all the winds contend in all their rage.</l>
                              <l>From clashing clouds their mingled torrents gush,</l>
                              <l>And rain and hail with rival fury rush.</l>
                              <l>Bolts of loud thunder, floods of lightning rend</l>
                              <l>The opening skies, and into earth descend.</l>
                              <l>O'er the vast army equal terrors spread;</l>
                              <l>No mind escapes the universal dread;</l>

                              <l>Holds its firm vigor in this horrid hour;</l>
                              <l>For now the fierce Eponamon appears,</l>
                              <l>And in a Dragon's form augments their fears;</l>
                              <l>Involving flames around the Daemon swell,</l>
                              <l>Who speaks his mandate in a hideous yell:</l>
                              <l>He bids his votaries with haste invest</l>
                              <l>The trembling city, by despair deprest.</l>
                              <l>Where'er th' invading squadrons force their way,</l>
                              <l>He promises their arms an easy prey.</l>
                              <l>Spare not (he cry'd) in the relentless strife,</l>
                              <l>One Spanish battlement, one Christian life!</l>
                              <l>He spoke, and, while the host his will adore,</l>
                              <l>Melts into vapour, and is seen no more.</l>

                              <l>The clouds disperse, restoring as they fly</l>
                              <l>The unobstructed sun and azure sky:</l>
                              <l>

                              <l>The tempest ceas'd, and heaven, serenely bright,</l>
                              <l>Arrayed the moisten'd earth in joyous light:</l>
                              <l>When, pois'd upon a cloud that swiftly flew,</l>
                              <l>A Female form descended to their view,</l>
                              <l>Clad in the radiance of so rich a veil,</l>
                              <l>As made the sun's meridian lustre pale;</l>
                              <l>For it outshone his golden orb as far</l>
                              <l>As his full blaze outshines the twinkling star.</l>
                              <l>Her sacred features banish all their dread,</l>
                              <l>And o'er the host reviving comfort shed.</l>
                              <l>An hoary Elder by her side appear'd,</l>
                              <l>For age and sanctity of life rever'd;</l>
                              <l>And thus she spoke, with soft persuasive grace:</l>
                              <l>Ah! whither rush ye, blind devoted race?</l>
                              <l>Turn, while you can, towards your native plain,</l>
                              <l>Nor 'gainst yon city point your arms in vain;</l>
                              <l>For God will guard his faithful Christian band,</l>
                              <l>And give them empire o'er your bleeding land,</l>
                              <l>Since, thankless, false, and obstinate in ill,</l>
                              <l>You scorn submission to his sacred will.</l>
                              <l>Yet shun those walls; th' Almighty, there ador'd,</l>
                              <l>There arms his people with Destruction's sword.</l>
                              <l>So spoke the Vision, with an angel's tongue,</l>
                              <l>And thro' the spacious air to heaven she sprung.</l>

                        <p>The Indians, confounded by this miraculous interposition, disperse in disorder to their several homes; and the Poet proceeds very gravely to affirm, that, having obtained the best information, from, many indi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>viduals, concerning this miracle, that he might be very exact in his ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count of it, he finds it happened on the twenty-third of April, four years before he wrote the verses that describe it, and in the year of our Lord 1554. The Vision was followed by pestilence and famine among the Indians. They remain inactive during the winter, but assemble again the ensuing spring in the plains of Arauco, to renew the war.

They receive intelligence that the Spaniards are attempting to rebuild the city of Concepcion, and are requested by the neighbouring tribes to march to their assistance, and prevent that design. Lantaro leads a chosen band on that expedition, hoping to surprize the fort the Spaniards had erected on the ruins of their city; but the Spanish com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mander, Alvarado, being apprized of their motion, sallies forth to meet the Indian party: a skirmish ensues; the Spaniards retire to their fort; Lantaro attempts to storm it; a most bloody encounter ensues; Tu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>capel signalizes himself in the attack; the Indians persevere with the most obstinate valour, and, after a long conflict (described with a con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>siderable portion of Homeric spirit) gain possession of the fort; Alvarado and a few of his followers escape; they are pursued, and much galled in their flight: a single Indian, named Rengo, harrasses Alvarado and two of his attendants; the Spanish officer, provoked by the insult, turns with his two companions to punish their pursuer; but the wily Indian secures himself on some rocky heights, and annoys them with his sling, till, despairing of revenge, they continue their flight.</p>

                        <p>THE Indians celebrate their victory with public games; and prizes are appointed for such as excel in their various martial exercises. Leu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>coton is declared victor in the contest of throwing the lance, and receives a scimitar as his reward. Rengo subdues his two rivals, Cayeguan and Talco, in the exercise of wrestling, and proceeds to contend with Leu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>coton. After a long and severe struggle, Rengo has the misfortune to fall by an accidental failure of the ground, but, springing lightly up, engages his adversary with increasing fury; and the canto ends without deciding the contest.</p>

                        <p>LANTARO separates the two enraged antagonists, to prevent the ill effects of their wrath. The youth Orompello, whom Leucoton had before surpassed in the contest of the lance, challenges his successful rival to wrestle: they engage, and fall together: the victory is disputed. Tucapel demands the prize for his young friend Orompello, and insults the General Caupolican. The latter is restrained from avenging the insult, by the sage advice of the veteran Colocolo, at whose request he distributes prizes of equal value to each of the claimants. To prevent farther animosities, they relinquish the rest of the appointed games, and enter into debate on the war. Lantaro is again appointed to the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mand of a chosen troop, and marches towards the city of St. Jago. The Spaniards, alarmed at the report of his approach, send out some forces to reconnoitre his party: a skirmish ensues: they are driven back to the city, and relate that Lantaro is fortifying a strong, post at some distance, intending soon to attack the city. Villagran, the Spaniard who commanded there, being confined by illness, appoints an officer of his own name to sally forth, with all the forces he can raise, in quest of the enemy. The Spaniards fix their camp, on the approach of night, near the fort of Lantaro: they are suddenly alarmed, and summoned to arms; but the alarm is occasioned only by a single horse without a rider, which Lantaro, aware of their approach, had turned loose towards their camp, as an insulting mode of proclaiming his late victory, in which he had taken ten of the Spanish horses.</p>
                        <p>The Spaniards pass the night under arms, resolving to attack the Indians at break of day. Lantaro had issued orders that no Indian should sally from the fort under pain of death, to prevent the advan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tage which the Spanish cavalry must have over his small forces in the open plain. He also commanded his soldiers to retreat with an appear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance of dismay, at the first attack on the fort, and suffer a considerable number of the enemy to enter the place. This stratagem succeeds: the Spaniards rush forward with great fury: the Indians give ground, but,
<pb n="237" facs="236"/>
soon turning with redoubled violence on those who had passed their lines, destroy many, and oblige the rest to save themselves by a preci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pitate flight. The Indians, forgetting the orders of their Leader, in the ardour of vengeance sally forth in pursuit of their flying enemy. Lantaro recalls them by the sound of a military horn, which he blows with the utmost violence. They return, but dare not appear in the presence of their offended Commander. He issues new restrictions; and then, summoning his soldiers together, addresses them, in a spirited, yet calm and affectionate harangue, on the necessity of martial obedience. While he is yet speaking, the Spaniards return to the attack, but are again repulsed with great loss. They retreat, and encamp at the foot of a mountain, unmolested by any pursuers.</p>

                        <p>THE Spaniards remain in their camp, while two of their adventurous soldiers engage to return once more to the fort, and examine the state of it. On their approach, one of them, called Marcos Vaez, is sa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>luted by his name, and promised security, by a voice from within the walls. Lantaro had formerly lived with him on terms of friendship, and now invites him into the fort. The Indian Chief harangues on the resolution and the power of his countrymen to exterminate the Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niards, unless they submit. He proposes, however, terms of accommo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dation to his old friend Marcos, and specifies the tribute he should ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pect. The Spaniard answers with disdain, that the only tribute the Indians would receive from his countrymen would be torture and death. Lantaro replies, with great temper, that arms, and the valour of the re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spective nations, must determine this point; and proceeds to entertain his guest with a display of six Indians, whom he had mounted and trained to exercise on Spanish horses. The Spaniard challenges the whole party: Lantaro will not allow him to engage in any conflict, but dismisses him in peace. He recalls him, before he had proceeded far from the fort, and, telling him that his soldiers were much distressed by the want of provision, entreats him to send a supply, affirming it to be true

heroism to relieve an enemy from the necessities of famine. The Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niard subscribes to the sentiment, and engages, if possible, to comply with the request. Returning to his camp, he acquaints his Commander Villagran with all that had passed; who, suspecting some dangerous design from Lantaro, decamps hastily in the night to regain the city. The Indian Chief is severely mortified by their departure, as he had formed a project for cutting off their retreat, by letting large currents of water into the marshy ground on which the Spaniards were encamped. Despairing of being able to succeed against their city, now prepared to resist him, he returns towards Arauco, most sorely galled by his disap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pointment, and thus venting his anguish:

The Spaniards at St. Jago are eager to sally in quest of Lantaro, but their Commander Villagran was absent on an expedition to the city of Imperial. In returning from thence he passes near the post. of Lantaro. An Indian ally acquaints him with its situation, and, at the earnest request of the Spanish officer, agrees to conduct him, by a short though difficult road, over a mountain, to attack the fort by sur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prize. The Poet suspends his narration of this interesting event, to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>late the arrival of new forces from Spain in America; and he now be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gins

to appear himself on the field of action. "Hitherto," says he, "I have described the scenes in which I was not present; yet I have collected my information from no partial witnesses, and I have recorded only those events in which both parties agree. Since it is known that I have shed so much blood in support of what I affirm, my future narration will be more authentic; for I now speak as an ocular witness of every action, unblinded by partiality; which I disdain, and resolved to rob no one of the praise which he deserves."</p>
                        <p>After pleading his youth as an apology for the defects of his style, and after declaring that his only motive for writing was the ardent desire to preserve so many valiant actions from perishing in oblivion, the Poet proceeds to relate the arrival of the Marquis de Canete as Viceroy in Peru, and the spirited manner in which he corrected the abuses of that country. The canto concludes with reflections on the advantages of loyalty, and the miseries of rebellion.</p>

                           <l>With sleep and valour struggling in their frame.</l>

                           <l>It was the season when, with tender care,</l>
                           <l>Lantaro reason'd with his anxious Fair;</l>

                           <l>But not so quick, on Apprehension's wings,</l>
                           <l>The wretched miser from his pillow springs,</l>
                           <l>Whose hoarded gold forbids his mind to rest,</l>

                           <l>Four hundred Indians march'd, their firm allies,</l>
                           <l>Who on the left their line of battle close,</l>
                           <l>And haste to combat with their painted bows;</l>
                           <l>Launching adroitly, in their rapid course,</l>
                           <l>Unnumber'd arrows with unerring force.</l>
                           <l>As brave Lantaro issued from his tent,</l>
                           <l>A shaft to meet the sallying Chief was sent;</l>
                           <l>Thro' his left side (ye valiant, mourn his lot!)</l>
                           <l>Flew the keen arrow, with such fury shot</l>
                           <l>It pierc'd his heart, the bravest and the best</l>
                           <l>That e'er was lodg'd within a human breast.</l>
                           <l>Proud of the stroke that laid such valor low,</l>
                           <l>Death seem'd to glory in th' important blow;</l>
                           <l>And, that no Mortal might his triumph claim,</l>
                           <l>In darkness hid the doubtful Archer's name.</l>
                           <l>Such force the keen resistless weapon found,</l>
                           <l>It stretch'd the mighty Chieftain on the ground,</l>
                           <l>And gave large outlet to his ardent blood,</l>
                           <l>That gush'd apace in a tumultuous flood.</l>
                           <l>From his sunk cheek its native colour fled;</l>

                           <l>His soul, that felt its glorious hopes o'erthrown,</l>

                        <p>THE Poet opens this canto with a lively panegyric on Love: he affirms that the greatest Poets have derived their glory from their vivid descriptions of this enchanting passion; and he laments that he is precluded by his subject from indulging his imagination in such scenes as are more likely to captivate a reader.</p>
                        <p>He seems to intend this as an apology (but I must own it is an un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>satisfactory one) for deserting the fair Guacolda, whom he mentions no more. He proceeds to describe the sharp contest which the undaunted Indians still maintained in their fort:—they refuse quarter, which is of<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fered them by the Spanish Leader, and all resolutely perish with the brave and beloved Lantaro. The Poet then resumes his account of the naval expedition from Peru to Chile; and concludes the canto with a spirited description of a storm, which attacked the vessels as they arrived in sight of the province to which they were steering.</p>

                        <p>THE storm abates. The Spaniards land, and fortify themselves on an island near the country of the Araucanians. The latter hold a council of war in the valley of Ongolmo. Caupolican, their General, proposes to attack the Spaniards in their new post. The elder Chieftains dissuade him from the design. A quarrel ensues between Tucapel and the aged Peteguelen:—they are appeased by a speech of the venerable Colocolo; by whose advice a spirited and adroit young Indian, named Millalanco, is dispatched, as a peaceful ambassador, to learn the situa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion and designs of the Spaniards. He embarks in a large galley with oars, and soon arrives at the island. He surveys the Spanish implements of war with astonishment, and is conducted to the tent of the General, Don Garcia.</p>

                        <p>THE Indian addresses the Spanish officers with a proposal of peace and amity. He is dismissed with presents. The Chieftains, on his return, pretend to relinquish hostilities; but prepare secretly for war. The Spaniards remain unmolested on the island during the stormy season. They send a select party of a hundred and thirty, including our Poet, to raise a fort on the continent: these execute their commission with infinite dispatch, and all the Spanish troops remove to this new post. The Araucanians are alarmed. An intrepid Youth, named Gra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>colano, proposes to the Indian General, Caupolican, to storm the fort. The Indians advance near it, under shelter of the night. The Poet de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scribes himself, at this juncture, as oppressed by the excessive labours of the day, and unable to pursue his poetical studies according to his nightly custom: the pen falls from his hand: he is seized with violent pains and tremblings: his strength and senses forsake him: but soon reco<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vering from this infirmity, he enjoys a refreshing sleep. Bellona appears to him in a vision, and encourages him both as a soldier and a poet. She conducts him, through a delicious country, to the summit of a most lofty mountain; when, pointing to a spot below, she informs him it is St. Quintin, and that his countrymen, under the command of their sovereign Philip, are just marching to attack it: she adds, that her pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sence is necessary in the midst of that important scene; and leaves the Poet on the eminence to survey and record the battle.</p>

                        <p>AFTER the Poet has described the success of his royal master at St. Quintin, a female figure of a most venerable appearance, but without a name, relates to him prophetically many future events of great importance to his country. She touches on the disturbances in the
<pb n="250" facs="249"/>
Netherlands, the enterprizes of the Turks, and the exploits of Don John of Austria, at that time unknown to fame. These she hints very imperfectly, telling the Poet, that if he wishes for farther information, he must follow the steps of a tame deer, which he will find in a parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cular spot; this animal will lead him to the cell of an ancient hermit, formerly a soldier, who will conduct him to the secret cave of the unso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cial Fiton, a mighty magician, who will display to him the most mira<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culous visions. His female Instructor then advises him to mix softer subjects with the horrors of war, and to turn his eyes and his thoughts to the charms of the many Beauties who then flourished in Spain. He beholds all these lovely fair ones assembled in a delicious paradise; and he is particularly attracted by a young lady, whose name he discovers to be Donna Maria Bazan (his future wife): in the moment that he be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gins to question his Guide concerning this engaging Beauty, he is roused from his vision by the sound of an alarm. He snatches up his arms, and hurries to his post:—while the morning dawns, and the Indians begin to attack the fort.</p>

                        <p>THE Indians advance in three squadrons. The Youth Gracolano o'erleaps the trench, supported on a lofty pike, by which he also passes the wall. He defends himself in the midst of the Spaniards with great spirit; but, finding himself unsupported, he wrenches a lance from a Spanish soldier, and tries to leap once more over the trench; but he is struck by a stone while vaulting through the air, and falls, covered, as the Poet expressly declares, with two-and-thirty wounds. Some of his friends are shot near him; but the Indians get possession of the Spa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nish lance with which he had sprung over the wall, and brandish it in triumph. The Spaniard, named Elvira, who had lost his weapon, piqued by the adventure, sallies from the fort, and returns, amid the shouts of his countrymen, with an Indian spear which he won in single combat from a Barbarian, whom he had perceived detached from his
<pb n="251" facs="250"/>
party. The Indians attempt to storm the fort on every side: many are destroyed by the Spanish fire-arms. The head of the ancient Peteguelen is shot off; but Tucapel passes the wall, and rushes with great slaughter into the midst of the enemy. The Spaniards who were in the ships that anchored near the coast hasten on shore, and march to assist their coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trymen in the fort, but are attacked by a party of Indians in their march. The conflict continues furious on the walls; but the Indians at length retreat, leaving Tucapel still fighting within the fort.</p>

                        <p>TUCAPEL, though severely wounded, escapes with life, and re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>joins the Indian army, which continues to retreat. The Spaniards sally from the fort, but soon return to it, from the apprehension of an ambuscade. They clear their trench, and strengthen the weaker parts of their fortification. Night comes on. The Poet describes himself stationed on a little eminence in the plain below the fort, which was seated on high and rocky ground:—fatigued with the toils of the day, and oppressed by the weight of his armour, which he continues to wear, he is troubled with a lethargic heaviness; which he counteracts by exercise, declaring that his disposition to slumber in his post arose not from any intemperance either in diet or in wine, as mouldy biscuit and rain-water had been for some time his chief sustenance; and that he was accustomed to make the moist earth his bed, and to divide his time between his poetical and his military labours. He then relates the fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lowing nocturnal adventure, which may perhaps be considered as the most striking and pathetic incident in this singular poem:

                              <l>As my quick feet, with many a silent stride,</l>
                              <l>Travers'd th' allotted ground from side to side,</l>
                              <l>My eye perceiv'd one quarter of the plain</l>

                              <l>And now it ceas'd, and now again begun,</l>

                              <l>To view the source of this uncertain noise,</l>
                              <l>Eager my mind's unquiet doubts to still,</l>

                              <l>I am a woman, guiltless of offence!</l>

                              <l>Will such a deed encrease thy martial fame,</l>

                              <l>That by thy ruthless sword a woman died,</l>
                              <l>A widow, sunk in sorrow's deepest tide?</l>
                              <l>Yet I implore thee, if 'twas haply thine,</l>

                        <p>The fair Indian then relates to Ercilla the particulars of her life, in speech of considerable length:—she informs him, that her name is Te<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gualda;—that she is the daughter of the Chieftain Brancól;—that her fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther had often pressed her to marry, which she had for some time declined, though solicited by many of the noblest Youths in her country; till, being appointed, in compliment to her beauty, to distribute the prizes. in a scene of public festivity, to those who excelled in the manly exer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cises, she was struck by the accomplishments of a gallant Youth, named Crepino, as she bestowed on him the reward of his victories;—that she declared her choice to her father, after perceiving the Youth inspired with a mutual affection for her;—that the old Chieftain was delighted by her chusing so noble a character, and their marriage had been publicly solemnized but a month from that day. On this conclusion of her story she bursts into new agonies of grief, and intreats Ercilla to let her pay her last duties to her husband; or rather, to unite them again in a com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon grave. Ercilla endeavours to console her, by repeated promises of all the assistance in his power. In the most passionate excess of sorrow,
<pb n="255" facs="254"/>
she still entreats him to end her miserable life.—In this distressing scene, our Author is relieved by the arrival of a brother officer, who had been also stationed on the plain, and now informs Ercilla that the time of their appointed watch is expired. They join in comforting the unhappy Mourner, and conduct her into the fort; where they consign her, for the remainder of the night, to <hi>the decent care of married women,</hi> to use the chaste expression of the generous and compassionate Ercilla.</p>

                        <p>As I have been tempted to dwell much longer than I intended on some of the most pathetic incidents of this extraordinary poem, I shall give a more concise summary of the remaining cantos.—On Ercilla's return, the Spaniards continue to strengthen their fort. They receive intelligence from an Indian ally, that the Barbarian army intend a fresh assault in the night. They are relieved from this alarm by the arrival of a large reinforcement from the Spanish cities in Chile:—on which event Colocolo prevails on the Indians to suspend the attack. Caupo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lican, the Indian General, reviews all his forces; and the various Chief<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tains are well described. The Spanish Commander, Don Garcia, being now determined to march into the hostile district of Amuco, addresses soldiers in a spirited harangue, requesting them to remember the pious, cause for which they fight, and to spare the life of every Indian who is disposed to submission. They remove from their post, and pass in boats over the broad river Biobio.</p>

                        <p>THE Spaniards are attacked in their new quarters—a surious battle enfues. The Spaniards are forced to give ground, but at last pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vail.

The Spaniards, after the conflict, seize an unhappy straggling Youth, named Galvarino, whom they punish as a rebel in the most barbarous manner, by cutting off both his hands. The valiant Youth defies their cruelty in the midst of this horrid scene; and, brandishing his bloody stumps, departs from his oppressors with the most insulting menaces of revenge.</p>

                        <p>GALVARINO appears in the Assembly of the Indian Chieftains, and excites them, in a very animated speech, to revenge the barba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity with which he has been treated. He faints from loss of blood, in the close of his harangue, but is recovered by the care of his friends, and restored to health. The Indians, exasperated by the sight of his wounds, unanimously determine to prosecute the war. The Spaniards, advancing in Arauco, send forth scouts to discover the disposition of the neighbouring tribes. Ercilla, engaging in this service, perceives an old Indian in a sequestered spot, apparently sinking under the infirmities of age; but, on his approach, the ancient figure flies from him with asto<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nishing rapidity. He endeavours in vain, though on horseback, to overtake this aged fugitive, who soon escapes from his sight. He now discovers the tame Deer foretold in his vision; and, pursuing it, is con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ducted through intricate paths to a retired cottage, where a courteous old man receives him in a friendly manner. Ercilla enquires after the Magician Fiton: the old man undertakes to guide him to the secret mansion of that wonderful Necromancer, to whom he declares himself related. He adds, that he himself was once a distinguished warrior; but, having the misfortune to sully his past glory, without losing his life, in a conflict with another Chieftain, he had withdrawn himself from society, and lived twenty years as a hermit. He now leads Ercilla through a gloomy grove to the cell of the Magician, whose residence and magical apparatus are described with great force of imagination. Fiton appears from a secret portal, and proves to be the aged figure who had escaped so swiftly from the sight of Ercilla. At the request of
<pb n="259" facs="258"/>
his relation, the old Warrior, he condescends to shew Ercilla the won<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders of his art. He leads him to a large lucid globe, self-suspended in the middle of an immense apartment. He tells him it is the work of forty years study, and contains an exact representation of the world, with this singular power, that it exhibits, at his command, any scene of futurity which he wishes to behold:—that, knowing the heroic compo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sition of Ercilla, he will give him an opportunity to vary and embellish his poem by the description of a most important sea-fight, which he will display to him most distinctly on that sphere. He then invokes all the powers of the infernal world. Ercilla fixes his eye on the globe, and perceives the naval forces of Spain, with those of the Pope and the Venetians, prepared to engage the great armament of the Turks.</p>

Ercilla, after being enter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tained with other marvellous sights, which he omits from his dread of prolixity, takes leave of his two aged friends, and regains his quarters. The Spaniards continue to advance: on their pitching their camp in a new spot, towards evening, an Araucanian, fantastically drest in armour, enquires for the tent of Don Garcia, and is conducted to his presence.</p>

                        <p>THE Araucanian delivers a defiance to Don Garcia, in the name of Caupolican, who challenges the Spanish General to end the war by a single combat. The messenger adds, that the whole Indian army will descend into the plain, on the next morning, to be spectators of the
<pb n="260" facs="259"/>
duel. Don Garcia dismisses him with an acceptance of the challenge. At the dawn of day the Indian forces appear in three divisions. A party of Spanish horse precipitately attack their left wing, before which Caupolican was advancing. They are repulsed. A general and obstinate engagement ensues. The mangled Galvarino appears at the head of one Indian squadron, and excites his countrymen to revenge his wrongs. Many Spaniards are named who distinguish themselves in the battle. Among the Indian Chiefs Tucapel and Rengo display the most splendid acts of valour; and, though personal enemies, they mutually defend each other. Caupolican also, at the head of the left squadron, obliges the Spaniards to retreat; and the Araucanians are on the point of gain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing a decisive victory, when the fortune of the day begins to turn.</p>

                        <p>THE reserved guard of the Spaniards, in which Ercilla was stationed, advancing to the charge, recover the field, and oblige the main body of the Indians to fly. Caupolican, though victorious in his quarter, sounds a retreat when he perceives this event. The Indians fly in great disorder. Rengo for some time sustains an unequal conflict, and at last retreats sullenly into a wood, where he collects several of the scattered fugitives. As Ercilla happened to advance towards this spot, a Spaniard, called Remon, exhorts him by name to attempt the dangerous but important exploit of forcing this Indian party from the wood. His honour being thus piqued, he rushes forward with a few followers, and, after an obstinate engagement, in which many of the Indians are cut to pieces, the Spaniards obtain the victory, and return to their camp with several prisoners. After this great defeat of the Indian army, the Spaniards, to deter their enemies from all future resistance, barbarously resolve to execute twelve Chieftains of distinction, whom they find among their captives, and to leave their bodies exposed on the trees that surrounded the field of battle. The generous Ercilla, lamenting this inhuman sentence, intercedes particularly for the life of one, alledging
<pb n="261" facs="260"/>
that he had seen him united with the Spaniards. This person proves to be Galvarino; who, on hearing the intercession for his life, produces his mangled arms, which he had concealed in his bosom, and, giving vent to his detestation of the Spaniards, insists on dying with his country<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>men. Ercilla persists in vain in his endeavour to save him. As, no executioner could be found among the Spanish soldiers, a new mode of destruction, says our Poet, was invented; and every Indian was ordered to terminate his own life by a cord which was given him. These brave men hastened to accomplish their fate with as much alacrity, continues Ercilla, as the most spirited warrior marches to an attack. One alone of the twelve begins to hesitate, and pray for mercy; declaring himself the lineal descendant of the most ancient race and sovereign of the country. He is interrupted by the reproaches of the impetuous Galva<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rino, and, repenting his timidity, atones for it by instant death.</p>
                        <p>The Spaniards advance still farther in the country and raise a fort where Valdivia had perished. Ercilla finds his old friend the Magician once more, who tells him that Heaven thought proper to punish the pride of the Araucanians by their late defeat; but that the Spaniards would soon pay dearly for their present triumph. The Wizard retires after this prophecy, and, with much intreaty, allows Ercilla to follow him. Coming to a gloomy rock, he strikes it with his wand; a secret door opens, and they enter into a delicious garden, which the Poet commends for its symmetry, expressly declaring that every hedge <hi>has its brother.</hi> The Magician leads him into a vault of alabaster; and, perceiving his wish, though he does not express it, of seeing the miraculous globe again, the courteous Fiton conducts him to it.</p>

                        <p>THE Magician displays to our Poet the various countries of the globe; particularly pointing out to him the ancient castle of Ercilla, the seat of his ancestors in Biscay, and the spot where his sove<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reign Philip the Second was soon to build his magnificent palace, the Escurial.

The Spaniards in vain attempt to sooth and to terrify the Araucanians into peace; and, finding the importance of their present post, they de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>termine to strengthen it. Ercilla proceeds with a party to the city of Imperial, to provide necessaries for this purpose.

                        <p>THE fair fugitive, whom our Poet describes as singularly beautiful, relates her story. She tells him her name is Glaura, the daughter of an opulent Chieftain, with whom she lived most happily, till a bro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther of her father's, who frequently resided with him, persecuted her with an unwarrantable passion;—that she in vain represented to him the impious nature of his love;—he persisted in his frantic attachment, and, on the appearance of a hostile party of Spaniards, rushed forth to die in her defence, intreating her to receive his departing spirit. He fell in the action; her father shared the same fate: she herself escaped at a postern gate into the woods. Two negroes, laden with spoil, discovered, and seized her. Her cries brought a young Indian, named Cariolano, to her rescue: he shot an arrow into the heart of the first russian, and stabbed the second. Glaura expressed her gratitude by receiving her young deliverer as her husband. Before they could regain a place of safety, they were alarmed by the approach of Spaniards. The generous Youth intreated Glaura to conceal herself in a tree, while he ventured to meet the enemy. In her terror she submitted to this expedient, which, on recovery from her panic, she bitterly repented; for when she issued from her retreat, she sought in vain for Cariolano, and supposed, from the clamour she had heard, that he must have perished. She continued to wander in this wretched state of mind, still unable to hear any tidings of her protector. While the fair Indian thus closes her narrative, Er<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cilla is alarmed by the approach of a large party of Barbarians. One of his faithful Indian attendants, whom he had lately attached to him,
<pb n="263" facs="262"/>
intreats him to escape with the utmost haste; adding, that he can save him from pursuit by his knowledge of the country; and that he will risque his own life most willingly, to preserve that of Ercilla. Glaura bursts into an agony of joy, in discovering her lost Cariolano in this faithful attendant. Ercilla exclaims, <q>Adieu, my friends; I give you both your liberty, which is all I have at present to bestow,</q> and rejoins his little troop. Before he enters on the account of what followed, he relates the circumstance by which he attached Cariolano to his service; whom he had found alone, as he himself was marching with a small party, and a few prisoners that he had taken. The Youth at first de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fended himself, and shot two Spaniards with his arrows, and continued to resist the numbers that pressed upon him, with his mantle and his dagger evading their blows by his extreme agility, and wounding se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veral. Ercilla generously rushed in to his rescue, and declared he. de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>served a reward for his uncommon bravery, instead of being destroyed so unfairly. The Youth, in consequence of this treatment, flung down his dagger, and became the affectionate attendant of Ercilla. Our Poet, after relating this incident, returns to the scene where his party was surprized in a hollow road, and severely galled by the enemy, who attacked them with showers of stones from the higher ground. Ercilla forces his way up the precipice, and, after dispersing part of the Indian force, effects his escape with a few followers; but all are wounded, and obliged to leave their baggage in the possession of their numerous enemies.</p>

Caupolican, who presided as judge of the combat, descends from his seat, and, finding some signs of life in each, orders them to be carried to their respective tents. They recover, and are reconciled. The Spaniards, leaving a garrison in their new fort, under a captain named Reynoso, had proceeded to the city of Imperial. Caupolican endeavours to take advantage of this event. He employs an artful Indian, named Pran, to examine the state of the fort. Pran insinuates himself among the Indian servants belonging to the Spaniards. He views the fort, and endeavours to persuade a servile Indian, named Andresillo, to admit Caupolican and his forces while the. Spaniards are sleeping.

The Senate, who are first informed of the proposal, being fearful that the chaste resolutions of their fair Sovereign may ruin their country, attempt to engage her, by a singular device, to accept the hand of Iarbas. They tell her, that this haughty Monarch has sent to demand twenty of her privy counsellors to regulate his king<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom; and that, in consideration of their age and infirmities, they must decline so unpleasant a service. The Queen represents to them the dan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ger of their refusal, and the duty which they owe to their country; declaring, that she would most readily sacrifice her own life for the safety or advantage of her subjects.

In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>voking his name, she plunges a poniard in her breast; and throws herself on a flaming pile, which had been kindled for a different sacrifice.

Alarmed by a centinel, he prepares for defence; but being soon wounded in the arm, surrenders, endeavouring to conceal his high character, and to make the Spaniards believe him an ordinary soldier.</p>

                        <p>CAUPOLICAN entreats Reynoso to grant his life, but without any signs of terror. He affirms it will be the only method of ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>peasing the sanguinary hatred by which the contending nations are inflamed; and he offers, from his great influence over his country, to in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>troduce the Christian worship, and to bring the Araucanians to consider themselves as the subjects of the Spanish Monarch. His proposals are rejected, and he is sentenced to be impaled, and shot to death with ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rows. He is unappall'd by this decree; but first desires to be publicly baptized: after which ceremony, he is inhumanly led in chains to a scaffold. He displays a calm contempt of death; but, on seeing a wretched Negro appointed his executioner, his indignation bursts forth, and he hurls the Negro from the scaffold, entreating to die by a more honourable hand. His horrid sentence is however executed. He sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ports the agonies of the stake with patient intrepidity, till a chosen band of archers put a period to his life.</p>

The Poet makes an abrupt transition from their debate, to relate the adventures of Don Garcia, with whom he was himself marching to explore new regions. The inhabitants of the districts they invade, alarmed at the approach of the Spaniards, consult on the occasion. An Indian, named Tunconabala, who had served under the Araucanians, addresses the assembly, and recommends to them a mode of eluding the supposed avaricious designs of the Spaniards, by sending messengers to them, who should assume an appearance of extreme poverty, and repre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent their country as barren, and thus induce the invaders to turn their arms towards a different quarter. He offers to engage in this service himself. The Indians adopt the project he recommends, and remove their valuable effects to the interior parts of their country.</p>

                        <p>DON GARCIA being arrived at the boundaries of Chile, which no Spaniard had passed, encourages his soldiers, in a spirited ha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rangue, to the acquisition of the new provinces which lay before them. They enter a rude and rocky country, in which they are exposed to many hazards by their deceitful guides. Tunconabala meets them, as he had projected, with the appearance of extreme poverty; and, after many assurances of the sterility of that region, advises them to return, or to advance by a different path, which he represents to them as dan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gerous, but the only practicable road. On finding them resolved to press forward, he supplies them with a guide. They advance, with great toil and danger. Their guide escapes from them. They continue their march, through various hardships, in a desolate region. They at length discover a fertile plain, and a large lake with many little inha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bited islands. As they approach the lake, a large gondola, with twelve oars, advances to meet them: the party it contained leap ashore, and salute the Spaniards with expressions of amity.</p>

                        <p>THE young Chieftain of the gondola supplies the Spaniards with provisions, refusing to accept any reward: and our Poet celebrates all the inhabitants of this region, for their amiable simplicity of man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ners. He visits one of the principal islands, where he is kindly enter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tained. He discovers that the lake had a communication with the sea, by a very rough and dangerous channel: this circumstance obliges the Spaniards, though reluctant, to return. They lament the necessity of passing again through the hardships of their former road. A young In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dian undertakes to conduct them by an easier way. But our adventu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous Ercilla, before the little army set forth on their return, engages ten chosen associates to embark with him in a small vessel, and pass the dan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gerous channel. He lands on a wild and sandy spot, and, advancing half a mile up the country, engraves a stanza, to record this adventure, on the bark of a tree. He repasses the channel, and rejoins the Spanish troops; who, after much difficulty, reach the city of Imperial. Our Poet then touches on some particulars of his personal history, which I mention in the slight sketch of his life. He afterwards promises his reader to relate the issue of the debate among the Araucanian Chieftains, on the election of their new General; but, recollecting in the instant that Spain herself is in arms, he entreats the favour of his Sovereign to inspire him with new spirit, that he may devote himself to that higher and more interesting subject.</p>

                     <pb n="276" facs="275"/>The Spanish Commentator of Camoens considers this vision as the most exquisite Sonnet of his author, and affirms that it is superior to the much longer poem of Petrarch's, on a similar idea. It may amuse a cu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rious reader to compare both Camoens and Petrarch, on this occasion, with Milton, who has also written a Sonnet on the same subject. The Commentator Faria has a very pleasant remark on this species of compo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sition. He vindicates the dignity of the amorous Sonnet, by producing an alphabetical list of two hundred great Poets, who have thus compli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mented the object of their affection; and he very gravely introduces Achilles as the leader of this choir, for having celebrated Briseis. If the Sonnets of the Portugueze Poet are worthy of attention, his Elegies are perhaps still more so, as they illustrate many particulars of his interest<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing life, which ended in 1579, under the most cruel circumstances of neglect and poverty.</p>
                  <p>Portugal has produced no less than fourteen Epic poems; twelve in

The Malaca Conquistada of Francisco de Sa' de Menesis—and the Ulyssea, or Lisboa Edificada, of Gabriel Pereira de Castro, are two of the most eminent among its successors.— For a list of the Portugueze Epic Poets, and for an elegant copy of the Malaca Conquistada, I am indebted to the very liberal politeness of the Chevalier de Pinto, the Ambassador of Portugal.</p>

                  <p>Before the appearance of Bossu's celebrated treatise on Epic poetry, the French had a similar work written in Latin. The learned Jesuit Mambrun published, in 1652, a quarto volume, entitled, Dissertatio Peripatetica de Epico Carmine. His Dissertation is founded on the principles of Aristotle, whom he considers as infallible authority; and he introduces the Greek Philosopher to de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cide the following very curious question, which he argues with becom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing gravity, Whether the action of a woman can be sufficiently splendid to prove a proper subject for an Epic poem.—Having reasoned on this delicate point, with more learning than gallantry, he thus concludes the debate: Congruenter magis finem huic quaestioni ponere non licet, quam verbis Aristotelis capite 15 Poeticae, ubi de moribus disputat, <gap rend="content:〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉">
                        <desc>foreign</desc>

The latter interpretation of the word <gap rend="content:〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉">
                        <desc>foreign</desc>
                     </gap> would render the decision of these Phi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>losophers very severe indeed on the Female character, by supposing it in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>capable of displaying both fortitude and prudence.—The Fair Sex have found an advocate, on this occasion, in a French Epic Poet. The famous Chapelain, in the preface to his unfortunate Pucelle, has very warmly attacked these ungallant maxims of Mambrun and Aristotle. In speak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing of certain critics, who had censured the choice of his subject, before the publication of his poem, he says, Ceux-cy, jurant sur le texte d'A<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ristote,

Ils n'estiment ce Sexe capable d'au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cune pensée heroique, dans la creance que l'esprit suit le temperament du corps, et que, dans le corps de la femme, l'esprit ne peut rien conce<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>voir, qui ne se sente de sa foiblesse. — Ces Messieurs me pardon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neront, toutefois, si je leur dis qu'ils ne considerent pas trop bien quelle est la nature de la vertu heroique, qu'ils en definissent l'essence, par un de ses moindres accidens, et qu'ils en font plutost une vertu brutale, qu'une vertu divine.— Ils se devroient souvenir que cette vertu n'a presque rien à faire avec le corps, et qu'elle consiste, non dans les efforts d'un Milon de Crotone, où l'esprit n'a aucune part, mais en ceux des ames nées pour les grandes choses; quand par une ardeur plusqu' hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>maine, elles s'elevent audessus d'elles-mesmes; qu'elles forment quelque dessein, dont l'utilité est aussi grande que la difficulté, et qu'elles choi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sissent les moyens de l'executer avec constance et hauteur de courage. Pour prevenus qu'ils soient en faveurs des hommes, je ne pense pas qu'ils voulussent attribuer à leur ame un seul avantage, auquel l'ame de la femme ne pust aspirer, ni faire deux especes des deux sexes, desquels la raison de tous les sages n'a fait qu'une jusqu'icy—je ne croy pas non plus qu'ils imaginent que les vertus morales ayent leur siege ailleurs, que dans la volonté, ou dans l'entendement. Mais si elles y ont leur siege, et si l'on ne peut dire que ces deux facultés soient autres, dans l'ame de la femme que dans l'ame de l'homme, ils ne peuvent, sans absurdité, accorder une de ces vertus à l' homme, et ne l' accorder pas à la femme. En effet, cette belle pensée d'Aristote qui a donné occasion à leur erreur, est si peu physique, qu'elle fait plus de tort à la philosophie du Lycée, qu'elle n'appuye l'opinion de ceux que nous combattons." Chapelain then enters into an historical defence of Female dignity, and opposes the authority of Plato to that of Aristotle, concerning the propriety of woman's ever appearing on the great theatre of active life. Happy had he sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ported
<pb n="280" facs="279"/>
the Female cause as forcibly, in the execution of his poem, as in the arguments of his preface: but Chapelain was unfortunately one of the many examples, which every country affords, that the most perfect union of virtue and erudition is utterly insufficient to form a Poet; and, as he had the ill fate to be persecuted by the pitiless rigour of Boileau, his inharmonious poem can never sink into a desirable oblivion. The treatise of Mambrun seems to have excited, among the French, an eager<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness to distinguish themselves in the field of Epic poetry; for several Epic poems were published in France in a few years after that work appeared; but most of them, and particularly those on scriptural sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jects, were hardly ever known to exist.</p>

The Satirist being asked, why he had never mentioned the poetry of Le Moine? replied with the two following verses, parodied from Corneille,
<q>
                        <l>Il s'est trop élevé pour en dire du mal,</l>
                        <l>Il s'est trop égaré pour en dire du bien.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>The judicious and candid Heyne has bestowed considerable applause on Le Moine, in one of his notes to the 6th book of Virgil, where he examines the different methods by which the Epic Poets have introduced their various pictures of futurity. From his account, Le Moine excels in this article. I can speak only from the opinion of this learned Critic, for the neglected French Poet is become so rare, that I have sought in vain for a copy of his work.—The number of obscure Epic writers in France is very trifling, compared to those which Italy has produced; the Italians have been indefatigable in this species of composition, and, as if they had resolved to leave no Hero unsung, their celebrated Novelist, Giraldi

                  <q>Keen Boileau shall not want his proper praise.</q>
                  <p>Nicolas Boileau Des<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>preaux was born <hi>in</hi> or <hi>near</hi> Paris, for it is a contested point, on the first of November 1636, and died in March 1711 of a dropsy, the very dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ease which terminated the life of his English rival. The Lutrin of Boileau, still considered by some French Critics of the present time as the best poem to which France has given birth, was first published in 1674. It is with great reason and justice that Voltaire confesses the Lutrin inferior to the Rape of the Lock. Few Poets can be so properly compared as Pope and Boileau; and, wherever their writings will admit of comparison, we may, without any national partiality, adjudge the superiority to the English Bard. These two great authors resembled each other as much in the integrity of their lives, as in the subjects and execution of their several compositions. There are two actions recorded of Boileau, which sufficiently prove that the inexorable Satirist had a most generous and friendly heart; when Patru, the celebrated Advocate, who was ruined by his passion for literature, found himself under the painful necessity of selling his expensive library, and had almost agreed to part with it for a moderate sum, Boileau gave him a much superior price; and, after paying the money, added this condition to the pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chase, that Patru should retain, during his life, the possession of the books. The succeeding instance of the Poet's generosity is yet nobler:— when it was rumoured at court that the King intended to retrench the pension of Corneille, Boileau hastened to Madame de Montespan, and said, that his Sovereign, equitable as he was, could not, without injus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tice, grant a pension to an author like himself, just ascending Parnassus, and take it from Corneille, who had so long been seated on the summit; that he entreated her, for the honour of the King, to prevail on his Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jesty rather to strike off <hi>his</hi> pension, than to withdraw that reward from a man whose title to it was incomparably greater; and that he should more easily console himself under the loss of that distinction, than un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der the affliction of seeing it taken away from such a Poet as Corneille. This magnanimous application had the success which it deserved, and it
<pb n="282" facs="281"/>
appears the more noble, when we recollect that the rival of Corneille was the intimate friend of Boileau.</p>
                  <p>The long and unreserved intercourse which subsisted between our Poet and Racine was highly beneficial and honourable to both. The dying farewell of the latter is the most expressive eulogy on the private character of Boileau: Je regarde comme un bonheur pour moi de mourir avant vous, said the tender Racine, in taking a final leave of his faithful and generous friend.</p>

                  <p>Though the Henriade has been frequently reprinted, and the partizans of Voltaire have endeavoured to make it a national point of honour to support its reputation, it seems at length to be sinking under that neglect and oblivion, which never fail to overtake every feeble offspring of the Epic Muse. Several of our most eminent Critics have attacked this performance with peculiar seve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity, and some have condemned it on the most opposite principles, merely because it does not coincide with their respective systems. Their sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tence has been passed only in short and incidental remarks; but a French writer, inflamed by personal animosity against Voltaire, has raised three octavo volumes on the defects of this single poem. Mr. Clement, in his <hi>"Entretiens sur le Poeme Epique relativement à la Henriade,"</hi> has endeavoured to prove it utterly deficient in all the essential points of Epic poetry;—in the structure of its general plan, in the conduct of its va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rious parts, in sentiment, in character, in style. His work indeed dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plays an acrimonious detestation of the Poet whom he examines; and perhaps there is hardly any human composition which could support the scrutiny of so rigid an inquisitor: the Henriade is utterly unequal to it; for in many articles we are obliged to confess, that the justice of the Cri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tic is not inferior to his severity. He discovers, in his dissection of the
<pb n="284" facs="283"/>
Poem, the skill of an anatomist, with the malignity of an assassin. If any thing can deserve such rigorous treatment, it is certainly the artifice of Voltaire, who, in his Essay on Epic Poetry, has attempted, with much ingenuity, to sink the reputation of all the great Epic Writers, that he might raise himself to their level; an attempt in which no au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thor can ultimately succeed; for, as D'Alembert has admirably remarked on a different occasion, Le public laissera l'amour propre de chaque ecrivain faire son plaidoyer, rira de leurs efforts, non de genie, mais de raisonnement, pour hausser leur place, et finira par mettre chacun à la sienne.</p>

                  <q>And, shrouded in a mist of moral spleen.]</q>
                  <p>It seems to be the peculiar infelicity of Pope, that his moral virtues have had a tendency to diminish his poetical reputation. Possessing a benevolent spirit, and wishing to make the art, to which he devoted his life, as serviceable as he could to the great interests of mankind, he soon quitted the higher regions of poetry, for the more level, and more frequented field of Ethics and of Satire. He declares, with a noble pride arising from the probity of his intention,
<q>
                        <l>That not in Fancy's maze he wander'd long,</l>
                        <l>But stoop'd to truth, and moraliz'd his song.</l>
                     </q>
The severity of Criticism has from hence inferred, that his imagination was inferior to the other faculties of his mind, and that he possessed not that vigour of genius which might enable him to rank with our more sublime and pathetic Bards. This inference appears to me extremely defective both in candour and in reason; it would surely be more gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous, and I will venture to add, more just, to assign very different causes for his having latterly applied himself to moral and satyric composition. If his preceding poems displayed only a moderate portion of fancy and of tenderness, we might indeed very fairly conjecture, that he quitted the kind of poetry, where these qualities are particularly required, because Nature directed him to shine only as the Poet of reason.—But his earlier productions will authorize an opposite conclusion. At an age when few authors have produced any capital work, Pope gave the world two poems;
<pb n="285" facs="284"/>
one the offspring of imagination, and the other of sensibility, which will ever stand at the head of the two poetical classes to which they belong: his Rape of the Lock, and his Eloise, have nothing to fear from any ri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vals, either of past or of future time. When a writer has displayed such early proofs of exquisite fancy, and of tender enthusiasm, those great constituents of the real Poet, ought we not to regret that he did not give a greater scope and freer exercise to these qualities, rather than to assert that he did not possess them in a superlative degree? Why then, it may be asked, did he confine himself to compositions in which these have little share? The life and character of Pope will perfectly explain the reasons, why he did not always follow the higher suggestions of his own natural genius. He had entertained an opinion, that by stooping to truth, and employing his talents on the vices and follies of the passing time, he should be most able to benefit mankind. The idea was perhaps ill-founded, but his conduct in consequence of it was certainly noble. Its effects however were most unhappy; for it took from him all his enjoy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment of life, and may injure, in some degree, his immortal reputation: by suffering his thoughts to dwell too much on knaves and fools, he fell into the splenetic delusion, that the world is nothing but a compound of vice and folly; and from hence he has been reproached for supposing that all human merit was confined to himself, and to a few of his most inti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mate correspondents.</p>
                  <p>There was an amiable peculiarity in the character of Pope, which had great influence both on his conduct and composition—he embraced the sentiments of those he loved with a kind of superstitious regard; his imagination and his judgment were perpetually the dupes of an affec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tionate heart: it was this which led him, at the request of his idol Bo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lingbroke, to write a sublime poem on metaphysical ideas which he did not perfectly comprehend; it was this which urged him almost to quar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rel with Mr. Allen, in compliance with the caprices of a female friend; it was this which induced him, in the warmth of gratitude, to follow the absurd hints of Warburton with all the blindness of infatuated af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fection. Whoever examines the life and writings of Pope with a mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nute and unprejudiced attention, will find that his excellencies, both as a Poet and a Man, were peculiarly his own; and that his failings were chiefly owing to the ill judgment, or the artifice, of his real and pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tended
<pb n="286" facs="285"/>
friends. The lavish applause and the advice of his favourite Atterbury, was perhaps the cause of his preserving the famous character of Addison, which, finely written as it is, all the lovers of Pope must wish him to have suppressed. Few of his friends had integrity or frank<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness sufficient to persuade him, that his satires would, destroy the tran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quillity of his life, and cloud the lustre of his fame: yet, to the honour of Lyttelton, be it remembered, that he suggested such ideas to the Poet, in the verses which he wrote to him from Rome, with all the becoming zeal of enlightened friendship:
<q>
                        <l>No more let meaner Satire dim the rays</l>
                        <l>That flow majestic from thy nobler bays!</l>
                        <l>In all the flowery paths of Pindus stray,</l>
                        <l>But shun that thorny, that unpleasing way!</l>
                        <l>Nor, when each soft, engaging Muse is thine,</l>
                        <l>Address the least attractive of the Nine!</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This generous admonition did not indeed produce its intended effect, for other counsellors had given a different bias to the mind of the Poet, and the malignity of his enemies had exasperated his temper; yet he af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terwards turned his thoughts towards the composition of a national Epic poem, and possibly in consequence of the hint which this Epistle of Lyt<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>telton contains. The intention was formed too late, for it arose in his decline of life. Had he possessed health and leisure to execute such a work, I am persuaded it would have proved a glorious acquisition to the literature of our country: the subject indeed which he had chosen must be allowed to have an unpromising appearance; but the opinion of Addi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son concerning his Sylphs, which was surely honest, and not invidious, may teach us hardly ever to decide against the intended works of a su<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perior genius. Yet in all the Arts, we are perpetually tempted to pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nounce such decisions. I have frequently condemned subjects which my friend Romney had selected for the pencil; but in the sequel, my opinion only proved that I was near-sighted in those regions of imagina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, where his keener eyes commanded all the prospect.</p>

                  <p>For the advice which I have thus ventured to give such of my fair readers as have a talent for poetry, I shall produce them a much higher poetical authority.

In her doubts on this point, she consulted the celebrated Poet of her country in an elegant Sonnet; and received his answer on the inte<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>resting subject in the same poetical form.

                  <p>Ariosto is said to have been publicly crowned with laurel at Mantua, by the Emperor Charles the Vth, towards the end of the year 1532. This fact has been disputed by various writers, but it seems to be sufficiently established by the researches of Mazzuchelli.</p>
                  <p>The custom of crowning Poets with laurel is almost as ancient as poetry itself, says the Abbé du Resnel, in his Recherches sur les Poetes couron<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nez, a work which contains but scanty information on this curious topic. Petrarch is generally supposed to have revived this ancient solemnity, which had been abolished as a pagan institution in the reign of the Em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>peror Theodosius. It appears however, from two passages in the writings of Boccacio, that Dante had entertained serious thoughts of this honour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able distinction, which his exile precluded him from receiving, as he chose, says his Biographer, to be crown'd only in his native city.</p>
                  <p>An amusing volume might be written on the honours which have been paid to Poets in different ages, and in various parts of the world. It is remarkable, that the most unpolished nations have been the most lavish in rewarding their Bards. There are two instances on record, in which poe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tical talents have raised their possessors even to sovereign dominion.

                  <q>For him her fountains gush with golden streams.]</q>
                  <p>Of the great wealth which flowed into the hands of this extraordinary Poet, his friend and biographer Montalvan has given a particular account. This author con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cludes that Lope de Vega gained by his dramatic works alone a sum nearly equal to 20,000 pounds sterling; the revenue arising from the posts he held, and from his pension, was very considerable. His opu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lence was much encreased by the most splendid instances of private libe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rality. He received many costly presents from various characters to whom he was personally unknown; and he was himself heard to say, in speaking of his generous patron, that the Duke of Sessa alone had given him, at different periods of his life, sums almost amounting to six thou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sand pounds.</p>
                  <p>It must be confessed, that the noble patrons of English poetry have not equalled this example of Spanish munificence, even if we admit, the truth of our traditionary anecdotes concerning the generosity of Lord South<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ampton to Shakespeare, and of Sir Philip Sidney to Spenser. Consider<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the liberality for which our nation is so justly celebrated, it is re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>markable, that not a single English Poet appears to have been enriched by our monarchs: yet Spenser had every claim to the bounty of Elizabeth; he sung her praises in a strain which might gratify her pride; and of all who have flattered the great, he may justly be considered as the most worthy of reward. His song was the tribute of his heart as well as of his fancy, and the sex of his idol may be said to purify his incense from all the offensive particles of servile adulation. The neglect which he ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perienced from the vain, imperious, and ungrateful Elizabeth, appears the more striking, when we recollect, that her lovely rival, the beautiful and unfortunate Queen of Scots, signalized her superior generosity by a magnificent present of plate to the French Poet Ronsard. This neglected Bard was once the darling of France, and perhaps equalled Lope de Vega in the honours which he received: his sovereign, Charles the Ninth, composed some elegant verses in his praise, and the city of Toulouse pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sented him with a Minerva of massive silver.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="292" facs="291"/>If our princes and nobles have not equalled those of other kingdoms in liberality to the great Poets of their country, England may yet boast the name of a private gentleman, who discovered in this respect a most princely spirit; no nation, either ancient or modern, can produce an ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ample of munificence more truly noble than the annual gratuity which Akenside received from Mr. Dyson; a tribute of generous and affectionate admiration, endeared to its worthy possessor by every consideration which could make it honourable both to himself and to his patron!</p>
                  <p>It has been lately lamented by an elegant and accomplished writer, who had too much reason for the complaint, that

In almost every modern author who has touched, how<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever slightly, on Epic poetry, we may find at least some part of the following sentence from Petronius Arbiter:—Ecce, Belli civilis ingens opus quisquis attigerit, nisi plenus litteris, sub onere labetur. Non enim res gestae versibus comprehendendae sunt, quod longe melius historici fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciunt; sed per ambages, deorumque ministeria, &amp; fabulosum sententi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>arum tormentum praecipitandus est liber spiritus; ut potius furentis animi vaticinatio appareat, quam religiosae orationis sub testibus fides.</p>
                  <p>These remarks on the necessity of celestial agents, were evidently, made to depreciate the Pharsalia of Lucan; and Petronius may be called a fair Critic, as Pope said of Milbourne, on his opposition to Dryden, because he produces his own poetry in contrast to that which he con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>demns. His specimen of the manner in which he thought an Epic poem should be conducted, sufficiently proves the absurdity of his cri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticism;
<pb n="294" facs="293"/>
for how insipid is the fable in those verses which he has opposed to the Pharsalia, when compared to the first book of Lucan! Yet the Epic composition of Petronius has not wanted admirers: a Dutch Commentator is bold enough to say, that he prefers this single rhapsody to three hundred volumes of such poetry as Lucan's: an opinion which can only lead us to exclaim with Boileau,
<q>Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l'admire.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If men of letters, in the age of Lucan, differed in their sentiments concerning machinery, the great changes that have since happened in the world, and the disquisitions which have appeared on the subject, are very far from having reconciled the judgment of modern writers on this important article. Two eminent Critics of the present time have delivered opinions on this topic so singularly opposite to each other, that I shall transcribe them both.</p>
                  <q>In a theatrical entertainment, which employs both the eye and the ear, it would be a gross absurdity to introduce upon the stage superior Beings in a visible shape. There is not place for such objection in an Epic poem; and Boileau, with many other Critics, declares strongly for that fort of machinery in an Epic poem. But waving authority, which is apt to impose upon the judgment, let us draw what light we can from reason. I begin with a preliminary remark, that this mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter is but indistinctly handled by Critics, The poetical privilege of animating insensible objects for enlivening a description, is very differ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ent from what is termed <hi>machinery,</hi> where deities, angels, devils, or other supernatural powers, are introduced as real personages, mixing in the action, and contributing to the catastrophe; and yet these two things are constantly jumbled together in the reasoning. The former is founded on a natural principle; but can the latter claim the same authority? So far from it, that nothing is more unnatural. Its effects at the same time are deplorable. First, it gives an air of fiction to the whole, and prevents that impression of reality which is requisite to interest our affections, and to move our passions; which of itself is sufficient to explode machinery, whatever entertainment it may afford to readers of a fantastic taste or irregular imagination.
<pb n="295" facs="294"/>
And next, were it possible, by disguising the fiction, to delude us into a notion of reality, which I think can hardly be, an insuperable objec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion would still remain, which is, that the aim or end of an Epic poem can never be attained in any perfection where machinery is in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>troduced; for an evident reason, that virtuous emotions cannot be raised successfully, but by the actions of those who are endued with passions and affections like our own, that is, by human actions: and as for moral instruction, it is clear that none can be drawn from Beings who act not upon the same principles with us. Homer, it is true, introduces the Gods into his fable; but the religion of his coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try authorized that liberty; it being an article in the Grecian creed, that the Gods often interpose visibly and bodily in human affairs. I must, however, observe, that Homer's Deities do no honour to his poems. Fictions that transgress the bounds of nature seldom have a good effect; they may inflame the imagination for a moment, but will not be relished by any person of a correct taste. They may be of some use to the lower rank of writers; but an author of genius has much finer materials of nature's production for elevating his subject, and making it interesting.—Voltaire, in his Essay upon Epic Poetry, talking of the Pharsalia, observes judiciously, that the proximity of time, the notoriety of events, the character of the age, enlightened and Political, joined with the solidity of Lucan's subject, deprived him of all liberty of poetical fiction. Is it not amazing, that a Critic who reasons so justly with respect to others, can be so blind with respect to himself? Voltaire, not satisfied to enrich his language with images drawn from invisible and superior Beings, introduces them into the action. In the sixth canto of the Henriade, St. Louis appears in person, and terrifies the soldiers; in the seventh canto, St. Louis sends the God of Sleep to Henry; and in the tenth, the demons of Discord, Fanaticism, War, &amp;c. assist Aumale in a single combat with Turenne, and are driven away by a good angel brandishing the sword of God. To blend such fictitious personages in the same action with. mortals, makes a bad figure at any rate, and is intolerable in a history so recent as that of Henry IV. This singly is sufficient to make the Henriade a short-lived poem, were it otherwise possessed of every beauty.

                     <pb n="296" facs="295"/>The Pagan Gods and Gothic Fairies were equally out of credit when Milton wrote. He did well therefore to supply their room with An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gels and Devils. If these too should wear out of the popular creed (and they seem in a hopeful way, from the liberty some late Critics have taken with them) I know not what other expedients the Epic Poet might have recourse to; but this I know—the pomp of verse, the energy of description, and even the finest moral paintings, would stand him in no stead. Without <hi>admiration</hi> (which cannot be effected but by the marvellous of celestial intervention, I mean the agency of su<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perior natures really existing, or by the illusion of the fancy taken to be so) no Epic poem can be long-lived. I am not afraid to instance in the Henriade itself, which, notwithstanding the elegance of the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position, will in a short time be no more read than the Gondibert of Sir W. Davenant, and for the same reason.

                  <p>I have thus ventured to confront these eminent critical antagonists, that, while they engage and overthrow each other, we may observe the injustice produced by the spirit of systematical criticism, even in authors most respectable for their talents and erudition.—Here is the unfortunate Voltaire placed between two critical fires, which equally destroy him. The <hi>first</hi> Critic asserts that the Henriade must be short-lived, because the Poet <hi>has introduced invisible and superior agents</hi>;—the <hi>second</hi> denounces the same fate against it, because <hi>it wants</hi> the <hi>agency of superior natures:</hi> yet surely every reader of poetry, who is not influenced by any particular system, will readily allow, that if Voltaire had treated his subject with true Epic spirit in all other points, neither the introduction nor the absence of St. Louis could be singly sufficient to plunge the Henriade in oblivion. Indeed the learned author, who has spoken in so peremptory a manner concerning the necessity of supernatural agents to preserve the existence of an Epic poem, appears rather unfortunate in the two exam<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ples by which he endeavours to support his doctrine; for the Epic poems both of Davenant and Voltaire have sufficient defects to account for any neglect which may be their lot, without considering the article of Machinery.</p>
                  <p>If I have warmly opposed any decisions of this exalted Critic, it is
<pb n="297" facs="296"/>
from a persuasion (in which I may perhaps be mistaken) that <hi>some</hi> of his maxims have a strong tendency to injure an art highly dear to us both; an art on which his genius and learning have cast <hi>many</hi> rays of pleasing and of useful light.</p>

                  <p>The Indian mythology, as it has lately been illustrated in the writings of Mr. Holwell, is finely calculated to answer the purpose of any poetical genius who may wish to introduce new machinery into the serious Epic Poem. Besides the powerful charm of novelty, it would have the advantage of not clashing with our national religion; for the endeavours of Mr. Holwell to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>concile the ancient and pure doctrine of Bramah with the dispensation of Christ, have so far succeeded, that if his system does not satisfy a theo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>logist, it certainly affords a sufficient basis for the structure of a Poet. In perusing his account of the Indian scripture, every reader of imagina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion may, I think, perceive, that the Shastah might supply a poetical spirit with as rich a mass of ideal treasure as fancy could with to work upon.—An Epic Poet, desirous of laying the scene of his action in India, would be more embarrassed to find interesting Heroes than proper Divi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nities. —Had justice and generosity inspired and guided that English valour, which has signalized itself on the plains of Indostan; had the arms of our country been employed to deliver the native Indians from the oppressive usurpation of the Mahometan powers; such exploits would present to the Epic Muse a subject truly noble, and the mytholo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gy of the East might enrich it with the most splendid decorations. Whether it be possible or not to find such a subject in the records of our Indian history, I leave the reader to determine.—Our great Historian of the Roman empire has intimated, in a note to the first volume of his immortal work, that
<q>the wonderful expedition of Odin, which deduces
<pb n="298" facs="297"/>
the enmity of the Goths and Romans from so memorable a cause, might supply the noble ground-work of an Epic poem.</q>
The idea is cer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tainly both just and splendid. Had Gray been ever tempted to engage in such a work, he would probably have convinced us, that the Northern mythology has still sufficient power to seize and enchant the imagina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, as much in Epic as in Lyric composition.</p>
                  <p>It may amuse our speculative Critics, to consider how far the <hi>religious Gothic fables</hi> should be introduced or rejected, to render such a per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formance most interesting to a modern reader. Few judges would agree in their sentiments on the question; and perhaps the great dispute con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerning Machinery cannot be fairly adjusted, till some happy genius shall possess ambition and perseverance enough to execute two Epic poems, in the one adopting, and in the other rejecting, supernatural agents; for Reason alone is by no means an infallible conductor in the province of Fancy; and in the poetical as well as the philosophical world, experi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment is the surest guide to truth.</p>
