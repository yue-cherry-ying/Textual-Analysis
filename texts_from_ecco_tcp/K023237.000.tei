         <head>DISCOURSE, &amp;c.</head>
         <p>RELIGION has two principal enemies, Fanaticism and Infidelity, or that which is called Atheism. The first requires to be combated by reason and morality, the other by natural philosophy.</p>
         <p>THE existence of a God is the first dogma of the Theophilanthropists. It is upon this subject that I solicit your attention: for though it has been often treated of, and that most su<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blimely, the subject is inexhaustible; and there will always remain something to be said that has not been before advanced. I go therefore to open the subject, and to crave your atten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion to the end.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="6" facs="4"/>THE universe is the bible of a true Theo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>philanthropist. It is there that he reads of God. It is there that the proofs of his exist<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence are to be sought and to be found. As to written or printed books, by whatever name they are called, they are the works of man's hands, and carry no evidence in themselves that God is the author of any of them. It must be in something that man could not make, that we must seek evidence for our belief, and that something is the universe; the true bible; the inimitable word of God.</p>
         <p>CONTEMPLATING the universe, the whole system of creation, in this point of light, we shall discover, that all that which is called natural philosophy is properly a divine study—It is the study of God through his works—It is the best study, by which we can arrive at a knowledge of his existence, and the only one by which we can gain a glimpse of his per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fection.</p>
         <p>DO we want to contemplate his power? we see it in the immensity of the Creation. Do we want to contemplate his wisdom? We see it in the unchangeable order by which the incomprehensible WHOLE is governed. Do we want to contemplate his munificence? We see
<pb n="7" facs="5"/>it in the abundance with which he fills the earth. Do we want to contemplate his mercy? We see it in his not withholding that abundance even from the unthankful. In fine, do we want to know what God is? Search not written or printed books, but the Scripture called the <hi>Creation.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>IT has been the error of the schools to teach astronomy, and all the other sciences, and subjects of natural philosophy, as accom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plishments only; whereas they should be taught theologically, or with reference to the Being who is the author of them; for all the prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciples of science are of Divine origin. Man cannot make, or invent, or contrive principles. He can only discover them; and he ought to look through the discovery to the author.</p>
         <p>WHEN we examine an extraordinary piece of machinery, an astonishing pile of architecture, a well executed statue, or an highly finished painting, where life and action are imitated, and habit only prevents our mistaking a surface of light and shade for cubical solidity, our ideas are naturally led to think of the extensive genius and talents of the artist. When we study elements of geometry, we think of Eu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clid. When we speak of gravitation, we think
<pb n="8" facs="6"/>of Newton. How then is it that when we study the works of God in the Creation, we stop short, and do not think of God? It is from the error of the schools in having taught those subjects as accomplishments only, and thereby separated the study of them from the Being who is the author of them.</p>
         <p>THE schools have made the study of theology to consist in the study of opinions in written or printed books; whereas theology should be studied in the works or books of the creation, The study of theology in books or opinions has often produced fanaticism, rancour, and cruelty of temper; and from hence have proceeded the numerous persecutions, the fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>natical quarrels, the religious burnings and massacres, that have desolated Europe. But the study of theology in the works of the cre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ation produces a direct contrary effect. The mind becomes at once enlightened and serene; a copy of the scene it beholds; information and adoration go hand in hand; and all the social faculties become enlarged.</p>
         <p>THE evil that has resulted from the error of the schools, in teaching natural philosophy as an accomplishment only, has been that of generating in the pupils a species of Atheism.
<pb n="9" facs="7"/>Instead of looking through the works of Creation to the Creator himself, they stop short, and employ <gap resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word" rend="content:〈◊〉">
               <desc>illegible</desc>
            </gap> knowledge they acquire to create doubts of his existence. They labour, with studied ingenuity, to ascribe every thing they behold to innate properties of matter, and jump over all the rest, by saying, that matter is eternal.</p>
         <p>LET us examine this subject; it is worth examining; for if we follow it through all its cases, the result will be, that the existence of a superior cause, or that which man calls God, will be discoverable by philosophical prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciples.</p>
         <p>IN the first place, admitting matter to have properties, as we see it has, the question still remains, how came matter by those proper<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties? To this they will answer, that matter possessed those properties eternally. This is not solution, but assertion; and to deny it is equally as impossble of proof as to assert it. It is then necessary to go further, and therefore I say,—if there exist a circumstance that is not a property of matter, and without which the universe, or to speak in a limited degree, the solar system, composed of planets and a sun, could not exist a moment; all the arguments
<pb n="10" facs="8"/>of Atheism, drawn from properties of matter, and applied to account for the universe, will be overthrown, and the existence of a superior cause, or that which man calls God, becomes discoverable, as is before said, by natural phi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>losophy.</p>
         <p>I go now to shew that such a circumstance exists, and what it is.</p>
         <p>THE universe is composed of matter, and, as a system, is sustained by motion. Motion is <hi>not a property</hi> of matter, and without this motion the solar system could not exist. Were motion a property of matter, that undiscovered and undiscoverable thing, called perpetual mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, would establish itself. It is because motion is not a property of matter, that perpetual motion is an impossibility in the hand of every being but that of the Creator of motion. When the pretenders to Atheism can produce perpe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tual motion, and not till then, they may expect to be credited.</p>
         <p>THE natural state of matter, as to place, is a state of rest. Motion, or change of place, is the effect of an external cause acting upon matter. As to that faculty of matter, that is called gravitation, it is the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fluence
<pb n="11" facs="9"/>which two or more bodies have reci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>procally on each other to unite and be at rest. Every thing which has hitherto been discovered with respect to the motion of the planets in the system, relates only to the laws by which motion acts, and not to the cause of motion. Gravitation, so far from being the cause of motion to the planets that compose the solar system, would be the destruction of the solar system, were revolutionary motions to cease; for as the action of spinning upholds a top, the revolutionary motion upholds the planets in their orbits, and prevents them from gravi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tating and forming one mass with the sun. In one sense of the word, philosophy knows, and atheism, says, that matter is in perpetual mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion. But the motion here meant refers to the <hi>state</hi> of matter, and that only on the surface of the earth. It is either decomposition, which is continually destroying the form of bodies of matter, or recomposition, which renews that matter in the same or another form, as the de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>composition of animal or vegetable substances enter into the composition of other bodies. But the motion that upholds the solar system is of an entire different kind, and is not a property of matter. It operates also to an entire different effect. It operates to <hi>perpetual preservation,</hi> and to prevent <hi>any change</hi> in the state of the system.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="12" facs="10"/>GIVING then to matter all the properties which philosophy knows it has, or all that atheism ascribes to it, and can prove, and even supposing matter to be eternal, it will not ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count for the system of the universe or of the solar system, because it will not account for mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, and it is motion that preserves it. When, therefore, we discover a circumstance of such immense importance, that without it the uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verse could not exist, and for which neither matter, nor any, nor all, the properties of mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter can account, we are by necessity forced into the rational and comfortable belief of the exist<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence of a cause superior to matter, and that cause man calls, GOD.</p>
         <p>AS to that which is called nature, it is no other than the laws by which motion and action of every kind, with respect to unintelligible matter, is regulated. And when we speak of looking through nature up to nature's God, we speak philosophically the same rational language as when we speak of looking through human law up to the power that ordained them.</p>
         <p>GOD is the power or first cause, nature is the law, and matter is the subject acted upon.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="13" facs="11"/>BUT infidelity by ascribing every phaeno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mena to properties of matter, conceives a system for which it cannot account, and yet it pretends to demonstration. It reasons from what it sees on the surface of the earth, but it does not carry itself on the solar system existing by mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion. It sees upon the surface a perpetual de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>composition and recomposition of matter. It sees that an oak produces an acorn, an acorn an oak, a bird an egg, an egg a bird, and so on. In things of this kind it sees something which it calls a natural cause, but none of the causes it sees is the cause of that motion which preserves the solar system.</p>
         <p>LET us contemplate this wonderful and stupendous system consisting of matter and ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>isting by motion. It is not matter in a state of rest, nor in a state of decomposition or re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>composition. It is matter systematized in per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>petual orbicular or circular motion. As a system that motion is the life of it: as anima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion is life to an animal body, deprive the system of motion, and, as a system it must expire. Who then breathed into the system the life of motion? What power impelled the planets to move since motion is not a property of the matter of which they are composed? If we contemplate the immense velocity of
<pb n="14" facs="12"/>this motion, our wonder becomes increased, and our adoration enlarges itself in the same proportion. To instance only one of the pla<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nets, that of the earth we inhabit, its distance from the sun, the centre of the orbits of all the planets, is, according to observations of the transit of the planet Venus, about one hundred million miles, consequently the diameter of the orbit or circle in which the earth moves round the sun is double that distance; and the measure of the circumference of the orbit, taken as three times its diameter, is six hundred million miles. The earth performs this voyage in 365 days and some hours, and consequently moves at the rate of more than one million six hundred thousand miles every twenty-four hours.</p>
         <p>WHERE will infidelity, where will atheism, find cause for this astonishing velocity of mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, never ceasing, never varying, and which is the preservation of the earth in its orbit? It is not by reasoning from an acorn to an oak, from an egg to a bird, or from any change in the state of matter on the surface of the earth, that this can be accounted for. Its cause is not to be found in matter, nor in any thing we call nature. The atheist who affects to reason, and the fanatic who rejects reason, plunge them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves
<pb n="15" facs="13"/>alike into inextricable difficulties. The one perverts the sublime and enlightening study of natural philosophy into a deformity of ab<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>surdities by not reasoning to the end. The other loses himself in the obscurity of metaphy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sical theories, and dishonours the Creator, by treating the study of his works with contempt. The one is a half-rational of whom there is some hope, the other a visionary to whom we must be charitable.</p>
         <p>WHEN at first thought we think of a Cre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ator, our ideas appear to us undefined and confused; but if we reason philosophically, those ideas can be easily arranged and simplified. <hi>It is a Being, whose power is equal to his will.</hi> Ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serve the nature of the will of man. It is of an infinite quality. We cannot conceive the possibility of limits to the will. Observe, on the other hand, how exceedingly limited is his power of acting compared with the nature of his will. Suppose the power equal to the will, and man would be a God. He would will himself eternal, and be so. He could will a creation, and could make it. In this pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gressive reasoning, we see, in the nature of the will of man, half of that which we conceive in thinking of God, add the other half and we have the whole idea of a being who could make
<pb n="16" facs="14"/>the universe, and sustain it by perpetual mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion; because he could create that motion.</p>
         <p>WE know nothing of the capacity of the will of animals; but we know a great deal of the difference of their powers. For example, how numerous are the degrees, and how im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mense is the difference of power, from a mite to a man. Since then every thing we see below us shews a progression of power, where is the difficulty in supposing that there is at the <hi>summit of all things,</hi> a Being, in whom an infinity of power unites with the infinity of the will. When this simple idea presents itself to our mind, we have the idea of a perfect being that man calls God.</p>
         <p>IT is comfortable to live under the belief of the existence of an infinitely protecting power; and it is an addition to that comfort to know, that such a belief is not a mere conceit of the imagi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nation, as many of the theories that are called religious are; nor a belief founded only on tra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dition or received opinion, but is a belief dedu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cible by the action of reason upon the things that compose the system of the universe; a belief arising out of visible facts, and so demonstra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble is the truth of this belief, that if no such belief had existed the persons who now con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trovert
<pb n="17" facs="15"/>it, would have been the persons who would have produced and propagated it; be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause by beginning to reason, they would have been led to reason progressively to the end, and thereby have discovered that matter and the properties it has, will not account for the system of the universe, and that there must necessa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rily be a superior cause.</p>
         <p>IT was the excess to which imaginary sys<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tems of religion had been carried, and the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tolerance, persecutions, burnings, and massa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cres, they occasioned, that first induced certain persons to propagate infidelity; thinking, that upon the whole, it was better not to believe at all, than to believe a multitude of things and complicated creeds, that occasioned so much mischief in the world. But those days are past, persecution has ceased, and the antidote then set up against it has no longer even the shadow of apology. We profess, and we proclaim in peace, the pure, unmixed, comfortable, and rational belief of a God, as manifested, to us in the universe. We do this without any ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prehension of that belief being made a cause of persecution as other beliefs have been, or of suffering persecution ourselves. To God, and not to man, are all men to account for their belief.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="18" facs="16"/>IT has been well observed at the first in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stitution of this society, that the dogmas it pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fesses to believe, are from the commencement of the world; that they are not novelties, but are confessedly the basis of all systems of reli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gion, however numerous and contradictory they may be. All men in the outset of the religion they profess, are Theophilanthropists. It is impossible to form any system of religion without building upon those principles, and therefore they are not sectarian principles un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>less we suppose a sect composed of all the world.</p>
         <p>I have said in the course of this discourse, that the study of natural philosophy is a divine study, because it is the study of the works of God in the creation. If we consider theology upon this ground what an extensive field of improvement in things both divine and human opens itself be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore us. All the principles of science are of divine origin. It was not man that invented the prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciples on which astronomy, and every branch of mathematics are founded and studied. It was not man that gave properties to the circle and the triangle. Those principles are eter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nal and immutable. We see in them the un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>changeable nature of the divinity. We see in them immortality, an immortality existing after
<pb n="19" facs="17"/>the material figures that express those proper<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties and dissolved in dust.</p>
         <p>THE society is at present in its infancy, and its means are small; but I wish to hold in view the subject I allude to, and instead of teaching the philosophical branches of learning as ornamental accomplishments only, as they have hitherto been taught, to teach them in a manner that shall combine theological know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge with scientific instruction. To do this to the best advantage, some instruments will be necessary for the purpose of explanation, of which the society is not yet possessed; but as the views of this society extend to public good as well as to that of the individual, and as its principles can have no enemies, means may be devised to procure them.</p>
         <p>IF we unite to the present instruction, a series of lectures on the ground I have mentioned, we shall, in the first place, render theology the most delightful and entertaining of all studies. In the next place, we shall give scien<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tific instruction to those who could not other<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wise obtain it. The mechanic of every pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fession will there be taught the mathematical principles necessary to render him a proficient
<pb n="20" facs="18"/>in his art. The cultivator will there see deve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>loped the principles of vegetation; while, at the same time, they will be led to see the hand of God in all these things.</p>
