            <p>THE greatest part of mankind may be di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vided into two classes; that of <hi>shallow</hi> thinkers, who fall short of the truth, and that of <hi>abstruse</hi> thinkers, who go beyond it. The latter class are by far the most uncommon, and I may add, by far the most useful and valuable. They suggest hints, at least, and start difficulties, which they want, perhaps, skill to pursue, but which may produce very fine discoveries, when handled by men who have a more just way of thinking. At worst, what they say is uncom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon; and if it should cost some pains to compre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hend it, one has, however, the pleasure of hear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing something that is new. An author is little to be valu'd, who tells us nothing but what we can learn from every coffee-house conversation.</p>
            <p>ALL people of <hi>shallow</hi> thought are apt to decry even those of <hi>solid</hi> understanding as <hi>abstruse</hi> think<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>science
<pb n="2" facs="5"/>
ers and metaphysicians and refiners; and never will allow any thing to be just, which is beyond their own weak conceptions. There are some cas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>es, I own, where an extraordinary refinement affords a strong presumption of falshood, and where no reasoning is to be trusted but what is na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tural and easy. When a man deliberates concern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing his conduct in any <hi>particular</hi> affair, and forms schemes in politics, trade, oeconomy, or any busi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness in life, he never ought to draw his arguments too fine, or connect too long a chain of consequen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces together. Something is sure to happen, that will disconcert his reasoning, and produce an e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vent different from what he expected. But when we reason upon <hi>general</hi> subjects, one may justly affirm, that our speculations can scarce ever be too fine, provided they be just; and that the diffe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rence betwixt a common man and a man of ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nius, is chiefly seen in the shallowness or depth of the principles, upon which they proceed. Gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral reasonings seem intricate, merely because they are general; nor is it easy for the bulk of mankind to distinguish, in a great number of particulars, that common circumstance, in which they all a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gree, or to extract it, pure and unmixt, from the other superfluous circumstances. Every judgment or conclusion, with them, is particular. They cannot enlarge their view to those universal pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>positions, which comprehend under them an infi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nite number of individuals, and include a whole
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>
in a single theorem. Their eye is con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>founded with such an extensive prospect, and the conclusions deriv'd from it, even tho' clearly ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prest, seem intricate and obscure. But however intricate they may seem, 'tis certain, that general principles, if just and sound, must always prevail in the general course of things, tho' they may fail in particular cases; and 'tis the chief business of philosophers to regard the general course of things. I may add, that 'tis also the chief business of poli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticians; especially in the domestic government of the state, where the public good, which is, or ought to be their object, depends on the concur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rence of a multitude of cases; not, as in foreign po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>litics, upon accidents, and chances, and the ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prices of a few persons. This therefore makes the difference betwixt <hi>particular</hi> deliberations and <hi>ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neral</hi> reasonings, and renders subtilty and refine<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment much more suitable to the latter than to the former.</p>
            <p>I THOUGHT this introduction necessary before the following discourses on <hi>commerce, luxury, money, interest,</hi> &amp;c. where, perhaps, there will occur some principles, which are uncommon, and which may seem too refin'd and subtile for such vulgar subjects. If false, let them be rejected: but no one ought to entertain a prejudice against them, merely because they are out of the common road.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="7"/>
THE greatness of a state and the happiness of its subjects, however independent they may be sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pos'd in some respects, are commonly allow'd to be inseparable with regard to commerce; and as pri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vate men receive greater security, in the possession of their trade and riches, from the power of the public, so the public becomes powerful in propor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion to the riches and extensive commerce of pri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vate men. This maxim is true in general; tho' I cannot forbear thinking, that it may possibly admit of some exceptions, and that we often esta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blish it with too little reserve and limitation. There may be some circumstances, where the commerce and riches and luxury of individuals, instead of adding strength to the public, may serve only to thin its armies, and diminish its authority among the neighbouring nations. Man is a very variable being and susceptible of many different opinions, principles, and rules of conduct. What may be true while he adheres to one way of thinking, will be found false, when he has embrac'd an opposite set of manners and opinions.</p>
            <p>THE bulk of every state may be divided into <hi>husbandmen</hi> and <hi>manufacturers.</hi> The former are employ'd in the culture of the land. The latter work up the materials furnish'd by the former, in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to all the commodities, which are necessary or or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>namental to human life. As soon as men quit their savage state, where they live chiefly by hunt<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>the
<pb n="5" facs="8"/>
ing and fishing, they must fall into these two class<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>es; tho' the arts of agriculture employ <hi>at first</hi> the most numerous part of the society <note place="bottom" n="*">Mons. <hi>Melon</hi> in his political essay on commerce asserts, that even at present, if you divide <hi>France</hi> into 20 parts, 16 are labour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ers or peasants, 2 only artizans, one belonging to the law, church and military, and one merchants, financiers and bourgeois. This calculation is certainly very erroneous. In <hi>France, England,</hi> and indeed most parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> half of the inhabitants live in cities, and even of those who live in the country, a very great number are artizans, perhaps above a third,</note>. Time and experience improve so much these arts, that the land may easily maintain a much greater number of men, than those who are immediately em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ploy'd in its cultivation, or who furnish the more necessary manufactures to such as are so employ'd.</p>
            <p>IF these superfluous hands be turn'd towards the finer arts, which are commonly denominated the arts of <hi>luxury,</hi> they add to the happiness of the state; since they afford to many the opportunity of receiving enjoyments, with which they would otherways have been unacquainted. But may not another scheme be propos'd for the employment of these superfluous hands? May not the sovereign lay claim to them, and employ them in fleets and armies, to increase the dominions of the state a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>broad, and spread its fame over distant nations? 'Tis certain, that the fewer desires and wants are found in the proprietors and labourers of land, the fewer hands do they employ; and consequently
<pb n="6" facs="9"/>
superfluities of the land, instead of maintain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing tradesmen and manufacturers, may support fleets and armies to a much greater extent, than where a great many arts are requir'd to minister to the luxury of particular persons. Here there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore seems to be a kind of opposition betwixt the greatness of the state and the happiness of the sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jects. A state is never greater than when all its superfluous hands are employ'd in the service of the public. The ease and convenience of private persons require, that these hands should be em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ploy'd in their service. The one can never be satis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fied, but at the expence of the other. As the am<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bition of the sovereign must entrench on the luxury of individuals; so the luxury of individuals must di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>minish the force, and check the ambition of the so<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vereign.</p>
            <p>NOR is this reasoning merely chimerical; but is founded on history and experience. The repub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lic of <hi>Sparta</hi> was certainly more powerful than any state now in the world, consisting of an equal number of people; and this was owing entirely to the want of commerce and luxury. The <hi>Helotes</hi> were the labourers: The <hi>Spartans</hi> were the soldi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ers or gentlemen. 'Tis evident, that the labour of the <hi>Helotes</hi> could not have maintain'd so great a number of <hi>Spartans,</hi> had these latter liv'd in ease and delicacy, and given employment to a great va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riety of trades and manufactures. The like poli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cy may be remark'd in <hi>Rome;</hi> and indeed, thro'
<pb n="7" facs="10"/>
all antient history, 'tis observable, that the small<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>est republics rais'd and maintain'd greater armies than states, consisting of triple the number of in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>habitants, are able to support at present. 'Tis computed that, in all <hi>European</hi> nations, the propor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion betwixt soldiers and people does not exceed one to a hundred. But we read, that the city of <hi>Rome</hi> alone, with its small territory, rais'd and maintain'd, in early times, ten legions against the <hi>Latins. Athens,</hi> whose whole dominions were not larger than <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> sent to the expedition against <hi>Sicily</hi> near forty thousand men<note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <hi>Thucydides,</hi> lib. 7.</note>. <hi>Dionysius</hi> the elder, 'tis said, maintain'd a standing army of a hundred thousand foot and ten thousand horse, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>side a large fleet of four hundred sail;<note place="bottom" n="†">
                  <hi>Diod. Sic.</hi> lib. 2. This account, I own, is somewhat suspi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cious, not to say worse; chiefly because this army was not com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed of citizens, but of mercenary forces. See discourse X.</note> tho' his territories extended no farther than the city of <hi>Sy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racuse,</hi> about a third part of the island of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and some sea-port towns or garrisons on the coast of <hi>I<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>taly</hi> and <hi>Illyricum.</hi> 'Tis true, the antient armies, in time of war, subsisted much upon plunder: But did not the enemy plunder in their turn? which was a more ruinous way of levying a tax, than a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny other that could be devis'd. In short, no prob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able reason can be given for the great power of the more antient states above the modern, but their
<pb n="8" facs="11"/>
want of commerce and luxury. Few artizans were maintain'd by the labour of the farmers, and there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore more soldiers might live upon it. <hi>Titus Li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vius</hi> says, that <hi>Rome,</hi> in his time, would find it dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficult to raise as large an army as that which, in her early days, she sent out against the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <hi>Titi Livit l.b. 7. cap. 25. Adeo in quae laboramus,</hi> says he, <hi>so<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>la crevimus, divitias luxurianque.</hi>
               </note>. Instead of those soldiers who fought for liberty and empire in <hi>Camillus</hi>'s time, there were, in <hi>Augustus</hi>'s days, musicians, painters, cooks, play<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ers and taylors. And if the land was equally cul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tivated at both periods, 'tis evident it could main<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain equal numbers in the one profession as in the other. They added nothing to the mere necessa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ries of life, in the latter period more than in the former.</p>
            <p>'TIS natural on this occasion to ask, whether sovereigns may not return to the maxims of anti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ent policy, and consult their own interest, in this respect, more than the happiness of their subjects? I answer, that it appears to me almost impossible; and that because antient policy was violent, and contrary to the more natural and usual course of things. 'Tis well known with what peculiar laws <hi>Sparta</hi> was govern'd, and what a prodigy that re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>public is justly esteem'd by every one, who has consider'd human nature, as it has display'd itself in other nations and other ages. Were the testi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mony
<pb n="9" facs="12"/>
of history less positive and circumstantial, such a government wou'd appear a mere philoso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phical whim or fiction, and impossible ever to be reduc'd to practice. And tho' the <hi>Roman</hi> and o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther antient republics were supported on princi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ples somewhat more natural, yet was there a very extraordinary concurrence of circumstances to make them submit to such grievous burthens. They were free states; they were small ones; and the age be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing martial, all the neighbouring states were con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinually in arms. Freedom naturally begets pu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blic spirit, especially in small states; and this pu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blic spirit, this <hi>amor patriae,</hi> must increase, when the public is almost in continual alarm, and men are oblig'd, every moment, to expose themselves to the greatest dangers for its defence. A continu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>al succession of wars makes every citizen a soldi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>er: They take the field in their turn; and during their service are chiefly maintain'd by themselves. And, notwithstanding that this service is equivalent to a very severe tax, 'tis less felt by a people addict<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed to arms, who fight for honour and revenge more than pay, and are unacquainted with gain and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dustry as well as pleasure.<note place="bottom" n="*">The more antient <hi>Romans</hi> liv'd in perpetual war with all their neighbours, and in old <hi>Latin,</hi> the term, <hi>hostis,</hi> exprest both a stranger and an enemy. This is remark'd by <hi>Cicero;</hi> but by him is ascribed to the humanity of his ancestors, who softened, as much as possible, the denomination of an enemy, by calling him by the same appellation which signified a stranger: <hi>De off.</hi> lib. 2. 'Tis however much more probable, from the manners of the times, that the ferocity of those people was so great as to make them re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard all strangers as enemies, and call them by the same name. It is not, besides, consistent with the most common maxims of policy or of nature, that any state shou'd regard its public enemies with a friendly eye, or preserve any such sentiments for them as the <hi>Roman</hi> orator would ascribe to his ancestors. Not to mention, that the early <hi>Romans</hi> really exercised piracy, as we learn from their first treaties with <hi>Carthage,</hi> preserved by <hi>Polybius,</hi> lib. 3. and consequently, like the <hi>Sall<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter" rend="content:•">
                        <desc>illegible</desc>
                     </gap>e</hi> and <hi>Algerine</hi> rovers, were actu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ally at war with most nations, and a stranger and an enemy were with them almost synonimous.</note> Not to mention the
<pb n="10" facs="13"/>
great equality of fortunes amongst the inhabitants of the antient republics, where every field, belong<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to a different proprietor, was able to maintain a family, and render'd the numbers of citizens very considerable, even without trade and manufactures.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' the want of trade and manufactures, amongst a free and very martial people, may <hi>some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>times</hi> have no other effect than to render the public more powerful; 'tis certain, that, in the common course of human affairs, it will have a quite con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trary tendency. Sovereigns must take mankind as they find them, and cannot pretend to introduce a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny violent change in their principles and ways of thinking. A long course of time, with a variety of accidents and circumstances, are requisite to pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duce those great revolutions, which so much diver<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sify the face of human affairs. And the less natu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral any set of principles are, which support a par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticular society, the more difficulty will a legislator

meet with in raising and cultivating them. 'Tis his best policy to comply with the common bent of man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kind, and give it all the improvements, of which it is susceptible. Now, according to the most natural course of things, industry and arts and trade in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>crease the power of the sovereign as well as the happiness of the subjects; and that policy is vio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lent, which aggrandizes the public by the poverty of individuals. This will easily appear from a few considerations, which will present to us the conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quences of sloth and barbarity.</p>
            <p>WHERE manufactures and mechanic arts are not cultivated, the bulk of the people must apply themselves to agriculture; and if their skill and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dustry increase, there must arise a great superfluity from their labour beyond what suffices to maintain them. They have no temptation, therefore, to in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>crease their skill and industry; since they cannot ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>change that superfluity for any commodities, which may serve either to their pleasure or vanity. A ha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bit of indolence naturally prevails. The greater part of the land lyes uncultivated. What is culti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vated, yields not its utmost, for want of skill or as<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>siduity in the farmers. If at any time, the public exigencies require, that great numbers shou'd be employed in the public service, the labour of the people furnishes now no superfluities, by which these numbers can be maintain'd. The labourers can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not increase their skill and industry on a sudden.
<pb n="12" facs="15"/>
Lands uncultivated cannot be brought into tillage for some years. The armies, mean while, must either make sudden and violent conquests, or dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>band for want of subsistence. A regular attack or defence, therefore, is not to be expected from such a people, and their soldiers must be as ignorant and unskilful as their farmers and manufacturers.</p>
            <p>EVERY thing in the world is purchas'd by la<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bour; and our passions are the only causes of la<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bour. When a nation abounds in manufactures and mechanic arts, the proprietors of land, as well as the farmers, study agriculture as a science, and redouble their industry and attention. The super<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fluity, which arises from their labour, is not lost; but is exchang'd with the manufacturers for those commodities, which mens luxury now makes them covet. By this means, land furnishes a great deal more of the necessaries of life, than what suffices for those who cultivate it. In times of peace and tranquillity, this superfluity goes to the maintenance of manufacturers and the improvers of liberal arts. But 'tis easy for the public to convert many of these manufacturers into soldiers, and maintain them by that superfluity, which arises from the labour of the farmers. Accordingly we find, that this is the case in all civiliz'd governments. When the sove<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reign raises an army, what is the consequence? He imposes a tax. This tax obliges all the people to retrench what is least necessary to their subsistence.
<pb n="13" facs="16"/>
Those, who labour in such commodities, must ei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther enlist in the troops, or turn themselves to a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>griculture, and thereby oblige some labourers to enlist for want of business. And to consider the matter abstractly, manufactures increase the power of the state only as they store up so much labour, and that of a kind, which the public may lay claim to, without depriving any one of the necessaries of life. The more labour, therefore, is employ'd beyond mere necessaries, the more powerful is any state; since the persons engag'd in that labour may easily be converted to the public service. In a state without manufactures, there may be the same number of hands; but there is not the same quantity of labour, nor of the same kind. All the labour is there bestow'd upon necessaries, which can admit of little or no abatement.</p>
            <p>THUS the greatness of the sovereign and the happiness of the state are, in a great measure, u<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nited with regard to trade and manufactures. 'Tis a violent method, and in most cases impracticable, to oblige the labourer to toil, in order to raise from the land more than what subsists himself and fami<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly. Furnish him with manufactures and commo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dities, and he will do it of himself. Afterwards, you will find it easy to seize some part of his su<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perfluous labour, and employ it in the public ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vice, without giving him his wonted return. Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing accustom'd to labour, he will think this less
<pb n="14" facs="17"/>
grievous, than if, at once, you oblig'd him to an augmentation of labour without any reward. The case is the same with regard to the other members of the state. The greater is the stock of labour of all kinds, the greater quantity may be taken from the heap, without making any sensible alteration upon it.</p>
            <p>A PUBLIC granary of corn, a store-house of cloth, a magazine of arms; all these must be al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low'd to be real riches and strength in any state. Trade and industry are really nothing; but a stock of labour, which, in time of peace and tranquillity, is employ'd for the ease and satisfaction of indivi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duals, but in the exigencies of state, may, in part, be turn'd to public advantage. Could we con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vert a city into a kind of fortified camp; and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fuse into each breast so martial a genius, and such a passion for public good as to make every one willing to undergo the greatest hardships for the sake of the public; these affections might now, as in antient times, prove alone a sufficient spur to industry, and support the community. It would then be advan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tageous, as in camps, to banish all arts and luxury; and, by restrictions on equipage and tables, make the provisions and forage last longer than if the ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>my were loaded with a number of superfluous re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tainers. But as these principles are too disinterest<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed and too difficult to support, 'tis requisite to go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vern men by other passions, and animate them with
<pb n="15" facs="18"/>
a spirit of avarice and industry, art and luxury. The camp is, in this case, loaded with a super<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fluous retinue; but the provisions flow in pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>portionably larger. The harmony of the whole is still supported; and the natural bent of mens minds being more complied with, individuals, as well as the public, find their account in the obser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vance of those maxims.</p>
            <p>THE same method of reasoning will let us see the advantage of <hi>foreign</hi> commerce, in augmenting the power of the state, as well as the riches and happiness of the subjects. It increases the stock of labour in the nation; and the sovereign may convert what share of it he finds necessary to the service of the public. Foreign trade, by its im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ports, furnishes materials for new manufactures. And by its exports, it produces labour in particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lar commodities, which could not be consum'd at home. In short, a kingdom, that has a large im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>port and export, must abound more with labour, and that upon delicacies and luxuries, than a king<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom, which rests contented with its native com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>modities. It is, therefore, more powerful, as well as richer and happier. The individuals reap the benefit of these commodities, so far as they gra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tify the senses and appetites. And the public is also a gainer, while a greater stock of labour is, by this means, stor'd up against any public exigen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cy; that is, a greater number of laborious men are
<pb n="16" facs="19"/>
maintain'd, who may be diverted to the public ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vice, without robbing any one of the necessaries, or even the chief conveniencies of life.</p>
            <p>IF we consult history, we shall find, that in most nations foreign trade has preceded any refinement in home manufactures, and given birth to domes<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tic luxury. The temptation is stronger to make use of foreign commodities, which are ready for use, and which are entirely new to us, than to make improvements on any domestic commodity, which always advance by slow degrees, and never affect us by their novelty. The profit is also very great, in exporting what is superfluous at home, and what bears no price, to foreign nations, whose soil or climate is not favourable to that commodity. Thus men become acquainted with the <hi>pleasures</hi> of lux<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ury and the <hi>profits</hi> of commerce; and their <hi>delicacy</hi> and <hi>industry,</hi> being once awaken'd, carry them to farther improvements, in every branch of domes<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tic as well as foreign trade. And this perhaps is the chief advantage, which arises from a com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce with strangers. It rouses men from their lethargic indolence; and presenting the gayer and more opulent part of the nation with objects of luxury, which they never before dream'd of, raises in them a desire of a more splendid way of life than what their ancestors enjoy'd. And, at the same time, the few merchants, who possess the secret of this importation and exportation, make exorbitant
<pb n="17" facs="20"/>
profits; and becoming rivals in wealth to the antient nobility, tempt other adventurers to become their rivals in commerce. Imitation soon diffuses all those arts; while domestic manufacturers emulate the foreign in their improvements, and work up e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very home-commodity to the utmost perfection, of which it is susceptible. Their own steel and iron, in such laborious hands, become equal to the gold and rubies of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN the affairs of the society are once brought to this situation, a nation may lose most of its fo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reign trade, and yet continue a great and powerful people. If strangers will not take any particular commodity of ours, we must cease to labour in it. The same hands will turn themselves towards some refinement in other commodities, which may be wanted at home. And there must always be ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terials for them to work upon; till every person in the state, who possesses riches, possesses as great plen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty of home-commodities, and those in as great per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fection, as he desires; which can never possibly hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pen. <hi>China</hi> is represented as one of the most flou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rishing empires in the world; tho' it has very little commerce beyond its own territories.</p>
            <p>IT will not, I hope, be considered as a superflu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous digression, if I here observe, that, as the multi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tude of mechanical arts is advantageous, so is the great number of persons, to whose share the pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ductions
<pb n="18" facs="21"/>
of these arts fall. A too great dispropor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion among the citizens weakens any state. Every person, if possible, ought to enjoy the fruits of his la<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bour, in a full possession of all the necessaries, and many of the conveniencies of life. No-one can doubt, but such an equality is most suitable to hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man nature, and diminishes much less from the <hi>happiness</hi> of the rich than it adds to that of the poor. It also augments the <hi>power of the state,</hi> and makes any extraordinary taxes or impositions be paid with much more chearfulness. Where the riches are engross'd by a few, these must contribute very large<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly to the supplying the public necessities. But when the riches are disperst among multitudes, the bur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>then feels light on every shoulder, and the taxes make not a very sensible difference on any one's way of living.</p>
            <p>ADD to this, that where the riches are in few hands, these must enjoy all the power, and will readily conspire to lay the whole burthen on the poor, and oppress them still farther, to the discou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ragement of all industry.</p>
            <p>IN this circumstance consists the great advantage of <hi>England</hi> above any nation at present in the world, or that appears in the records of any story. 'Tis true, the <hi>English</hi> feel some disadvantages in foreign trade by the high price of labour, which is in part the effect of the riches of their artizans, as well as of
<pb n="19" facs="22"/>
the plenty of money: But as foreign trade is not the most material circumstance, 'tis not to be put in competition with the happiness of so many milli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons. And if there were no more to endear to them that free government, under which they live, this alone were sufficient. The poverty of the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon people is a natural, if not an infallible conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quence of absolute monarchy; tho' I doubt, whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther it be always true, on the other hand, that their riches are an infallible consequence of liberty. That seems to depend on particular accidents and a certain turn of thinking, in conjunction with li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berty. My lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> accounting for the great advantages obtain'd by the <hi>English</hi> in their wars with <hi>France,</hi> ascribes them chiefly to the superior ease and plenty of the common people, amongst the former; yet the governments of the two king<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doms were, at that time, pretty much alike. Where the labourers and artizans are accustom'd to work for low wages, and to retain but a small part of the fruits of their labour, 'tis difficult for them, even in a free government, to better their condition, or conspire among themselves to heighten their wages. But even where they are accustom'd to a more plentiful way of life, 'tis easy for the rich, in a des<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>potic government, to conspire against <hi>them,</hi> and throw the whole burthen of the taxes on their shoulders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="23"/>
IT may seem an odd position, that the poverty of the common people in <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> is, in some measure, owing to the superior riches of the soil and happiness of the climate; and yet there want not many reasons to justify this pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>radox. In such a fine mold or soil as that of those more southern regions, agriculture is an easy art; and one man, with a couple of sorry horses, will be able, in a season, to cultivate as much land as will pay a pretty considerable rent to the proprietor. All the art, which the farmer knows, is to leave his ground fallow for a year, as soon as it is ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hausted; and the warmth of the sun alone and temperature of the climate enrich it, and restore its fertility. Such poor peasants, therefore, require only a simple maintenance for their labour. They have no stock nor riches, which claim more; and at the same time, they are for ever dependent on their landlord, who gives no leases, nor fears that his land will be spoil'd by the ill methods of culti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vation. In <hi>England,</hi> the land is rich, but coarse; must be cultivated at a great expence; and pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duces slender crops, when not carefully manag'd, and by a method, which gives not the full profit but in a course of several years. A farmer, there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore, in <hi>England</hi> must have a considerable stock and a long lease; which beget proportional profits. The fine vineyards of <hi>Champagne</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> that oft yield to the landlord above five pounds <hi>per</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="24"/>
acre, are cultivated by peasants, who have scarce bread: And the reason is, that such peasants need no stock but their own limbs, along with instru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments of husbandry, which they can buy for 20 shillings. The farmers are commonly in some better circumstances in those countries. But the graziers are most at their ease of all those, who cultivate the land. The reason is still the same. Men must have profits proportionable to their ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pence and hazard. Where so considerable a num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber of the labouring poor as the peasants and farm<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ers, are in very low circumstances, all the rest must partake of their poverty, whether the government of that nation be monarchical or republican.</p>
            <p>WE may form a similar remark with regard to the general history of mankind. What is the rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son, why no people living betwixt the tropics cou'd ever yet attain to any art or civility, or reach e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven any police in their government and any mili<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tary discipline; while few nations in the temperate climates have been altogether depriv'd of these ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantages? 'Tis probable, that one cause of this phaenomenon is the warmth and equality of wea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther in the torrid zone, that render cloaths and houses less requisite for the inhabitants, and there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>by remove, in part, that necessity, which is the great spur to industry and invention. <hi>Curis acuens mortalia corda.</hi> Not to mention, that the fewer goods or possessions of this kind any people enjoy,
<pb n="22" facs="25"/>
the fewer quarrels are likely to arise amongst them; and the less necessity will there be for a settled po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lice or regular authority to protect and defend them from foreign enemies or from each other.</p>

            <head>DISCOURSE II. <hi>Of Luxury.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>LUXURY is a word of a very uncertain signi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fication, and may be taken in a good as well as a bad sense. In general, it means great refine<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment in the gratification of the senses; and any de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gree of it may be innocent or blameable, according to the age or country or condition of the person. The bounds betwixt the virtue and the vice can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not here be fixt exactly, more than in other moral subjects. To imagine, that the gratifying any of the senses, or the indulging any delicacy in meats, drinks, or apparel is, of itself, a vice, can never en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter into any head, that is not disorder'd by the frenzies of a fanatical enthusiasm. I have, indeed, heard of a monk abroad, who, because the win<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dows of his cell open'd upon a very noble pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spect, made a <hi>covenant with his eyes</hi> never to turn that way, or receive so sensual a gratification. And such is the crime of drinking <hi>Champagne</hi> or <hi>Bur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gundy,</hi> preferably to small beer or porter. These indulgences are only vices, when they are pursu'd at the expence of some virtue, as liberality or cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity: In like manner, as they are follies, when for them a man ruins his fortune, and reduces himself to want and beggary. Where they entrench upon
<pb n="24" facs="27"/>
no virtue, but leave ample subject, whence to pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vide for friends, family, and every proper object of generosity or compassion, they are entirely inno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cent, and have in every age been acknowledg'd such by almost all moralists. To be entirely oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cupy'd with the luxury of the table, for instance, without any relish for the pleasures of ambition, stu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dy or conversation, is a mark of gross stupidity, and is incompatible with any vigour of temper or ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nius. To confine one's expence entirely to such a gratification, without regard to friends or family, is an indication of a heart entirely devoid of huma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity or benevolence. But if a man reserve time sufficient for all laudable pursuits, and money suf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficient for all generous purposes, he is free from e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very shadow of blame or reproach.</p>
            <p>SINCE luxury may be consider'd, either as in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nocent or blameable, one may be surpris'd at those preposterous opinions, which have been entertain'd concerning it; while men of libertine principles bestow praises even on vitious luxury, and repre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent it as highly advantageous to society; and on the other hand, men of severe morals blame even the most innocent luxury, and represent it as the source of all the corruptions, disorders, and facti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons, incident to civil government. We shall here endeavour to correct both these extremes, by prov<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, <hi>first,</hi> that the ages of refinement and luxury are both the happiest and most virtuous; <hi>secondly,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="28"/>
that wherever luxury ceases to be innocent, it also ceases to be beneficial, and when carry'd a degree too far, is a quality pernicious, tho' perhaps not the most pernicious, to political society.</p>
            <p>To prove the first point, we need but consider the effects of luxury both on <hi>private</hi> and on <hi>public</hi> life. Human happiness, according to the most re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceiv'd notions, seems to consist in three ingredients, action, pleasure, and indolence; and tho' these in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gredients ought to be mixt in different proportions, according to the particular dispositions of the per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son, yet no one ingredient can be entirely want<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, without destroying, in some measure, the re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lish of the whole composition. Indolence or re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose, indeed, seems not, of itself, to contribute much to our enjoyment; but like sleep, is requisite as an indulgence to the weakness of human nature, which cannot support an uninterrupted course of business or pleasure. That quick march of the spirits, which takes a man from himself, and chief<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly gives satisfaction, does in the end exhaust the mind, and requires some intervals of repose, which, tho' agreeable for a moment, yet, if prolong'd, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>get a languor and lethargy, that destroy all enjoy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment. Education, custom, and example have a mighty influence in turning the mind to any of these pursuits; and it must be own'd, that, where they promote a relish for action and pleasure, they are so far favourable to human happiness. In times,
<pb n="26" facs="29"/>
when industry and arts flourish, men are kept in perpetual occupation, and enjoy, as their reward, the occupation itself, as well as those pleasures, which are the fruits of their labour. The mind acquires new vigour; enlarges its powers and facul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties; and by an affiduity in honest industry, both satisfies its natural appetites, and prevents the growth of unnatural ones, which commonly spring up, when nourish'd with ease and idleness. Banish those arts from society, you deprive men both of action and of pleasure; and leaving nothing but indolence in their place, you even destroy the relish of indo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lence, which never is agreeable, but when it suc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceeds to labour, and recruits the spirits, exhausted by too much application and fatigue.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER advantage of industry and of refine<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments in the mechanical arts is, that they com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monly produce some refinements in the liberal arts; nor can the one be carried to perfection, without being accompany'd, in some degree, with the other. The same age, which produces great philosophers and politicians, renown'd generals and poets, usu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ally abounds with skilful weavers and ship-carpen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters. We cannot reasonably expect, that a piece of woolen cloth will be wrought to perfection in a nation, that is ignorant of astronomy, or where ethics are neglected. The spirit of the age affects all the arts; and the minds of men, being once rous'd from their lethargy, and put into a fermen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tation,
<pb n="27" facs="30"/>
turn themselves on all fides, and carry im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>provements into every art and science. Profound ignorance is totally banish'd, and men enjoy the privilege of rational creatures, to think as well as to act, to cultivate the pleasures of the mind as well as those of the body.</p>
            <p>THE more these refin'd arts advance, the more sociable do men become; nor is it possible, that, when enrich'd with science, and possest of a fund of conversation, they should be contented to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>main in solitude, or live with their fellow citizens in that distant manner, which is peculiar to igno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rant and barbarous nations. They flock into ci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties; love to receive and communicate knowledge; to show their wit or their breeding; their taste in conversation or living, in cloaths or furniture. Cu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riosity allures the wise: Vanity the foolish: And pleasure both. Particular clubs and societies are every where form'd: Both sexes meet in an easy and sociable manner, and mens tempers, as well as behaviour, refine a-pace. So that beside the im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>provements they receive from knowledge and the liberal arts, 'tis impossible but they must feel an increase of humanity, from the very habit of con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versing together, and contributing to each other's pleasure and entertainment. Thus <hi>industry, know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge,</hi> and <hi>humanity</hi> are linkt together by an indis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>soluble chain, and are found, from experience as
<pb n="28" facs="31"/>
well as reason, to be peculiar to the more polish'd and luxurious ages.</p>
            <p>NOR are these advantages attended with disad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantages, that bear any proportion to them. The more men refine upon pleasure, the less will they indulge in excesses of any kind; because nothing is more destructive to true pleasure than such exces<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ses. One may safely affirm, that the <hi>Tartars</hi> are oftner guilty of beastly gluttony, when they feast on their dead horses, than <hi>European</hi> courtiers with all their refinements of cookery. And if libertine love, or even infidelity to the marriage-bed, be more fre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quent in polite ages, when it is often regarded on<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly as a piece of gallantry, drunkenness, on the other hand, is much less common: A vice more odious and more pernicious both to mind and body. And in this matter I would appeal not only to an <hi>Ovid</hi> or a <hi>Petronius,</hi> but to a <hi>Seneca</hi> or a <hi>Cato.</hi> We know, that <hi>Caesar,</hi> during <hi>Cataline</hi>'s conspiracy, being necessitated to put into <hi>Cato</hi>'s hands a <hi>billet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doux,</hi> which discover'd an intrigue with <hi>Servilia, Cato</hi>'s own sister, that stern philosopher threw it back to him with indignation, and in the bitterness of his wrath gave him the appellation of drunkard, as a term more opprobrious than that with which he cou'd more justly have reproach'd him.</p>
            <p>BUT industry, knowledge, and humanity are not advantageous in private life alone: They diffuse their beneficial influence on the <hi>Public,</hi> and render
<pb n="29" facs="32"/>
the government as great and flourishing as they make individuals happy and prosperous. The en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>crease and consumption of all the commodities, which serve to the ornament and pleasure of life, are advantageous to society; because at the same time that they multiply those innocent gratifications to individuals, they are a kind of <hi>store-house</hi> of labour, which, in the exigencies of state, may be turn'd to the public service. In a nation, where there is no demand for such superfluities, men sink into indo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lence, lose all the enjoyment of life, and are useless to the public, which cannot maintain nor support its fleets and armies, from the industry of such sloth<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful members.</p>
            <p>THE bounds of all the <hi>European</hi> kingdoms are, at present, pretty near the same they were two hundred years ago: But what a difference is there in the power and grandeur of those king<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doms? Which can be ascrib'd to nothing but the encrease of art and industry. When <hi>Charles</hi> the VIII. of <hi>France</hi> invaded <hi>Italy,</hi> he carry'd with him about 20,000 men: And yet this arma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment so exhausted the nation, as we learn from <hi>Guicciardin,</hi> that for some years it was not able to make so great an effort. The late king of <hi>France,</hi> in time of war, kept in pay above 400,000 men;<note place="bottom" n="*">The inscription on the <hi>Place-de-Vendome</hi> says 440,000.</note> tho' from <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s death to his own he was en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gag'd in a course of wars, that lasted near thirty years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="33"/>
THIS industry is much promoted by the know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge, inseparable from the ages of arts and luxury; as on the other hand, this knowledge enables the public to make the best advantage of the industry of its subjects. Laws, order, police, discipline; these can never be carry'd to any degree of perfec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, before human reason has refin'd itself by ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ercise, and by an application to the more vulgar arts, at least, of commerce and manufactures. Can we expect, that a government will be well model'd by a people, who know not how to make a spin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ning wheel, or to employ a loom to advantage? Not to mention, that all ignorant ages are infest<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed with superstition, which throws the government off its bias, and disturbs men in the pursuit of their interest and happiness.</p>
            <p>KNOWLEDGE in the arts of government natur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ally begets mildness and moderation, by instruct<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing men in the advantages of humane maxims a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bove rigour and severity, which drive subjects in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to rebellion, and render the return to submission impracticable, by cutting off all hopes of pardon. When mens temper is soften'd as well as their knowledge improv'd, this humanity appears still more conspicuous, and is the chief characteristic, that distinguishes a civiliz'd age from times of bar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>barity and ignorance. Factions are then less invete<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rate; revolutions less tragical; authority less severe;
<pb n="31" facs="34"/>
and seditions less frequent. Even foreign wars a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bate of their cruelty; and after the field of battle, where honour and interest steel men against com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>passion as well as fear, the combatants divest them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves of the brute, and resume the man.</p>
            <p>NOR need we fear, that men, by losing their ferocity, will lose their martial spirit, or become less undaunted and vigorous in defence of their country or their liberty. The arts have no such effect in enervating either the mind or body. On the contrary, industry, their inseparable attendant, adds new force to both. And if anger, which is said to be the whetstone of courage, loses somewhat of its asperity, by politeness and refinement; a sense of honour, which is a stronger, more constant, and more governable principle, acquires fresh vigour by that elevation of genius, which arises from knowledge and a good education. Add to this, that courage can neither have any duration, nor be of any use, when not accompany'd with discip<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>line and martial skill, which are seldom found a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mong a barbarous people. The antients remark'd that <hi>Datames</hi> was the only barbarian that ever knew the art of war. And <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> seeing the <hi>Romans</hi> marshal their army with some art and skill, said with surprize <hi>These barbarians have no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing barbarous in their discipline!</hi> 'Tis observable, that as the old <hi>Romans,</hi> by applying themselves solely to war, were the only unciviliz'd people that
<pb n="32" facs="35"/>
ever possest military discipline; so the modern <hi>I<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>talians</hi> are the only civiliz'd people, among <hi>Euro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>peans,</hi> that ever wanted courage and a martial spirit. Those who wou'd ascribe this effeminacy of the <hi>I<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>talians</hi> to their luxury or politeness, or application to the arts, need but consider the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lish,</hi> whose bravery is as uncontestable as their love of luxury, and their assiduity in commerce. The <hi>Italian</hi> historians give us a more satisfactory reason for this degeneracy of their countrymen. They shew us how the sword was dropt at once by all the <hi>Italian</hi> sovereigns; while the <hi>Venetian</hi> aristo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cracy was jealous of its subjects, the <hi>Florentine</hi> de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mocracy apply'd itself entirely to commerce; <hi>Rome</hi> was govern'd by priests, and <hi>Naples</hi> by women. War then became the business of soldiers of for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tune, who spar'd one another, and to the astonish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment of the world, cou'd engage a whole day in what they call'd a battle, and return at night to their camps without the least bloodshed.</p>
            <p>WHAT has chiefly induc'd severe moralists to declaim against luxury and refinement in pleasure is the example of antient <hi>Rome,</hi> which, joining, to its poverty and rusticity, virtue and public spirit, rose to such a surprising height of grandeur and liberty; but having learn'd from its conquer'd pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vinces the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Asiatic</hi> luxury, fell into e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very kind of corruption; whence arose sedition and civil wars, attended at last with the total loss of li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berty.
<pb n="33" facs="36"/>
All the <hi>Latin</hi> classics, whom we peruse in our infancy, are full of these sentiments, and uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versally ascribe the ruin of their state to the arts and riches imported from the East: insomuch that <hi>Sal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lust</hi> represents a taste for painting as a vice no less than lewdness and drinking. And so popular were these sentiments during the latter ages of the re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>public, that this author abounds in praises of the old rigid <hi>Roman</hi> virtue, tho' himself the most egregi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous instance of modern luxury and corruption; speaks contemptuously of <hi>Grecian</hi> eloquence, tho' the most elegant writer in the world; nay, employs preposterous digressions and declamations to this purpose, tho' a model of taste and correctness.</p>
            <p>BUT it would be easy to prove, that these writ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ers mistook the cause of the disorders in the <hi>Ro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man</hi> state, and ascrib'd to luxury and the arts what really proceeded from an ill model'd government, and the unlimited extent of conquests. Luxury or refinement on pleasure has no natural tendency to beget venality and corruption. The value, which all men put upon any particular pleasure, depends on comparison and experience; nor is a porter less greedy of money, which he spends on bacon and brandy, than a courtier, who purchases champagne and ortolans. Riches are valuable at all times and to all men, because they always purchase pleasures, such as men are accustom'd to and desire; nor can any thing restrain or regulate the love of money but
<pb n="34" facs="37"/>
a sense of honour and virtue; which, if it be not nearly equal at all times, will naturally abound most in ages of luxury and knowledge.</p>
            <p>OF all <hi>European</hi> kingdoms, <hi>Poland</hi> seems the most defective in the arts of war as well as peace, mechanical as well as liberal; and yet 'tis there that venality and corruption do most prevail. The nobles seem to have preserv'd their crown elective for no other purpose, but regularly to sell it to the highest bidder. This is almost the only species of commerce, with which that people are acquainted.</p>
            <p>THE liberties of <hi>England,</hi> so far from decaying since the origin of luxury and the arts, have ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver flourish'd so much as during that period. And tho' corruption may seem to encrease of late years; this is chiefly to be ascrib'd to our establish'd liberty, when our princes have found the impossibility of governing without parliaments, or of terrifying par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liaments by the fantom of prerogative. Not to mention, that this corruption or venality prevails infinitely more among the electors than the elect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed; and therefore cannot justly be ascrib'd to any refinements in luxury.</p>
            <p>IF we consider the matter in a proper light, we shall find, that luxury and the arts are rather fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vourable to liberty, and have a natural tendency to preserve, if not produce a free government. In
<pb n="35" facs="38"/>
rude unpolish'd nations, where the arts are neglect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, all the labour is bestow'd on the cultivation of the ground; and the whole society divides into two classes, proprietors of land, and their vassals or tenants. The latter are necessarily dependent and fitted for slavery and subjection; especially where they possess no riches, and are not valu'd for their knowledge in agriculture; as must always be the case where the arts are neglected. The former naturally erect themselves into petty tyrants; and must either submit to an absolute master for the sake of peace and order; or if they will preserve their independency, like the <hi>Gothic</hi> barons, they must fall into feuds and contests amongst them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves, and throw the whole society into such con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fusion as is perhaps worse than the most despotic government. But where luxury nourishes com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce and industry, the peasants, by a proper culti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vation of the land, become rich and independent; while the tradesmen and merchants acquire a share of the property, and draw authority and consider<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ation to that middling rank of men; who are the best and firmest basis of public liberty. These sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mit not to slavery, like the poor peasants, from po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verty and meanness of spirit; and having no hopes of tyrannizing over others, like the barons, they are not tempted, for the sake of that gratification, to submit to the tyranny of their sovereign. They covet equal laws, which may secure their proper<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty,
<pb n="36" facs="39"/>
and preserve them from monarchical, as well as aristocratical tyranny.</p>
            <p>THE house of commons is the support of our popular government; and all the world acknow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge, that it ow'd its chief influence and consider<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ation to the encrease of commerce, which threw such a balance of property into the hands of the commons. How inconsistent, then, is it to blame so violently luxury, or a refinement in the arts, and to represent it as the bane of liberty and public spirit!</p>
            <p>TO declaim against present times, and magnify the virtue of remote ancestors, is a propensity al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most inherent in human nature; and as the senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments and opinions of civiliz'd ages alone are transmitted to posterity, hence it is that we meet with so many severe judgments pronounc'd a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gainst luxury and even science, and hence it is that at present we give so ready an assent to them. But the fallacy is easily perceiv'd from comparing dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent nations that are contemporaries; where we both judge more impartially, and can better set in opposition those manners with which we are sufficiently acquainted. Treachery and cruelty, the most pernicious and most odious of all vi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces, seem peculiar to unciviliz'd ages; and by the refin'd <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were ascrib'd to all the barbarous nations, which surrounded them. They
<pb n="37" facs="40"/>
might justly, therefore, have presum'd, that their own ancestors, so highly celebrated, possest no greater virtue, and were as much inferior to their posterity in honour and humanity as in taste and science. An antient <hi>Frank</hi> or <hi>Saxon</hi> may be high<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly extoll'd: But I believe every man would think his life or fortune much less secure in the hands of a <hi>Moor</hi> or <hi>Tartar,</hi> than in those of a <hi>French</hi> or <hi>English</hi> gentleman, the rank of men the most civiliz'd, in the most civiliz'd nations.</p>
            <p>WE come now to the <hi>second</hi> position, which we propos'd to illustrate, <hi>viz.</hi> that as innocent luxury or a refinement in pleasure is advantageous to the public; so wherever luxury ceases to be innocent, it also ceases to be beneficial, and when carry'd a degree farther, begins to be a quality pernicious, tho', perhaps, not the most pernicious, to political society.</p>
            <p>LET us consider what we call vicious luxury. No gratification, however sensual, can, of itself, be esteem'd vicious. A gratification is only vici<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous, when it engrosses all a man's expence, and leaves no ability for such acts of duty and genero<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sity as are requir'd by his situation and fortune. Suppose, that he correct the vice, and employ part of his expence in the education of his children, in the support of his friends, and in relieving the poor; would any prejudice result to society? On the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trary,
<pb n="38" facs="41"/>
the same consumption would arise; and that labour, which, at present, is employ'd only in pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ducing a slender gratification to one man, would relieve the necessitous, and bestow satisfaction on hundreds. The same care and toil, which raise a dish of peas at <hi>Christmas,</hi> would give bread to a whole family during six months. To say, that, without a vicious luxury, the labour would not have been employ'd at all, is only to say, that there is some other defect in human nature, such as indo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lence, selfishness, inattention to others, for which luxury, in some measure, provides a remedy; as one poison may be an antidote to another. But virtue, like wholesome food, is better than poisons, however corrected.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSE the same number of men, that are, at present, in <hi>Britain,</hi> with the same soil and climate; I ask, is it not possible for them to be happier, by the most perfect way of life, that can be imagin'd, and by the greatest reformation, which omnipo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tence itself could work in their temper and dispo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sition? To assert, that they cannot, appears evi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dently ridiculous. As the land is able to maintain more than all its inhabitants, they cou'd never, in such an <hi>Utopian</hi> state, feel any other ills, than those which arise from bodily sickness; and these are not the half of human miseries. All other ills spring from some vice, either in ourselves or others; and even many of our diseases proceed from the same
<pb n="39" facs="42"/>
origin. Remove the vices, and the ills follow. You must only take care to remove all the vices. If you remove part, you may render the matter worse. By banishing <hi>vicious</hi> luxury, without cur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing sloth and an indifference to others, you only diminish industry in the state, and add nothing to mens charity or their generosity. Let us, there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore, rest contented with asserting, that two oppo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>site vices in a state may be more advantageous than either of them alone; but let us never pronounce vice, in it self, advantageous. Is it not very in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>consistent for an author to assert in one page, that moral distinctions are inventions of politicians for public interest; and in the next page maintain, that vice is advantageous to the public?<note place="bottom" n="*">Fable of the hees.</note> And in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed, it seems, upon any system of morality, little less than a contradiction in terms, to talk of a vice, that is in general beneficial to society.</p>
            <p>I THOUGHT this reasoning necessary, in order to give some light to a philosophical question, which has been much disputed in <hi>Britain.</hi> I call it a <hi>phi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>losophical</hi> question, not a <hi>political</hi> one. For what<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever may be the consequence of such a miracu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lous transformation of mankind, as would endow them with every species of virtue, and free them from every vice, this concerns not the magistrate, who aims only at possibilities. He cannot cure e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very vice, by substituting a virtue in its place. Ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry
<pb n="40" facs="43"/>
often he can only cure one vice by another; and in that case, he ought to prefer what is least per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nicious to society. Luxury, when excessive, is the source of many ills; but is in general prefer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able to sloth and idleness, which wou'd commonly succeed in its place, and are more pernicious both to private persons and to the public. When sloth reigns, a mean uncultivated way of life prevails a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mongst individuals, without society, without enjoy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment. And if the sovereign, in such a situation, demands the service of his subjects, the labour of the state suffices only to furnish the necessaries of life to the labourers, and can afford nothing to those, who are employ'd in the public service.</p>

            <head>DISCOURSE III. <hi>Of Money.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MONEY is not, properly speaking, one of the subjects of commerce; but only the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>strument, which men have agreed upon to facili<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tate the exchange of one commodity for another. 'Tis none of the wheels of trade: 'Tis the oil, which renders the motion of the wheels more smooth and easy. If we consider any one king<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom by itself, 'tis evident, that the greater or less plenty of money is of no consequence; since the prices of commodities are always proportion'd to the plenty of money, and a crown in <hi>Harry</hi> the VII's. time serv'd the same purpose as a pound does at present. 'Tis only the <hi>public,</hi> that draws any advantage from the greater plenty of money; and that only in its wars and negociations with fo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reign states. And this is the reason, why all rich and trading countries, from <hi>Carthage</hi> to <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> have employ'd mercenary troops, which they hir'd from their poorer neighbours. Were they to make use of their native subjects, they would find less advantage from their superior riches, and from their great plenty of gold and silver; since the pay of all their servants must rise in proportion to the public opulence. Our small army in <hi>Britain</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="45"/>
of 20,000 men are maintain'd at as great expence as a <hi>French</hi> army thrice as numerous. The <hi>Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lish</hi> fleet, during the late war, requir'd as much money to support it as all the <hi>Roman</hi> legions, which kept the whole world in subjection, during the time of the emperors <note place="bottom" n="*">APRIVATE soldier in the <hi>Roman</hi> infantry had a denarius a day, somewhat less than 8 pence. The <hi>Roman</hi> emperors had common<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly 25 legions in pay, which, allowing 5000 men to a legion, makes 125,000. <hi>Tacit. ann. lib.</hi> 4. 'Tis true, there were also auxilia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ries to the legions; but their numbers are uncertain as well as their pay. To consider only the legionaries, the pay of the private men could not exceed 1600,000 pound. Now the parliament in the last war commonly allow'd for the fleet 2500,000. We have therefore 900,000 over for the officers and other expences of the <hi>Roman</hi> le<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gions. There seem to have been but few officers in the <hi>Roman</hi> ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mies, in comparison of what are employ'd in all our modern troops, except some <hi>Swiss</hi> corps: And these officers had very small pay: A centurion, for instance, only double a common soldier. And as the soldiers from their pay <hi>(Tacit. ann. lib.</hi> 1.) bought their own cloaths, arms, tents and baggage; this must also diminish consider<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ably the other charges of the army. So little expensive was that mighty government, and so easy was its yoke over the world. And indeed, this is the more natural conclusion from the forego<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing calculations. For money, after the conquest of <hi>Egypt,</hi> seems to have been nearly in as great plenty at <hi>Rome,</hi> as it is at present in the richest of the <hi>European</hi> kingdoms.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE greater number of people and their great<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>er industry are serviceable in all cases; at home and abroad, in private and in public. But the greater plenty of money is very limited in its use, and may even sometimes be a loss to a nation in its com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce with foreigners.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="46"/>
THERE seems to be a happy concurrence of causes in human affairs, which check the growth of trade and riches, and hinder them from being confin'd entirely to one people; as might natural<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly at first be dreaded from the advantages of an e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stablish'd commerce. Where one nation has got the start of another in trade, 'tis very difficult for the latter to regain the ground it has lost; because of the superior industry and skill of the former, and the greater stocks, which its merchants are possest' of, and which enable them to trade for so much smaller profits. But these advantages are compen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sated, in some measure, by the low prices of labour in every nation, that has not an extensive com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce, and does not very much abound in gold and silver. Manufactures, therefore, gradually shift their places, leaving those countries and provinces, which they have already enrich'd, and flying to o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thers, whither they are allur'd by the cheapness of provisions and labour; till they have enrich'd these also, and are again banish'd by the same causes. And in general, we may observe, that the dearness of every thing, from plenty of money, is a disad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantage, that attends an establish'd commerce, and sets bounds to it in every country, by enabling the poorer states to undersell the richer in all foreign markets.</p>
            <p>THIS has made me entertain a great doubt con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerning the benefit of <hi>banks</hi> and <hi>paper credit,</hi> which
<pb n="44" facs="47"/>
are so generally esteem'd advantageous to every nation. That provisions and labour shou'd become dear by the encrease of trade and money, is, in many respects, an inconvenience; but an inconve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nience that is unavoidable, and the effect of that public wealth and prosperity, which are the end of all our wishes. 'Tis compensated by the advan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tages we reap from the possession of these precious metals, and the weight which they give the nati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on in all foreign wars and negotiations. But there appears no reason for encreasing that inconveni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence by a counterfeit money, which foreigners will never accept of, and which any great disorder in the state will reduce to nothing. There are, 'tis true, many people in every rich state, who, hav<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing large sums of money, wou'd prefer paper with good security; as being of more easy transport and more safe custody. If the public provide not a bank, private bankers will take advantage of this circumstance; as the goldsmiths formerly did in <hi>London,</hi> or as the bankers do at present in <hi>Dublin:</hi> And therefore 'tis better, it may be thought, that a public company should enjoy the benefit of that paper credit, which always will have place in every opulent kingdom. But to endeavour artificially to encrease such a credit, can never be the interest of any trading nation; but must lay them under disadvantages, by encreasing money beyond its na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tural proportion to labour and commodities, and thereby heightening their price to the merchant
<pb n="45" facs="48"/>
and manufacturer. And in this view, it must be allow'd, that no bank cou'd be more advantageous than such a one as lockt up all the money it re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceiv'd, and never augmented the circulating coin, as is usual, by returning part of its treasure into com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce. A public bank, by this expedient, might cut off much of the dealings of private bankers and mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney jobbers; and tho' the state bore the charge of salaries to the directors and tellers of this bank, (for according to the preceeding supposition, it would have no profit from its dealings) the nation<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>al advantage, resulting from the low price of la<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bour and the destruction of paper credit, would be a sufficient compensation. Not to mention, that so large a sum, lying ready at command, would be a great convenience in times of public danger and distress; and might be replac'd at leisure, when peace and tranquillity were restor'd to the nation.</p>
            <p>BUT of this subject of paper credit, we shall treat more largely hereafter. And I shall finish this essay of money, by proposing and explaining two observations, which may, perhaps, serve to employ the thought of our speculative politicians. For to these only I all along address myself. 'Tis enough that I submit to the ridicule sometimes, in this age, attach'd to the character of a philoso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pher, without adding to it that which belongs to a projector.</p>

'Tis indeed evident, that money is nothing but the representation of labour and commodities, and serves only as a method of rating or estimating them. Where coin is in great<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>er plenty; as a greater quantity of it is then re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quir'd to represent the same quantity of goods; it can have no effect, either good or bad, taking a nation within itself: no more than it wou'd make any alteration on a merchant's books, if instead of the <hi>Arabian</hi> method of notation, which requires few characters, he shou'd make use of the <hi>Roman,</hi> which requires a great many. Nay the greater plenty of money, like the <hi>Roman</hi> characters, is ra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther inconvenient and troublesome; and requires greater care to keep and transport it. But not<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>withstanding this conclusion, which must be allow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed just, 'tis certain, that since the discover of the mines in <hi>America,</hi> industry has encreas'd in all the nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> except in the possessors of those mines; and this may justly be ascrib'd, amongst o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther reasons, to the encrease of gold and silver. Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cordingly we find, that in every kingdom, into which money begins to flow in greater abundance than for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merly, every thing takes a new face; labour and
<pb n="47" facs="50"/>
industry gain life; the merchant becomes more en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terprizing; the manufacturer more diligent and skillful; and even the farmer follows his plough with greater alacrity and attention. This is not easily to be accounted for, if we consider only the influence, which a greater abundance of coin has in the kingdom itself, by heightening the price of commodities, and obliging every one to pay a great<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>er number of these little yellow or white pieces for every thing he purchases. And as to foreign trade, it appears, that great plenty of money is rather disadvantageous, by raising the price of every kind of labour.</p>
            <p>To account, then, for this phaenomenon, we must consider, that tho' the high price of commo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dities be a necessary consequence of the encrease of gold and silver, yet it follows not immediately upon that encrease; but some time is requir'd before the money circulate thro' the whole state, and make its effects be felt on all ranks of people. At first, no alteration is perceiv'd; by degrees, it raises the price first of one commodity, then of another; till the whole at last rises to a just proportion, with the new quantity of specie, which is in the kingdom. In my opinion, 'tis only in this interval or interme<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diate situation, betwixt the acquisition of money and rise of prices, that the encreasing quantity of gold and silver is favourable to industry. When any quantity of money is imported into a nation, it is
<pb n="48" facs="51"/>
not at first disperst into many hands; but is confin'd to the coffers of a few persons, who immediately seek to employ it to the best advantage. Here are a set of manufacturers or merchants, we shall sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose, who have receiv'd returns of gold and silver for goods, which they sent to <hi>Cadiz.</hi> They are thereby enabled to employ more workmen than formerly, who never dream of demanding higher wages, but are glad of employment from such good paymasters. If workmen become scarce, the manufacturer gives higher wages; but at first re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quires an encrease of labour, and this is willingly submitted to by the artizan, who can now eat and drink better to compensate his additional toil and fatigue. He carries his money to market, where he finds every thing at the same price as formerly, but returns with greater quantity and of better kinds, for the use of his family. The farmer and gardener, finding that all their commodities are taken off, apply themselves with alacrity to the raising of more; and at the same time, can afford to take better and more cloaths from their trades<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>men, whose price is the same as formerly, and their industry only whetted by so much new gain. 'Tis easy to trace the money in its progress thro' the whole commonwealth; where we shall find, that it must first quicken the diligence of every indivi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dual, before it encrease the price of labour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="52"/>
AND that the specie may encrease to a consider<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able pitch, before it have this latter effect, appears, amongst other reasons, from the frequent operations of the <hi>French</hi> king on the money; where it was al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ways found, that the augmenting the numerary va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lue did not produce a proportional rise of the prices, at least for some time. In the last year of <hi>Louis</hi> the XIV. money was rais'd three sevenths, but prices augmented only one. Corn in <hi>France</hi> is now sold at the same price, or for the same number of livres, it was in 1683, tho' silver was then at 30 livres the mark, and is now at 50.<note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <p>THESE facts I give upon the authority of <hi>Mons. de Tot</hi> in his <hi>Reflections politiques,</hi> an author of reputation. Tho' I must con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fess, that the facts, which he advances on other occasions, are often so suspicious as to make his authority less in this matter. However, the general observation, that the augmenting the mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney in <hi>France</hi> does not at first proportionably augment the prices, is certainly just.</p>
                  <p>By the bye, this seems to be one of the best reasons for a gradu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>al and universal augmentation of the money, which can be given, tho' it has been entirely overlook'd in all those volumes, which have been wrote on that question by <hi>Melon, Du Tot,</hi> and <hi>Paris de Verney.</hi> Were all our money, for instance, recoin'd, and a penny's worth of silver taken from every shilling, the new shil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ling wou'd probably purchase every thing that cou'd have been bought by the old; the prices of every thing wou'd thereby be in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sensibly diminish'd; foreign trade enliven'd; and domestic indus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try, by the circulation of a greater number of pounds and shillings, wou'd receive some encrease and encouragement. In executing such a project, 'twou'd be better to make the new shilling pass for 24 half-pence, in order to preserve the illusion, and make it be ta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ken for the same.</p>
               </note> Not to mention, the
<pb n="50" facs="53"/>
great addition of gold and silver, which may have come into that kingdom, since the former period.</p>
            <p>FROM the whole of this reasoning we may con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clude, that 'tis of no manner of consequence, with regard to the domestic happiness of a state, whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther money be in a greater or less quantity. The good policy of the magistrate consists only in keep<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing it, if possible, still encreasing; because, by that means, he keeps a spirit of industry alive in the na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, and encreases the stock of labour, wherein consists all real power and riches. A nation, whose money decreases, is actually, at that time, much weaker and more miserable, than another nation, who possesses no more money, but is on the en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>creasing hand. This will be easily accounted for, if we consider, that the alterations in the quantity of money, either on the one side or the other, are not immediately attended with proportionable alte<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rations in the prices of commodities. There is al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ways an interval before matters be adjusted to their new situation; and this interval is as pernicious to industry, when gold and silver are diminishing, as it is advantageous, when these metals are encreasing. The workman has not the same employment from the manufacturer and merchant; tho' he pays the same price for every thing in the market. The farmer cannot dispose of his corn and cattle; tho' he must pay the same rent to his landlord. The
<pb n="51" facs="54"/>
poverty and beggary and sloth, which must ensue, are easily foreseen.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>second</hi> observation I propos'd to make with regard to money, may be explain'd after the following manner. There are some kingdoms, and many provinces in <hi>Europe,</hi> (and all of them were once in the same condition) where money is so scarce, that the landlord can get none at all from his tenants; but is oblig'd to take his rent in kind, and either to consume it himself, or transport it to pla<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces, where he may find a market. In those coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tries, the prince can levy few or no taxes, but in the same manner: And as he will receive very small benefit from impositions so pay'd, 'tis evi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dent, that such a kingdom has very little force e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven at home; and cannot maintain fleets and ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mies to the same extent, as if every part of it a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bounded in gold and silver. There is surely a greater disproportion betwixt the force of <hi>Germany</hi> at present and what it was three centuries ago,<note place="bottom" n="*">THE <hi>Italians</hi> gave to the emperor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> the nick<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>name of <hi>Pocchi-danari.</hi> None of the enterprises of that prince e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver succeeded, for want of money.</note> than there is in its industry, people and manfac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tures. The <hi>Austrian</hi> dominions in the empire are in general well peopled and well cultivated, and are of great extent, but have not a proportionable weight in the balance of <hi>Europe;</hi> proceeding, as is commonly suppos'd, from their scarcity of money. How do all these facts agree with that principle of
<pb n="52" facs="55"/>
reason, that the quantity of gold and silver is in it<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self altogether indifferent? According to that prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciple, wherever a sovereign has numbers of sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jects, and these have plenty of commodities, he shou'd, of course, be great and powerful, and they rich and happy, independent of the greater or les<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ser abundance of the precious metals. These ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mit of divisions and sub-divisions to a great extent; and where they wou'd become so small as to be in danger of being lost, 'tis easy to mix them with a baser metal, as is practis'd in some countries of <hi>Europe;</hi> and by that means raise them to a bulk more sensible and convenient. They still serve the same purposes of exchange, whatever their num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber may be, or whatever colour they may be sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pos'd to have.</p>
            <p>To these difficulties I answer, that the effect, here suppos'd to flow from scarcity of money, re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ally arises from the manners and customs of the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>habitants, and that we mistake, as is usual, a col<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lateral effect for a cause. The contradiction is only apparent; but it requires some thought and reflection to discover the principles, by which we can reconcile <hi>reason</hi> to <hi>experience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seems a maxim almost self-evident, that the prices of every thing depend on the proportion be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>twixt commodities and money, and that any con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>siderable alteration on either of these has the same
<pb n="53" facs="56"/>
effect either of heightening or diminishing the price. Encrease the commodities, they become cheaper: Encrease the money, they rise in their value. As on the other hand, a diminution of the former, and that of the latter have contrary tendencies.</p>
            <p>'TIS also evident, that the prices do not so much depend on the absolute quantity of commodities and of money, which are in a nation; as on that of the commodities, which come or may come to market, and of the money, which circulates. If the coin be lockt up in chests, 'tis the same thing with regard to prices, as if it were annihilated: If the commodities be hoarded in granaries, a like effect follows. As the money and commodities, in these cases, never meet, they cannot affect each other. Were we, at any time, to form con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jectures concerning the prices of provisions, the corn, which the farmer must reserve for the main<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tenance of himself and family, ought never to en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter into the estimation. 'Tis only the overplus, compar'd to the demand, that determines the value.</p>
            <p>To apply these principles, we must consider, that in the first and more uncultivated ages of a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny state, e're fancy has confounded her wants with those of nature, men, contented with the produc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions of their own fields, or with those rude prepa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rations, which they themselves can work upon
<pb n="54" facs="57"/>
them, have little occasion for exchange, or at least for money, which, by agreement, is the common measure of exchange. The wool of the farmer's own flock, spun in his own family, and wrought by a neighbouring weaver, who receives his pay<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment in corn or wool, suffices for furniture and cloathing. The carpenter, the smith, the mason, the taylor are retain'd by wages of a like nature; and the landlord himself, dwelling in the neigh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bourhood, is contented to receive his rent in the commodities rais'd by the farmer. The greatest part of these he consumes at home, in rustic ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spitality: The rest, perhaps, he disposes of for mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney to the neighbouring town, whence he draws the materials of his expence and luxury.</p>
            <p>BUT after men begin to refine on all these en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>joyments, and live not always at home, nor are contented with what can be rais'd in their neigh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bourhood, there is more exchange and commerce of all kinds, and more money enters into that ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>change. The tradesmen will not be paid in corn; because they want something more than barely to eat. The farmer goes beyond his own parish for the commodities he purchases, and cannot always carry his commodities to the merchant, who sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plies him. The landlord lives in the capital or in a foreign country; and demands his rent in gold and silver, which can easily be transported to him. Great undertakers and manufacturers and mer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chants
<pb n="55" facs="58"/>
arise in every commodity; and these can conveniently deal in nothing but in specie. And consequently, in this situation of society, the coin enters into many more contracts, and by that means is much more employ'd than in the former.</p>
            <p>THE necessary effect is, that provided the mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney does not encrease in the nation, every thing must become much cheaper in times of industry and refinement, than in rude, uncultivated ages. 'Tis the proportion betwixt the money, that cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culates, and the commodities in the market, that determines the prices. Goods, that are consum'd at home, or exchang'd with other goods in the neighbourhood, never come to market; they af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect not, in the least, the current specie; with re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard to it they are as if totally annihilated; and consequently this method of using them sinks the proportion on the side of the commodities, and en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>creases the prices. But after money enters into all contracts and sales, and is every where the measure of exchange, the same national cash has a much greater task to perform; all commodities are then in the market; the sphere of circulation is enlarg'd; 'tis the same case as if that individual sum were to serve a larger kingdom; and therefore, the proportion being here diminish'd on the side of the money, every thing must become cheaper, and the prices gradually fall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="59"/>
BY the most exact computations, that have been form'd all over <hi>Europe,</hi> after making allowance for the change in the numerary value or the deno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mination, 'tis found, that the prices of all things have only risen three, or at most four times since the discovery of the <hi>West Indies.</hi> But will any one assert, that there is no more than four times the coin in <hi>Europe,</hi> that was in the fifteenth cen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tury and the centuries preceding it? The <hi>Spani<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ards</hi> and <hi>Portuguese</hi> from their mines, the <hi>En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>glish, French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> by their <hi>African</hi> trade, and by their interlopers in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> bring home about seven millions a year, of which not a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bove a tenth part goes to the <hi>East Indies.</hi> This sum alone in five years would probably double the antient stock of money in <hi>Europe.</hi> And no other satisfactory reason can be given, why all prices have not risen to a much more exorbitant height, except that deriv'd from a change of customs and manners. Besides, that more commodities are produc'd by additional industry, the same commo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dities come more to market, after men depart from their antient simplicity of manners. And tho' this encrease has not been equal to that of mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney, it has, however, been considerable, and has preserv'd the proportion betwixt coin and commo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dities nearer the antient standard.</p>
            <p>WERE the question propos'd, which of these methods of living in the people, the simple or the
<pb n="57" facs="60"/>
refin'd, is the most advantageous to the state or pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lic, I shou'd, without much scruple, prefer the latter, in a view to politics at least; and should produce this as an additional reason for the encou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ragement of trade and manufactures.</p>
            <p>WHEN men live in the antient simple manner, and supply all their necessities from their domestic industry or from the neighbourhood, the sovereign can levy no taxes in money from a considerable part of his subjects; and if he will impose on them any burthens, he must take his payment in commodities, with which alone they abound; a method attended with such great and obvious in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>conveniencies, that they need not here be insisted on. All the money he can pretend to raise must be from his principal cities, where alone it circu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lates; and these, 'tis evident, cannot afford him so much as the whole state cou'd, did gold and sil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver circulate thro' the whole. But besides this obvious diminution of the revenue, there is also another cause of the poverty of the public in such a situation. Not only the sovereign receives less money, but the same money goes not so far as in times of industry and general commerce. Every thing is dearer, where the gold and silver are sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pos'd equal; and that because fewer commodities come to market, and the whole coin bears a high<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>er proportion to what is to be purchas'd by it;
<pb n="58" facs="61"/>
whence alone the prices of every thing are fix'd and determin'd.</p>
            <p>HERE then we may learn the fallacy of the re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mark, often to be met with in historians, and even in common conversation, that any particular state is weak, tho' fertile, populous, and well cultivat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, merely because it wants money. It appears, that the want of money can never injure any state within itself: For men and commodities are the real strength of any community. 'Tis the simple manner of living which here hurts the public, by confining the gold and silver to few hands, and preventing its universal diffusion and circulation. On the contrary, industry and refinements of all kinds incorporate it with the whole state, however small its quantity may be: They digest it into e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very vein, so to speak; and make it enter into e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very transaction and contract. No hand is entire<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly empty of it; and as the prices of every thing fall by that means, the sovereign has a double advan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tage: He may draw money by his taxes from every part of the state, and what he receives goes farther in every purchase and payment.</p>
            <p>WE may infer, from a comparison of prices, that money is not more plentiful in <hi>China,</hi> than it was in <hi>Europe</hi> three centuries ago: But what im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mense power is that empire possest of, if we may judge by the civil and military list, maintain'd by
<pb n="59" facs="62"/>
it? <hi>Polybius</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Lib. 2. cap. 15.</note> tells us, that provisions were so cheap in <hi>Italy</hi> during his time, that in some places the stated club in the inns was a <hi>semis</hi> a head, little more than a farthing: Yet the <hi>Roman</hi> power had even then subdu'd the whole known world. A<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bout a century before that period, the <hi>Carthagini<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>an</hi> ambassadors said, by way of raillery, that no people liv'd more sociably amongst themselves than the <hi>Romans;</hi> for that in every entertainment, which, as foreign ministers, they receiv'd, they still observ'd the same plate at every table.<note place="bottom" n="†">
                  <hi>Plin.</hi> lib. 33. cap. 11.</note> The absolute quantity of the precious metals is a mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter of great indifference. There are only two cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstances of any importance, <hi>viz.</hi> their gradual encrease, and their thorough concoction and cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culation thro' the state; and the influence of both these circumstances has been here explained.</p>
            <p>IN the following discourse we shall see an in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stance of a like fallacy, as that above mention'd; where a collateral effect is taken for a cause, and where a consequence is ascrib'd to the plenty of money; tho' it be really owing to a change in the manners and customs of the people.</p>

            <head>DISCOURSE IV. <hi>Of Interest.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>NOTHING is esteem'd a more certain sign of the flourishing condition of any nation than the lowness of interest: And with reason; tho' I believe the cause is somewhat different from what is commonly apprehended. The lowness of interest is generally ascrib'd to the plenty of money. But money, however plentiful, has no other ef<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect, <hi>if fixt,</hi> than to raise the price of labour. Sil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver is more common than gold; and therefore you receive a greater quantity of it for the same com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>modities: But do you pay less interest for it? In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terest in <hi>Batavia</hi> and <hi>Jamaica</hi> is at 10 <hi>per cent.</hi> in <hi>Portugal</hi> at 6; tho' these places, as we may learn from the prices of every thing, abound much more in gold and silver than either <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Amster<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WERE all the gold in <hi>England</hi> annihilated at once, and one and twenty shillings substituted in the place of every guinea, wou'd money be more plentiful or interest lower? No surely: We shou'd only use silver instead of gold. Were gold ren<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der'd as common as silver, and silver as common as copper; would money be more plentiful or in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terest
<pb n="62" facs="64"/>
lower? We may assuredly give the same an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swer. Our shillings would then be yellow, and our half-pence white; and we shou'd have no guineas. No other difference wou'd ever be observ'd. No alteration on commerce, manufactures, navigation, or interest; unless we imagine, that the colour of the metal is of any consequence.</p>
            <p>NOW what is so visible in these greater variations of scarcity or abundance of the precious metals, must hold in all inferior changes. If the multiply<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing gold and silver fifteen times makes no diffe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rence, much less can the doubling or tripling them. All augmentation has no other effect than to heigh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ten the price of labour and commodities; and e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven this variation is little more than that of a name. In the progress towards these changes, the aug<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mentation may have some influence, by exciting industry; but after the prices are settled, suitable to the new abundance of gold and silver, it has no manner of influence.</p>
            <p>AN effect always holds proportion with its cause. Prices have risen about four times, since the dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>covery of the <hi>Indies;</hi> and 'tis probable gold and silver have multiply'd much more: But interest has not fallen much above half. The rate of interest, therefore, is not deriv'd from the quantity of the precious metals.</p>

               <pb n="63" facs="65"/>
MONEY having merely a fictitious value, aris<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing from the agreement and convention of men, the greater or less plenty of it is of no consequence, if we consider a nation within itself; and when once fixt, tho' in never so great abundance, it has no other effect, than to oblige every one to tell out a greater number of those shining bits of me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tal, for cloaths, furniture, or equipage, without en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>creasing any one convenience of life. If a man borrows money to build a house, he then carries home a greater load; because the stone, timber, lead, glass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the labour of the masons and carpenters, are represented by a greater quantity of gold and silver. But as these metals are con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sider'd merely as representations, there can no al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>teration arise, from their bulk or quantity, their weight or colour, either upon their real value or their interest. The same interest, in all cases, bears the same proportion to the sum. And if you lent me so much labour and so many commodities; by receiving five <hi>per cent.</hi> you receive always pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>portional labour and commodities, however repre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sented, whether by yellow or white coin, whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther by a pound or an ounce.

HIGH interest arises from <hi>three</hi> circumstances: A great demand for borrowing; little riches to supply that demand; and great profits arising from commerce: And these circumstances are a clear proof of the small advance of commerce and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dustry, not of the scarcity of gold and silver. Low interest, on the other hand, proceeds from the three opposite circumstances: A small demand for borrowing; great riches to supply that demand; and small profits arising from commerce: And these circumstances are all connected together, and proceed from the encrease of industry and com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce, not of gold and silver. We shall endea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vour to prove these points as fully and distinctly as possible, and shall begin with the causes and the effects of a great or small demand for borrowing.</p>
            <p>WHEN a people have emerg'd ever so little from a state of barbarity, and their numbers have en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>creas'd beyond the original multitude, there must immediately arise an inequality of property; and while some possess large tracts of land, others are confin'd within narrow limits, and some are en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tirely without any landed property. Those, who possess more land than they can labour, employ those who possess none, and agree to receive a de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terminate part of the product. Thus the <hi>landed</hi> interest is immediately establish'd; nor is there any settled government, however rude, wherein
<pb n="65" facs="67"/>
affairs are not on this footing. Of these proprie<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tors of land, some must presently discover them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves to be of different tempers from others; and while one wou'd willingly store up the product of his land for futurity, another desires to consume at present what shou'd suffice for many years. But as the spending a settled revenue is a way of life en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tirely without occupation; men have so much need of somewhat to fix and engage them, that pleasures, such as they are, will be the pursuit of the greatest part of the landholders, and the prodigals amongst them will always be more numerous than the mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sers. In a state, therefore, where there is nothing but a landed interest, as there is little frugality, the borrowers must be very numerous, and the rate of interest must hold proportion to it. The difference depends not on the quantity of money, but on the habits and manners which prevail. By this alone the demand for borrowing is encreas'd or diminish'd. Were money so plentiful as to make an egg be sold for six-pence; as long as there are only land<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed gentry and peasants in the state, the borrowers must be numerous, and interest high. The rent for the same farm wou'd be heavier and more bul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ky: But the same idleness of the landlord, with the higher prices of commodities, wou'd dissipate it in the same time, and produce the same necessi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty and demand for borrowing.<note place="bottom" n="*">I HAVE been inform'd by a very eminent lawyer and a man of great knowledge and observation, that it appears from antient papers and records, that, about four centuries ago, money, in <hi>Scot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land,</hi> and probably in other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> was only at five <hi>per cent.</hi> and afterwards rose to ten before the discovery of the <hi>West In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dies.</hi> This fact is curious; but might easily be reconcil'd to the foregoing reasoning. Men, in that age, liv'd so much at home, and in so very simple and frugal a manner, that they had no occasion for money; and tho' the lenders were then few, the borrowers were still fewer. The high rate of interest among the early <hi>Romans</hi> is accounted for by historians from the frequent losses sustain'd by the inroads of the enemy.</note>

               <pb n="66" facs="68"/>
NOR is the case different with regard to the <hi>se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cond</hi> circumstance we propos'd to consider, <hi>viz.</hi> the great or little riches to supply this demand. This effect also depends on the habits and ways of living of the people, not on the quantity of gold and silver. In order to have, in any state, a great number of lenders, 'tis not sufficient nor requisite, that there be great abundance of the precious me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tals. 'Tis only requisite, that the property or com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mand of that quantity, which is in the state, whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther great or small, should be collected in particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lar hands, so as to form considerable sums, or com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose a great money'd interest. This begets a num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber of lenders, and sinks the rate of usury; and this, I shall venture to affirm, depends not on the quan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tity of specie, but on particular manners and cus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>toms, which make the specie gather into separate sums or masses of considerable value.</p>
            <p>FOR suppose, that, by miracle, every man in <hi>Britain</hi> shou'd have five pounds slipt into his poc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ket in one night; this wou'd much more than
<pb n="67" facs="69"/>
double the whole money that is at present in the kingdom, and yet there would not next day, nor for some time, be any more lenders, nor any vari<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ation on the interest. And were there nothing but landlords and peasants in the state, this money, however abundant, cou'd never gather into sums, and wou'd only serve to encrease the prices of e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very thing, without any farther consequence. The prodigal landlord dissipates it, as fast as he receives it; and the beggarly peasant has no means nor view nor ambition of obtaining above a bare livelihood. The overplus of borrowers above that of lenders continuing still the same, there will follow no re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duction of interest. That depends upon another principle, and must proceed from an encrease of in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dustry and frugality, of arts and commerce.</p>
            <p>EVERY thing, useful to the life of man, arises from the ground; but few things arise in that con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dition, which is requisite to render them useful. There must, therefore, beside the peasants and the proprietors of land, be another rank of men, who, receiving from the former the rude materials, work them into their proper form, and retain part for their own use and subsistence. In the infancy of society, these contracts betwixt the artizans and the peasants, and betwixt one species of artizan and another, are commonly enter'd into immediately, by the persons themselves, who, being neighbours, are readily acquainted with each other's necessities,
<pb n="68" facs="70"/>
and can lend their mutual assistance to supply them. But when mens industry encreases, and their views enlarge; 'tis found, that the most remote parts of the state can assist each other as well as the more contiguous, and that this intercourse of good offi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces may be carry'd on to the greatest extent and intricacy. Hence the origin of <hi>merchants,</hi> the most useful race of men in the whole society, who serve as agents betwixt those parts of the state, that are wholly unacquainted, and are ignorant of each o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther's necessities. Here are in a city fifty workmen in silk and linen and a thousand customers; and these two ranks of men, so necessary to each other, can never rightly meet, 'till one man erects a shop, to which all the workmen, and all the customers repair. In this province, grass rises in abundance: The inhabitants abound in cheese and butter and cattle; but want bread and corn, which, in a neighbour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing province, are in too great abundance for the uses of the inhabitants. One man discovers this. He brings corn from the one province, and returns with cattle; and supplying the wants of both, he is, so far, a common benefactor. As the people en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>crease in numbers and industry, the difficulty of their mutual intercourse encreases: The business of the agency or merchandize becomes more intri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cate; and divides, sub-divides, compounds, and mixes to a greater variety. In all these transacti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons, 'tis necessary and reasonable, that a consider<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able part of the commodities and labour shou'd be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>long
<pb n="69" facs="71"/>
to the merchant, to whom, in a great mea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure, they are owing. And these commodities he will sometimes preserve in kind, or more common<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly convert into money, which is their common re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>presentation. If gold and silver have encreas'd in the state along with industry, it will require a great quantity of these metals to represent a great quan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tity of commodities and labour. If industry alone has encreas'd, the prices of every thing must sink, and a very small quantity of specie will serve as a representation.</p>
            <p>THERE is no craving or demand of the human mind more constant and insatiable than that for ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ercise and employment; and this desire seems the foundation of most of our passions and pursuits. Deprive a man of all business and serious occupa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, he runs restless from one amusement to ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther; and the weight and oppression, which he feels from idleness, is so great, that he forgets the ruin, which must follow from his immoderate ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pences. Give him a more harmless way of em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ploying his mind or body, he is satisfied, and feels no longer that insatiable thirst after pleasure. But if the employment you give him be profitable, e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>specially if the profit be attach'd to every particular exertion of industry, he has gain so often in his eye, that he acquires, by degrees, a passion for it, and knows no such pleasure as that of seeing the daily encrease of his fortune. And this is the reason why
<pb n="70" facs="72"/>
trade encreases frugality, and why, among mer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chants, there is the same overplus of misers above prodigals, as, among the possessors of land, there is the contrary.</p>
            <p>COMMERCE encreases industry, by conveying it readily from one member of the state to another, and allowing none of it to perish or become useless. It encreases frugality, by giving occupation to men, and employing them in the arts of gain, which soon engage their affection, and remove them from all relish of pleasure and expence. 'Tis an infallible consequence of all industrious professions to beget frugality, and make the love of gain prevail over the love of pleasure. Among lawyers and physi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cians, who have any practice, there are many more, who live within their income, than who exceed it, or even live up to it. But lawyers and physici<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ans beget no industry; and 'tis even at the expence of others they acquire their riches; so that they are sure to diminish the possessions of some of their fel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low citizens as fast as they encrease their own. Merchants, on the contrary, beget industry, by serving as canals to convey it thro' every corner of the state; and, at the same time, by their frugality, they acquire great power over that in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dustry, and collect a large property in the labour and commodities, which they are the chief instru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments in producing. There is no other profession, therefore, except merchandize, which can make
<pb n="71" facs="73"/>
the money'd interest considerable, or in other words, can encrease industry, and by also encreasing fru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gality, give a great command of that industry to particular members of the society. Without com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce, the state must consist chiefly of landed gen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try, whose prodigality and expence make a con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinual demand for borrowing; and of peasants, who have no sums to supply that demand. The mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney never gathers into large stocks or sums, that can be lent at interest. It is disperst into number<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>less hands, who either squander it in idle show and magnificence, or employ it in the purchase of the common necessaries of life. Commerce alone assembles it into considerable sums; and this effect it has merely from the industry, which it begets, and the frugality, which it inspires, independent of the quantity of precious metal, which may cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culate in the state.</p>
            <p>THUS an encrease of commerce, by a necessary and infallible consequence, raises a great number of lenders, and by that means produces a lowness of interest. We must now consider how far this encrease of commerce diminishes the profits aris<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing from that profession, and gives rise to the <hi>third</hi> circumstance requisite to produce a lowness of in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terest.</p>
            <p>IT may be proper to observe on this head, that low interest and low profits of merchandize are
<pb n="72" facs="74"/>
two events, that mutually forward each other, and are both originally deriv'd from that extensive com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce, which produces opulent merchants, and renders the money'd interest considerable. Where merchants possess great stocks, whether represent<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed by few or many pieces of metal, it must fre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently happen, that, when they either become tir'd of business, or have heirs unwilling or unfit to engage in commerce, a great deal of these riches naturally seeks an annual and secure revenue. The plenty diminishes their price, and makes the lend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ers accept of a low interest. This consideration obliges many to keep their stocks in trade, and ra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther be content with low profit than dispose of their money at an under-value. On the other hand, when commerce has become very extensive, and employs very large stocks, there must arise rival<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ships among the merchants, which diminish the profits of trade; at the same time, that they en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>crease the trade itself. The low profits of mer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chandize induce the merchants to accept more willingly of a low interest, when they leave off business, and begin to indulge themselves in ease and indolence. It is needless, therefore, to enquire, which of these circumstances, <hi>viz. low interest</hi> or <hi>low profits,</hi> is the cause, and which the effect. They both arise from an extensive commerce, and mu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tually forward each other. No man will accept of low profits, where he can have high interest; and no man will accept of low interest, where he can
<pb n="73" facs="75"/>
have high profits. An extensive commerce, by pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ducing large stocks, diminishes both interest and profit, and is always assisted, in its diminution of the one, by the proportional sinking of the other. I may add, that as low profits arise from the en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>crease of commerce and industry; they serve in their turn to the farther encrease of commerce, by ren<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dering the commodities cheaper, encreasing the consumption, and heightening the industry. And thus, if we consider the whole connexion of causes and effects, interest is the true barometer of the state, and its lowness is a sign almost infallible of the flourishing of a people. It proves the encrease of industry, and its prompt circulation thro' the whole state, little inferior to a demonstration. And tho', perhaps, it may not be impossible but a sudden and a great check to commerce may have a momenta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry effect of the same kind, by throwing so many stocks out of trade; it must be attended with such misery and want of employment in the poor, that, besides its short duration, it will not be possible to mistake the one case for the other.</p>
            <p>THOSE, who have asserted, that the plenty of money was the cause of low interest, seem to have taken a collateral effect for a cause; since the same industry, which sinks the interest, does common<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly acquire great abundance of the precious metals. A variety of fine manufactures, along with vigilant, enterprising merchants, will soon draw money to
<pb n="74" facs="76"/>
a state, if it be any where to be found in the world. The same cause, by multiplying the conveniences of life, and encreasing industry, collects great riches into the hands of persons, who are not proprietors of land, and produces by that means a lowness of interest. But tho' these effects, plenty of money and low interest, do both naturally arise from com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce and industry, they are altogether indepen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dent of each other. For, suppose a nation remov'd into the <hi>Pacific</hi> ocean, without any foreign com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce or any knowledge of navigation: Suppose, that this nation possesses always the same stock of coin, but is continually encreasing in its numbers and industry: 'Tis evident, that the price of eve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry commodity must gradually diminish in that king<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom; since 'tis the proportion betwixt money and any species of goods, which fixes their mutual va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lue; and upon the present supposition, the conve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niences of life become every day more abundant, without any alteration on the current specie. A less quantity of money, therefore, amongst this people, will make a rich man, during the times of industry, than wou'd serve to that purpose, in ig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>norant and slothful ages. Less money will build a house, portion a daughter, buy an estate, support a manufactory, or maintain a family and equipage. These are the uses, for which men borrow money; and therefore, the greater or less quantity of it in a state has no influence on the interest. But 'tis evident, that the greater or less stock of labour
<pb n="75" facs="77"/>
and commodities must have a great influence; since we really and in effect borrow these, when we take money upon interest. 'Tis true, when commerce is extended all over the globe, the most industrious nations always abound most with the precious me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tals: So that low interest and plenty of money are in fact almost inseparable. But still 'tis of conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quence to know the principle, whence any pheno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>menon arises, and to distinguish betwixt a cause and a concomitant effect. Besides, that the specu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lation is curious, it may frequently be of use in the conduct of public affairs. At least, it must be own'd, that nothing can be of more use than to improve, by practice, the method of reasoning on these sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jects, which, of all others, are the most important; tho' they are commonly treated in the loosest and most careless manner.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER reason of this popular mistake with regard to the cause of low interest seems to be the instance of some nations; where, after a sudden ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quisition of riches or of the precious metals, by means of foreign conquest, the interest has fal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>len, not only amongst them, but in all the neigh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bouring states, as soon as that money was disperst, and had insinuated itself into every corner. Thus, interest in <hi>Spain</hi> fell near a half immediately after the discovery of the <hi>West Indies,</hi> as we are inform'd by <hi>Garcilasso de la Vega:</hi> And it has been ever since gradually sinking in every kingdom of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="78"/>
Interest in <hi>Rome,</hi> after the conquest of <hi>Egypt,</hi> fell from 6 to 4 <hi>per cent.</hi> as we learn from <hi>Dion.</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Lib. 51.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE causes of the sinking of interest upon such an event seem different in the conquering country and in the neighbouring states; but in neither of them can we justly ascribe that effect merely to the encrease of gold and silver.</p>
            <p>IN the conquering country, 'tis natural to ima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gine, that this new acquisition of money will fall into a few hands, and be gather'd into large sums, which seek a secure revenue, either by the pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chase of land or by interest; and consequently the same effect follows, for a little time, as if there had been a great occasion of industry and com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce. The encrease of lenders above the bor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rowers sinks the interest; and so much the fast<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>er, if those, who have acquir'd those large sums, find no industry or commerce in the state, and no method of employing their money but by lending it at interest. But after this new mass of gold and silver has been digested and has circulated, thro' the whole state, affairs will soon return to their former situation: While the landlords and new money-holders, living idly, squander above their in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>come; and the former daily contract debt, and the latter encroach on their stock 'till its final extinc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion. The whole money may still be in the state,
<pb n="77" facs="79"/>
and make itself felt by the encrease of prices: But not being now collected into any large masses or stocks, the disproportion betwixt the borrowers and lenders is the same as formerly, and conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently the high interest returns.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY we find, in <hi>Rome,</hi> that so ear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly as <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s time, interest had again mounted to 6 <hi>per cent.</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <hi>Columella,</hi> lib. 3. cap. 3.</note> tho' no accident had happen'd to drain the empire of money. In <hi>Trajan</hi>'s time, money, lent on mortgages in <hi>Italy,</hi> bore 6 <hi>per cent.</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="†">

                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> lib. 10. ep. 62.</note> And if interest in <hi>Spain</hi> has not risen to its old pitch; this can be ascrib'd to nothing but the continuance of the same cause, that sunk it, <hi>viz.</hi> the large fortunes continually made in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which come over to <hi>Spain,</hi> from time to time, and supply the de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mand of the borrowers. But this accidental and extraneous cause, more money is to be lent in <hi>Spain;</hi> that is, more money is collected into large sums, than would otherways be found in a state, where there are so little commerce and industry.</p>
            <p>As to the reduction of interest, which has fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low'd in <hi>England, France,</hi> and other kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> that have no mines, it has been gra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dual, and has not proceeded from the encrease of money, consider'd merely in itself, but from the
<pb n="78" facs="80"/>
encrease of industry, which is the natural effect of the former encrease, in that interval, before it rais<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>es the price of labour and provisions. For to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn to the foregoing supposition; if the industry of <hi>England</hi> had risen as much from other causes (and that rise might easily have happen'd, tho' the stock of money had remain'd the same) must not all the same consequences have follow'd, which we observe at present? The same people wou'd, in that case, be found in the kingdom, the same commo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dities, the same industry, manufactures and com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>merce, and consequently the same merchants, with the same stocks, that is, with the same command over labour and commodities, only represented by a smaller number of white or yellow pieces: Which being a circumstance of no moment, would only affect the waggoner, porter, and trunk-maker. Lu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>xury, therefore, manufactures, arts, industry, fru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gality, flourishing equally as at present, 'tis evident that interest must also have been as low; since that is the necessary result of all these circumstances; so far as they determine the profits of commerce, and the proportion betwixt the borrowers and lend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ers in any state.</p>

            </head>
            <p>'TIS very usual, amongst nations ignorant of the nature of commerce, to prohibit the exportation of commodities, and to preserve a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mongst themselves, whatever they think valuable and useful. They consider not, that, in this pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hibition, they act directly contrary to their inten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions, and that the more is exported of any com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>modity, the more will be rais'd at home, of which they themselves will always have the first offer.</p>
            <p>'TIS well known to the learned, that the antient laws of <hi>Athens</hi> render'd the exportation of figs cri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>minal; that being suppos'd a species of fruit so ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cellent in <hi>Attica,</hi> that the <hi>Athenians</hi> esteem'd it too delicious for the palate of any foreigner. And in this ridiculous prohibition they were so much in earnest, that informers were thence called sy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cophants among them, from two <hi>Greek</hi> words, which signify <hi>figs</hi> and <hi>discoverer.</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Plut. <hi>de curiositate.</hi>
               </note> I have been told, that many old acts of parliament show the same ignorance in the nature of commerce. And to this day, in a neighbouring kingdom, the exporta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of corn is almost always prohibited; in order,
<pb n="80" facs="82"/>
as they say, to prevent famines; tho' 'tis evident, that nothing contributes more to the frequent fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mines, which so much distress that fertile country.</p>
            <p>THE same jealous fear with regard to money has also prevail'd amongst several nations; and it requir'd both reason and experience to convince any people, that these prohibitions serve to no other purpose than to raise the exchange against them, and produce a still greater exportation.</p>
            <p>THESE errors, one may say, are gross and palp<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able: But there still prevails, even amongst nati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons well acquainted with commerce, a strong jea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lousy with regard to the balance of trade, and a fear, that all their gold and silver may be leaving them. This seems to me, almost in every case, a very groundless apprehension; and I shou'd as soon dread, that all our springs and rivers wou'd be exhausted, as that money shou'd abandon a king<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom, where there are people and industry. Let us carefully preserve these latter advantages; and we need never be apprehensive of losing the former.</p>
            <p>'TIS easy to observe, that all calculations con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerning the balance of trade are founded on very uncertain facts and suppositions. The custom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>house books are own'd to be an insufficient ground of reasoning; nor is the rate of exchange much better, unless we consider it with all nations, and
<pb n="81" facs="83"/>
know also the proportions of the several sums re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mitted; which one may safely pronounce impos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sible. Every man, who has ever reason'd on this subject, has always prov'd his theory, whatever it was, by facts and calculations, and by an enume<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ration of all the commodities sent to all foreign kingdoms.</p>
            <p>THE writings of Mr. <hi>Gee</hi> struck the nation with an universal pannic, when they saw it plainly de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monstrated, by a detail of particulars, that the ba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lance was against them for so considerable a sum as must leave them without a single shilling in five or six years. But, luckily, twenty years have since elaps'd, along with an expensive foreign war; and yet 'tis commonly suppos'd, that money is still more plentiful amongst us than in any former period.</p>
            <p>NOTHING can be more entertaining on this head than Dr. <hi>Swift;</hi> an author, who has more humour than knowledge, more taste than judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, and more spleen, prejudice, and passion than any of these qualities. He says, in his <hi>short view of the state of</hi> Ireland, that the whole cash of that kingdom amounted but to 500,000 <hi>l.</hi> that out of this they remitted every year a neat million to <hi>Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land,</hi> and had scarce any other source to compen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sate themselves from, and little other foreign trade but the importation of <hi>French</hi> wines, for which they pay'd ready money. The consequence of
<pb n="82" facs="84"/>
this situation, which must be own'd disadvantage<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous, was, that in a course of three years, the cur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rent money of <hi>Ireland,</hi> from 500,000 <hi>l.</hi> was re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duc'd to less than two. And at present, I suppose, in a course of near 30 years, it is absolutely nothing. Yet I know not how, that opinion of the advance of riches in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which gave the doctor so much indignation, seems still to continue, and gain ground amongst every body.</p>
            <p>IN short, this apprehension of the wrong balance of trade, appears of such a nature, that it discovers itself, wherever one is out of humour with the ministry, or is in low spirits; and as it can never be refuted by a particular detail of all the exports, which counterbalance the imports, it may here be proper to form a general argument, which may prove the impossibility of that event, as long as we preserve our people and our industry.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSE four parts of all the money in <hi>Britain</hi> to be annihilated in one night, and the nation re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duc'd to the same condition, in this particular, as in the reigns of the <hi>Harrys</hi> and <hi>Edwards;</hi> what would be the consequence? Must not the price of all labour and commodities sink in proportion, and every thing be sold as cheap as they were in those ages? What nation could then dispute with us in any foreign market, or pretend to navigate or to sell manufactures at the same price, which to us
<pb n="83" facs="85"/>
wou'd afford sufficient profit? In how little time, therefore, must this bring back the money, which we had lost, and raise us to the level of all the neighbouring nations? Where, after we have ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riv'd, we immediately lose the advantage of the cheapness of labour and commodities; and the farther flowing in of money is stopt by our fulness and repletion.</p>
            <p>AGAIN; suppose, that all the money in <hi>Britain</hi> were multiply'd four-fold in a night, must not the contrary effect follow? Must not all labour and commodities rise to such an exorbitant height, that no neighbouring nations could afford to buy from us; while their commodities, on the other hand, became so cheap in comparison, that, in spite of all the laws, which cou'd be form'd, they wou'd be run in upon us, and our money wou'd flow out; 'till we fall to a level with foreigners, and lose that great superiority of riches, which had laid us under such disadvantages?</p>
            <p>Now 'tis evident, that the same causes, which wou'd correct these exorbitant inequalities, were they to happen miraculously, must prevent their happening in the common course of nature, and must for ever, in all neighbouring nations, preserve money nearly proportion'd to the art and industry of each nation. All water, wherever it commu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nicates, remains always at a level: Ask naturalists
<pb n="84" facs="86"/>
the reason; they tell you, that were it to be rais'd in any one place, the superior gravity of that part, not being balanc'd, must depress it, 'till it meets a counterpoize; and that the same cause, which re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dresses the inequality, when it happens, must for ever prevent it, without some violent, external o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>peration.<note place="bottom" n="*">THERE is another cause, tho' more limited in its operation, which checks the wrong balance of trade, to every particular nati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on, to which the kingdom trades. When we import more goods than we export, the exchange turns against us, and this becomes a new encouragement to export; as much as the charge of carriage and insurance of the money due would amount to. For the ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>change can never rise higher than that sum.</note>
            </p>
            <p>CAN one imagine, that it had ever been pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sible, by any laws, or even by any art, or industry, to have preserv'd all the money in <hi>Spain,</hi> which the galleons have brought from the <hi>Indies?</hi> Or that all commodities cou'd be sold in <hi>France</hi> for a tenth of the price they wou'd yield on the other side of the <hi>Pyrenees,</hi> without finding their way thither, and draining from that immense treasure? What other reason, indeed, is there, why all nations, at present, gain in their trade with <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gal;</hi> but because it is impossible to heap up mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney, more than any fluid, beyond its proper level? The sovereigns of these countries have shown, that they wanted not inclination to keep their gold and silver to themselves, had it been in any degree prac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="87"/>
BUT as any body of water may be rais'd above the level of the surrounding element, if the form<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>er has no communication with the latter; so in money, if the communication be cut off, by any material or physical impediment (for all laws alone are ineffectual) there may, in such a case, be a ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry great inequality of money. Thus the immense distance of <hi>China,</hi> along with the monopolies of our <hi>India</hi> companies, obstructing the communication, preserve in <hi>Europe</hi> the gold and silver, especially the latter, in much greater plenty than they are found in that kingdom. But notwithstanding this great obstruction, the force of the causes above mention'd is still evident. The skill and ingenu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ity of <hi>Europe</hi> in general much surpasses that of <hi>Chi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>na,</hi> with regard to manual arts and manufactures; yet are we never able to trade thither without great disadvantage: And were it not for the continual re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cruits we receive from <hi>America,</hi> money wou'd ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry soon sink in <hi>Europe,</hi> and rise in <hi>China,</hi> 'till it came nearly to a level in both places. Nor can any reasonable man doubt, but that industrious na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, were they as near us as <hi>Poland</hi> or <hi>Barba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry,</hi> would drain us of the overplus of our specie, and draw to themselves a larger share of the <hi>West Indian</hi> treasures. We need have no recourse to a physical attraction, to explain the necessity of this operation. There is a moral attraction, arising from the interests and passions of men, which is full as potent and infallible.</p>

HOW is the balance kept in the provinces of e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very kingdom among themselves, but by the force of this principle, which makes it impossible for mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney to lose its level, and either to rise or sink, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>yond the proportion of the labour and commodi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties, that is in each province? Did not long expe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rience make people easy on this head, what a fund of gloomy reflections might calculations afford a melancholy <hi>Yorkshire</hi> man; while he computed and magnify'd the sums drawn to <hi>London</hi> by taxes, absentees, commodities; and found on comparison the opposite articles so much inferior? And no doubt, had the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> subsisted in <hi>England,</hi> the legislature of each state had been continually a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larm'd by the fear of a wrong balance; and as 'tis probable, that the mutual hatred of these states wou'd have been extremely violent, on account of their close neighbourhood, they wou'd have loaded and opprest all commerce, by a jealous and superflu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous caution. Since the union has remov'd the bar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riers betwixt <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> which of these nations gains from the other by this free commerce? Or if the former kingdom has receiv'd any encrease of riches, can it be reasonable accounted for by a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny thing, but the encrease of its art and industry? 'Twas a common apprehension in <hi>England,</hi> before the union, as we learn from <hi>L'Abbe du Bos,</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Les interets d'Angleterre mal-entendus.</note> that <hi>Scotland</hi> wou'd soon drain them of their treasure,
<pb n="87" facs="89"/>
were an open trade allow'd; and on t'other side the <hi>Tweed</hi> a contrary apprehension prevail'd: With what justice in both, time has shown.</p>
            <p>WHAT happens in small portions of mankind must take place in greater. The provinces of the <hi>Roman</hi> empire, no doubt, kept their balance with each other, and with <hi>Italy,</hi> independent of the le<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gislature; as much as the several counties of <hi>Bri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain,</hi> or the several parishes of each county. And any man, who travels over <hi>Europe,</hi> at this day, may see, by the prices of commodities, that mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney, in spite of the absurd jealousy of princes and states, has brought itself nearly to a level, and that the difference betwixt one kingdom and another is not greater in this respect, than it is often betwixt different provinces of the same kingdom. Men naturally flock to capital cities, sea-ports, and na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vigable rivers. There we find more men, more industry, more labour, and consequently more mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney; but still the latter difference holds proportion with the former, and the level is preserv'd.<note place="bottom" n="*">IT must carefully be remark'd, that, throughout this discourse, wherever I speak of the level of money, I mean always its pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>portional level to the commodities, labour, industry, and skill, which is in the several states. And I assert, that, where these advantages are double, triple, quadruple, to what they are in the neighbouring states, the money infallibly will also be double, triple, quadruple. The only circumstance, that can obstrust the exact<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness of these proportions, is the expence of transporting the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>modities from one place to another; and this expence is sometimes unequal. Thus the corn, cattle, cheese, butter of <hi>Derbyshire</hi> cannot draw the money of <hi>London,</hi> so much as the manufactures of <hi>London</hi> draw the money of <hi>Derbyshire.</hi> But this objection is on<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly a seeming one: For so far as the transport of commodities is ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pensive, so far is the communication betwixt the places obstruct<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed and imperfect.</note>

OUR jealousy and our hatred of <hi>France</hi> are with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out bounds; and the former sentiment, at least, must be acknowledg'd very reasonable and well ground<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed. These passions have occasion'd innumerable barriers and obstructions upon commerce, where we are accus'd of being commonly the aggressors. But what have we gain'd by the bargain? We lost the <hi>French</hi> market for our woolen manufactures, and transferr'd the commerce of wine to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> where we buy much worse liquor at a higher price. There are few <hi>Englishmen,</hi> that wou'd not think their country absolutely ruin'd, were <hi>French</hi> wines sold in <hi>England</hi> so cheap and in such abundance as to supplant, in some measure, all ale and home-brewn liquors: But wou'd we lay a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>side prejudice, it wou'd not be difficult to prove, that nothing cou'd be more innocent, perhaps ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantageous. Each new acre of vineyard planted in <hi>France,</hi> in order to supply <hi>England</hi> with wine, wou'd make it requisite for the <hi>French</hi> to take the product of an <hi>English</hi> acre, sown in wheat or bar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ley, in order to subsist themselves; and 'tis evi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dent, we have thereby got command of the better commodity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="91"/>
THERE are many edicts of the <hi>French</hi> king, pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hibiting the planting of new vineyards, and order<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing all those lately planted to be grubb'd up: So sensible are they, in that country, of the superior value of corn, above every other product.</p>
            <p>MARESCHAL <hi>Vauban</hi> complains often, and with reason, of the absurd duties, which load the entry of wines of <hi>Languedoc, Guienne</hi> and those other southern provinces, that are imported into <hi>Britany</hi> and <hi>Normandy.</hi> He entertain'd no doubt, but these latter provinces cou'd preserve their ba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lance, notwithstanding the open commerce, which he recommends. And 'tis evident, that a few leagues more navigation to <hi>England</hi> wou'd make no difference: Or if it did, that it must operate alike on the commodities of both kingdoms.</p>
            <p>THERE is indeed one expedient, by which it is possible to sink, and another by which we may raise, money beyond its natural level in any king<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom; but these cases, when examin'd, will be found to resolve into our general theory, and to bring ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ditional authority to it.</p>
            <p>I SCARCE know any method of sinking money below its level; but those institutions of banks, funds, and paper credit, with which we are in this kingdom so much infatuated. These render
<pb n="90" facs="92"/>
paper equivalent to money, circulate it thro' the whole state, make it supply the place of gold and silver, raise proportionably the price of labour and commodities, and by that means either banish a great part of those precious metals, or prevent their farther encrease. What can be more short-sight<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed than our reasonings on this head? We fancy, because an individual wou'd be much richer, were his stock of money doubled, that the same good ef<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect wou'd follow were the money of every one encreas'd; not considering, that this wou'd raise as much the price of every commodity, and reduce every man, in time, to the same condition as be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore. 'Tis only in our public negotiations and transactions with foreigners, that a greater stock of money is advantageous; and as our paper is there absolutely insignificant, we feel, by its means, all the ill effects, arising from a great abundance of money, without reaping any of the advantages.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSE there are 12 millions of paper, that circulate in the kingdom as money (for we are not to imagine, that all our enormous funds are em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ploy'd in that shape) and suppose, that the real cash of the kingdom is 18 millions: Here is a state, which is found by experience able to hold a stock of 30 millions. I say, if it be able to hold it, it must of necessity have acquir'd it in gold and silver, had we not obstructed the entrance of these metals by this new invention of paper. <hi>Whence would it</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="93"/>
               <hi>have acquir'd that sum?</hi> From all the kingdoms of the world. <hi>But why?</hi> Because, if you remove these 12 millions, money in this state is below its level, compar'd with our neighbours; and we must immediately draw from all of them, till we be full and saturate, so to speak, and can hold no more. By our wise politics, we are as careful to stuff the nation with this fine commodity of bank<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bills and chequer-notes, as if we were afraid of be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing overburthen'd with the precious metals.</p>
            <p>'TIS not to be doubted, but the great plenty of bullion in <hi>France,</hi> is, in a great measure, owing to the want of paper credit. The <hi>French</hi> have no banks: Merchants bills do not there circulate as with us: Usury or lending on interest is not di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rectly permitted; so that many have large sums in their coffers: Great quantities of plate are us'd in private houses; and all the churches are full of it. By this means, provisions and labour still remain much cheaper amongst them than in nations that are not half so rich in gold and silver. The ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantage of this situation in point of trade, as well as in great public emergencies, is too evident to be disputed.</p>
            <p>THE same fashion, a few years ago, prevail'd in <hi>Genoa,</hi> which still has place in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land,</hi> of using services of <hi>China</hi> ware instead of plate; but the senate, wisely foreseeing the conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quences,
<pb n="92" facs="94"/>
prohibited the use of that brittle commo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dity beyond a certain extent; while the use of sil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver plate was left unlimited. And I suppose, in their late distresses, they felt the good effect of this ordonnance.<note place="bottom" n="*">OUR tax on plate is, perhaps, in this view, impolitic.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BEFORE the introduction of paper money into our colonies, they had gold and silver sufficient for their circulation. Since the introduction of that commodity, the least of the inconveniencies that has follow'd, is the total banishment of the preci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous metals. And after the abolition of paper, can it be doubted but money will return, while these colonies possess manufactures and commodities, the only things valuable in commerce, and for whose sake alone all men desire money.</p>
            <p>WHAT pity <hi>Lycurgus</hi> did not think of paper cre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dit, when he wanted to banish gold and silver from <hi>Sparta!</hi> It wou'd have serv'd his purpose better than the lumps of iron he made use of as money; and wou'd also have prevented more effectually all commerce with strangers, as being of so much less real and intrinsic value.</p>
            <p>BUT as our darling projects of paper credit are pernicious, being almost the only expedient, by which we can sink money below its level; so in my opinion the only expedient, by which we can raise money above its level, is a practice we wou'd all
<pb n="93" facs="95"/>
exclaim against as destructive, <hi>viz.</hi> the gathering large sums into a public treasure, locking them up, and absolutely preventing their circulation. The fluid, not communicating with the neigh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bouring element, may, by such an artifice, be rais'd to what height we please. To prove this, we need only return to our first supposition, of the anni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hilating the half or any part of our cash; where we found, that the immediate consequence of such an event wou'd be, the attraction of an equal sum from all the neighbouring kingdoms. Nor does there seem to be any necessary bounds set, by the nature of things, to this practice of hoarding. A small city, like <hi>Geneva,</hi> continuing this policy for ages, might engross nine tenths of the money of <hi>Europe.</hi> There seems, indeed, in the nature of man, an invincible obstacle to that immense growth of riches. A weak state, with an enormous treasure, wou'd soon become a prey to some of its poorer but more powerful neighbours. A great state wou'd dissipate its wealth on dangerous and ill<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>concerted projects; and probably destroy, along with it, what is much more valuable, the industry, morals, and numbers of its people. The fluid, in this case, rais'd to too great a height, bursts and destroys the vessel, that contains it; and mixing it<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self with the surrounding element, soon falls to its proper level.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="96"/>
So little are we commonly acquainted with this principle, that, tho' all historians agree in relating uniformly so recent an event, as the immense treasure amass'd by <hi>Harry</hi> the VII. (which they make amount to 1,700,000 pounds) we rather re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject their concurring testimony, than admit of a fact, which agrees so ill with our inveterate prejudices. 'Tis indeed probable, that that sum might be three fourths of all the money in <hi>England.</hi> But where is the difficulty that such a sum might be amass'd in twenty years, by a cunning, rapacious, frugal, and almost arbitrary monarch? Nor is it probable, that the diminution of circulating money was ever sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sibly felt by the people, or ever did them any pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>judice. The sinking of the prices of all commo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dities wou'd immediately replace it, by giving <hi>Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land</hi> the advantage in its commerce with all the neighbouring kingdoms.</p>
            <p>HAVE we not an instance in the small republic of <hi>Athens</hi> with its allies, who in about fifty years, betwixt the <hi>Median</hi> and <hi>Peloponesian</hi> wars, amass'd a sum greater than that of <hi>Harry</hi> the VII?<note place="bottom" n="*">There were about eight ounces of silver in a pound <hi>Sterling</hi> in <hi>Harry</hi> the VII,'s time.</note> For all the <hi>Greek</hi> historians <note place="bottom" n="†">

talents, which they afterwards dissipated to their own ruin, in rash and imprudent enterprises.

               <note place="bottom" n="*">The poverty, which <hi>Stanyan</hi> speaks of, is only to be seen in the most mountainous cantons, where there is no commodity to bring money: And even there the people are not poorer than in the diocese of <hi>Saltzburg</hi> on the one hand, or <hi>Savoy</hi> on the other; if they be so poor.</note>

            <p>THE account given by <hi>Appian</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="†">Proem.</note> of the treasure of the <hi>Ptolemies,</hi> is so prodigious, that one cannot ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mit
<pb n="97" facs="99"/>
of it; and so much the more, that the hi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>storian says the other successors of <hi>Alexander</hi> were also frugal, and had many of them treasures not much inferior. For this saving humour of the neigh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bouring princes must necessarily have check'd the frugality of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> monarchs, according to the foregoing theory. The sum he mentions is 740,000 talents or 191,166,666 pounds 13 shil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lings and 4 pence, according to Dr. <hi>Arbuthnot</hi>'s com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>putation. And yet <hi>Appian</hi> says, that he extracted his account from the public records; and he was himself a native of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM these principles we may learn what judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment we ought to form of those numberless bars, obstructions, and imposts, which all nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> and none more than <hi>England,</hi> have put upon trade; from an exorbitant desire of amassing money, which never will heap up beyond its le<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vel, while it circulates; or from an ill grounded ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prehension of losing their specie, which never will sink below it. Cou'd any thing scatter our riches, 'twou'd be such impolitic contrivances. But this general ill effect, however, results from them, that they deprive neighbouring nations of that free com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>munication and exchange, which the author of the world has intended, by giving them soils, climates, and geniuses, so different from each other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="100"/>
OUR modern politics embrace the only method of banishing money, the using paper credit; they reject the only method of amassing it, the practice of hoarding; and they adopt a hundred contrivan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces, which serve to no purpose but to check indus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try, and rob ourselves and our neighbours of the common benefits of art and nature.</p>
            <p>ALL taxes, however, upon foreign commodi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties, are not to be regarded as prejudicial or useless, but those only which are founded on the jealou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sy above mention'd. A tax on <hi>German</hi> linen en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>courages home manufactures, and thereby multi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plies our people and industry. A tax on brandy encreases the sale of rum, and supports our southern colonies. And as 'tis necessary imposts shou'd be levy'd for the support of government, it may be thought more convenient to lay them on foreign commodities, which can easily be intercepted at the port, and subjected to the impost. We ought, however, always to remember the maxim of Dr. <hi>Swift,</hi> that, in the arithmetic of the customs, two and two make not four, but often make only one. It can scarcely be doubted, but if the duties on wine were lower'd to a third, they wou'd yield much more to the government than at present: Our people might thereby afford to drink commonly a better and more wholsome liquor: And no preju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dice wou'd ensue to the balance of trade, of which
<pb n="99" facs="101"/>
we are so jealous. The manufacture of ale, beyond the agriculture, is but inconsiderable, and gives employment to few hands. The transport of wine and corn wou'd not be much inferior.</p>
            <p>BUT are there not frequent instances, you will say, of states and kingdoms, that were formerly rich and opulent, and are now poor and beggarly? Has not the money left them, with which they formerly abounded? I answer, If they lose their trade, industry, and people, they cannot expect to keep their gold and silver: For these precious me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tals hold proportion to the former advantages. When <hi>Lisbon</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam</hi> got the <hi>East India</hi> trade from <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> they also got the pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fits and money, that arose from it. Where the seat of government is transferr'd, where expensive armies are maintain'd at a distance, where great funds are possest by foreigners; there naturally fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lows from these causes a diminution of the specie. But these, we may observe, are violent and forcible methods of carrying away money, and are in time commonly attended with the transport of people and industry. But where these remain, and the drain is not continu'd, the money always finds its way back again, by a hundred canals, of which we have no notion nor suspicion. What immense trea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sures have been spent, by so many nations, in <hi>Flan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders,</hi> since the revolution, in the course of three long wars? More money perhaps, than the half of what
<pb n="100" facs="102"/>
is at present in all <hi>Europe.</hi> But what has now be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>come of it? Is it in the narrow compass of the <hi>Aus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trian</hi> provinces? No surely: It has most of it re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn'd to the several countries, whence it came, and has follow'd that art and industry, by which, at first, it was acquir'd.</p>
            <p>IN short, a government has great reason to pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serve with care its people and its manufactures. Its money, it may safely trust to the course of human affairs, without fear or jealousy. Or if it ever give attention to that latter circumstance, it ought on<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly to be so far as it affects the former.</p>

            <head>DISCOURSE VI. <hi>Of the Balance of Power.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is a question, whether the <hi>idea</hi> of the balance of power be owing entirely to modern policy, or whether the <hi>phrase</hi> only has been invented in these latter ages. 'Tis certain, that<note place="bottom" n="*">Lib. I.</note> 
               <hi>Xenophon,</hi> in his institution of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> represents the combination of the <hi>Asiatic</hi> powers to have arisen from a jealousy of the encreasing force of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians;</hi> and tho' that elegant composition shou'd be sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pos'd altogether a romance, this sentiment, ascrib'd by the author to the Eastern princes, is at least a proof of the prevailing notions of antient times.</p>
            <p>IN the whole politics of <hi>Greece,</hi> the anxiety, with regard to the balance, is most apparent, and is expressly pointed out to us, even by the antient historians. <hi>Thucydides</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="†">Lib. I.</note> represents the league, which was form'd against <hi>Athens,</hi> and which produc'd the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> war, as entirely owing to this prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciple. And after the decline of <hi>Athens,</hi> when the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> disputed for sovereigni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty, we find, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> (as well as many other republics) threw themselves always into the
<pb n="102" facs="104"/>
lighter scale, and endeavour'd to preserve the ba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lance. They supported <hi>Thebes</hi> against <hi>Sparta,</hi> till the great victory, gain'd by <hi>Epaminondas</hi> at <hi>Leuc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tra;</hi> after which they immediately went over to the conquer'd, from generosity, as they pretended, but, in reality, from their jealousy of the conquer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ors.<note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <hi>Xenoph.</hi> hist, <hi>Graec,</hi> lib. 6. &amp; 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>WHOEVER will read <hi>Demosthenes</hi>'s oration for the <hi>Megalopolitans,</hi> may see the utmost refinements on this principle, that ever enter'd into the head of a <hi>Venetian</hi> or <hi>English</hi> speculatist. And upon the first rise of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> power, this orator im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mediately discover'd the danger, sounded the alarm thro' all <hi>Greece,</hi> and at last assembled that confede<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racy under the banners of <hi>Athens,</hi> which fought the great and decisive battle of <hi>Chaeronea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'TIS true, the <hi>Grecian</hi> wars are regarded by historians as wars of emulation rather than of poli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tics; and each state seems to have had more in view the honour of leading the rest than any well<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>grounded hopes of authority and dominion. If we consider, indeed, the small number of inhabitants in any one republic, compar'd to the whole, the great difficulty of forming sieges in those times, and the extraordinary bravery and discipline of every free<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man amongst that noble people; we shall con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clude,
<pb n="103" facs="105"/>
that the balance of power was of itself suf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficiently secur'd in <hi>Greece,</hi> and needed not to be guarded with that caution, which may be requi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>site in other ages. But whether we ascribe the shifting sides in all the <hi>Grecian</hi> republics to <hi>jealous emulation</hi> or <hi>cautious politics,</hi> the effects were a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>like, and every prevailing power was sure to meet with a confederacy against it, and that often com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pos'd of its former friends and allies.</p>
            <p>THE same principle, call it envy or prudence, which produc'd the <hi>Ostracism</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Petalism</hi> of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> and expell'd every citizen, whose fame or power overtop'd the rest; the same principle, I say, naturally discover'd itself in foreign politics, and soon rais'd enemies to the leading state, how<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever moderate in the exercise of its authority.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Persian</hi> monarch was really, in his force, a petty prince, compar'd to the <hi>Grecian</hi> republics; and therefore it behov'd him, from views of safety more than from emulation, to interest himself in their quarrels, and to support the weaker side in every contest. This was the advice given by <hi>Alcibiades</hi> to <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <hi>Thuc.</hi> lib. 8.</note> and it prolong'd near a century the date of the <hi>Persian</hi> empire; till the neglect of it for a moment, after the first appearance of the aspiring genius of <hi>Philip,</hi> brought that lofty and frail edifice to the ground,
<pb n="104" facs="106"/>
with a rapidity, of which there are few instances in the history of mankind.</p>
            <p>THE successors of <hi>Alexander</hi> show'd an infinite jealousy of the balance of power; a jealousy, found<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed on true politics and prudence, and which pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serv'd distinct for several ages the partitions made after the death of that famous conqueror. The fortune and ambition of <hi>Antigonus</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <hi>Diod, Sic.</hi> lib. 20.</note> threaten'd them anew with an universal monarchy; but their com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bination and their victory at <hi>Ipsus</hi> sav'd them. And in after times, we find, that, as the Eastern princes consider'd the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Macedonians</hi> as the only real military force, with whom they had any in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tercourse, they kept always a watchful eye over that part of the world. The <hi>Ptolemies,</hi> in particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lar, supported first <hi>Aratus</hi> and the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and then <hi>Cleomenes</hi> King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> from no other view than as a counterbalance to the <hi>Macedonian</hi> mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>narchs. For this is the account, which <hi>Polybius</hi> gives of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> politics.<note place="bottom" n="†">Lib. 2. cap. 51.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE reason, why 'tis suppos'd, that the antients were intirely ignorant of the <hi>balance of power,</hi> seems to be drawn from the <hi>Roman</hi> history more than the <hi>Greek;</hi> and as the transactions of the former are generally the most familiar to us, we have thence form'd all our conclusions. It must be
<pb n="105" facs="107"/>
own'd, that the <hi>Romans</hi> never met with any such general combination or confederacy against them, as might naturally be expected from their rapid conquests and declar'd ambition; but were al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low'd peaceably to subdue their neighbours, one after another, till they extended their dominion o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver the whole known world. Not to mention the fabulous history of their <hi>Italic</hi> wars<note place="bottom" n="*">THERE have strong suspicions, of late, arisen amongst crities, and, in my opinion, not without reason, concerning the first ages of the <hi>Roman</hi> history; as if they were almost entirely fabulous, 'till after the sacking of the city by the <hi>Gauls;</hi> and were even doubtful for some time afterwards, 'till the <hi>Greeks</hi> began to give attention to <hi>Roman</hi> affairs, and commit them to writing. This scepticism, however, seems to me scarcely defensible in its full extent, with regard to the domestic history of <hi>Rome,</hi> which has some air of truth and probability, and cou'd scarce be the inven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of an historian, who had so little morals or judgment as to in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dulge himself in fiction and romance. The revolutions seem so well proportion'd to their causes: The progress of the factions is so conformable to political experience: The manners and maxims of the age are so uniform and natural, that scarce any real histo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry affords more just reflection and improvement. Is not <hi>Machiavel</hi>'s comment on <hi>Livy</hi> (a work surely of great judgment and genius) founded entirely on this period, which is represented as fabulous. I wou'd willingly, therefore, in my private sentiments, divide the matter with these critics; and allow, that the battles and vic<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tories and triumphs of those ages had been extremely falsify'd by family memoirs, as <hi>Cicero</hi> says they were: But as in the accounts of domestic factions, there were two opposite relations transmitted to posterity, this both serv'd as a check upon fiction, and enabled latter historians to gather some truth from comparison and reason<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing. Half of the slaughter, which <hi>Livy</hi> commits on the <hi>Ae<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>qui</hi> and the <hi>Volsci,</hi> wou'd depopulate <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> and that historian, tho' perhaps he may justly be charg'd as superfici<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>al, is at last shock'd himself with the incredibility of his narration. The same love of exaggeration seems to have magnify'd the num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bers of the <hi>Romans</hi> in their armies, and <hi>census.</hi>

upon <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s invasion of the <hi>Roman</hi> state, a ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry remarkable crisis, which ought to have call'd up the attention of all civiliz'd nations.

            <p>THE <hi>Rhodian</hi> and <hi>Achaean</hi> republics are much celebrated by antient historians for their wisdom and sound policy; yet both of them assisted the <hi>Romans</hi> in their wars against <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Antiochus.</hi> And what may be esteem'd still a stronger proof, that this maxim was not familiarly known in those ages; no antient author has ever remark'd the impru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dence
<pb n="107" facs="111"/>
of those measures, nor has even blam'd that absurd treaty above mention'd, made by <hi>Philip</hi> with the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Princes and statesmen may, in all ages, be blinded in their reasonings with re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard to events, before hand: But 'tis somewhat extraordinary, that historians, afterwards, shou'd not form a sounder judgment of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Massinissa, Attalus, Prusias,</hi> in satisfying their private passions, were, all of them, the instru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments of the <hi>Roman</hi> greatness, and never seem to have suspected, that they were forging their own chains, while they advanc'd the conquests of their ally. A simple treaty and agreement betwixt <hi>Mas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sinissa</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> so much requir'd by mutual interest, barr'd the <hi>Romans</hi> from all en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trance into <hi>Africa,</hi> and preserv'd liberty to man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kind.</p>
            <p>THE only prince we meet with in the <hi>Roman</hi> history, who seems to have understood the balance of power, is <hi>Hiero</hi> king of <hi>Syracuse.</hi> Tho' ally of <hi>Rome,</hi> he sent assistance to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> dur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the war of the auxiliaries. <q>Esteeming it re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quisite, (says <hi>Polybius</hi>
                  <note place="bottom" n="*">Lib. 1. cap. 83.</note>) both in order to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain his dominions in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and to preserve the <hi>Roman</hi> friendship, that <hi>Carthage</hi> shou'd be safe: Lest by its fall the remaining power shou'd be able, without contraste or opposition, to execute
<pb n="108" facs="112"/>
every purpose and undertaking. And here he acted with great wisdom and prudence. For that is never, on any account, to be overlookt; nor ought such a force ever to be thrown into one hand, as to incapacitate the neighbouring states from defending their rights against it.</q> Here is the aim of modern politics pointed out in express terms.</p>
            <p>IN short, the maxim of preserving the balance of power is founded so much on common sense and obvious reasoning, that 'tis impossible it cou'd alto<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gether have escap'd antiquity, where we find, in other particulars, so many marks of deep penetra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion and discernment. If it was not so generally known, and acknowledg'd as at present, it had, at least, an influence on all the wiser and more ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perienc'd princes and politicians. And indeed, e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven at present, however generally known and ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>knowledged, amongst speculative reasoners, it has not, in practice, an authority much more extensive, amongst those who govern the world.</p>
            <p>AFTER the fall of the <hi>Roman</hi> empire, the form of government establish'd by the northern con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>querors, incapacitated them, in a great measure, from farther conquests, and long maintain'd each state in its proper boundaries. But when vassalage and the feudal militia were abolish'd, mankind were anew alarm'd by the danger of universal mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>narchy,
<pb n="109" facs="113"/>
from the union of so many kingdoms and principalities in the person of the emperor, <hi>Charles.</hi> But the power of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> founded on extensive but divided dominions, and their rich<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>es, deriv'd chiefly from mines of gold and silver, were more likely to decay, of themselves, from internal defects, than to overthrow all the bulwarks rais'd against them. In less than a century, the force of that violent and haughty race was shat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter'd, their opulence dissipated, their splendor e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clips'd. A new power succeeded, more formida<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble to the liberties of <hi>Europe,</hi> possessing all the ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantages of the former, and labouring under none of its defects; except a share of that spirit of bi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gotry and persecution, with which the house of <hi>Austria</hi> were so long and still are so much infa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tuated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Europe</hi> has now, for above a century, remain'd on the defensive against the greatest force, that e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver, perhaps, was form'd by the civil or political combination of mankind. And such is the influ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence of the maxim here treated of, that tho' that ambitious nation, in the five last general wars, have been victorious in four <note place="bottom" n="*">THOSE concluded by the peace of the <hi>Pyrences, Nimeguen, Ryswick</hi> and <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle.</hi>
               </note>, and unsuccessful only in one <note place="bottom" n="†">THAT concluded by the peace of <hi>Utrecht.</hi>
               </note>, they have not much enlarg'd their domini<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons, nor acquir'd a total ascendant over <hi>Europe.</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="114"/>
On the contrary, there remain still some hopes of maintaining the resistance so long, that the natu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral revolutions of human affairs, together with un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>foreseen events and accidents, may guard us a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gainst universal monarchy, and preserve the world from so great an evil.</p>
            <p>IN the three last of these general wars, <hi>Britain</hi> has stood foremost in the glorious struggle; and she still maintains her station, as guardian of the gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral liberties of <hi>Europe,</hi> and patron of mankind. Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>side her advantages of riches and situation; her people are animated with such a national spirit, and are so fully sensible of the inestimable blessings of their government, that we may hope their vigor ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver will languish in so necessary and so just a cause. On the contrary, if we may judge by the past, their passionate ardour seems rather to require some mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deration; and they have oftener err'd from a laud<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able excess than from a blamable deficiency.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>first</hi> place, we seem to have been more possest with the antient <hi>Greek</hi> spirit of jealous emu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lation, than actuated with the prudent views of modern politics. Our wars with <hi>France</hi> have been begun with justice, and even, perhaps, from neces<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sity; but have always been too far push'd, from obstinacy and passion. The same peace, which was afterwards made at <hi>Ryswick</hi> in 1697, was of<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fer'd so early as the ninety two; that concluded at

               <hi>Utrecht</hi> in 1712 might have been finish'd on as good conditions at <hi>Gertruytenberg</hi> in the eight; and we might have given at <hi>Frankfort,</hi> in 1743, the same terms, which we were glad to accept of at <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle</hi> in the forty eight. Here then we see, that above half of our wars with <hi>France,</hi> and all our public debts are owing more to our own imprudent vehemence, than to the ambition of our neighbours.</p>
            <p>IN the <hi>second</hi> place, we are so declar'd in our opposition to <hi>French</hi> power, and so alert in defence of our allies, that they always reckon upon our force as upon their own; and expecting to carry on war at our expence, refuse all reasonable terms of accommodation. <hi>Habent subjectos, tanquam su<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>os; viles, ut alienos.</hi> All the world knows, that the factious vote of the house of commons, in the beginning of the last parliament, along with the profest humour of the nation, made the queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> inflexible in her terms, and prevented that agreement with <hi>Prussia,</hi> which wou'd immediate<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly have restor'd the general tranquillity of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the <hi>third</hi> place, we are such true combatants, that, when once engag'd, we lose all concern for ourselves and our posterity, and consider only how we may best annoy the enemy. To mortgage our revenues at so deep a rate, in wars, where we were only accessaries, was surely the most fatal delusion,
<pb n="112" facs="116"/>
that a nation, who had any pretension to politics and prudence, has ever yet been guilty of. That re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>medy of funding, if it be a remedy, and not rather a poison, ought, in all reason, to be reserv'd to the last extremity; and no evil, but the greatest and most urgent, shou'd ever induce us to embrace so dangerous an expedient.</p>
            <p>THESE excesses, to which we have been carry'd, are prejudicial; and may, perhaps, in time, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>come still more prejudicial another way, by beget<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, as is usual, the opposite extreme, and render<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing us totally careless and supine with regard to the fate of <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Athenians,</hi> from the most bustling, intriguing, warlike people of <hi>Greece,</hi> find<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing their error in thrusting themselves into every quarrel, abandon'd all attention to foreign affairs; and in no contest ever took party on either side, except by their flatteries and complaisance to the victor.</p>
            <p>ENORMOUS monarchies, such as <hi>Europe,</hi> at pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent, is in danger of falling into, are, probably, de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>structive to human nature; in their progress, in their continuance,<note place="bottom" n="*">IF the <hi>Roman</hi> empire was of advantage, it cou'd only proceed from this, that mankind were generally in a very disorderly, un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>civiliz'd condition, before its establishment.</note> and even in their downfall, which never can be very distant from their esta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blishment.

the monarchy, soon leaves the court, the ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pital, and the center of such a government; while the wars are carry'd on at a great distance, and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terest so small a part of the state. The antient no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bility, whose affections attach them to their sove<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reign, live all at court, and never will accept of mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>litary employments, which wou'd carry them to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mote and barbarous frontiers, where they are dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tant both from their pleasure and their fortune. The arms of the state must, therefore, be trusted to mercenary strangers, without zeal, without at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tachment, without honour; ready on every occa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion to turn them against the prince, and join each desperate malecontent, who offers pay and plunder. This is the necessary progress of human affairs: Thus human nature checks itself in its airy eleva<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions: Thus ambition blindly labours for the de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>struction of the conqueror, of his family, and of e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very thing near and dear to him. The <hi>Bourbons,</hi> trusting to the support of their brave, faithful, and affectionate nobility, would push their advantage, without reserve or limitation. These, while fir'd with glory and emulation, can bear the fatigues and dangers of war: But never would submit to languish in the garrisons of <hi>Hungary</hi> or <hi>Lithuania,</hi> forgot at court, and sacrisic'd to the intrigues of e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very minion or mistress, that approaches the prince.

            <head>DISCOURSE VII. <hi>Of Taxes.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THERE is a maxim, that prevails amongst those, whom, in this country, we call <hi>ways and means men,</hi> and who are denominated <hi>Finan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciers</hi> and <hi>Maltotiers</hi> in <hi>France; that every new tax creates a new ability in the subjects to bear it, and that each encrease of publick burthens encreases proportion<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ably the industry of the people.</hi> This maxim is of such a nature as is most likely to be extremely a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bus'd, and is so much the more dangerous, that its truth cannot be altogether deny'd; but it must be own'd; when kept within certain bounds, to have some foundation in reason and experience.</p>
            <p>WHEN a tax is laid upon commodities, that are consum'd by the common people, the necessary consequence may seem to be, that either the poor must retrench something from their way of living, or raise their wages, so as to make the burthen of the tax fall entirely upon the rich. But there is a third consequence, which very often follows upon taxes, <hi>viz.</hi> that the poor encrease their industry, perform more work, and live as well as before, without de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manding more for their labour. Where taxes are moderate, are laid on gradually, and affect not the
<pb n="116" facs="120"/>
necessaries of life, this consequence naturally follows; and 'tis certain, that such difficulties often serve to excite the industry of a people, and render them more opulent and laborious than others, who enjoy the greatest advantages. For we may observe, as a parallel instance, that the most trading nations have not always possest the greatest extent of fertile land; but on the contrary, that they have labour'd under many natural disadvantages. <hi>Tyre, Athens, Car<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thage, Rhodes, Genoa, Venice, Holland</hi> are strong examples to this purpose. And in all history, we find only three instances of large and fertile coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tries, that have possest much trade, the <hi>Netherlands, England,</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> The two former seem to have been allur'd by the advantages of their mari<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>time situation, and the necessity they lay under of frequenting foreign ports, in order to procure what their own climate refus'd them. And as to <hi>France,</hi> trade has come very late into that kingdom, and seems to have been the effect of reflection and ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>servation in an ingenious and enterprising people, who remark'd the immense riches acquir'd by such of the neighbouring nations as cultivated navigati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on and commerce.</p>
            <p>THE places mention'd by <hi>Cicero,</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <hi>Epist. ad Att.</hi> lib. 9. ep. 11.</note> as possest of the greatest commerce in his time are <hi>Alexandria, Colchos, Tyre, Sidon, Andros, Cyprus, Pamphilia, Lycia, Rhodes, Chios, Byzantium, Lesbos, Smyrna,</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="121"/>
               <hi>Miletum, Coos.</hi> All these, except <hi>Alexandria,</hi> were either small islands or narrow territories. And that city ow'd its trade entirely to the happiness of its situation.</p>
            <p>SINCE therefore some natural necessities or dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>advantages may be thought favourable to industry, why may not artificial burthens have the same ef<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect? Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="†">ACCOUNT of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> chap. 6.</note> I am sure, ascribes the industry of the <hi>Dutch</hi> entirely to necessity, proceed<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing from their natural disadvantages; and illustrates his doctrine by a very striking comparison with <hi>Ire<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land;</hi> 
               <q>where, (says he,) by the largeness and plenty of the soil, and scarcity of people, all things necessary to life are so cheap, that an in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dustrious man, by two days labour, may gain enough to feed him the rest of the week: Which I take to be a very plain ground of the laziness, attributed to the people. For men naturally prefer ease before labour, and will not take pains, if they can live idle; though when, by necessity, they have been enur'd to it, they cannot leave it, being grown a custom necessary to their health and to their very entertainment: Nor perhaps is the change harder, from con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stant ease to labour, than from constant labour to ease.</q> After which the author proceeds to confirm his doctrine, by enumerating, as above, the places, where trade has most flourish'd, in
<pb n="118" facs="122"/>
antient and modern times; and which are com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monly observ'd to be such narrow confin'd terri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tories, as beget a necessity for industry.</p>
            <p>'TIS always observ'd, in years of scarcity, if it be not extreme, that the poor labour more, and really live better, than in years of great plenty, when they indulge themselves in idleness and riot. I have been told, by a considerable manufacturer, that in the year 1740, when bread and provisions of all kinds were very dear, his workmen not on<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly made a shift to live, but paid debts, which they had contracted in former years, that were much more favourable and abundant.<note place="bottom" n="*">To this purpose, see also discourse I. at the end.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THIS doctrine, therefore, with regard to taxes, may be admitted in some degree: But beware of the abuse. Taxes, like necessity, when carry'd too far, destroy industry, by engendring despair; and even before they reach this pitch, they raise the wages of the labourer and manufacturer, and heighten the price of all commodities. An atten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive, disinterested legislature will observe the point, when the emolument ceases, and the prejudice be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gins: But as the contrary character is much more common, 'tis to be fear'd, that taxes, all over <hi>Europe,</hi> are multiplying to such a degree, as will entirely crush all art and industry; tho', perhaps, their first increase, along with other circumstan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces,
<pb n="119" facs="123"/>
might contribute to the growth of these ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantages.</p>
            <p>THE best taxes are those which are levy'd upon consumptions, especially those of luxury; because such taxes are less felt by the people. They seem to be, in some measure, voluntary, since a man may chuse how far he will use the commodity, which is taxed: They are paid gradually and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sensibly: And being confounded with the natural price of the commodity, they are scarcely perceiv'd by the consumers. Their only disadvantage is, that they are expensive in the levying.</p>
            <p>TAXES upon possessions are levy'd without ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pence; but have every other disadvantage. Most states, however, are oblig'd to have recourse to them, in order to supply the deficiencies of the o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther.</p>
            <p>BUT the most pernicious of all taxes are those which are arbitrary. They are commonly con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verted, by their management, into punishments on industry; and also, by their unavoidable inequali<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty, are more grievous than by the real burthen, which they impose. 'Tis surprising, therefore, to see them have place amongst any civiliz'd people.</p>
            <p>IN general, all poll-taxes, even when not arbi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trary, which they commonly are, may be esteem'd
<pb n="120" facs="124"/>
dangerous: Because it is so easy for the sovereign to add a little more, and a little more, to the sum demanded, that these taxes are apt to become alto<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gether oppressive and intolerable. On the other hand, a duty upon commodities checks itself; and a prince will soon find, that an encrease of the im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>post is no encrease of his revenue. It is not easy, therefore, for a people to be altogether ruin'd by such taxes.</p>
            <p>HISTORIANS inform us, that one of the chief causes of the destruction of the <hi>Roman</hi> state was the alteration, which <hi>Constantine</hi> introduc'd into the finances, by substituting an universal poll-tax, in lieu of almost all the tythes, customs, and excis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>es, which formerly compos'd the revenue of the <hi>empire.</hi> The people, in all the provinces, were so grinded and opprest by the <hi>publicans,</hi> that they were glad to take refuge under the conquering arms of the barbarians; whose dominion, as they had fewer necessities and less art, was found preferable to the refin'd tyranny of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is a prevailing opinion, that all taxes, however levy'd, fall upon the land at last. Such an opinion may be useful in <hi>Britain,</hi> by checking the landed gentlemen, in whose hands our legislature is lodg'd, and making them preserve great regard for trade and industry. But I must confess, that this principle, tho' first advanc'd by a celebrated writer,
<pb n="121" facs="125"/>
has so little appearance of reason, that, were it not for his authority, it had never been receiv'd by any body. Every man, to be sure, is desirous of push<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing off from himself the burthen of any tax, that is impos'd, and laying it upon others: But as eve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry man has the same inclination, and is upon the defensive; no set of men can be suppos'd to prevail altogether in this contest. And why the landed gentleman shou'd be the victim of the whole, and shou'd not be able to defend himself, as well as o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thers are, I cannot readily imagine. All tradesmen, indeed, wou'd willingly prey upon him, and divide him among them, if they cou'd: But this inclina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion they always have, tho' no taxes were levy'd; and the same methods, by which he guards against the imposition of tradesmen before taxes, will serve him afterwards, and make them share the burthen with him.</p>
            <p>I SHALL conclude this subject with observing, that we have, with regard to taxes, an instance of what frequently happens in political institutions, that the consequences of things are diametrically opposite to what we shou'd expect on the first appearance. 'Tis regarded as a fundamental max<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>im of the <hi>Turkish</hi> government, that the <hi>Grand sig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nior,</hi> tho' absolute master of the lives and fortunes of each individual, has no authority to impose a new tax; and every <hi>Ottoman</hi> prince, who has made such an attempt, either has been oblig'd to retract,
<pb n="122" facs="126"/>
or has found the fatal effects of his perseverance. One wou'd imagine, that this prejudice or esta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blish'd opinion were the firmest barrier in the world against oppression; yet'tis certain, that its effect is quite contrary. The emperor, having no regular method of encreasing his revenue, must allow all the bashas and governors to oppress and abuse the subjects: And these he squeezes after their return from their government. Whereas, if he cou'd impose a new tax, like our <hi>European</hi> princes, his interest wou'd so far be united with that of his peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple, that he wou'd immediately feel the bad effects of these disorderly levies of money, and wou'd find, that a pound, rais'd by a general imposition, wou'd have less pernicious effects, than a shilling taken in so unequal and arbitrary a manner.</p>

            <p>ON the contrary, our modern expedient, which has become very general, is to mortgage the pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lic revenues, and to trust, that posterity, during peace, will pay off the incumbrances, contracted during the preceding war: And they, having be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore their eyes, so good an example of their wise fathers, have the same prudent reliance on their po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sterity; who, at last, from necessity, more than choice, are oblig'd to place the same confidence in a new posterity. But not to waste time in declaim<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing against a practice, which appears ruinous, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>yond the evidence of a hundred demonstrations; it seems pretty apparent, that the antient maxims are, in this respect, much more prudent than the modern; even tho' the latter had been confin'd within some reasonable bounds, and had ever, in any instance, been attended with such frugality, in time of peace, as to discharge the debts incurr'd by an expensive war. For why shou'd the case be so very different betwixt the public and an indivi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dual, as to make us establish such different maxims of conduct for each? If the funds of the former be
<pb n="125" facs="129"/>
greater, its necessary expences are proportionably larger; if its resources be more numerous, they are not infinite; and as its frame should be calculated for a much longer duration, than the date of a single life, or even of a family, it shou'd embrace max<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ims, large, durable, and generous, suitable to the suppos'd extent of its existence. To trust to chan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces and temporary expedients is, indeed, what the necessity of human affairs frequently reduces us to; but whoever voluntarily depend on such resources have not necessity, but their own folly, to accuse for their misfortunes, when any such befal them.</p>
            <p>IF the abuses of treasures be dangerous, either by engaging the state in rash enterprises, or mak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing them neglect military discipline, in confidence of their riches; the abuses of mortgaging are more certain and inevitable; poverty, impotence, and subjection to foreign powers.</p>
            <p>ACCORDING to modern policy, war is attend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed with every destructive circumstance; loss of men, encrease of taxes, decay of commerce, dissi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pation of money, plunder by sea and land. Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cording to antient maxims, the opening of the public treasure, as it produc'd an uncommon afflu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence of gold and silver, serv'd as a temporary en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>couragement to industry, and aton'd, in some de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gree, for the inevitable calamities of war.</p>

WHAT then shall we say to the new paradox, that public encumbrances are, of themselves, ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantageous, independent of the necessity of con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tracting them; and that any state, even tho' it were not prest by a foreign enemy, cou'd not possibly have embrac'd a wiser expedient for promoting commerce and riches, than to create funds and debts and taxes, without limitation? Discourses, such as these, might naturally have past for trials of wit among rhetoricians, like the panegyrics on folly and a fever, on <hi>Busiris</hi> and <hi>Nero;</hi> had we not seen such absurd maxims patroniz'd, by great ministers, and by a whole party among us. And these puz<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>zling arguments, (for they deserve not the name of specious) tho' they cou'd not be the foundation of lord <hi>Oxford</hi>'s conduct; for he had more sense; serv'd at least to keep his partizans in countenance, and perplex the understanding of the nation.</p>

            <p>THERE is a word, which is here in the mouth of every body, and which, I find, has also got a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>broad, and is much employ'd by foreign writers,<note place="bottom" n="*">

               </note>
               <pb n="127" facs="131"/>
in imitation of the <hi>English;</hi> and that is CIRCULA<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>TION. This word serves as an account of every thing; and tho' I confess, that I have sought for its meaning in the present subject, ever since I was a school-boy, I have never yet been able to disco<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver it. What possible advantage is there which the nation can reap by the easy transference of stock from hand to hand? Or is there any para<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lel to be drawn from the circulation of other com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>modities, to that of chequer notes and <hi>India</hi> bonds? Where a manufacturer has a quick sale of his goods to the merchant, the merchant to the shop-keeper, the shop-keeper to his customers; this enlivens in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dustry, and gives new encouragement to the first dealer or the manufacturer and all his tradesmen, and makes them produce more and better commo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dities of the same species. A stagnation is here pernicious, wherever it happens; because it oper<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ates backwards, and stops or benumbs the indus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trious hand in its production of what is useful to human life. But what production we owe to <hi>Change-alley,</hi> or even what consumption, except that of coffee, and pen, ink and paper, I have not yet learn'd; nor can one foresee the loss or decay of any one beneficial commerce or commodity, tho' that place and all its inhabitants were for ever bury'd in the ocean.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' this term, circulation, has never been explain'd by those, who insist so much on the ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantages
<pb n="128" facs="132"/>
that result from it, there seems, however, to be some benefit of a similar kind, arising from our incumbrances: As indeed, what human evil is there, which is not attended with some advantage? This we shall endeavour to explain, that we may estimate the weight we ought to allow it.</p>
            <p>PUBLIC securities are with us become a kind of money, and pass as readily at the current price as gold or silver.

No merchant thinks it necessary to keep by him any considerable cash. Bank stock, or <hi>India</hi> bonds, especially the latter, serve to all the same purpo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ses; because he can dispose of them, or pledge them to a banker, in a quarter of an hour; and at the same time, they are not idle, even when in his scritoire, but bring him in a constant revenue. In short, our national debts furnish merchants with a species of money, that is continually multiplying in their hands, and produces sure gain, beside the profits of their commerce. This must enable them to trade upon less profit. The small profit of the merchant renders the commodity cheaper; causes a greater consumption; quickens the labour of the
<pb n="129" facs="133"/>
common people; and helps to spread arts and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dustry thro' the whole society.</p>
            <p>THERE are also, we may observe, in <hi>England,</hi> and in all states, that have both commerce and pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lic debts, a set of men, who are half merchants, half stock-holders, and may be suppos'd willing to trade for small profits; because commerce is not their principal or sole support, and their revenues in the funds are a sure resource for themselves and their families. Were there no funds, great mer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chants wou'd have no expedient for realizing or securing any part of their profit, but by making purchases of land; and land has many disadvanta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ges in comparison of funds. Requiring more care and inspection, it divides the time and attention of the merchant; upon any tempting offer or extra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ordinary accident in trade, it is not so easily con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verted into money; and as it attracts too much, both by the many natural pleasures it affords, and the authority it gives, it soon converts the citizen into the country gentleman. More men, there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore, with large stocks and incomes may naturally be suppos'd to continue in trade, where there are public debts: And this, it must be own'd, is of some advantage to commerce, by diminishing its profits, promoting circulation, and encouraging industry.<note place="bottom" n="*">ON this head, I shall observe, without interrupting the thread of the argument, that the multiplicity of our public debts serves rather to sink the interest, and that the more the government bor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rows, the cheaper may they expect to borrow; contrary to first appearance, and contrary to common opinion. The profits of trade have an influence on interest. See discourse IV.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="134"/>
BUT in opposition to these two favourable cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstances, perhaps of no very great importance, weigh the many disadvantages, that attend our public debts, in the whole <hi>interior</hi> oeconomy of the state: You will find no comparison betwixt the ill and the good, that result from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> 'TIS certain, that national debts cause a mighty confluence of people and riches to the ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pital, by the great sums, which are levy'd in the provinces to pay the interest of those debts; and perhaps too, by the advantages in trade above men<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion'd, which they give the merchants in the ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pital above the rest of the kingdom. The question is, whether, in our case, it be for the public interest, that so many privileges shou'd be conferr'd on <hi>Lon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>don,</hi> which has already arriv'd at such an enormous size, and seems still encreasing. Some men are apprehensive of the consequences. For my part, I cannot forbear thinking, that tho' the head is un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doubtedly too big for the body, yet that great city is so happily situated, that its excessive bulk causes less inconvenience, than even a smaller capital to a greater kingdom. There is more difference be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>twixt
<pb n="131" facs="135"/>
the prices of all provisions in <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Lan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guedoc</hi> than betwixt those in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Yorkshire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> PUBLIC stocks, being a kind of paper<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>credit, have all the disadvantages attending that species of money. They banish gold and silver from the most considerable commerce of the state, reduce them to common circulation, and by that means render all provisions and labour dearer than otherwise they wou'd be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THE taxes, which are levy'd to pay the interest of these debts, are a check upon industry, heighten the price of labour, and are an oppression on the poorer sort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As foreigners possess a share of our na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tional funds, they render the public, in a manner, tributary to them, and may in time occasion the transport of our people and our industry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> THE greatest part of public stock being always in the hands of idle people, who live on their revenue, our funds give great encouragement to an useless and inactive life.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' the injury, that arises to commerce and industry from our public funds, will appear, upon balancing the whole, very considerable, it is trivial in comparison of the prejudice, that results
<pb n="132" facs="136"/>
to the state, consider'd as a body politic, which must support itself in the society of nations, and have various transactions with other states, in wars and negotiations. The ill, there, is pure and unmixt, without any favourable circumstance to atone for it: And 'tis an ill too, of a nature the highest and most important.</p>
            <p>WE have indeed been told, that the public is no weaker upon account of its debts; since they are mostly due amongst ourselves, and bring as much property to one as they take from another. 'Tis like transferring money from the right hand to the left; which leaves the person neither richer nor poorer than before. Such loose reasonings and specious comparisons will always pass, where we judge not upon principles. I ask, Is it possible, in the nature of things, to overburthen a nation with taxes, even where the sovereign resides a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mongst them? The very doubt seems extravagant; since 'tis requisite, in every commonwealth, that there be a certain proportion observ'd betwixt the laborious and the idle part of it. But if all our pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent taxes be mortgag'd, must we not invent new ones? And may not this matter be carry'd to a length, that is ruinous and destructive?</p>
            <p>IN every nation, there are always some methods of levying money more easy than others, suitable to the way of living of the people, and the commodi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties
<pb n="133" facs="137"/>
they make use of. In <hi>Britain,</hi> the excises up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on malt and beer afford a very large revenue; be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause the operations of malting and brewing are very tedious and are impossible to be conceal'd; and at the same time, these commodities are not so ab<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>solutely necessary to life, as that the raising their price wou'd very much affect the poorer sort. These taxes being all mortgag'd, what difficulty to find new ones! What vexation and ruin of the poor!</p>
            <p>DUTIES upon consumptions are more equal and easy than those upon possessions. What a loss to the public, that the former are all exhausted, and that we must have recourse to the more grievous method of levying taxes!</p>
            <p>WERE all the proprietors of land only stewards to the public; must not necessity force them to practise all the arts of oppression, us'd by stewards, where the absence and negligence of the proprietor render them secure against enquiry?</p>
            <p>'TWILL scarce be asserted, that no bounds ought ever to be set to national debts, and that the pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lic wou'd be no weaker, were 12 or 15 shillings in the pound, land tax, mortgag'd, along with all the present customs and excises. There is something, therefore, in the case, beside the mere transferring of property from one hand to another. In 500 years,
<pb n="134" facs="138"/>
the posterity of those, now in the coaches, and of those upon the boxes, will probably have chang'd places, without affecting the public by these revo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lutions.</p>
            <p>I MUST confess, that there is a strange supine<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, from long custom, crept into all ranks of men, with regard to public debts; not unlike what di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vines so vehemently complain of with regard to their religious doctrines. We all own, that the most sanguine imagination cannot hope, either that this or any future ministry will be possest of such rigid and steady frugality, as to make any consider<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able progress in the payment of our debts, or that the situation of foreign affairs will, for any long time, allow them leisure and tranquillity, sufficient for such an undertaking.<note place="bottom" n="*">IN times of peace and security, when alone it is possible to pay debt, the money'd interest are averse to receive partial pay<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments, which they know not how to dispose of to advantage; and the landed interest are averse to continue the taxes requisite for that purpose. Why therefore shou'd a minister persevere in a measure so disagreeable to all parties? For the sake, I suppose, of a poste<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity, which be will never see, or of a few reasonable, reflecting peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple, whose united interest, perhaps, will not be able to secure him the smallest borough in <hi>England.</hi> 'Tis not likely we shall ever find any minister so bad a politician. With regard to these nar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>row, destructive maxims of politics, all ministers are expert enough.</note> 
               <hi>What then is to become of us?</hi> Were we ever so good Christians, and ever so resign'd to providence; this, methinks, were a curious question, even consider'd as a speculative one, and what it might not be altogether impossible
<pb n="135" facs="139"/>
to form some conjectural solution of. The events here will depend little upon the contingencies of battles, negotiations, intrigues, and factions. There seems to be a natural progress of things, which may guide our reasoning. As it wou'd have requir'd but a moderate share of prudence, when we first began this practice of mortgaging, to have foretold, from the nature of men and of ministers, that things wou'd necessarily be carry'd to the length we see; so now that they have at last happily reach'd it, it may not be difficult to guess at the consequence. It must, indeed, be one of these two events; ei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther the nation must destroy public credit, or pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lic credit will destroy the nation. 'Tis impos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sible they can both subsist, after the manner they have been hitherto manag'd, in this, as well as in some other nations.</p>
            <p>THERE was, indeed, a scheme for the payment of our debts, which was propos'd by an excellent citizen, Mr. <hi>Hutchinson,</hi> above 30 years ago, and which was much approv'd of by some men of sense, but never was likely to take effect. He asserted, that there was a fallacy in imagining, that the public ow'd this debt; for that really every individual ow'd a proportional share of it, and paid, in his taxes, a proportional share of the interest, beside the ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pences of levying these taxes. Had we not better, then, says he, make a proportional distribution of the debt amongst us, and each of us contribute a
<pb n="136" facs="140"/>
sum suitable to his property, and by that means, discharge at once all our funds and public mort<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gages? He seems not to have consider'd, that the laborious poor pay a considerable part of the taxes by their annual consumptions, tho' they cou'd not advance, at once, a proportional part of the sum re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quir'd. Not to mention, that property in money and stock in trade might easily be conceal'd or dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guis'd; and that visible property in lands and hou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ses wou'd really at last answer for the whole: An inequality and oppression, which never wou'd be submitted to. But tho' this project is never likely to take place; 'tis not altogether improbable, that, when the nation become heartily sick of their debts, and are cruelly opprest by them, some daring pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jector may arise, with visionary schemes for their discharge. And as public credit will begin, by that time, to be a little frail, the least touch will destroy it, as happen'd in <hi>France;</hi> and in this manner, it will <hi>dye of the doctor.</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">SOME neighbouring states practise an easy expedient, by which they lighten their public debts. The <hi>French</hi> have a custom (as the <hi>Romans</hi> formerly had) of augmenting their money; and this the nation has been so much familiariz'd to, that it hurts not public credit, tho' it be really cutting off at once, by an edict, so much of their debts. The <hi>Dutch</hi> diminish the interest without the consent of their creditors; or which is the same thing, they arbitrarily tax the funds as well as other property. Cou'd we prac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tise either of these methods, we need never be opprest by the nati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>onal debt; and 'tis not impossible but one of these, or some other method may, at all adventures, be try'd, on the augmentation of our encumbrances and difficulties. But people in this country are so good reasoners upon whatever regards their interest, that such a practice will deceive no body; and public credit will probably tumble at once by so dangerous a trial.</note>
            </p>
            <pb n="137" facs="141"/>
            <p>BUT 'tis more probable, that the breach of na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tional faith will be the necessary effect of wars, de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>feats, misfortunes, and public calamities, or even perhaps of victories and conquests. I must confess, when I see princes and states fighting and quarrel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, amidst their debts, funds, and public mortgages, it always brings to my mind a match of cudgel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>playing fought in a <hi>China</hi> shop. How can it be expected, that sovereigns will spare a species of property, which is pernicious to themselves and to the public, when they have so little compassion on lives and properties, which are useful to both? Let the time come (and surely it will come) when the new funds, created for the exigencies of the year, are not subscrib'd to, and raise not the mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney projected. Suppose, either that the cash of the nation is exhausted; or that our faith, which has been hitherto so ample, begins to fail us. Sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose, that, in this distress, the nation is threaten'd with an invasion, a rebellion is suspected or broke out at home, a squadron cannot be equipt for want of pay, victuals, or repairs; or even a foreign subsi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dy cannot be advanc'd. What must a prince or minister do in such an emergence? The right of
<pb n="138" facs="142"/>
self-preservation is unalienable in every individual, much more in every community. And the folly of our statesmen must then be greater than the folly of those who first contracted debt, or what is more, than that of those who trusted, or continue to trust this security, if these statesmen have the means of safety in their hands, and do not employ it. The funds, created and mortgag'd, will, by that time, bring in a large yearly revenue, sufficient for the defence and security of the nation: Money is per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps lying in the exchequer, ready for the discharge of the quarterly interest: Necessity calls, fear urges, reason exhorts, compassion alone exclaims: The money will immediately be seiz'd for the current service, under the most solemn protestations, per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps, of being immediately replac'd. But no more is requisite. The whole fabric, already tottering, falls to the ground, and buries thousands in its ruins. And this, I think, may be called the <hi>natural death</hi> of public credit: For to this period it tends as na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turally as an animal body to its dissolution and de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>struction.<note place="bottom" n="*">So great dupes are the generality of mankind, that, notwith<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>standing such a violent shock to public credit, as a voluntary bank<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ruptcy in <hi>England</hi> wou'd occasion, it wou'd not probably be long, e're credit wou'd again revive in as flourishing a condition as be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore. The present king of <hi>France,</hi> during the late war, borrow'd money at lower interest than ever his grandfather did; and as low as the <hi>British</hi> parliament, comparing the natural rate of interest in both kingdoms. And tho' men are commonly more govern'd by what they have seen, than by what they foresee, with whatever certainty; yet promises, protestations, fair appearances, with the allurements of present interest, have such powerful influence as few are able to resist. Mankind are, in all ages, caught by the same baits: The same tricks, play'd over and over again, still trepan them. The heights of popularity and patriotism are still the beaten road to power and tyranny; flattery to treachery; standing ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mies to arbitrary government; and the glory of God to the tem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poral interest of the clergy. The fear of an everlasting destruc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of credit, allowing it to be an evil, is a needless bugbear. A prudent man, in reality, wou'd rather lend to the public imme<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diately after they had taken a spunge to their debts than at pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent; as much as an opulent knave, even tho' one cou'd not force him to pay, is a preferable debtor to an honest bankrupt: For the former, in order to carry on business, may find it his interest to discharge his debts, where they are not exorbitant: The latter has it not in his power. The reasoning of <hi>Tacitus, hist. lib</hi> 3. as it is eternally true, is very applicable to our present case. <hi>Sed vul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gus ad magnitudinem beneficiorum aderat: Stultissimus quisque pecuniis mercabatur: Apud sapientes cassa habebantur, quae neque dari neque accepi, salva republica, poterant.</hi> The public is a debtor, whom no man can oblige to pay. The only check, which the creditors have on it, is the interest of preserving credit; an interest, which may easily be overbalanc'd by a very great debt; and by a difficult and extraordinary emergence, even supposing that credit irrecoverable. Not to mention, that a present necessity often forces states into measures, which are, strictly speaking, against their interest.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="143"/>
THESE two events, suppos'd above, are calami<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tous, but not the most calamitous. Thousands are thereby sacrific'd to the safety of millions. But we are not without danger, that the contrary event may take place, and that millions may be sacrific'd, for ever, to the temporary safety of thousands. <note place="bottom" n="*">I HAVE heard it has been computed, that the whole credi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tors of the public, natives and foreigners, amount only to 17000. These make a figure at present on their income; but in case of a public bankruptcy, wou'd, in an instant, become the lowest, as well as the most wretched of the people. The dignity and authority of the landed gentry and nobility is much better rooted; and wou'd render the contention very unequal, if ever we come to that ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tremity. One wou'd incline to assign to this event a very near period, such as half a century, had not our fathers prophesies of this kind been already found fallacious, by the duration of our pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lic credit, so much beyond all reasonable expectation. When the astrologers in <hi>France</hi> were every year foretelling the death of <hi>Harry</hi> the IV. <hi>These fellows,</hi> says he, <hi>must be right at last.</hi> We shall, therefore, be more cautious than to assign any precise date; and shall content ourselves with pointing out the event in general.</note> Our
<pb n="140" facs="144"/>
popular government, perhaps, will render it diffi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cult or dangerous for a minister to venture on so desperate an expedient, as that of a voluntary bank<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ruptcy. And tho' the house of lords be altogether compos'd of the proprietors of lands, and the house of commons chiefly; and consequently neither of them can be suppos'd to have great property in the funds; yet the connexions of the members may be so great with the proprietors, as to render them more tenacious of public faith, than prudence, policy, or even justice, strictly speaking, requires. And per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps too, our foreign enemies, or rather enemy (for we have but one to dread) may be so politic as to discover, that our safety lyes in despair, and may not, therefore, show the danger, open and bare<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fac'd, 'till it be inevitable. The balance of power in <hi>Europe,</hi> our grandfathers, our fathers, and we, have all justly esteem'd too unequal to be preserv'd without our attention and assistance. But our
<pb n="141" facs="145"/>
children, weary with the struggle, and fetter'd with incumbrances, may sit down secure, and see their neighbours opprest and conquer'd; till at last, they themselves and their creditors lye both at the mer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cy of the conqueror. And this may properly e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nough be denominated the <hi>violent death</hi> of our public credit.</p>
            <p>THESE seem to be the events, which are not ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry remote, and which reason foresees as clearly al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most as she can do any thing, that lyes in the womb of time. And tho' the antients maintain'd, that, in order to reach the gift of prophesy, a certain di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vine fury or madness was requisite; one may safe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly affirm, that, in order to deliver such prophesies as these, no more is necessary, than merely to be in one's senses, free from the influence of popular madness and delusion.</p>

            <p>I SHALL observe three remarkable customs in three celebrated governments; and shall con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clude from the whole, that all general maxims in politics ought to be establish'd with great reserve, and that irregular and extraordinary appearances are frequently discover'd, in the moral, as well as in the physical world. The former, perhaps, we can better account for, after they happen, from springs and principles, of which every one has, within himself, or from obvious observation, the strongest assurance and conviction: But 'tis often fully as impossible for human prudence, before hand, to foresee and foretell them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. ONE wou'd think it essential to every supreme council or assembly, which debates, that entire li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berty of speech shou'd be granted to every member, and that all motions or reasonings shou'd be re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceiv'd, which can any way tend to illustrate the point under deliberation.

                  </gap>, or to restore the pri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vilege of bearing offices to those who had been declar'd incapable. Perhaps, these were both clauses of the same law.</note> On account of this law, the orator was afterwards try'd by the indictment above mention'd; and defended himself, amongst other topics, by that stroke cele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brated by <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Longinus. It was not I,</hi>

said he, <hi>that mov'd for this law: It was the neces<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sities of war; it was the battle of Chaeronea.</hi> The orations of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> abound with many instan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces of trials of this nature, and prove clearly, that nothing was more commonly practis'd.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Athenian</hi> democracy was such a mobbish government, as we can scarce form a notion of in the present age of the world. The whole collec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive body of the people voted in every law, with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out any limitation of property, without any distinc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of rank, without controul from any magistra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cy or senate; <note place="bottom" n="*">THE senate of the Bean was only a less numerous mob, cho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sen by lot from among the people; and their authority was not great.</note> and consequently with little regard to order, justice, or prudence. The <hi>Athenians</hi> soon became sensible of the mischiefs attending this con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stitution: But being averse to the checking them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves by any rule or restriction, they resolv'd, at least, to check their demagogues or counsellors, by the fear of future punishment and enquiry. They accordingly instituted this remarkable law; a law esteem'd so essential to their government, that <hi>Ae<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>schines</hi> insists on it, as a known truth, that were it abolish'd or neglected, it were impossible for the democracy to subsist. <note place="bottom" n="†">

THE people fear'd not any ill consequences to liberty from the authority of the criminal courts; because these were nothing but very numerous ju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ries, chosen by lot from amongst the people. And they consider'd themselves justly as in a state of pu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pillage, where they had an authority, after they came to the use of reason, not only to retract and controul whatever had been determin'd, but to pu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nish any guardian for measures, which they had em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brac'd by his persuasion. The same law had place in <hi>Thebes;</hi> 
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Plut. in vita Pelop.</note> and for the same reason.</p>
            <p>IT appears to have been an usual practice in <hi>A<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thens,</hi> on the establishment of any law, esteem'd very useful or popular, to prohibit for ever its abrogation and repeal.

To establish two distinct legislatures, each of which possesses full and absolute authority within itself, and stands in no need of the other's assistance, in order to give vali<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dity to its acts; this may appear, before hand, al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>together impracticable, as long as men are actuat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed by the passions of ambition, emulation, and ava<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rice, which have been hitherto their chief govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing principles. And shou'd I assert, that the state I have in my eye was divided by two distinct fac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions, each of which predominated in a distinct le<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gislature, and yet produc'd no clashing of these in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dependent powers; the supposition may appear al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>most incredible. And if, to augment the paradox, I shou'd affirm, that this disjointed, irregular go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernment was the most active, triumphant, and il<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lustrious commonwealth, that ever yet appear'd on
<pb n="149" facs="152"/>
the stage of the world; I shou'd certainly be told, that such a political chimera was as absurd as any vision of the poets. But there is no need for search<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing long, in order to prove the reality of the fore<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>going suppositions: For this was actually the case with the <hi>Roman</hi> republic.</p>
            <p>THE legislative power was there lodged both in the <hi>comitia centuriata</hi> and <hi>comitia tributa.</hi> In the former, 'tis well known, the people voted accord<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ingly to their <hi>census;</hi> so that when the first class was unanimous, (as commonly happen'd) tho' it con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain'd not, perhaps, the hundredth part of the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monwealth, it determin'd the whole; and with the authority of the senate, establish'd a law. In the latter, every vote was alike; and as the authority of the senate was not there requisite, the lower people entirely prevail'd, and gave law to the whole state. In all party divisions, at first betwixt the <hi>Pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tricians</hi> and <hi>Plebeians,</hi> afterwards betwixt the nobles and the people, the interest of the Aristocracy was predominant in the first legislature; that of the De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mocracy in the second: The one cou'd always de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stroy what the other had establish'd: Nay, the one, by a sudden and unforeseen motion, might take the start of the other; and totally annihilate its rival, by a vote, which, from the nature of the constitu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, had the full authority of a law. But no such contest or struggle is observ'd in the history of <hi>Rome:</hi> No instance of a quarrel betwixt these two legisla<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tures;
<pb n="150" facs="153"/>
tho' many betwixt the parties, that govern'd in each. Whence arose this concord, which may seem so extraordinary?</p>
            <p>THE legislature establish'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thority of <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> was the <hi>comitia centuri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ata,</hi> which, after the expulsion of the kings, ren<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der'd the government, for some time, altogether a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ristocratical. But the people, having numbers and force on their side, and being elated with frequent conquests and victories in their foreign wars, always prevail'd when push'd to extremities, and first ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>torted from the senate the magistracy of the tri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bunes, and then the legislative power of the <hi>comitia tributa.</hi> It then behov'd the nobles to be more careful than ever not to provoke the people. For beside the force, which the latter were always pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sest of, they had now got possession of legal autho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity, and cou'd instantly break in pieces any order or institution, which directly oppos'd them. By intrigue, by influence, by money, by combinati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on, and by the respect paid their character; the nobles might often prevail, and direct the whole machine of government: But had they openly set their <hi>comitia centuriata</hi> in oposition to the <hi>tributa,</hi> they had soon lost the advantage of that institution, along with their consuls, praetors, ediles, and all the magistrates elected by it. But the <hi>comitia tri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>buta,</hi> not having the same reason for respecting the <hi>centuriata,</hi> frequently repeal'd laws favourable to
<pb n="151" facs="154"/>
the aristocracy: They limited the authority of the nobles; protected the people from oppression; and controul'd the actions of the senate and magis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tracy. The <hi>centuriata</hi> found it convenient always to submit; and tho' equal in authority, yet being inferior in power, durst never directly give any shock to the other legislature, either by repealing its laws, or establishing laws, which, it foresaw, wou'd soon be repeal'd by it.</p>
            <p>NO instance is found of any opposition or struggle betwixt these <hi>comitia;</hi> except one slight attempt of this kind, mention'd by <hi>Appian</hi> in the 3d book of his civil wars. <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> resolving to deprive <hi>Decimus Brutus</hi> of the government of <hi>Cisalpine Gaul,</hi> rail'd in the <hi>Forum,</hi> and call'd one of the <hi>comitia,</hi> in order to prevent the meeting of the o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, which had been order'd by the senate. But affairs were then fallen into such confusion, and the <hi>Roman</hi> constitution was so near its last extremity, that no inserence can be drawn from such an ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pedient. This contest, besides, was founded more on form than party. 'Twas the senate, who order'd the <hi>comitia tributa,</hi> that they might obstruct the meeting of the <hi>centuriata,</hi> which, by the constitu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, or at least forms of the government, cou'd a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lone dispose of provinces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cicero</hi> was recall'd by the <hi>comitia centuriata;</hi> tho' banish'd by the <hi>tributa,</hi> that is, by a <hi>plebiscitum:</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="155"/>
But his banishment, we may observe, never was consider'd as a legal deed, arising from the free choice and inclination of the people. It was al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ways ascrib'd to the violence alone of <hi>Clodius,</hi> and the disorders introduc'd by him into the govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="3">III. THE <hi>third</hi> custom we propos'd to observe regards <hi>England;</hi> and tho' it be not so important as those, which we have pointed out in <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> it is no less singular and remarkable. 'Tis a maxim in politics, which we readily admit as undisputed and universal, that a power, how<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever great, when granted by law to an eminent magistrate, is not so dangerous to liberty, as an authority, however inconsiderable, which he ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quires from violence and usurpation. For besides that the law always limits every power, which it bestows; the very receiving it as a concession e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stablishes the authority whence it is deriv'd, and preserves the harmony of the constitution. By the same right that one prerogative is assum'd without law, another may also be claim'd, and another, with still greater facility: While the first usurpa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions both serve as precedents to the following, and give force to maintain them. Hence the heroism of <hi>Hampden,</hi> who sustain'd the whole violence of royal prosecution rather than pay a tax of 20 shil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lings, not impos'd by parliament: Hence the care of all <hi>English</hi> patriots to guard against the first en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>croachments
<pb n="153" facs="156"/>
of the crown: And hence alone the existence, at this day, of <hi>English</hi> liberty.</p>
            <p>THERE is, however, one occasion, wherein the parliament has departed from this maxim; and that is, in the <hi>pressing of seamen.</hi> The exercise of an illegal power is here tacitly permitted in the crown; and tho' it has frequently been deliberat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed on, how that power might be render'd legal, and under what restrictions it might be granted to the sovereign, no safe expedient cou'd ever be pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pos'd for that purpose, and the danger to liberty always appear'd greater from law than from usur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pation. While this power is exercis'd to no other end than to man the navy, men willingly submit to it, from a sense of its use and necessity; and the sailors, who are alone affected by it, find no body to support them, in claiming the rights and privi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>leges, which the law grants, without distinction, to all <hi>English</hi> subjects. But were this power, on any occasion, made an instrument of faction or mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nisterial tyranny, the opposite faction, and indeed all lovers of their country, wou'd immediately take the alarm, and support the injur'd party: The liberty of <hi>Englishmen</hi> wou'd be asserted: Juries wou'd be implacable; and the tools of tyranny, acting both against law and equity, wou'd meet with the severest vengeance. On the other hand, were the parliament to grant such an authority, they wou'd probably fall into one of these two incon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veniencies: They wou'd either bestow it under so
<pb n="154" facs="157"/>
many restrictions as wou'd make it lose its effects, by cramping the authority of the crown; or they wou'd render it so large and comprehensive, as might give occasion to great abuses, for which we cou'd, in that case, have no remedy. The very illegality of the power, at present, prevents its a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>buses, by affording so easy a remedy against them.</p>
            <p>I PRETEND not, by this reasoning, to exclude all possibility of contriving a register for seamen, which might mann the navy, without being dange<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous to liberty. I only observe, that no satisfac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tory scheme of that nature has yet been propos'd. Rather than adopt any project hitherto invented, we continue a practice seemingly the most absurd and unaccountable. Authority, in times of full in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ternal peace and concord, is arm'd against law: A continu'd and open usurpation in the crown is permitted, amidst the greatest jealousy and watch<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fulness in the people; nay proceeding from those very principles: Liberty, in a country of the high<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>est liberty, is left entirely to its own defence, with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out any countenance or protection: The wild state of nature is renew'd, in one of the most civiliz'd societies of mankind: And great violences and dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>orders, amongst the people, the most humane and the best natur'd, are committed with impunity; while the one party pleads obedience to the su<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>preme magistrate, the other the permission of fun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>damental laws.</p>

               <note place="bottom" n="*">AN eminent clergyman in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> having wrote, some years ago, a discourse on the same question with this, of the popu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lousness of antient nations, was pleas'd lately to communicate it to the author.

            <p>THERE is very little ground, either from reason or experience, to conclude the uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verse eternal or incorruptible. The continual and rapid motion of matter, the violent revolutions with which every part is agitated, the changes remark'd in the heavens, the plain traces, as well as traditi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on, of an universal deluge or general convulsion of the elements; all these prove strongly the mortality of this fabric of the world, and its passage, by cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ruption or dissolution, from one state or order to an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>other. It must, therefore, have its infancy, youth, manhood, and old age, as well as each individual form, which it contains, and 'tis probable, that, in all these variations, man, equally with every animal
<pb n="156" facs="159"/>
and vegetable, will partake. In the flourishing age of the world, it may be expected, that the human species shou'd possess greater vigour both of mind and body, more prosperous health, higher spirits, longer life, and a stronger inclination and power of generation. But if the general system of things, and human society of course, have any such gradu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>al revolutions, they are too slow to be discernible in that short period, which is comprehended by his<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tory and tradition. Stature and force of body, length of life, even courage and extent of genius, seem hi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>therto to have been naturally, in all ages, pretty much the same. The arts and sciences, indeed, have flourish'd in one period, and have decay'd in another: But we may observe, that at the time when they rose to greatest perfection amongst one people, they were perhaps totally unknown to all the neighbouring nations; and tho' they universally decay'd in one age, yet in a succeeding generation they again reviv'd, and diffus'd themselves over the world. As far, therefore, as observation reaches, there is no universal difference discernible in the hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man species; and tho' it were allow'd, that the uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verse, like an animal body, had a natural progress from infancy to old age, yet as it must still be uncertain, whether, at present, it be advancing to its point of perfection, or declining from it, we cannot thence presuppose any decay in human nature. <note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <hi>Collumela</hi> says, lib. 3. cap. 8. that in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> the bearing of twins was frequent and even customary, <hi>gemini parties familiares, ac paene solennes sunt.</hi> If this was true, there is a phy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sical difference both in countries and ages. For travellers make no such remark of those countries at present. On the contrary, we are apt to suppose the northern nations more fertile. As those two countries were provinces of the <hi>Roman</hi> empire, it is difficult, tho' not altogether absurd, to suppose, that such a man as <hi>Colu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mella</hi> might be mistaken with regard to them.</note> To
<pb n="157" facs="160"/>
prove, therefore, or account for the greater popu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lousness of antiquity, by the imaginary youth or vigour of the world, will scarce be admitted by any just reasoner. These <hi>general physical</hi> causes ought entirely to be excluded from that question.</p>
            <p>THERE are indeed some more <hi>particular physi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cal</hi> causes of great importance. Diseases are men<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion'd in antiquity, which are almost unknown to modern medicine; and new diseases have arisen and propagated themselves, of which there are no traces in ancient history. And in this particular, we may observe, upon comparison, that the disad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantage is very much on the side of the moderns. Not to mention some others of less importance, the small pox commits such ravages, as would almost alone account for the great superiority suppos'd in antient times. The tenth or the twelfth part of mankind, destroy'd every generation, shou'd make a vast difference, it may be thought, in the num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bers of the people; and when join'd to venereal dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tempers, a new plague diffus'd every where, this disease is perhaps equivalent, by its constant oper<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ation, to the three great scourges of mankind, war,
<pb n="158" facs="161"/>
pestilence, and famine. Were it certain, therefore, that antient times were more populous than the pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent, and cou'd no moral causes be assign'd for so great a change; these physical causes alone, in the opinion of many, wou'd be sufficient to give us sa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tisfaction on that head.</p>
            <p>BUT is it certain, that antiquity was so much more populous, as is pretended? The extrava<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gancies of <hi>Vossius,</hi> with regard to this subject, are well known: But an author of much greater ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nius and discernment has ventur'd to affirm, that, according to the best computations, which these subjects will admit of, there are not now the fifti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>eth part of mankind on the face of the earth, which existed in the time of <hi>Julius Caesar.</hi> 
               <note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <hi>Lettres Persanes.</hi> See also <hi>L'Esprit des Loix liv.</hi> 23. chap. 17, 18, 19.</note> It may easi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly be observ'd, that the comparisons, in this case, must be very imperfect; even tho' we confine our<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves to the scene of antient history, <hi>Europe</hi> and the nations about the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> We know not exactly the numbers of any <hi>European</hi> kingdom, or even city, at present: How can we pretend to calculate those of antient cities and states, where historians have left us such imperfect traces? For my part, the matter appears to me so uncertain, that, as I intend to throw together some reflexi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons on that head, I shall intermingle the enquiry concerning <hi>causes</hi> with that concerning <hi>facts;</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="162"/>
which ought never to be admitted, where the facts can be ascertain'd with any tolerable assurance. We shall <hi>first</hi> consider, whether it be probable, from what we know of the situation of society in both periods, that antiquity must have been more populous. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether in reality it was so. If I can make appear, that the conclusion is not so certain, as is pretended, in favour of antiquity, 'tis all I aspire to.</p>
            <p>IN general, we may observe, that the question with regard to the comparative populousness of ages or kingdoms implies very important consequences, and commonly determines concerning the prefe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rence of their whole police, manners, and constituti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on of government. For as there is in all men, both male and female, a desire and power of generation more active than is ever universally exerted, the re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>straints, which it lyes under, must proceed from some difficulties in mens situation, which it be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>longs to a wise legislature carefully to observe and remove. Almost every man, who thinks he can maintain a family, will have one; and the human species, at this rate of propagation, wou'd more than double every generation, were every one coupled as soon as he comes to the age of puberty. How fast do mankind multiply in every colony or new settle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment; where it is an easy matter to provide for a family; and where men are no way straitned or confin'd, as in long establish'd governments? Hi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>story
<pb n="160" facs="163"/>
tells us frequently of plagues, that have swept away the third or fourth part of a people: Yet in a generation or two, the destruction was not per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceiv'd; and the society had again acquir'd their former number. The lands, that were cultivated, the houses built, the commodities rais'd, the riches acquir'd, enabled the people, who escap'd, imme<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diately to marry, and to rear families, which sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ply'd the place of those who had perish'd. <note place="bottom" n="*">THIS too is a good reason, why the small pox does not de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>populate countries so much as may at first sight be imagin'd. Where there is room for more people, they will always arise, even without the assistance of naturalization bills. 'Tis remarkt by <hi>Don Geronimo de Ustariz,</hi> that the provinces of <hi>Spain,</hi> which send most people to the <hi>Indies,</hi> are most populous; which pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceeds from their superior riches.</note> And for a like reason, every wise, just, and mild govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, by rendering the condition of its subjects ea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sy and secure, will always abound most in people, as well as in commodities and riches. A country, indeed, whose climate and soil are fitted for vines, will naturally be more populous than one, which produces only corn, and that more populous than one, which is only fitted for pasturage. But if every thing else be equal, it seems natural to expect, that whereever there are most happiness and virtue and the wisest institutions, there will also be most people.</p>
            <p>THE question, therefore, concerning the popu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lousness of antient and modern times being allow'd of great importance, 'twill be requisite, if we wou'd
<pb n="161" facs="164"/>
bring it to some determination, to compare both the <hi>domestic</hi> and <hi>political</hi> situation of these two pe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riods, in order to judge of the facts by their moral causes; which is the first view, in which we pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pos'd to consider them.</p>
            <p>THE chief difference betwixt the <hi>domestic</hi> oeco<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nomy of the antients and that of the moderns con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sists in the practice of slavery, which prevail'd a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mongst the former, and which has been abolish'd for some centuries throughout the greatest part of <hi>Europe.</hi> Some passionate admirers of the antients and zealous partizans of civil liberty (for these sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timents, as they are both of them, in the main, extremely just, are also found to be almost inse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parable) cannot forbear regreting the loss of this institution; and whilst they brand all submission to the government of a single person, with the harsh denomination of slavery, they wou'd gladly subject the greatest part of mankind to real slavery and subjection. But to one, who considers cooly of the subject, it will appear, that human nature, in general, really enjoys more liberty at present, in the most arbitrary government of <hi>Europe,</hi> than it ever did during the most flourishing period of antient times. As much as submission to a petty prince, whose dominions extend not beyond a single city, is more grievous than obedience to a great mon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>arch; so much is domestic slavery more cruel and oppressive than any civil subjection whatsoever.
<pb n="162" facs="165"/>
The more the master is remov'd from us in place and rank, the greater liberty do we enjoy; the less are our actions inspected and controul'd; and the fainter that cruel comparison becomes betwixt our own subjection, and the freedom and even domi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nion of another. The remains, that are left of do<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mestic slavery, in our colonies, and amongst some <hi>European</hi> nations, wou'd never surely create a de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sire os rendering it more universal. The little hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manity commonly observ'd in persons, accustom'd, from their infancy, to exercise so great authority over their fellow creatures, and to trample upon human nature, were sufficient alone to disgust us with that authority. Nor can a more probable rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son be given for the severe, I might say, barbarous, manners of antient times, than the practice of do<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mestic slavery; by which every man of rank was render'd a petty tyrant, and educated amidst the flattery, submission, and low debasement of his slaves.</p>
            <p>ACCORDING to the antient practice, all checks were on the inferior, to restrain him to the duty of submission; none on the superior, to engage him to the reciprocal duties of gentleness and humanity. In modern times, a bad servant finds not easily a good master, nor a bad master a good servant; and the checks are mutual, suitable to the inviolate and eternal laws of reason and equity.</p>

THE custom of exposing old, useless, or sick slaves in an island of the <hi>Tyber,</hi> there to starve, seems to have been pretty common in <hi>Rome;</hi> and who<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever recover'd, after having been so expos'd, had his liberty given him, by an edict of the emperor <hi>Claudius;</hi> where it was likeways forbid to kill any slave, merely for old age or sickness. <note place="bottom" n="*">Suetonius in vita Claudii.</note> But sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posing, that this edict was strictly obey'd, wou'd it better the domestic treatment of slaves, or ren<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der their lives much more comfortable?

            <p>BUT our present business is only to consider the influence of slavery on the populousness of a state. 'Tis pretended, that, in this particular, the antient practice has infinitely the advantage, and was the the chief cause of that extreme populousness, which
<pb n="166" facs="169"/>
is suppos'd in those times. At present, all masters discourage the marrying of their male servants, and admit not by any means the marriage of the female, who are then suppos'd altogether incapacitated for their service. But where the property of the ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vants is lodg'd in the master, their marriage and sertility form his riches, and bring him a succession of slaves that supply the place of those, whom age and infirmity have disabled. He encourages, there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore, their propagation, as much as that of his cattle; rears the young with the same care; and educates them to some art or calling, which may render them more useful or valuable to him. The opu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lent are, by this policy, interested in the being at least, tho' not the well-being of the poor; and enrich themselves by encreasing the number and industry of those, who are subjected to them. Each man, being a sovereign in his own family, has the same interest with regard to it, as the prince with regard to the state; and has not, like the prince, any opposite motives of ambition or vain-glory, which may lead him to depopulate his little sove<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reignty. All of it is, at all times, under his eye; and he has leisure to inspect the most minute de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tail of the marriage and education of his subjects. <note place="bottom" n="*">WE may here observe, that if domestic slavery really encreas'd populousness, it wou'd be an exception to the general rule, that the happiness of any society and its populousness are necessary atten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dants. A master, from humour or interest, may make his slaves very unhappy, and yet be careful, from interest, to encrease their number. Their marriage is not a matter of choice with them, no more than any other action of their life.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="170"/>
SUCH are the consequences of domestic slavery, according to the first aspect and appearance of things: But if we enter deeper into the subject, we shall perhaps find reason to retract our hasty deter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>minations. The comparison is shocking betwixt the management of human creatures and that of cattle; but being extremely just, when apply'd to the present subject, it may be proper to trace the consequences of it. At the capital, near all great cities, in all populous, rich, industrious provinces, few cattle are bred. Provisions, lodging, atten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dance, labour are there dear; and men find better their account in buying the cattle, after they come to a certain age, from the remoter and cheaper countries. These are consequently the only breed<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing countries for cattle; and by a parity of reason, for men too, when the latter are put on the same footing with the former. To rear a child in <hi>Lon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>don,</hi> till he cou'd be serviceable, wou'd cost much dearer, than to buy one of the same age from <hi>Scot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land</hi> or <hi>Ireland;</hi> where he had been rais'd in a cot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tage, cover'd with rags, and fed on oatmeal or po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tatoes. Those who had slaves, therefore, in all the richer and more populous countries, wou'd dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>courage the pregnancy of the females, and either
<pb n="168" facs="171"/>
prevent or destroy the birth. The human species wou'd perish in those places, where it ought to en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>crease the fastest; and a perpetual recruit be need<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed from all the poorer and more desart provinces. Such a continu'd drain wou'd tend mightily to de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>populate the state, and render great cities ten times more destructive than with us; where every man is master of himself, and provides for his children from the powerful instinct of nature, not the calculations of sordid interest. If <hi>London,</hi> at present, without much encreasing, needs a yearly recruit from the country of 5000 people, as is commonly comput<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed: What must it require, if the greatest part of the tradesmen and common people were slaves, and were hinder'd from breeding, by their avarici<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous masters?</p>
            <p>ALL antient authors tell us, that there was a perpetual flux of slaves to <hi>Italy</hi> from the remoter provinces, particularly <hi>Syria, Cilicia,</hi> 
               <note place="bottom" n="*">TEN thousand slaves in a day have been often sold for the use of the <hi>Romans,</hi> at <hi>Delus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia. Strabo,</hi> lib. 14.</note>

So far from multiplying, they cou'd not, it seems, so much as keep up the stock, without immense recruits.

            <p>THE term for a slave, born and bred in the fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mily, was <hi>verna;</hi> 
               <note place="bottom" n="†">As <hi>servus</hi> was the name of the genus, and <hi>verna</hi> of the spe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cies, without any correlative, this forms a strong presumption, that the latter were, by far, the least numerous. 'Tis an universal observation, which we may form upon language, that where two related parts of a whole bear any proportion to each other, in numbers, rank, or consideration, there are always correlative terms invented, which answer to both the parts, and express their mu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tual relation. If they bear no proportion to each other, the term is only invented for the less, and marks its distinction from the whole. Thus, man and woman, master and servant, father and son, prince and subject, stranger and citizen are correlative terms. But the words, seaman, carpenter, smith, taylor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have no cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>respondent terms, which express those who are no seaman, no car<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>penter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Languages differ very much with regard to the par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticular words, where this distinction obtains; and may thence af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ford very strong inferences, concerning the manners and customs of different nations. The military government of the <hi>Roman</hi> emperors had exalted the soldiery so high, that they balanc'd all the other orders of the state: Hence <hi>miles</hi> and <hi>paganus</hi> became re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lative terms, a thing, till then, unknown to antient and still so to modern languages. Modern superstition exalted the clergy so high, that they overbalanced the whole state: Hence <hi>clergy</hi> and <hi>laity</hi> are terms oppos'd in all modern languages; and in these alone. And from the same principles I infer, that, if the number of slaves, bought by the <hi>Romans</hi> from foreign countries, had not extremely exceeded those bred at home, <hi>verna</hi> wou'd have had a correlative, which wou'd have exprest the former species of slaves. But these, it wou'd seem, compos'd the main body of the antient slaves, and the latter were but a few exceptions.</note> and these slaves seem to have

He seems not to suppose they are ever marry'd.

For as it is requisite, says he, to have an overseer and his wife, whether the vineyard or plantation be great or small, this must alter the ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>actness of the proportion.

THE common reason why parents thrust their daughters into nunneries, is, that they may not be overburthen'd with too numerous a family; but the antients had a method almost as innocent and more effectual to that purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> the exposing their children in the earliest infancy.

Perhaps, by an odd conexion of causes, the barbarous practice of the antients might ra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther render those times more populous.

OF all sciences there is none, where first ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pearances are more deceitful than politics. Hos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pitals for foundlings seem favourable to the encrease of numbers; and perhaps, may be so, when kept under proper restrictions. But when they open the door to every one, without distinction, they have probably a contrary effect, and are pernicious to the state. 'Tis computed, that every ninth child, born at <hi>Paris,</hi> is sent to the hospital; tho' it seems certain, according to the common course of human affairs, that 'tis not a hundredth part, whose pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rents are altogether incapacitated to rear and edu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cate them. The infinite difference, for health, industry, and morals, betwixt an education in an hospital and that in a private family, shou'd induce us not to make the entrance into an hospital too ea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sy and engaging. To kill one's own child is shock<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to nature, and must therefore be pretty unusual; but to turn over the care of him upon others is very tempting to the natural indolence of mankind.</p>

            <p>IT must be own'd, that the situation of affairs in modern times, with regard to civil liberty, as well as equality of fortune, is not near so favourable, ei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther to the propagation or happiness of mankind. <hi>Europe</hi> is shar'd out mostly into great monarchies; and such parts of it as are divided into small terri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tories, are commonly govern'd by absolute princes, who ruin their people by a ridiculous mimickry of the greater monarchs, in the splendor of their court and number of their forces. <hi>Swisserland</hi> alone and <hi>Holland</hi> resemble the antient republics; and tho' the former is far from possessing any advantage ei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
<pb n="186" facs="189"/>
of soil, climate, or commerce, yet the num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bers of people, with which it abounds, notwith<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>standing their enlisting themselves into every ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vice in <hi>Europe,</hi> prove sufficiently the advantages of their political institutions.</p>
            <p>THE antient republics deriv'd their chief or on<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly security from the numbers of their citizens. The <hi>Trachinians</hi> having lost great numbers of their people, the remainder, instead of enriching them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves by the inheritance of their fellow citizens, ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ply'd to <hi>Sparta,</hi> their metropolis, for a new stock of inhabitants. The <hi>Spartans</hi> immediately col<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lected ten thousand men, amongst whom the old citizens divided the lands, of which the former pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prietors had perish'd.<note place="bottom" n="*">

<pb n="187" facs="190"/>
and of the good effects of these maxims, in the extreme populousness of that small country, <hi>Greece,</hi> which cou'd at once supply so large a co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lony. The case was not much different with the <hi>Romans</hi> in early times. He is a pernicious citizen, said <hi>M.

                  <hi>Plin.</hi> lib. 18. cap. 3.

Sex domi femissem Africae possidebant, cum interfecit cos Nero princeps.</hi> In this view, the barbarous butchery committed by the first <hi>Roman</hi> emperors was not perhaps so destructive to the public as we may imagine. These never ceas'd till they had extin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guish'd all the illustrious families, which had enjoy'd the plun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der of the world, during the latter ages of the republic. The new nobles, who rose in their place, were less splendid, as we learn from <hi>Tacit. Ann.</hi> lib. 3. cap. 55.</note> Such ideas of equality cou'd not fail to produce populousness.</p>
            <p>WE must now consider what disadvantages the antients lay under with regard to populousness, and what checks they receiv'd from their political max<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ims and institutions. There are commonly com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pensations in every human condition; and tho' these compensations be not always perfectly equi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>valent, yet they serve, at least, to restrain the pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vailing principle. To compare them and estimate their influence is indeed very difficult, even where they take place in the same age and in neighbour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing countries: But where several ages have inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven'd, and only scatter'd lights are afforded us by antient authors; what can we do but amuse our<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves
<pb n="188" facs="191"/>
by talking, <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> on an interesting subject, and thereby correcting all hasty and vio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lent determinations?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> WE may observe, that the antient repu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blics were almost in perpetual war; a natural ef<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect of their martial spirit, their love of liberty, their mutual emulation, and that hatred, which gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rally prevails amongst nations, that live in a close neighbourhood. Now war in a small state is much more destructive than in a great one; both because all the inhabitants, in the former case, must fill the armies, and because the state is all frontier, and all expos'd to the inroads of the enemy.</p>
            <p>THE maxims of antient war were much more destructive than those of modern; chiefly by the distribution of plunder, in which the soldiers were indulg'd. Our common soldiers are such a low rascally set of people, that we find any abundance, beyond their simple pay, breeds confusion and dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>order, and a total dissolution of discipline. The very wretchedness and meanness of those, who fill the modern armies, render them less destructive to the countries, which they invade: One instance, amongst many, of the deceitfulness of first appear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ances in all political reasonings.<note place="bottom" n="*">THE antient soldiers, being free citizens, above the lowest rank, were all marry'd. Our modern soldiers are either forc'dto live unmarry'd, or their marriages turn to small account to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards the encrease of mankind. A circumstance which ought, perhaps, to be taken into consideration, as of some consequence in favour of the antients.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="192"/>
ANTIENT battles were much more bloody by the very nature of the weapons employ'd in them. The antients drew up their men 16 or 20, some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>times 50 men deep, which made a narrow front; and 'twas not difficult to find a field, in which both armies might be marshall'd, and might engage with each other. Even where any body of the troops was kept off by hedges, hillocks, woods, or hollow ways, the battle was not so soon decided be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>twixt the contending parties, but that the others had time to overcome the difficulties, that oppos'd them, and take part in the engagement. And as the whole armies were thus engag'd, and each man closely buckl'd to his antagonist, the battles were com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monly very bloody, and great slaughter made on both sides, but especially on the vanquish'd. The long, thin lines, requir'd by fire arms, and the quick decision of the fray, render our modern engage<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments but partial rencounters, and enable the ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neral, who is foil'd in the beginning of the day, to draw off the greatest part of his army, sound and entire. Cou'd <hi>Folard</hi>'s project of the column take place (which seems impracticable<note place="bottom" n="*">WHAT is the advantage of the column after it has broke the enemy's line? Only, that it then takes them in the flank, and dissipates whatever stands near it by a fire from all sides. But till it has broke them, does it not present a flank to the enemy, and that expos'd to their musquetry, and what is much worse, to their cannon?</note>) it wou'd ren<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der modern battles as destructive as the antient.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="193"/>
            <p>THE battles of antiquity, both by their durati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on and their resemblance of single combats, were wrought up to a degree of fury, quite unknown to latter ages. Nothing cou'd then engage the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>batants to give quarter but the hopes of profit, by making slaves of their prisoners. In civil wars, as we learn from <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="†">HIST. lib. 2. cap. 44.</note> the battles were the most bloody, because the prisoners were not slaves.</p>
            <p>WHAT a stout resistance must be made, where the vanquish'd expected so hard a fate! How in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veterate the rage, where the maxims of war were, in every respect, so bloody and severe!</p>
            <p>INSTANCES are very frequent, in antient histo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry, of cities besieg'd, whose inhabitants, rather than open their gates, murder'd their wives and chil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dren, and rush'd themselves on a voluntary death, sweeten'd perhaps with a little prospect of revenge upon the enemy. <hi>Greeks,</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">As <hi>Abydus</hi> mention'd by <hi>Livy,</hi> lib. 31. cap. 17, 18. and <hi>Polyb.</hi> lib. 16. As also the <hi>Xanthians, Appian de bell. civil.</hi> lib. 4.</note> as well as <hi>Barbarians,</hi> have been often wrought up to this degree of fury. And the same determinate spirit and cruelty must, in many other instances, less remarkable, have been
<pb n="191" facs="194"/>
extremely destructive to human society, in those petty commonwealths, that liv'd in a close neigh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bourhood, and were engag'd in perpetual wars and contentions.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES the wars in <hi>Greece,</hi> says <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">In vita Arati.</note> were carried on entirely by inroads, and robberies, and pyracies. Such a method of war must be more destructive, in small states, than the bloodiest battles and sieges.</p>
            <p>BY the laws of the 12 tables, possession for two years form'd a prescription for land; one year for movables:<note place="bottom" n="†">INST. lib. 2. cap. 6. 'Tis true, the same law seems to have been continu'd, till the time of <hi>Justinian.</hi> But abuses, introduc'd by barbarism, are not always corrected by civility.</note> An indication, that there was not in <hi>Italy,</hi> during that period, much more order, tran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quillity, and settled police than there is at present a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mongst the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE only cartel, I remember in antient history, is that betwixt <hi>Demetrius Poliorcetes</hi> and the <hi>Rho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dians;</hi> when it was agreed, that a free citizen shou'd be restor'd for 1000 <hi>drachamas,</hi> a slave bearing arms for 500.<note place="bottom" n="‡">

            </p>
            <p>BUT <hi>secondly,</hi> it appears, that antient manners were more unfavourable than the modern, not on<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly in time of war but also in time of peace, and that too, in every respect, except the love of civil li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berty
<pb n="192" facs="195"/>
and equality, which is, I own, of considerable importance. To exclude faction from a free go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernment is very difficult, if not altogether imprac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticable; but such inveterate rage betwixt the fac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions, and such bloody maxims, are found, in mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dern times, amongst religious parties alone, where bigotted priests are the accusers, judges, and execu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tioners. In antient history, we may always ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serve, where one party prevail'd, whether the no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bles or people, (for I can observe no difference in this respect <note place="bottom" n="†">
                  <hi>Lysias,</hi> who was himself of the popular faction, and very nar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rowly escap'd from the 30 <hi>Tyrants,</hi> says that the Democracy was as violent a government as the Oligarchy. <hi>Orat.</hi> 24. de statu popul.</note>) that they immediately butcher'd all of the opposite party they laid their hands on, and banish'd such as had been so fortunate as to escape their fury. No form of process, no law, no trial, no pardon. A fourth, a third, perhaps near a half of the city were slaughter'd, or expell'd, every revo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lution; and the exiles always join'd foreign ene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mies, and did all the mischief possible to their fel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low citizens; till fortune put it in their power to take full revenge by a new revolution. And as these were very frequent in such violent govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments, the disorder, diffidence, jealousy, enmity, which must prevail, are not easy for us to imagine in this age of the world.</p>
            <p>THERE are only two revolutions I can recollect in all antient history, which past without great se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verity and great effusion of blood in massacres and
<pb n="193" facs="196"/>
assassinations, <hi>viz.</hi> the restoration of the <hi>Athenian</hi> democracy by <hi>Thrasybulus,</hi> and the subduing the <hi>Roman</hi> republic by <hi>Caesar.</hi> We learn from antient history, that <hi>Thrasybulus</hi> past a general amnesty for all past offences; and first introduc'd that word, as well as practice into <hi>Greece.</hi>

               </note> that the chief, and even some of the subaltern offenders, in the pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceeding tyranny, were try'd, and capitally punish'd. This is a difficulty not clear'd up, and even not ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serv'd, by antiquarians and historians. And as to <hi>Caesar's</hi> clemency, tho' much celebrated, it wou'd not gain great applause in the present age.

All those, who had born arms against that usurper, were forfeited; and, by <hi>Hirtius</hi>'s law, de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clar'd incapable of all public offices.</p>
            <p>THESE people were extremely fond of liberty; but seem not to have understood it very well. When the thirty tyrants first establish'd their do<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>minion at <hi>Athens,</hi> they began with seizing all the sycophants and informers, that had been so trouble<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>some during the democracy, and putting them to death, by an arbitrary sentence and execution. <hi>E<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very</hi>

            <p>THE utmost energy of <hi>Thucydides</hi>'s nervous stile, and the great copiousness and expression of the <hi>Greek</hi> language seem to sink under that historian, when he attempts to describe the disorders, that a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rose from faction, throughout all the <hi>Greek</hi> com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monwealths. You wou'd imagine, that he still labours with a thought greater than he can find words to communicate. And he concludes his pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thetic description with an observation, which is at once very refin'd and very solid. <q>In these con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tests, (says he,) those who were dullest and most stupid and had the least foresight, com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monly prevail'd. For being conscious of this weakness, and dreading to be over-reach'd by those of greater penetration, they went to work hastily, without premeditation, by the sword and poniard, and thereby prevented their antago<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nists, who were forming fine schemes and pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jects for their destruction.</q>

INEED not insist on the <hi>Greek</hi> tyrannies, which were altogether horrible. Even the mixt monar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chies, by which most of the antient states of <hi>Greece</hi> were govern'd, before the introduction of repub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lics, were very unsettled.

<pb n="200" facs="203"/>
by a necessary consequence, must contribute to unsettle and disturb the state. The universal preference given to the elder in modern govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments, tho' it increases the inequality of fortunes, has, however, this good effect, that it accustoms men to the same idea of public succession, and cuts off all claim and pretension of the younger.</p>

Why otherways did the <hi>Greeks</hi> so much value them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves on their humanity, gentleness and modera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion above all other nations? This reasoning seems very natural: But unluckily the history of the <hi>Roman</hi> commonwealth, in its earlier times, if we give credit to the receiv'd accounts, stands against us. No blood was ever shed in any sedition at

               <hi>Rome,</hi> 'till the murder of the <hi>Gracchi. Dionysius Halicarnassoeus</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="‡">LIB. 1.</note>, observing the singular humanity of the <hi>Roman</hi> people in this respect, makes use of it as an argument that they were originally of <hi>Gre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cian</hi> extraction: Whence we may conclude, that the factions and revolutions in the barbarous re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>publics were more violent than even those of <hi>Greece</hi> above mention'd.</p>
            <p>IF the <hi>Romans</hi> were so late in coming to blows, they made ample compensation after they had once enter'd upon the bloody scene; and <hi>Appian</hi>'s histo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry of their civil wars contains the most frightful picture of massacres, proscriptions and forfeitures, that ever was presented to the world. What pleases most in that historian is, that he seems to feel a proper resentment of these barbarous pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceedings; and talks not with that provoking cool<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness and indifference, which custom had produc'd in many of the <hi>Greek</hi> historians.<note place="bottom" n="¶">THE authorities cited above are all historians, orators, and philosophers, whose testimony is unquestioned.

THE maxims of antient politics contain, in general, so little humanity and moderation, that it seems superfluous to give any particular reason for the violences committed at any particular period. Yet I cannot forbear observing, that the laws, in the latter ages of the <hi>Roman</hi> commonwealth, were so absurdly contriv'd, that they oblig'd the heads of parties to have recourse to these extre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mities. All capital punishments were abolish'd: However criminal, or what is more, however dan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gerous any citizen might be, he cou'd not regu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larly be punish'd otherways than by banishment: And it became necessary, in the revolutions of par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty, to draw the sword of private vengeance; nor was it easy, when laws were once violated, to set bounds to these sanguinary proceedings. Had <hi>Bru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tus</hi> himself prevail'd over the <hi>triumvirate,</hi> cou'd he, in common prudence, have allow'd <hi>Octavius</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="206"/>
and <hi>Anthony</hi> to live, and have contented himself with banishing them to <hi>Rhodes</hi> or <hi>Marseilles,</hi> where they might still have plotted new commotions and rebellions? His executing <hi>C. Antonius,</hi> bro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther to the <hi>triumvir,</hi> shows evidently his sense of the matter. Did not <hi>Cicero,</hi> with the approbati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on of all the wise and virtuous of <hi>Rome,</hi> arbitrari<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly put to death <hi>Catiline</hi>'s associates, contrary to law, and without any trial or form of process? And if he moderated his executions, did it not proceed, either from the clemency of his temper or the conjunctures of the times? A wretched security in a government, which pretends to laws and li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berty.</p>
            <p>THUS, one extreme produces another. In the same manner as excessive severity in the laws is apt to beget great relaxation in their execution; so their excessive lenity naturally engenders cruelty and barbarity. 'Tis dangerous to force us, in a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny case, to use freedom with their sacred regulati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons and prescriptions.</p>
            <p>ONE general cause of the disorders, so frequent in all antient governments, seems to have consisted in the great difficulty of establishing any aristocra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cy in those ages, and the perpetual discontents and seditions of the people, whenever even the meanest and most beggarly were excluded from the legis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lature and from public offices. The very quality
<pb n="204" facs="207"/>
of <hi>freeman</hi> gave such a rank, being oppos'd to that of <hi>slave,</hi> that it seem'd to intitle the possessor to every power and privilege of the common<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wealth. <hi>Salon</hi>'s <note place="bottom" n="†">Plutarch. in vita Salon.</note> laws excluded no freeman from votes or elections, but confin'd some magistracies to a particular <hi>census;</hi> yet were the people never satisfy'd 'till those laws were repeal'd. By the treaty with <hi>Antipater</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="‡">

               <hi>Cassander</hi> reduc'd that <hi>census</hi> to the half <note place="bottom" n="∴">Id, ibid.</note>; yet still the go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernment was consider'd as an oligarchical tyran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny, and the effect of foreign violence.</p>

            <p>IN those days, there was no medium betwixt a severe, jealous aristocracy, over discontented sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jects; and a turbulent, factious, tyrannical demo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cracy.</p>

BUT <hi>thirdly,</hi> there are many other circumstan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces, in which antient nations seem inferior to the modern, both for the happiness and encrease of mankind.

The perse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cutions of <hi>Philip</hi> the II. and <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. fill'd all <hi>Europe</hi> with the manufacturers of <hi>Flanders</hi> and of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I GRANT, that agriculture is the species of in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dustry, which is chiefly requisite to the subsistence of multitudes of people; and it is possible, that this industry may flourish, even where manufactures and other arts are unknown or neglected. <hi>Swis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serland</hi> is at present a very remarkable instance; where we find, at once, the most skilful husband<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>men and the most bungling tradesmen, that are to be met with in all <hi>Europe.</hi> That agriculture flou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rish'd mightily in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> at least in some parts of them, and at some periods, we have rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son
<pb n="209" facs="212"/>
to presume: And whether the mechanical arts had reach'd the same degree of perfection may not be esteem'd so material; especially, if we consi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der the great equality in the antient republics, where each family was oblig'd to cultivate, with the greatest care and industry, its own little field, in order to its subsistence.</p>
            <p>BUT is it just reasoning, because agriculture may, in some instances, flourish without trade or manu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>factures, to conclude that, in any great extent of country, and for any great tract of time, it wou'd subsist alone? The most natural way, surely, of en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>couraging husbandry, is first to excite other kinds of industry, and thereby afford the labourer a ready market for his commodities, and a return of such goods as may contribute to his pleasure and enjoy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment. This method is infallible and universal; and as it prevails more in modern governments than in the antient, it affords a presumption of the superior populousness of the former.</p>
            <p>EVERY man, says <hi>Xenophon,</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">Oecon.</note> may be a farmer: No art or skill is requisite: All consists in the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dustry and attention to the execution. A strong proof, as <hi>Columella</hi> hints, that agriculture was but little known in the age of <hi>Xenophon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL our latter improvements and refinements; have they operated nothing towards the easy sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sistence
<pb n="210" facs="213"/>
of men, and consequently towards their propagation and encrease? Our superior skill in mechanics, the discovery of new worlds, by which commerce has been so much enlarg'd, the esta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blishment of posts, and the use of bills of exchange; these seem all extremely useful to the encourage<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment of art, industry, and populousness. Were we to strike off these, what a check wou'd we give to every kind of business and labour, and what mul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>titudes of families wou'd immediately perish from want and hunger? And it seems not probable, that we cou'd supply the place of these new inventions by any other regulation or institution.</p>
            <p>HAVE we reason to think, that the police of an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tient states was any way comparable to that of modern, or that men had then equal security, either at home, or in their journeys by land or water? I question not, but every impartial exami<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner wou'd give us the preference in this particular.<note place="bottom" n="*">SEE essays moral and political, essay XV.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THUS upon comparing the whole, it seems im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>possible to assign any just reason, why the world shou'd have been more populous in antient than in modern times. The equality of property, a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mongst the antients, liberty, and the small divisi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons of their states, were indeed favourable to the propagation of mankind: But their wars were more bloody and destructive; their governments
<pb n="211" facs="214"/>
more factious and unsettl'd; commerce and ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nufactures more feeble and languishing; and the general police more loose and irregular. These latter disadvantages seem to form a sufficient coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter-balance to the former advantages; and rather favour the opposite opinion to that which common<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly prevails with regard to this subject.</p>
            <p>BUT there is no reasoning, it may be said, a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gainst matter of fact. If it appear, that the world was then more populous than at present, we may be assur'd, that our conjectures are false, and that we have overlook'd some material circumstance in the comparison. This I readily own: All our preceding reasonings, I acknowledge to be mere trifling, or, at least, small skirmishes and frivolous rencounters, that decide nothing. But unluckily the main combat, where we compare facts, can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not be render'd much more decisive. The facts deliver'd by antient authors are either so uncertain or so imperfect as to afford us nothing decisive in this matter. How indeed cou'd it be otherwise? The very facts, which we must oppose to them, in computing the greatness of modern states, are far from being either certain or compleat. Many grounds of calculation, proceeded on by celebrat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed writers, are little better than those of the em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>peror <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> who form'd an estimate of the immense greatness of <hi>Rome,</hi> from ten thousand

            </p>
            <p>'TIS to be remark'd, that all kinds of numbers are uncertain in antient manuscripts, and have been subject to much greater corruptions than any other part of the text; and that for a very obvious rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son. Any alteration in other places, commonly affects the sense or grammar, and is more readily perceiv'd by the reader and transcriber.</p>
            <p>FEW enumerations of inhabitants have been made of any tract of country by any antient author of good authority; so as to afford us a large enough view for comparison.</p>
            <p>'TIS probable, that there was formerly a good foundation for the numbers of citizens assigned to any free city; because they enter'd for a share of the government, and there were exact registers kept of them. But as the number of slaves is seldom mention'd, this leaves us in as great uncertain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty as ever, with regard to the populousness even of single cities.</p>
            <p>The first page of <hi>Thucydides</hi> is, in my opinion, the commencement of real history. All preced<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing narrations are so intermixt with fable, that phi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>losophers
<pb n="213" facs="216"/>
ought to abandon them, in a great mea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure, to the embellishment of poets and orators.<note place="bottom" n="*">IN general, there is more candour and sincerity in antient hi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>storians, but less exactness and care, than in the moderns. Our speculative factions, especially those of religion, throw such an illusion over our minds, that men seem to regard impartiality to their adversaries and to heretics, as a vice or weakness: But the commonness of books, by means of printing, has oblig'd modern historians to be more careful in avoiding contradictions and incon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gruities. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> is a good writer; but 'tis with pain I see his narration contradict, in so many particulars, the two most authentic pieces of all <hi>Greek</hi> history, <hi>viz. Xenophon</hi>'s expedition, and <hi>Demosthenes'</hi> orations. <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Appian</hi> seem scarce ever to have read <hi>Cicero</hi>'s epistles.</note>

            <p>WITH regard to remote times, the numbers of people assign'd are often ridiculous, and lose all cre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dit and authority. The free citizens of <hi>Sybaris,</hi> able to bear arms, and actually drawn out in battle, were 300,000.

               <note place="bottom" n="*">LIB. 1.</note> gives three millions of inhabitants to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> a very small number: But then he makes the number of their cities amount to 18,000: An evident contra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diction.</p>

            <p>THAT <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s army was extremely numerous, I can readily believe; both from the great extent of his

There is something very rational, I own, in <hi>Lysi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>as</hi>'s <note place="bottom" n="‡">Orat. funebris.</note> argument upon this subject. Had not <hi>Xerx<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>es</hi>'s army been incredibly numerous, says he, he had never made a bridge over the <hi>Hellespont:</hi> It had been much easier to have transported his men over so short a passage, with the numerous shipping he was master of.</p>

The United Provinces never were masters of such a force by sea and land, as that which is said to belong to <hi>Dionysius;</hi> yet they possess as large a territory, per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fectly
<pb n="218" facs="221"/>
well cultivated, and have infinitely more re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sources from their commerce and industry. <hi>Dio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dorus Siculus</hi> allows, that, even in his time, the army of <hi>Dionysius</hi> appear'd incredible; that is, as I interpret it, it was entirely a fiction, and the o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pinion arose from the exaggerated flattery of the courtiers, and perhaps from the vanity and policy of the tyrant himself.</p>
            <p>THE critical art may very justly be suspected of temerity, when it pretends to correct or dispute the plain testimony of antient historians by any pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bable or analogical reasonings: Yet the licence of authors upon all subjects, particularly with regard to numbers, is so great, that we ought still to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain a kind of doubt or reserve, whenever the facts advanc'd depart, in the least, from the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon bounds of nature and experience. I shall give an instance with regard to modern history. Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> tells us, in his memoirs, that, having a free conversation with <hi>Charles</hi> the II, he took the opportunity of representing to that mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>narch the impossibility of introducing into this island the religion and government of <hi>France,</hi> chiefly on account of the great force, requisite to subdue the spirit and liberty of so brave a people. <q>The <hi>Romans,</hi> says he, were forc'd to keep up 12 legi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons for that purpose'' (a great absurdity<note place="bottom" n="*">
                     <hi>Strabo,</hi> lib. 4. says that one legion would be sufficient, with a few cavalry; but the <hi>Romans</hi> commonly kept up somewhat a greater force in this island; which they never took pains entirely to subdue.</note>) and
<pb n="219" facs="222"/>
                  <hi>Cromwell</hi> left an army of near eighty thousand men.</q> Must not this last fact be regarded as unquestion'd by future critics, when they find it asserted by a wise and learned minister of state, contemporary to the fact, and who addrest his discourse, upon an ungrateful subject, to a great monarch, who was also contemporary, and who himself broke those very forces about fourteen years before. Yet by the most undoubted autho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity, we may insist, that <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s army, when he died, did not amount to half the number here mention'd.</p>
            <p>'TIS a very usual fallacy to consider all the ages of antiquity as one period, and to compute the numbers contain'd in the great cities mention'd by antient authors, as if these cities had been all con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>temporary. The <hi>Greek</hi> colonies flourish'd ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tremely in <hi>Sicily,</hi> during the age of <hi>Alexander:</hi> But in <hi>Augustus</hi>'s time they were so decay'd, that almost all the product of that fertile island was con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sum'd in <hi>Italy.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THE same remark is to be extended to all the other <hi>Greek</hi> cities; and when the number of the citizens is assign'd, we must always understand it of the inhabitants of the neighbouring country, as well as of the city. Yet even with this allow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance, it must be confest, that <hi>Greece</hi> was a popu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lous country, and much exceeded what we cou'd imagine of so narrow a territory, naturally not very fertile, and which drew no supplies of corn from other places. For excepting <hi>Athens,</hi> which trad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed to <hi>Pontus</hi> for that commodity, the other cities seem to have subsisted chiefly from their neighbour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing territory.<note place="bottom" n="‡">
                  <hi>Demost. contra Lept.</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> brought yearly from <hi>Pontus</hi> 400,000 medimni or bushels of corn, as appear'd from the custom-house books. And at that time they imported little corn from any other place. This by the bye is a strong proof, that there is some great mistake in the foregoing passage of <hi>Athenaeus.</hi> For <hi>Attica</hi> itself was so barren in corn, that it produc'd not enough even to maintain the peasants. <hi>Tit. Livii</hi> lib. 43. cap. 6. <hi>Lucian,</hi> in his <hi>navigium sive vota,</hi> says, that a ship, which, by the dimen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions he gives, seems to have been about the size of our third rates, carry'd as much corn as wou'd maintain all <hi>Attica</hi> for a twelve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>month.

                  <p>ALL the best manuscripts of <hi>Pliny</hi> read the passage as here cit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed, and fix the compass of the walls of <hi>Rome</hi> to be 13 miles. The only question is, what <hi>Pliny</hi> means by 30775 paces, and how that number was form'd. The manner, in which I conceive it, is this. <hi>Rome</hi> was a semicircular area of 13 miles circumference. The <hi>Forum</hi> and consequently the <hi>Milliarium,</hi> we know, was situated on the Banks of the <hi>Tyber,</hi> and near the center of the circle or upon the diameter of the semicircular area. Tho' there were 37 gates to <hi>Rome,</hi> yet only twelve of them had streight streets, leading from them to the <hi>Milliarium. Pliny,</hi> therefore, having assign'd the cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumference of <hi>Rome,</hi> and knowing that that alone was not suf<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ficient to give in a just notion of its surface, uses this farther me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thod. He supposes all the streets, leading from the <hi>Milliarium</hi> to the 12 gates, to be laid together into one streight line, and sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poses we run along that line, so as to count each gate once: In which case, he says, that the whole line is 30775 paces: Or in other words, that each street or radius of the semicircular area is upon an average two miles and a half; and the whole length of <hi>Rome</hi> is 5 miles, and its breadth about half as much, beside the scatter'd suburbs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pere Hardouin</hi> understands this passage in the same manner; with regard to the laying together the several streets of <hi>Rome</hi> into one line, in order to compose 30775 paces: But then he sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poses that streets led from the <hi>Milliarium</hi> to every gate, and that no street exceeded 800 paces in length. But (1) a semicir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cular area, whose radius was only 800 paces, cou'd never have a circumference near 13 miles, the compass of <hi>Rome</hi> as assign'd by <hi>Pliny.</hi> A radius of two miles and a half forms very nearly that circumference. (2) There is an absurdity in supposing a city so built as to have streets running to its center from every gate in its circumference. These streets must interfere as they approach. (3) This diminishes too much from the greatness of antient <hi>Rome,</hi> and reduces that city below even <hi>Bristol</hi> or <hi>Rotterdam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sense which <hi>Vossius</hi> in his <hi>observationes variae</hi> puts on this passage of <hi>Pliny,</hi> errs widely in the other extreme. One manu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>script, of no authority, instead of 13 miles, has assign'd 30 miles for the compass of the walls of <hi>Rome.</hi> And <hi>Vossius</hi> understands this only of the curvilinear part of the circumference; supposing, that, as the <hi>Tyber</hi> form'd the diameter, there were no walls built on that side. But (1) this reading is allow'd contrary to almost all the manuscripts. (2) Why shou'd <hi>Pliny,</hi> a concise writer, re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>peat the compass of the walls of <hi>Rome</hi> in two successive senten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces? (3) Why repeat it with so sensible a variation? (4) What is the meaning of <hi>Pliny</hi>'s mentioning twice the <hi>Milliarium,</hi> if a line was measur'd, that had no dependence on the <hi>Milliarium?</hi> (5) <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s wall is said by <hi>Vopiscus</hi> to have been drawn <hi>laxiore ambitu,</hi> and to have comprehended all the buildings and suburbs on the north-side of the <hi>Tyber;</hi> yet its compass was only 50 miles, and even here critics suspect some mistake or corruption in the text. It is not probable that <hi>Rome</hi> wou'd diminish from <hi>Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gustus</hi> to <hi>Aurelian.</hi> It remain'd still the capital of the same em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pire; and none of the civil wars, in that long period, except the tumults on the death of <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Balbinus,</hi> ever affected the city. <hi>Caracalla</hi> is said by <hi>Aurelius Victor</hi> to have encreas'd <hi>Rome.</hi> (6) There are no remains of antient buildings, which mark any such greatness of <hi>Rome. Vossius</hi>'s reply to this objection seems absurd, that the rubbish wou'd sink 60 or 70 foot below ground. It appears from <hi>Spartian (in vita Severi)</hi> that the five mile stone <hi>in via Lavicana</hi> was out of the city. (7) <hi>Olympiodorus</hi> and <hi>Pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lius Victor</hi> fix the number of houses in <hi>Rome</hi> to be betwixt forty and fifty thousand. (8) The very extravagance of the consequences, drawn by this critic, as well as <hi>Lipsius,</hi> if they be necessary, de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stroys the foundation on which they are grounded: That <hi>Rome</hi> contain'd 14 millions of inhabitants; while the whole kingdom of <hi>France</hi> contains only five, according to his computation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE only objection to the sense, which we have affix'd above to the passage of <hi>Pliny,</hi> seems to lye in this, that <hi>Pliny,</hi> after mentioning the 37 gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> assigns only a reason for suppress<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the seven old ones, and says nothing of the 18 gates, the streets leading from which, terminated, according to my opinion, before they reach'd the Forum. But as <hi>Pliny</hi> was writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who perfectly knew the disposition of the streets, it is not strange he shou'd take a circumstance for granted, which was so familiar to every body. Perhaps too, many of these gates led to wharfs upon the river.</p>

            <p>THE number of citizens, who receiv'd corn by the public distribution in <hi>Augustus</hi>'s time,<note place="bottom" n="*">Ex monument. Ancyr.</note> were 200,000. This one wou'd esteem a pretty certain ground of calculation: Yet is it attended with such circumstances as throw us back into doubt and un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>certainty.</p>
            <p>Did the poorer citizens only receive the distri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bution? It was calculated, to be sure, chiefly for their benefit. But it appears from a passage of <hi>Cicero,</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="†">
                  <hi>Tusc. quaest.</hi> lib. 3. cap. 48.</note> that the rich might also take their porti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on, and that it was esteem'd no reproach in them to apply for it.</p>
            <p>TO whom was the corn given; whether only to heads of families, or to every man, woman and child? The portion every month was five <hi>mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dii</hi> to each <note place="bottom" n="‡">
                  <hi>Licinius apud Sallust. hist. frag.</hi> lib. 3.</note> (about ⅚ of a bushel.) This was too little for a family, and too much for an individual.
<pb n="235" facs="238"/>
A very accurate antiquarian,<note place="bottom" n="†">Nicolaus Hortensius de re frumentaria Roman.</note> therefore, infers, that it was given to every man of full years: But he allows the matter to be uncertain.</p>
            <p>WAS it strictly enquir'd, whether the claimant liv'd within the precincts of <hi>Rome,</hi> or was it suffi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cient, that he presented himself at the monthly dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tribution? This last seems more probable.<note place="bottom" n="‡">Not to take the people too much from their business, <hi>Augustus</hi> ordain'd the distribution of corn to be made only thrice a year: But the people finding the monthly distributions more convenient (as preserving, I suppose, a more regular oeconomy in their fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mily) desir'd to have them restor'd. <hi>Sucton.

            <p>BUT lastly, what proportion of slaves must we assign to these citizens? This is the most material question; and the most uncertain. 'Tis very doubt<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful, whether <hi>Athens</hi> can be establish'd as a rule for <hi>Rome.</hi> Perhaps the <hi>Athenians</hi> had more slaves, because they employ'd them in manufactures, for which a capital city, like <hi>Rome,</hi> seems not so proper. Perhaps, on the other hand, the <hi>Romans</hi> had more slaves, on account of their superior lux<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ury and riches.</p>
            <p>THERE were exact bills of mortality kept in <hi>Rome;</hi> but no antient author has given us the

               <note place="bottom" n="*">In vita Neronis.</note> who tells us, that in one season, there were 30,000 names car<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry'd to the temple of <hi>Libitina:</hi> But this was dur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing a plague; which can afford no certain founda<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion for any inference.</p>

               <note place="bottom" n="†">

            </p>
            <p>IT appears from the same historian,<note place="bottom" n="†">LIB. 2. cap. 15.</note> that there was, then, much land uncultivated, and put to no
<pb n="239" facs="242"/>
manner of use; and he ascribes it as a great praise to <hi>Pertinax,</hi> that he allow'd every one to take such land, either in <hi>Italy</hi> or elsewhere, and cultivate it as he pleas'd, without paying any taxes. <hi>Lands uncul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tivated and put to no manner of use!</hi> This is not heard of in any part of Christendom; except per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps, in some remote parts of <hi>Hungary,</hi> as I have been inform'd. And it surely corresponds very ill with that idea of the extreme populousness of an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tiquity, so much insisted on.</p>
            <p>We learn from <hi>Vopiscus,</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <hi>In Aurelian.</hi> cap. 48.</note> that there was in <hi>E<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>truria</hi> much fertile land uncultivated; which the emperor, <hi>Aurelian,</hi> intended to convert into vine<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>yards, in order to furnish the <hi>Roman</hi> people with a gratuitous distribution of wine: A very proper ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pedient to dispeople still farther that capital and all the neighbouring territories.</p>
            <p>IT may not be amiss to take notice of the ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count, which <hi>Polybius</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="†">LIB. 12. cap. 2.</note> gives of the great herds of swine to be met with in <hi>Tuscany</hi> and <hi>Lombardy,</hi> as well as in <hi>Greece,</hi> and of the method of feeding them which was then practis'd. <q>There are great herds of swine, (says he) throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> particularly, in former times, thro' <hi>Etru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ria</hi> and <hi>Cisalpine Gaul.</hi> And a herd frequently contains a thousand or more swine. When one of
<pb n="240" facs="243"/>
these herds in feeding meets with another, they mix together; and the swine-herds have no o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther expedients to separate them than to go to different quarters, where they sound their horn; and these animals, being accustom'd to that sig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nal, run immediately each to the horn of his own keeper. Whereas in <hi>Greece,</hi> if the herds of swine happen to mix in the forests, he, who has the greatest flock, takes cunningly the op<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>portunity of driving all away. And thieves are very apt to purloin the straggling hogs, which have wander'd to a great distance from their keeper, in search of food.</q>
            </p>
            <p>MAY we not infer from this account, that the North of <hi>Italy</hi> was then much less peopled, and worse cultivated than at present? How cou'd these vast herds be fed in a country, so thick of enclo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sures, so improv'd by agriculture, so divided by farms, so planted with vines and corn intermingled together? I must confess, that <hi>Polybius</hi>'s relation has more the air of that oeconomy, which is to be met with in our <hi>American</hi> colonies, than the management of an <hi>European</hi> country.</p>

<pb n="241" facs="244"/>
our present reasoning may be thought really to prove nothing. That philosopher, treating of friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship, and observing, that that relation ought nei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther to be contracted to a very few, nor extended over a great multitude, illustrates his opinion by the following argument. <q>In like manner, (says he,) as a city cannot subsist, if it either have so few inhabitants as ten, or so many as a hundred thousand; so is there a mediocrity requir'd in the number of friends; and you destroy the es<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sence of friendship by running into either ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>treme.</q> What! Impossible, that a city can contain a hundred thousand inhabitants! Had <hi>A<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ristotle</hi> never seen, nor heard of a city that was near so populous? This, I must own, passes my comprehension.</p>

               <hi>Pliny</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">LIE. 6. cap. 28.</note> tells us, that <hi>Seleucia,</hi> the seat of the <hi>Greek</hi> empire in the East, was reported to contain 600,000 people. <hi>Carthage</hi> is said by <hi>Strabo</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="†">LIE. 17.</note> to have contain'd 700,000. The inhabitants of <hi>Pe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kin</hi> are not much more numerous. <hi>London, Pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ris,</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> may admit of nearly the same computation; at least, the two latter cities do not exceed it. <hi>Rome, Alexandria, Antioch</hi> we have already spoke of. From the experience of past and present ages, one might conjecture, that there is a kind of impossibility in the nature of
<pb n="242" facs="245"/>
things, that any city cou'd ever rise much beyond this proportion. Whether the grandeur of a city be founded on commerce or on empire, there seem to be invincible obstacles, which prevent its farther progress. The seats of vast monarchies, by intro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ducing extravagant luxury, irregular expence, idle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness, dependence, and false ideas of rank and superiority, are improper for commerce. Exten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sive commerce checks itself, by raising the price of all labour and commodities. When a great court engages the attendance of a numerous nobility, possest of over-grown fortunes, the middling gen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try remain in their provincial towns, where they can make a figure on a moderate income. And if the dominions of a state arrive at an enormous size, there necessarily arise many capitals, in the remot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>er provinces; whither all the inhabitants, except a few courtiers, repair, for education, fortune, and amusement.<note place="bottom" n="*">Such were <hi>Alexandria, Anticob, Carthage, Ephesus, Lyons,</hi> &amp;c. in the <hi>Roman</hi> empire.

            <p>'TIS an observation of <hi>L'Abbe du Bos,</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="†">VOL. 2. sect. 16.</note> that <hi>I<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>taly</hi> is warmer at present than it was in antient times. <q>The annals of <hi>Rome</hi> tell us, (says he) that in the year 480. <hi>ab U.

                  <note place="bottom" n="*">SAT. 6.</note> describes a superstitious woman, he represents her as breaking the ice of the <hi>Tyber,</hi> that she may per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>form her ablutions.</q>

               <q>He speaks of that river's freezing as a common event. Many passages of <hi>Horace</hi> suppose the streets of <hi>Rome</hi> full of snow and ice. We shou'd have more certainty with regard to this point, had the antients known the use of thermome<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters: But their writers, without intending it,
<pb n="244" facs="247"/>
give us information, sufficient to convince us, that the winters are now much more temperate at <hi>Rome</hi> than formerly. At present, the <hi>Tyber</hi> no more freezes at <hi>Rome</hi> than the <hi>Nile</hi> at <hi>Cairo.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> esteem the winter very rigorous, if the snow lyes two days, and if one sees for eight and forty hours a few small icicles hang from a fountain that has a North exposition.</q>

            <p>THE observation of this ingenious critic may be extended to other <hi>European</hi> climates. Who cou'd discover the mild climate of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi>'s <note place="bottom" n="*">LIB. 4.</note> description of <hi>Gaul?</hi> 
               <q>As it is a Nort<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hern climate, (says he) it is infested with cold to an extreme degree. In cloudy weather, in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stead of rain, there fall great snows; and in clear weather it there freezes so excessive hard, that the rivers acquire bridges of their own sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stance, over which, not only single travellers may pass, but large armies, accompany'd with all their baggage and loaded waggons. And there being many rivers in <hi>Gaul,</hi> the <hi>Rhone,</hi> the <hi>Rhine, &amp;c.</hi> almost all of them are froze over; and 'tis usual, in order to prevent falling, to cover the ice with chaff and straw, at the places where the road passes.</q>

               <hi>Ovid</hi> positively maintains, with all the serious affirmation of prose, that the <hi>Euxine</hi> sea froze every winter in his time; and he appeals to <hi>Roman</hi> go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernors, whom he names, for the truth of his as<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sertion.<note place="bottom" n="‡">

ALLOWING, therefore, this remark to be just, that <hi>Europe</hi> is become warmer than formerly; how can we account for it? Plainly, by no other me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thod, but by supposing, that the land is at present much better cultivated, and that the woods are clear'd, which formerly threw a shade upon the earth, and kept the rays of the sun from penetrat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to it. Our Northern colonies in <hi>America</hi> be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>come more temperate, in proportion as the woods are fell'd;<note place="bottom" n="*">THE warm Southern also become more healthful: And 'tis remarkable, that in the <hi>Spanish</hi> histories of the first discovery and conquest of these countries they appear to have been very healthful; being then well peopled and cultivated.

            <p>LET us now cast our eye over all the countries, that were the scene of antient and modern history, and compare their past and present situation. We shall not, perhaps, find such foundation for the complaint of the present emptiness and desolation of the world. <hi>Aegypt</hi> is represented by <hi>Maillet,</hi> to whom we owe the best account of it, as extreme<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly populous; tho' he esteems the number of its in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>habitants to be diminish'd. <hi>Syria</hi> and the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> as well as the coast of <hi>Barbary,</hi> I can readi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly own, to be very desart in comparison of their antient condition. The depopulation of <hi>Greece</hi> is also very obvious; but whether the country now call'd <hi>Turky</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> may not, in gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral, contain as many inhabitants as during the flou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rishing period of <hi>Greece</hi> may be a little doubtful. The <hi>Thracians</hi> seem, then, to have liv'd like the <hi>Tar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tars</hi> at present, by pasturage and plunder:<note place="bottom" n="*">

            <p>
               <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Muscovy</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> are not very po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pulous; but are certainly much more so than the antient <hi>Sarmatia</hi> and <hi>Scythia;</hi> where no husban<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dry or agriculture was ever heard of, and pasturage was the sole art, by which the people were main<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain'd. The like observation may be extended to <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden.</hi> No one ought to esteem the immense swarms of people, that formerly came from the North, and over-ran all <hi>Europe,</hi> to be a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny objection to this opinion. Where a whole na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, or even half of it, remove their seat; 'tis ea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sy to imagine what a prodigious multitude they must form; with what desperate courage they must make their attacks; and how the terror they strike into the invaded nations, will make these magnify, in their imagination, both the courage and multi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tude of the invaders. <hi>Scotland</hi> is neither extensive nor populous; but were the half of its inhabitants to seek a new habitation, they wou'd form a co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lony as large as the <hi>Teutons</hi> and <hi>Cimbri,</hi> and wou'd shake all <hi>Europe;</hi> supposing it in no better a con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dition for defence than formerly.</p>

                  <p>IT appears from <hi>Caesar</hi>'s account, that the <hi>Gauls</hi> had no do<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mestic slaves.

                  <p>We may remark, that the numbers in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s commentaries can be more depended on than those of any other antient author; because of the <hi>Greek</hi> translation, which still remains, and which checks the original.</p>

                  <p>Tis remarkable, that tho' <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> makes the whole in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>habitants of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when conquer'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> amount on<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly to three millions; yet <hi>Josephus, de bello Jud.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 16. says, that its inhabitants, excluding those of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> were se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven millions and a half, in the reign of <hi>Nero:</hi> And he express<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly says, that he drew this account from the books of the <hi>Roman</hi> publicans, who levy'd the poll tax. <hi>Strabo,</hi> lib. 17. praises the superior police of the <hi>Romans</hi> with regard to the finances of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> above that of its former monarchs: And no part of admini<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stration is more essential to the happiness of a people.

            <p>THAT author, endeavouring to account for the silence of many of the oracles, says, that it may be ascribed to the present desolation of the world, proceeding from former wars and factions; which common calamity, he adds, has fallen heavier upon <hi>Greece</hi> than on any other country; insomuch, that the whole cou'd scarce at present furnish out three thousand warriors, which, in the time of the <hi>Me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dian</hi> war, were supply'd by the single city of <hi>Me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gara.</hi> The gods, therefore, who affect works of dignity and importance, have supprest many of their oracles, and deign not to use so many inter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>preters of their will to so diminutive a people.</p>
            <p>I MUST confess, that this passage contains so ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny difficulties, that I know not what to make of it. You may observe, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> assigns for a cause
<pb n="257" facs="260"/>
of the decay of mankind, not the extensive domi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but the former wars and fac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions of the several nations; all which were quiet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed by the <hi>Roman</hi> arms. <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s reasoning, therefore, is directly contrary to the inference, which is drawn from the fact he advances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polybius</hi> supposes, that <hi>Greece</hi> had become more prosperous and flourishing after the establishment of the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke;<note place="bottom" n="*">LIB. 2. cap. 62. It may perhaps be imagin'd, that <hi>Poly<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bius,</hi> being dependent on <hi>Rome,</hi> wou'd naturally extol the <hi>Roman</hi> dominion. But in the <hi>first</hi> place, <hi>Polybius,</hi> tho' one sees some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>times instances of his caution, discovers no symptoms of flattery. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This opinion is only deliver'd in a single stroke, by the bye, while he is intent upon another subject; and 'tis allow'd, if there be any suspicion of an author's insincerity, that these o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blique propositions discover his real opinion better than his more formal and direct assertions.</note> and tho' that historian wrote before these conquerors had degenerated, from be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the patrons, to be the plunderers of mankind; yet as we find from <hi>Tacitus</hi>

                  <hi>Annal.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 2.</note> that the severity of the emperors afterwards corrected the licence of the governors, we have no reason to think that exten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sive monarchy so destructive, as it is often repre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sented.</p>
            <p>WE learn from <hi>Strabo,</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="‡">LIB. 8, &amp; 9.</note> that the <hi>Romans,</hi> from their regard to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> maintain'd, to his time, most of the privileges and liberties of that celebrat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed
<pb n="258" facs="261"/>
nation; and <hi>Nero</hi> afterwards rather encreas'd them.<note place="bottom" n="*">Plutarch. De his qui sero a Numine puniuntur.</note> How therefore can we imagine, that the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke was so burthensome over that part of the world? The oppression of the proconsuls was check'd; and the magistracies in <hi>Greece</hi> being all be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stow'd in the several cities, by the free votes of the people, there was no great necessity for the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>petitors to attend the emperor's court. If great numbers went to seek their fortunes in <hi>Rome,</hi> and advance themselves by learning or eloquence, the commodities of their native country, many of them wou'd return with the fortunes they had made, and thereby enrich the <hi>Grecian</hi> commonwealths.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>Plutarch</hi> says, that the general depopula<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion had been more sensibly felt in <hi>Greece</hi> than in any other country. How is this reconcileable to its superior privileges and advantages?</p>
            <p>BESIDES, this passage, by proving too much, really proves nothing. <hi>Only three thousand men able to bear arms in all Greece!</hi> Who can admit so strange a proposition; especially, if we consider the great numbers of <hi>Greek</hi> cities, whose names still remain in history, and which are mention'd by writers long after the age of <hi>Plutarch?</hi> There are there surely ten times more people at present, when there scarce remains a city in all the bounds
<pb n="259" facs="262"/>
of antient <hi>Greece.</hi> That country is still tolerably cultivated, and furnishes a sure supply of corn, in case of any scarcity in <hi>Spain, Italy</hi> or the South of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE must observe, that the antient frugality of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and their equality of property, still sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sisted during the age of <hi>Plutarch;</hi> as appears from <hi>Lucian.</hi>
               <note place="bottom" n="*">De mercede conductis.</note> Nor is there any ground to imagine, that that country was possest by a few masters, and a great number of slaves.</p>
            <p>'TIS probable, indeed, that military discipline, being entirely useless, was extremely neglected in <hi>Greece</hi> after the establishment of the <hi>Roman</hi> empire; and if these commonwealths, formerly so warlike and ambitious, maintain'd each of them a small city guard, to prevent mobbish disorders, 'tis all they had occasion for: And these, perhaps, did not amount to three thousand men, throughout all <hi>Greece.</hi> I own, that if <hi>Plutarch</hi> had this fact in his eye, he is here guilty of a very gross paralo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gism, and assigns causes no way proportion'd to the effects. But is it so great a prodigy, that an au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thor shou'd fall into a mistake of this nature?<note place="bottom" n="†">
                  <p>I must confess, that that discourse of <hi>Plutarch</hi> concerning the silence of the oracles is in general of so odd a texture, and so unlike his other productions, that one is at a loss what judgment to form of it. 'Tis wrote in dialogue, which is a method of composition, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> commonly little affects. The person<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ages he introduces advance very wild, absurd, and contradictory opinions, more like the visionary systems of <hi>Plato</hi> than the solid sense of <hi>Plutarch.</hi> There runs also thro' the whole an air of su<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perstition and credulity, which resembles very little the spirit, that appears in the other philosophical compositions of that au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thor. For 'tis remarkable, that tho' <hi>Plutarch</hi> be an historian as superstitious as <hi>Herodotus</hi> or <hi>Livy,</hi> yet there is scarcely, in all an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tiquity, a philosopher less superstitious, excepting <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Lu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cian.</hi> I must, therefore, confess, that a passage of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> cit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed from this discourse, has much less authority with me, than if it had been found in most of his other compositions.</p>
                  <p>THERE is only one other discourse of <hi>Plutarch</hi> liable to like objections, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>concerning those whose punishment is delay'd by the Deity.</hi> It is also wrote in dialogue, contains like superstitious, wild visions, and seems to have been chiefly compos'd in rivalship to <hi>Plato,</hi> particularly his last book, <hi>de republica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND here I cannot but observe, that Mons. <hi>Fontenelle,</hi> a writ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>er eminent for candour, seems to have departed a little from his usual character, when he endeavours to throw a ridicule upon <hi>Plutarch</hi> on account of passages to be met with in this dialogue concerning oracles. The absurdities here put into the mouths of the several personages are not to be ascrib'd to <hi>Plutarch.</hi> He makes them resute each other; and in general, he seems to intend the ridiculing of those very opinions, which <hi>Fontenelle</hi> wou'd ri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dicule him for maintaining. See <hi>Histoire des Oracles.</hi>

BUT whatever force may remain in this passage of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> we shall endeavour to counter-ba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lance it by as remarkable a passage in <hi>Diodorus Si<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culus,</hi> where the historian, after mentioning <hi>Ni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nus</hi>'s army of 1,700,000 foot and 200,000 horse, endeavours to support the credibility of this ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count, by some posterior facts; and adds, that we must not form a notion of the antient populousness

            </head>
            <p>I SUPPOSE, that a member of parliament, in the reign of king <hi>William</hi> or queen <hi>Anne,</hi> while the establishment of the <hi>protestant succession</hi> was yet uncertain, were deliberating concerning the party he wou'd chuse in that important question, and weighing, with impartiality, the advantages and disadvantages on each side. I believe the follow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing particulars wou'd have enter'd into his conside<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ration.</p>
            <p>HE wou'd easily perceive the great advantages, resulting from the restoration of the <hi>Stuart</hi> family; by which we shou'd preserve the succession clear and undisputed, free from a pretender, with such a specious title as that of blood, which, with the multitude, is always the claim, the strongest, and most easily comprehended. 'Tis in vain to say, as many have done, that the question with regard to <hi>governors,</hi> independent of <hi>government,</hi> is frivolous, and little worth disputing, much less fighting about. The generality of mankind never will enter into these sentiments; and 'tis much happier, I believe, for society, that they do not, but continue in their natural prejudices and prepossessions. How cou'd
<pb n="264" facs="266"/>
stability be preserv'd in any monarchical govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment (which, tho', perhaps, not the best, is, and always has been the most common of any) unless men had so passionate a regard for the true heir of their royal family; and even tho' weak in under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>standing, or infirm in years, gave him so great a preference above persons, the most accomplish'd in shining talents, or celebrated for great atchieve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments? Wou'd not every popular leader put in his claim at every vacancy, or even without any va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cancy; and the kingdom become the theatre of perpetual wars and convulsions? The condition of the <hi>Roman</hi> empire, surely, was not, in this re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spect, much to be envy'd; nor is that of the <hi>Eastern</hi> nations, who pay little regard to the title of their sovereigns, but sacrifice them, every day, to the caprice or momentary humour of the populace or soldiery. 'Tis but a foolish wisdom, which is so carefully display'd, in undervaluing princes, and placing them on a level with the meanest of man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kind. To be sure, an anatomist finds no more in the greatest monarch than in the lowest peasant or day-labourer; and a moralist may, perhaps, fre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently find less. But what do all these reflections tend to? We, all of us, still retain these prejudi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces in favour of birth and family; and neither in our serious occupations, nor most careless amuse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments, can we ever get entirely rid of them. A tragedy, that wou'd represent the adventures of common sailors, or porters, or even of private
<pb n="265" facs="267"/>
gentlemen, wou'd presently disgust us; but one, that introduces kings and princes, acquires in our eyes an air of importance and dignity. Or shou'd a man be able, by his superior wisdom, to get en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tirely above such prepossessions, he wou'd soon, by means of the same wisdom, again bring himself down to them; for the sake of society, whose wel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fare he wou'd perceive to be intimately connected with them. Far from endeavouring to undeceive the people in this particular, he wou'd cherish and foster such sentiments of reverence to their prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces; as requisite to preserve a due subordination in society. And tho' the lives of twenty thousand men be often sacrific'd to maintain a king in possessi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on of his throne, or preserve the right of succes<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion undisturbed, he entertains no indignation at the loss; on pretence that every individual of these was, perhaps, in himself, as valuable as the prince he serv'd. He considers the consequences of vio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lating the hereditary right of kings: Consequen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces, which may be felt for many centuries; while the loss of several thousand men brings so little pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>judice to a large kingdom, that it may not be per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceiv'd a few years afterwards.</p>
            <p>THE advantages of the <hi>Hanover</hi> succession are of an opposite nature, and arise from this very cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstance, that it violates hereditary right, and places on the throne a prince, to whom birth gave no title to that dignity. 'Tis evident to any one,
<pb n="266" facs="268"/>
who considers the history of this island, that the privileges of the people have, during the two last centuries, been continually upon the encrease, by the division of the church lands, by the alienations of the barons estates, by the progress of trade, and above all, by the happiness of our situation, which, for a long time, gave us sufficient security, with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out any standing army or military establishment. On the contrary, public liberty has, almost in e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very other nation of <hi>Europe,</hi> been, during the same period, extremely upon the decline; while the people were disgusted at the hardships of the old <hi>Go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thic</hi> militia, and chose rather to entrust their prince with mercenary armies, which he easily turn'd a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gainst themselves. 'Twas nothing extraordinary, therefore, that some of our <hi>British</hi> sovereigns mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>took the nature of the constitution, and genius of the people; and as they embrac'd all the favour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able precedents left them by their ancestors, they over-look'd all those, which were contrary, and which suppos'd a limitation in our government. They were encourag'd in this mistake, by the ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ample of all the neighbouring princes, who, bear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the same title or appellation, and being adorn'd with the same ensigns of authority, naturally led them to claim the same powers and prerogatives.<note place="bottom" n="*">
                  <p>IT appears from the speeches, and proclamations, and whole train of king <hi>James</hi> the I. 's actions, as well as his son's, that they consider'd the <hi>English</hi> government as a simple monarchy, and ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver imagin'd that any considerable part of their subjects enter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain'd a contrary idea. This made them discover their pretensi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons, without preparing any force to support them; and even with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out reserve or disguise, which are always employ'd by those, who enter upon any new project, or endeavour to innovate in any go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernment. King <hi>James</hi> told his parliament plainly, when they meddled in state affairs, <hi>Ne sutor ultra crepidam.</hi> He us'd also, at his table, in promiscuous companies, to advance his notions, in a manner still more undisguis'd: As we may learn from a story told in the life of Mr. <hi>Waller,</hi> and which that poet us'd frequently to repeat. When Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> was young, he had the curiosity to go to court; and he stood in the circle, and saw king <hi>James</hi> dine, where, amongst other company, there sat at table two bi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shops. The king, openly and aloud, propos'd this question, <hi>Whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther he might not take his subjects money, when he had occasion for it, without all this formality of parliament.</hi> The one bishop readily replied, <hi>God forbid you shou'd not: For you are the breath of our no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>strils.</hi> The other bishop declin'd answering, and said he was not skill'd in parliamentary cases: But upon the king's urging him, and saying he wou'd admit of no evasion, his lordship replied ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry pleasantly, <hi>Why then, I think your majesty may lawfully take my brother's money: For he offers it.</hi> In Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>'s pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>face to the history of the world, there is this remarkable passage. Philip <hi>the II. by strong hand and main force, attempted to make him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self, not only an</hi> absolute monarch <hi>over the</hi> Netherlands, <hi>like unto the kings and sovereigns of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> France; <hi>but</hi> Turk-like <hi>to tread under his feet all their natural and fundamental laws, privi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>leges and antient rights. Spenser,</hi> speaking of some grants of the <hi>English</hi> kings to the <hi>Irish</hi> corporations, says, <q>All which, tho', at the time of their first grant, they were tolerable, and per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps reasonable, yet now are most unreasonable and inconve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nient. But all these will easily be cut off with the superior power of her majesty's prerogative, against which her own grants are not to be pleaded or enforc'd.</q>

                  <p>As these were very common, tho' not, perhaps, the universal notions of the times, the two first princes of the house of <hi>Stuart</hi> were the more excusable for their mistake. And <hi>Rapin,</hi> the most judicious of historians, seems sometimes to treat them with too much severity upon account of it.</p>

The flattery of courtiers farther blinded them; and above all, that of the clergy, who from seve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral passages of their <hi>scripture,</hi> and these wrested too, had erected a regular and avow'd system of
<pb n="268" facs="270"/>
tyranny and despotic power. The only method of destroying, at once, all these exorbitant claims and pretensions was to depart from the true here<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ditary line, and chuse a prince, who, being plain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly a creature of the public, and receiving the crown on conditions, exprest and avow'd, found his au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thority establish'd on the same bottom with the privileges of the people. By electing him in the royal line, we cut off all hopes of ambitious subjects, who might, in future emergencies, disturb the go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernment by their cabals and pretensions: By ren<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dering the crown hereditary in his family, we a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>voided all the inconveniencies of elective monar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chy: And by excluding the lineal heir, we secur'd all our constitutional limitations, and render'd our government uniform and of a piece. The people cherish monarchy, because protected by it: The monarch favours liberty, because created by it. And thus every advantage is obtain'd by the new establishment, as far as human skill and wisdom can extend itself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="269" facs="271"/>
THESE are the separate advantages of fixing the succession, either in the house of <hi>Stuart,</hi> or in that of <hi>Hanover.</hi> There are also disadvantages in each establishment, which an impartial patriot wou'd ponder and examine, in order to form a just judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment upon the whole.</p>
            <p>THE disadvantages of the protestant succession consist in the foreign dominions, which are possest by the princes of the <hi>Hanover</hi> line, and which, it might be suppos'd, wou'd engage us in the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trigues and wars of the continent, and lose us, in some measure, the inestimable advantage we pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sess, of being surrounded and guarded by the sea, which we command. The disadvantages of re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>calling the abdicated family consist chiefly in their religion, which is more prejudicial to society than that establish'd amongst us, is contrary to it, and affords no toleration or peace or security to any o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther religion.</p>
            <p>IT appears to me, that all these advantages and disadvantages are allow'd on both sides; at least, by every one, who is at all susceptible of argument or reasoning. No subject, however loyal, pretends to deny, that the disputed title and foreign domi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nions of the present royal family are a loss; nor is there any partizan of the <hi>Stuart</hi> family, but will confess, that the claim of hereditary, indefeasible right, and the <hi>Roman</hi> catholick religion are also dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>advantages
<pb n="270" facs="272"/>
in that family. It belongs, therefore, to a philosopher alone, who is of neither party, to put all these circumstances in the scale, and assign to each of them its proper poize and influence. Such an one will readily, at first, acknowledge, that all political questions are infinitely complicat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed; and that there scarce ever occurs, in any de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liberation, a choice, which is either purely good, or purely ill. Consequences, mix'd and vary'd, may be foreseen to flow from every measure: And many consequences, unforeseen, do always, in fact, result from it. Hesitation, and reserve, and sus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pence are, therefore, the only sentiments he brings to this essay or trial. Or if he indulges any passi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on, 'tis that of derision and ridicule against the ig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>norant multitude, who are always clamorous and dogmatical, even in the nicest questions, of which, from want of temper, perhaps still more than of understanding, they are altogether unfit judges.</p>
            <p>BUT to say something more determinate on this head; the following reflections will, I hope, show the temper, if not the understanding of a philoso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pher.</p>
            <p>WERE we to judge merely by first appearance, and by past experience, we must allow, that the advantages of a parliamentary title in the house of <hi>Hanover</hi> are much greater than those of an undis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>puted hereditary title in the house of <hi>Stuart;</hi> and
<pb n="271" facs="273"/>
that our fathers acted wisely in preferring the for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mer to the latter. So long as the house of <hi>Stuart</hi> reign'd in <hi>Britain,</hi> which, with some interrupti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons, was above 80 years, the government was kept in a continual fever, by the contentions betwixt the privileges of the people and the prerogatives of the crown. If arms were dropt, the noise of dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>putes continu'd: Or if these were silenc'd, jea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lousy still corroded the heart, and threw the nati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on into an unnatural ferment and disorder. And while we were thus occupy'd in domestic conten<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions, a foreign power, dangerous, if not fatal, to public liberty, erected itself in <hi>Europe,</hi> without a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny opposition from us, and even sometimes with our assistance.</p>
            <p>BUT within these last sixty years, when a par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liamentary establishment has taken place; whate<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver factions may have prevail'd either amongst the people or in public assemblies; the whole force of our constitution has always fallen to one side, and an uninterrupted harmony has been preserv'd be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>twixt our princes and our parliaments. Public li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berty, with internal peace and order, has flourish'd, almost without interruption: Trade and manufac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tures and agriculture have encreas'd: The arts and sciences and philosophy have been cultivated: E<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven religious parties have been necessitated to lay aside their mutual rancour: And the glory of the nation has spread itself all over <hi>Europe;</hi> while we
<pb n="272" facs="274"/>
stand the bulwark against oppression, and the great antagonist of that power, which threatens every people with conquest and subjection. So long and so glorious a period no nation almost can boast of; nor is there another instance, in the whole history of mankind, that so many millions of people have, during such a space of time, been held together, in a manner so free, so rational, and so suitable to the dignity of human nature.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' this recent instance seems clearly to decide in favour of the present establishment, there are some circumstances to be thrown into the o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther scale; and 'tis dangerous to regulate our judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment by one event or example.</p>
            <p>WE have had two rebellions during the flourish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing period above mention'd; besides plots and con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spiracies without number. And if none of these have produc'd any very fatal event, we may ascribe our escape chiefly to the narrow genius of those princes, who disputed our establishment; and may esteem ourselves so far fortunate. But the claims of the banish'd family, I fear, are not yet antiquat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed; and who can foretel, that their future attempts will produce no greater disorder?</p>
            <p>THE disputes betwixt privilege and prerogative may easily be compos'd by laws, and votes, and conferences, and concessions; where there is toler<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able
<pb n="273" facs="275"/>
temper or prudence on both sides, or on ei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther side. Amongst contending titles, the questi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on can only be determin'd by the sword, and by devastation, and by civil war.</p>
            <p>A PRINCE, who fills the throne with a disputed title dares not arm his subjects; the only method of securing a people fully, both against domestic oppression and foreign conquest.</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all our riches and re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nown, what a critical escape did we lately make, from dangers, which were owing not so much to bad conduct and ill success in war, as to the pernicious practice of mortgaging our finances, and the still more pernicious maxim of never paying off our in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumbrances. Such fatal measures cou'd never have been embrac'd, had it not been to secure a preca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rious establishment.<note place="bottom" n="*">THOSE who consider how universal this pernicious practice of funding has become all over <hi>Europe</hi> may perhaps dispute this last opinion. But we lay under less necessity than other states.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to convince us, that an hereditary title is to be embrac'd rather than a parliamentary one, which is not supported by any other views or mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tives; a man needs only transport himself back to the aera of the restoration, and suppose, that he had had a seat in that parliament, which recall'd the royal family, and put a period to the greatest dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>orders
<pb n="274" facs="276"/>
that ever arose from the opposite pretensi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons of prince and people. What wou'd have been thought of one, that had propos'd, at that time, to set aside <hi>Charles</hi> the second, and settle the crown on the duke of <hi>York</hi> or <hi>Gloucester;</hi> merely, in or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der to exclude the high claims of their father and grandfather? Wou'd not such an one have been re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>garded as a very extravagant projector, who lov'd dangerous remedies, and cou'd tamper and play with a government and national constitution, like a quack with a sickly patient?</p>
            <p>THE advantages, which result from a parlia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mentary title, preferably to an hereditary one, tho' they are great, are too refin'd ever to enter into the conception of the vulgar. The bulk of man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kind wou'd never allow them to be sufficient for committing what wou'd be regarded as an injustice to the prince. They must be supported by some gross, popular, and familiar topics; and wise men, tho' convinc'd of their force, wou'd reject them, in compliance with the weakness and prejudices of the people. An encroaching tyrant or deluded bi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>got alone, by his misconduct, is able to enrage the nation, and render practicable what was always, perhaps, desirable.</p>
            <p>IN reality, the reason asiign'd by the nation for excluding the race of <hi>Stuart,</hi> and so many other branches of the royal family, is not on account of
<pb n="275" facs="277"/>
their hereditary title (which however just in itself, wou'd, to vulgar apprehensions, have appear'd al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>together absurd) but on account of their religion: Which leads us to compare the disadvantages above mention'd of each establishment.</p>
            <p>I CONFESS, that, considering the matter in ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neral, it were rather to be wish'd, that our prince had no foreign dominions, and cou'd confine all his attention to the government of this island. For not to mention some real inconveniencies, that may result from territories on the continent; they afford such a handle for calumny and defamation, as is greedily seiz'd by the people, who are always dispos'd to think ill of their superiors. It must, however, be acknowledg'd, that <hi>Hanover</hi> is, per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps, the spot of ground in <hi>Europe</hi> the least incon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venient for a king of <hi>Britain.</hi> It lyes in the heart of <hi>Germany,</hi> at a distance from the great powers, which are our natural rivals: It is protected by the laws of the empire, as well as by the arms of its own sovereign: And it serves only to connect us more closely with the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> which is our natural ally.</p>
            <p>IN the last war, it has been of service to us, by furnishing us with a considerable body of auxiliary troops, the bravest and most faithful in the world. The elector of <hi>Hanover</hi> is the only considerable prince in the empire, who has drove no separate
<pb n="276" facs="278"/>
end, and has rais'd up no stale pretensions, during the late commotions of <hi>Europe;</hi> but has acted, all along, with the dignity of a king of <hi>Britain.</hi> And ever since the accession of that family, 'twou'd be difficult to show any harm we have ever receiv'd from the electoral dominions, except that short disgust in 1718, with <hi>Charles</hi> the twelfth, who, regulating himself by maxims very different from those of other princes, made a personal quarrel of every public injury.</p>
            <p>THE religious persuasion of the house of <hi>Stuart</hi> is an inconvenience of a much deeper dye, and wou'd threaten us with much more dismal conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quences. The <hi>Roman</hi> catholic religion, with its huge train of priests and friers, is vastly more ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pensive than ours: Even tho' unaccompany'd with its natural attendants of inquisitors and stakes and gibbets, it is less tolerating: And not contented with dividing the sacerdotal from the regal office, (which must be prejudicial to any state) it bestows the former on a foreigner, who has always a sepa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rate, and may often have an opposite interest to that of the public.</p>
            <p>BUT were this religion ever so advantageous to society, it is contrary to that which is establish'd among us, and which is likely to keep possession, for a long time, of the minds of the people. And tho' it is much to be hop'd, that the progress of rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son
<pb n="277" facs="279"/>
and philosophy will, by degrees, abate the vi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rulent acrimony of opposite religious all over <hi>Eu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rope;</hi> yet the spirit of moderation has, as yet, made too slow advances to be entirely trusted. The conduct of the <hi>Saxon</hi> family, where the same per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son can be a catholic king and a protestant elector, is, perhaps, the first instance, in modern times, of so reasonable and prudent a behaviour. And the gradual progress of the catholic superstition does, even there, prognosticate a speedy alteration: Af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter which, 'tis justly to be apprehended, that per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>secutions will put a speedy period to the protestant religion in the place of its nativity.</p>
            <p>THUS, upon the whole, the advantages of the settlement in the family of <hi>Stuart,</hi> which frees us from a disputed title, seem to bear some proporti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on with those of the settlement in the family of <hi>Hanover,</hi> which frees us from the claims of prero<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gative: But at the same time, its disadvantages, by placing on the throne a <hi>Roman</hi> catholic, are much greater than those of the other establishment, in settling the crown on a foreign prince. What party an impartial patriot, in the reign of king <hi>William</hi> or queen <hi>Anne,</hi> wou'd have chosen a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>midst these opposite views, may, perhaps, to some appear hard to determine. For my part, I esteem liberty so invaluable a blessing in society, that what<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever favours its progress and security, can scarce
<pb n="278" facs="280"/>
be too fondly cherish'd by every one, who is a lo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver of human kind.</p>
            <p>BUT, the settlement in the house of <hi>Hanover</hi> has actually taken place. The princes of that family, without intrigue, without cabal, without sollicita<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion on their part, have been call'd to mount our throne, by the united voice of the whole legislative body. They have, since their accession, display'd, in all their actions, the utmost mildness, equity, and regard to the laws and constitution. Our own ministers, our own parliaments, ourselves have go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vern'd us; and if aught ill has befallen us, we can only blame fortune or ourselves. What a reproach must we become amongst nations, if, disgusted with a settlement so deliberately made, and whose conditions have been so religiously observ'd, we shou'd throw every thing again into confusion; and by our levity and rebellious disposition, prove our<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves totally unfit for any state but that of abso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lute slavery and subjection?</p>
            <p>THE greatest inconvenience attending a disput<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed title is, that it brings us in danger of civil wars and rebellions. What wise man, to avoid this in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>convenience, wou'd run directly upon a civil war and rebellion? Not to mention, that so long pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>session, secur'd by so many laws, must, e're this time, in the apprehension of a great part of the nation, have begot a title in the house of <hi>Hano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver,</hi>
               <pb n="279" facs="281"/>
independent of their present possession: So that now we shou'd not even, by a revolution, obtain the end, of avoiding a disputed title.</p>
            <p>No revolution, made by national forces, will e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver be able, without some other great necessity, to abolish our debts and incumbrances, in which the interest of so many persons is concern'd. And a revolution, made by foreign forces, is a conquest: A calamity, with which the precarious balance of power very nearly threatens us, and which our ci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vil dissensions are likely, above all other circum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces, to bring suddenly upon us.</p>

            <p>OF all mankind, there are none so pernicious as political projectors, if they have power; nor so ridiculous, if they want it: As on the other hand, a wise politician is the most beneficial cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racter in nature, if accompany'd with authority, and the most innocent, and not altogether useless, even if depriv'd of it. 'Tis not with forms of go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernment, as with other artificial contrivances; where an old engine may be rejected, if we can dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cover another more accurate and commodious, or where trials may safely be made, even tho' the suc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cess be doubtful. An establish'd government has an infinite advantage, by that very circumstance of its being establish'd; the bulk of mankind being govern'd by authority, not reason, and never attri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>buting authority to any thing, that has not the re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>commendation of antiquity. To tamper, therefore, in this affair, or try projects, merely upon the cre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dit of suppos'd argument and philosophy, can ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver be the part of a wise magistrate, who will bear a reverence to what carries the marks of age; and tho' he may attempt some improvement for the public good, yet will he adjust his innovations, as much as possible, to the antient fabric, and pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serve
<pb n="282" facs="283"/>
entire the chief pillars and supports of the constitution.</p>
            <p>THE mathematicians in <hi>Europe</hi> have been much divided concerning that figure of a ship, which is the most commodious for sailing; and <hi>Huygens,</hi> who at last fixt this controversy, is justly thought to have oblig'd the learned, as well as commerci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>al world; tho' <hi>Columbus</hi> had sail'd to <hi>America,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> made the tour of the world, without any such discovery. As one form of go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernment must be allow'd more perfect than ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, independent of the manners and humours of particular men; Why may we not enquire what is the most perfect of all, tho' the common botcht and inaccurate governments seem to serve the pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poses of society, and tho' it be not so easy to esta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blish a new government as to build a vessel upon a new plan? The subject is surely the most worthy curiosity, of any the wit of man can possibly de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vise. And who knows, if this controversy were fixt by the universal consent of the learned, but in some future age an opportunity might be afford<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed of reducing the theory to practice, either by a dissolution of the old governments, or the combi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nation of men to form a new one, in some distant part of the world? In all cases, it must be advan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tageous to know what is most perfect in the kind, that we may be able to bring any real constitution or form of government as near it as possible, by
<pb n="283" facs="284"/>
such gentle alterations and innovations, as may not give too great disturbance to society.</p>
            <p>ALL I'pretend to in the present essay is to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vive this subject of speculation; and therefore I shall deliver my sentiments in as few words as pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sible. A long dissertation on that head wou'd not, I apprehend, be very acceptable to the pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lic, who will be apt to regard such disquisitions, both as useless and chimerical.</p>
            <p>ALL plans of government, which suppose great reformation in the manners of mankind, are plain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly imaginary. Of this nature, are the republic of <hi>Plato,</hi> and the <hi>Utopia</hi> of Sir <hi>Thomas More.</hi> The <hi>Oceana</hi> is the only valuable model of a common<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wealth, that has yet been offer'd to the public.</p>
            <p>THE chief defects of the <hi>Oceana</hi> seem to be these. <hi>First,</hi> Its rotation is inconvenient, by throw<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing men, of whatever ability, by intervals, out of public employments. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Its <hi>Agrarian</hi> is im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>practicable. Men will soon learn the art, which was practis'd in antient <hi>Rome,</hi> of concealing their possessions under other peoples names; till at last, the abuse will become so common, that they will throw off, even the appearance of restraint. <hi>Third<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly,</hi> The <hi>Oceana</hi> provides not a sufficient security for liberty or the redress of grievances. The senate must propose, and the people consent; by which
<pb n="284" facs="285"/>
means, the senate have not only a negative upon the people, but what is of infinitely greater conse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quence, their negative goes before the votes of the people. Were the king's negative of the same na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture in the <hi>English</hi> constitution, and cou'd he pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vent any bill from coming into parliament, he wou'd be an absolute monarch. As his negative follows the votes of the houses, it is of little con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sequence: Such a difference is there in the man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner of placing the same thing. When a popular bill has been debated in the two houses, is brought to maturity, all its conveniencies and inconvenien<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cies weigh'd and balanc'd; if afterwards it be pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sented for the royal assent, few princes will ven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture to reject the unanimous desire of the people. But cou'd the king crush a disagreeable bill in em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bryo (as was the case, for some time in the <hi>Scotch</hi> parliament, by means of the lords of the articles) the <hi>British</hi> government wou'd have no balance, nor wou'd grievances ever be redrest: And 'tis certain, that exorbitant power proceeds not, in any govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, from new laws, so much as from neglecting to remedy the abuses, which frequently rise upon the old ones. A government, says <hi>Machiavel,</hi> must often be brought back to its original prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciples. It appears, then, that in the <hi>Oceana</hi> the whole legislature may be said to rest in the senate; which <hi>Harrington</hi> wou'd own to be an inconve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nient form of government; especially after the <hi>Agrarian</hi> is abolish'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="286"/>
HERE is a form of government, to which I can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not, in theory, discover any considerable objection. Let <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> or any territory of equal extent, be divided into 100 counties, and each county into 100 parishes, making in all 10,000. If the country, purpos'd to be erected into a com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monwealth, be of more narrow extent, we may diminish the number of counties, but never bring them below thirty. If it be of greater extent, 'twere better to enlarge the parishes, or throw more parishes into a county, than encrease the number of counties.</p>
            <p>LET all the freeholders in the country parishes, and those who pay scot and lot in the town pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rishes, meet annually in the parish church, and chuse by ballot some freeholder of the county for their member, whom we shall call the county <hi>re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>presentative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET the 100 county representatives, two days after their election, meet in the county town, and chuse by ballot, from their own body, ten coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty <hi>magistrates,</hi> and one <hi>senator.</hi> There are, there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore, in the whole commonwealth, 100 senators, 1100 county magistrates, and 10,000 county re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>presentatives. For we shall bestow on all sena<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tors the authority of county magistrates, and on all county magistrates the authority of county repre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sentatives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="287"/>
LET the senators meet in the capital, and be en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dow'd with the whole executive power of the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monwealth, the power of peace and war, of giv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing orders to generals, admirals, and ambassadors; and in short, all the prerogatives of a <hi>British</hi> king, except his negative.</p>
            <p>LET the county representatives meet in their particular counties, and possess the whole legisla<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive power of the commonwealth; the greatest number of counties deciding the question, and where these are equal, let the senate have the cast<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing vote.</p>
            <p>EVERY new law must first be debated in the senate; and tho' rejected by it, if ten senators in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sist and protest, it must be sent down to the coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties. The senate may join to the copy of the law, their reasons for receiving or rejecting it.</p>
            <p>BECAUSE it would be troublesome to assemble the whole county representatives for every trivial law, that may be requisite, the senate have their choice of sending down the law either to the coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty magistrates or county representatives.</p>
            <p>THE magistrates, tho' the law be referr'd to them, may, if they please, call the representatives, and submit the affair to their determination.</p>
            <p>WHETHER the law be referr'd by the senate to the county magistrates or representatives, a co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>py of it, and of the senate's reasons must be sent to
<pb n="287" facs="288"/>
every representative eight days before the day ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pointed for the assembling in order to deliberate concerning it. And tho' the determination be, by the senate, referr'd to the magistrates, if five re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>presentatives of the county order the magistrates to assemble the whole court of representatives, and submit the affair to their determination, they must obey.</p>
            <p>EITHER the county magistrates or representa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tives may give, to the senator of the county, the copy of a law to be propos'd to the senate; and if five counties concur in the same order, the law, tho' refus'd by the senate, must come either to the county magistrates or representatives, as is con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain'd in the order of the five counties.</p>
            <p>ANY twenty counties, by a vote either of their magistrates or representatives, may throw any man out of all public offices for a year. Thirty coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties for three years.</p>
            <p>THE senate has a power of throwing out any member or number of members of its own body, not to be re-elected for that year. The senate cannot throw out twice in a year the senator of the same county.</p>
            <p>THE power of the old senate continues for three weeks after the annual election of the county repre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sentatives. Then all the new senators are shut up in a conclave, like the cardinals; and by an intri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cate
<pb n="288" facs="289"/>
ballot, such as that of <hi>Venice</hi> or <hi>Malta,</hi> they chuse the following magistrates; a protector, who represents the dignity of the commonwealth, and presides in the senate; two secretaries of state; these six councils, a council of state, a coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cil of religion and learning, a council of trade, a council of laws, a council of war, a council of the admiralty; each council consisting of five persons: Along with six commissioners of the treasury and a chief commissioner. All these must be senators. The senate also names all the ambassadors to fo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>reign courts, who may either be senators or not.</p>
            <p>THE senate may continue any or all of these, but must re-elect them every year.</p>
            <p>THE protector and two secretaries have session and suffrage in the council of state. The business of that council is all foreign politics. The coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cil of state has session and suffrage in all the other councils.</p>
            <p>THE council of religion and learning inspects the universities and clergy. That of trade inspects e<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very thing that may affect commerce. That of laws inspects all the abuses of laws by the inferior magistrates, and examines what improvements may be made of the municipal law. That of war in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spects the militia and its discipline, magazines, stores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when the republic is in war, ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>amines into the proper orders for generals. The council of admiralty has the same power with re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gard
<pb n="289" facs="290"/>
to the navy, along with the nomination of the captains and all inferior officers.</p>
            <p>NONE of these councils can give orders them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves, except where they receive such powers from the senate. In other cases, they must communicate every thing to the senate.</p>
            <p>WHEN the senate is under adjournment, any of the councils may assemble it before the day ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pointed for its meeting.</p>
            <p>BESIDES these councils or courts, there is ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther call'd the court of <hi>competitors,</hi> which is thus constituted. If any candidates for the office of se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nator have more votes than a third of the represen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tatives, that candidate, which has most votes, next to the senator elected, becomes incapable for one year of all public offices, even of being a magistrate or representative: But he takes his seat in the court of competitors. Here then is a court, which may sometimes consist of a hundred members; sometimes have no members at all; and by that means, be for a year abolish'd.</p>
            <p>THE court of competitors has no power in the commonwealth. It has only the inspection of public accounts, and the accusing any man before the senate. If the senate acquit him, the court of competitors may, if they please, appeal to the people, either magistrates or representatives. Up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on that appeal, the magistrates or representatives meet on the day appointed by the court of compe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>titors,
<pb n="290" facs="291"/>
and chuse in each county three persons; from which number every senator is excluded. These to the number of 300 meet in the capital, and bring the person accus'd to a new trial.</p>
            <p>The court of competitors may propose any law to the senate; and if refus'd may appeal to the people, that is to the magistrates or representatives, who examine it in their counties. Every senator, who is thrown out of the senate by a vote of the court, takes his seat in the court of competitors.</p>
            <p>THE senate possesses all the judicative authority of the house of lords, that is, all the appeals from the inferior courts. It likewise nominates the lord chancellor, and all the officers of the law.</p>
            <p>EVERY county is a kind of republic within itself, and the representatives may make county laws; which have no authority 'till three months after they are voted. A copy of the law is sent to the senate, and to every other county. The senate or any single county may, at any time, annul any law of another county.</p>
            <p>THE representatives have all the authority of the <hi>British</hi> justices of the peace in trials, commit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE magistrates have the nomination of all the officers of the revenue in each county. All causes with regard to the revenue are appeal'd ultimately
<pb n="291" facs="292"/>
to the magistrates. They pass the accompts of all the officers; but must have all their own accompts examin'd and past at the end of the year by the representatives.</p>
            <p>THE magistrates name rectors or ministers to all the parishes.</p>
            <p>THE presbyterian government is establish'd; and the highest ecclesiastical court is an assembly or synod of all the presbyters of the county. The magistrates may take any cause from this court, and determine it themselves.</p>
            <p>THE magistrates may try, and depose or sus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pend any presbyter.</p>
            <p>THE militia is establish'd in imitation of that in <hi>Swisserland,</hi> which being well known, we shall not insist upon it. 'Twill only be proper to make this addition, that an army of 20,000 be annually drawn out by rotation, paid and encamp'd during six weeks in summer; that the duty of a camp may not be altogether unknown.</p>
            <p>THE magistrates nominate all the colonels and downwards. The senate all upwards. During war, the general nominates the colonel and down<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards, and his commission is good for a twelve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>month. But after that it must be confirm'd by the magistrates of the county, to which the regiment belongs. The magistrates may break any officer in the county regiment. And the senate may do the same to any officer in the service. If the ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gistrates
<pb n="292" facs="293"/>
do not think proper to confirm the gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral's choice, they may nominate another officer in the place of him they reject.</p>
            <p>ALL crimes are try'd within the county by the magistrates and a jury. But the senate can stop a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny trial, and bring it before themselves.</p>
            <p>ANY county may indict any man before the se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nate, for any crime.</p>
            <p>THE protector, the two secretaries, the coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cil of state, with any five more that the senate ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>points, on extraordinary emergencies, are possest of <hi>dictatorial</hi> power for six months.</p>
            <p>THE protector may pardon any person con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>demn'd by the inferior courts.</p>
            <p>IN time of war, no officer of the army, that is in the field, can have any civil office in the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monwealth.</p>
            <p>THE capital, which we shall call <hi>London,</hi> may be allow'd four members in the senate. It may therefore be divided into four counties. The re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>presentatives of each of these chuse one senator, and ten magistrates. There are therefore in the city four senators, forty four magistrates, and four hun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dred representatives. The magistrates have the same authority as in the counties. The represen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tatives also have the same authority; but they ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver meet in one general court: They give their
<pb n="293" facs="294"/>
votes in their particular county or division of hun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dreds.</p>
            <p>WHEN they enact any city law, the greatest number of counties or divisions determines the mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter. And where these are equal, the magistrates have the casting vote.</p>
            <p>THE magistrates chuse the mayor, sheriff, re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>corder and other officers of the city.</p>
            <p>IN the commonwealth, no representative, ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gistrate, or senator, as such, has any salary. The protector, secretaries, councils, and ambassadors have salaries.</p>
            <p>THE first year in every century is set apart to correct all inequalities, which time may have pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duc'd in the representation. This must be done by the legislature.</p>
            <p>THE following political aphorisms may explain the reason of these orders.</p>
            <p>THE lower sort of people and small proprietors are good enough judges of one not very distant from them in rank or habitation; and therefore, in their parochial meetings, will probably chuse the best or nearly the best representative: But they are wholly unfit for county meetings, and for electing into the higher offices of the republic. Their ignorance gives the grandees an opportuni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty of deceiving them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="294" facs="295"/>
TEN thousand, even tho' they were not annu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ally elected, are a large enough basis for any free government. 'Tis true, the nobles in <hi>Poland</hi> are more than 10,000, and yet these oppress the people. But as power continues there always in the same persons and families, this makes them, in a man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner, a different nation from the people. Besides, the nobles are there united under a few heads of families.</p>
            <p>ALL free governments must consist of two coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cils, a less and a greater, or in other words, of a senate and people. The people, as <hi>Harrington</hi> ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serves, wou'd want wisdom, without the senate: The senate, without the people, wou'd want ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nesty.</p>
            <p>A LARGE assembly of 1000, for instance, to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>present the people, if allow'd to debate, wou'd fall into disorder. If not allow'd to debate, the senate has a negative upon them, and the worst kind of negative, that before resolution.</p>
            <p>HERE therefore is an inconvenience which no government has yet fully remedy'd, but which is the easiest to be remedy'd in the world. If the people debate, all is confusion: If they do not de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bate, they can only resolve; and then the senate carves for them. Divide the people into many se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parate bodies; and then they may debate with
<pb n="295" facs="296"/>
safety, and every inconvenience seems to be pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vented.</p>
            <p>CARDINAL <hi>de Retz</hi> says, that all numerous as<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>semblies, however compos'd, are mere mob, and sway'd in their debates by the least motive. This we find confirm'd by daily experience. When an absurdity strikes a member, he conveys it to his neighbour, and so on, till the whole be infected. Separate this great body; and tho every member be only of middling sense, 'tis not probable, that a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny thing but reason can prevail over the whole. Influence and example being remov'd, good sense will always get the better of bad among a num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber of people, Good sense is one thing: But fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lies are numberless; and every man has a diffe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rent one. The only way of making a people wise is to keep them from uniting into large assemblies.</p>
            <p>THERE are two things to be guarded against in every <hi>senate:</hi> Its combination and its division. Its combination is most dangerous; and against this inconvenience we have provided the following remedies. 1, The great dependence of the sena<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tors on the people by annual elections; and that not by an undistinguishing rabble, like the <hi>English</hi> electors, but by men of fortune and education. 2, The small power they are allow'd. They have few offices to dispose of. Almost all are given by the magistrates in the counties. 3, The court of
<pb n="296" facs="297"/>
competitors, which being compos'd of men that are their rivals, next to them in interest, and un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>easy in their present situation, will be sure to take all advantages against them.</p>
            <p>THE division of the senate is prevented, 1, By the smallness of their number. 2, As faction sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poses a combination to a separate interest, it is pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vented by their dependence on the people. 3, They have a power of expelling any factious member. 'Tis true, when another member of the same spirit comes from the county, they have no power of expelling him: Nor is it fit they shou'd; for that shows the humour to be in the people, and probably arises from some ill conduct in public affairs. 4, Almost any man, in a senate so regularly chosen by the people, may be suppos'd fit for any civil office. 'Twou'd be proper, there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore, for the senate to form some <hi>general</hi> resoluti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons with regard to the disposing of offices among the members: Which resolutions wou'd not con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fine them in critical times, when extraordinary parts on the one hand, or extraordinary stupidity on the other, appears in any senator; but yet they wou'd be sufficient to prevent brigue and faction, by making the disposal of the offices a thing of course. For instance; let it be a resolution, that no man shall enjoy any office, till he has sat four years in the senate: That, except ambassadors, no man shall be in office two years following: That
<pb n="297" facs="298"/>
no man shall attain the higher offices but thro' the lower; That no man shall be protector twice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The senate of <hi>Venice</hi> govern themselves by such resolutions.</p>
            <p>IN foreign politics the interest of the senate can scarc eever be divided from that of the people; and therefore 'tis fit to make the senate absolute with regard to them; otherwise there cou'd be no se crecy nor refin'd policy. Besides, without mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney, no alliance can be executed; and the senate is still sufficiently dependent. Not to mention, that the legislative power being always superior to the executive, the magistrates or representatives may interpose, whenever they think proper.</p>
            <p>THE chief support of the <hi>British</hi> government is the opposition of interests; but that, tho' in the main serviceable, breeds endless factions. In the foregoing plan, it does all the good without any of the harm. The <hi>competitors</hi> have no power of controlling the senate: They have only the power of accusing, and appealing to the people.</p>
            <p>'TIS necessary, likewise, to prevent both com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bination and division in the thousand magistrates. This is done sufficiently by the separation of places and interests.</p>
            <p>BUT lest that shou'd not be enough, their de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pendence on the 10,000 for their elections, serves to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="298" facs="299"/>
NOR is that all: For the 10,000 may resume the power, whenever they please; and not only when they all please, but when any five of a hun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dred please, which will happen upon the very first suspicion of a separate interest.</p>
            <p>THE 10,000 are too large a body either to u<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nite or divide, except when they meet in one place, and fall under the guidance of ambitious leaders. Not to mention their annual election, by almost the whole body of the people.</p>
            <p>A SMALL commonwealth is the happiest go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernment in the world, within itself; because eve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry thing lyes under the eye of the rulers: But it may be subdu'd by great force from without. This scheme seems to have all the advantages both of a great and a little commonwealth.</p>
            <p>EVERY county law may be anull'd either by the senate or another county; because that shows an opposition of interests: In which case, no part ought to decide for itself. The matter must be referr'd to the whole, which will best determine what agrees with general interest.</p>
            <p>AS to the clergy and militia, the reasons of these orders are obvious. Without the dependence of the clergy on the civil magistrate, and without a militia, 'tis folly to think any free government will ever have security or stability.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="299" facs="300"/>
IN many governments, the inferior magistrates have no rewards but what arise from their ambiti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on, vanity, or public spirit. The salaries of the <hi>French</hi> judges amount not to the interest of the sums they pay for their offices. The <hi>Dutch</hi> bur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>go-masters have little more immediate profit than the <hi>English</hi> justices of peace, or the members of the house of commons formerly. But lest any shou'd suspect that this wou'd beget negligence in the administration, (which is little to be fear'd con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sidering the natural ambition of mankind) let the magistrates have competent salaries. The sena<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tors have access to so many honourable and lucra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive offices, that their attendance needs not be bought. There is little attendance requir'd of the representatives.</p>
            <p>THAT the foregoing plan of government is practicable, no one can doubt, who considers the resemblance it bears to the commonwealth of the United provinces, formerly one of the wisest and most renown'd governments, that ever was in the world. The alterations in the present scheme are all evidently to the better. 1, The represen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tation is more equal. 2, The unlimited power of the burgo-masters in the towns, which forms a perfect aristocracy in the <hi>Dutch</hi> commonwealth, is corrected by a well temper'd democracy, in giv<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing to the people the annual election of the coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty
<pb n="300" facs="301"/>
representatives. 3, The negative, which eve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry province and town has upon the whole body of the <hi>Dutch</hi> republic, with regard to alliances, peace and war, and the imposition of taxes, is here re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mov'd. 4, The counties, in the present plan, are not so independent of each other, nor do they form separate bodies so much as the seven provinces; where the jealousy and envy of the smaller pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vinces and towns against the greater, particular<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> have frequently dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turb'd the government. 5, Larger powers, tho' of the safest kind, are entrusted to the senate than the States General possess; by which means, the former may become more expeditious, and secret in their resolutions, than 'tis possible for the latter.</p>

                  <desc>illegible</desc>
               </gap>t perfect model of limited monarchy, seem to be the following. <hi>First,</hi> The plan of the republican par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liament ought to be restor'd, by making the repre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sentation equal, and by allowing none to vote in the county elections who possess not a hundred a year. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As such a house of commons wou'd be too weighty for a frail house of lords, like the present, the bishops and <hi>Scotch</hi> peers ought to be remov'd, whose behaviour, <hi>in former parli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>aments,</hi> destroy'd entirely the authority of that house: The number of the upper house ought to be rais'd to three or four hundred: Their seats not
<pb n="301" facs="302"/>
hereditary, but during life: They ought to have the election of their own members; and no com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>moner shou'd be allow'd to refuse a seat, that was offer'd him. By this means, the house of lords wou'd consist entirely of the men of chief credit, ability, and interest of the nation; and every tur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bulent leader in the house of commons might be taken off, and connected in interest with the house of peers. Such an aristocracy wou'd be an excel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lent barrier both to the monarchy and against it. At present, the balance of our government de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pends, in some measure, on the ability and behavi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>our of the sovereign; which are variable and un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>certain circumstances.</p>
            <p>I ALLOW, that this plan of limited monarchy, however corrected, is still liable to three great in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>conveniencies. <hi>First,</hi> It removes not entirely, tho it may soften, the parties of <hi>court</hi> and <hi>country. Se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>condly,</hi> The king's personal character must still have a great influence on the government. <hi>Third<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly,</hi> The sword is in the hands of a single person, who will always neglect to discipline the militia, in order to have a pretext for keeping up a stand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing army. 'Tis evident, that this is a mortal dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>temper in the <hi>British</hi> government, of which it must at last inevitably perish. I must, however, con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fess, that <hi>Sweden</hi> seems, in some measure, to have remedy'd this inconvenience, and to have a mili<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tia, along with its limited monarchy, as well as a
<pb n="302" facs="303"/>
standing army, which is less dangerous than the <hi>British.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE shall conclude this subject with observing the falshood of the common opinion, that no large state, such as <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Britain,</hi> cou'd ever be mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dell'd into a commonwealth, but that such a form of government can only take place in a city or small territory. The contrary seems evident. Tho' 'tis more difficult to form a republican government in an extensive country than in a city; there is more facility, when once it is form'd, of preserving it steady and uniform, without tumult and faction, in the former than in the latter. 'Tis not easy, for the distant parts of a large state to combine in any plan of free government; but they easily con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spire in the esteem and reverence for a single per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son, who, by means of this popular favour, may seize the power, and forcing the more obstinate to submit, may establish a monarchical government. On the other hand, a city readily concurs in the same notions of government, the natural equality of property favours liberty, and the nearness of ha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bitation enables the citizens mutually to assist each other. Even under absolute princes, the subordi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nate government of cities is commonly republican; while that of counties and provinces is monarchical. But these same circumstances, which facilitate the erection of commonwealths in cities, render their constitution more frail and uncertain. Democra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cies
<pb n="303" facs="304"/>
are turbulent. For however the people may be separated or divided into small parties, either in their votes or elections; their near habitation in a city will always make the force of popular tides and currents very sensible. Aristocracies are bet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter adapted for peace and order, and accordingly were most admired by antient writers; but they are jealous and oppressive. In a large government, which is modell'd with masterly skill, there is com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pass and room enough to refine the democracy, from the lower people, who may be admitted into the first elections or first concoction of the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monwealth, to the higher magistrates, who direct all the motions. At the same time, the parts are so distant and remote, that 'tis very difficult, either by intrigue, prejudice, or passion, to hurry them into any measures against the public interest.</p>
            <p>'TIS needless to enquire whether such a govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment wou'd be immortal. I allow the justness of the poet's exclamation on the endless projects of human race, <hi>Man and for ever!</hi> The world itself probably is not immortal. Such consuming plagues may arise as wou'd leave even a perfect govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment a weak prey to its neighbours. We know not, how far enthusiasm, or other extraordinary motions of the human mind, may transport men, to the neglect of all order and public good. Where difference of interest is remov'd, whimsical and unaccountable factions often arise, from personal
<pb n="304" facs="305"/>
favour or enmity. Perhaps, rust may grow to the springs of the most accurate political machine, and disorder its motions. Lastly, extensive conquests when pursu'd, must be the ruin of every free go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernment, and of the more perfect governments sooner than of the imperfect; because of the very advantages, which the former possess above the lat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter. And tho' such a state ought to establish a fun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>damental law against conquests: Yet republics have ambition as well as individuals, and present in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terest makes men forgetful of their posterity. 'Tis a sufficient incitement to human endeavours, that such a government wou'd flourish for many ages; without pretending to bestow on any work of man, that immortality, which the Almighty seems to have refus'd to his own productions.</p>
