               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Reflections of <hi>Horace,</hi> and the Judgments past in this Epistle to <hi>Augustus,</hi> seem'd so seasonable to the present Times, that I could not help applying them to the use of my own Country. The Author thought them considerable enough to address them to His Prince; whom he paints with all the great and good Qualities of a Monarch, upon whom the <hi>Romans</hi> depended for the En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>crease of an <hi>Absolute Empire.</hi> But to make the Poem en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tirely English, I was willing to add one or two such, as contribute to the Happiness of a <hi>Free People,</hi> and are more consistent with the Welfare of <hi>our Neighbours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Epistle will show the learned World to have fallen into two mistakes; one, that <hi>Augustus was a Patron of Poets in general;</hi> whereas he not only prohibited all but the Best Writers to name him, but recommended that Care even to the Civil Magistrate: <hi>Admonebat Praetores, ne paterentur Nomen suum obsolefieri,</hi> &amp;c. The other to imagine this Piece to be a <hi>general Discourse of Poetry;</hi> whereas it is an <hi>Apology for the Poets,</hi> in order to render <hi>Augustus</hi> more their Patron. <hi>Horace</hi> here pleads the Cause of his Cotemporaries, first against the Taste of the
<pb n="iv" facs="3"/>
Town, whose humour it was to magnify the Authors of the preceding Age; secondly against the Court and Nobi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lity, who encouraged only the Writers for the Theatre; and lastly against the Emperor himself, who had conceived them of little use to the Government. He shews (by a view of the Progress of Learning, and the Change of Taste a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mong the <hi>Romans</hi>) that the Introduction of the Polite Arts of <hi>Greece</hi> had given the Writers of his Time great advan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tages over their Predecessors, that their <hi>Morals</hi> were much improved, and the Licence of those ancient Poets restrain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed: that <hi>Satire</hi> and <hi>Comedy</hi> were become more just and useful; that whatever extravagancies were left on the Stage, were owing to the Ill Taste of the Nobility; that Poets, under due Regulations, were in many respects use<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful to the <hi>State;</hi> and concludes, that it was upon them the Emperor himself must depend, for his Fame with Poste<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rity.</p>
            <p>We may farther learn from this Epistle, that <hi>Horace</hi> made his Court to this Great Prince, by writing with a decent Freedom toward him, with a just Contempt of his low Flatterers, and with a manly Regard to his own Character.</p>
