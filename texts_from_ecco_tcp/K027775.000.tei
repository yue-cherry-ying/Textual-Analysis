               <l>Sicut aquae tremulum labris ubi lumen ahenis</l>
               <l>Sole repercussum, aut radiantis imagine lunae,</l>
               <l>Omnia pervolitat laté loca, jamque sub auras</l>
               <l>Erigitur, summique ferit laquearia tecti.</l>

            </q>
            <q>
               <l>So water trembling in a polish'd vase,</l>
               <l>Reflects the beam that plays upon its face,</l>
               <l>The sportive light, uncertain where it falls,</l>
               <l>Now strikes the roof, now flashes on the walls.</l>
            </q>
            <q>Nous sommes nés pour la vérité, et nous ne pouvons souffrir son
abord. les figures, les paraboles, les emblémes. sont toujours
des ornements nécessaires pour qu'elle puisse s'annoncer. et soit
quon craigne qu'elle ne découvre trop brusquement le défaut
qu'on voudroit cacher, ou qu'enfin elle n'instruise avec trop
peu de ménagement, ou veut, en la recevant, qu'elle soit
déguisée. <bibl>CARACCIOLI.</bibl>

               <l>YOU told me, I remember, glory built</l>
               <l>On selfish principles, is shame and guilt.</l>
               <l>The deeds that men admire as half divine,</l>
               <l>Stark naught, because corrupt in their design.</l>
               <l>Strange doctrine this! that without scruple tears</l>
               <l>The laurel that the very light'ning spares,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="5"/>
Brings down the warrior's trophy to the dust,</l>
               <l>And eats into his bloody sword like rust.</l>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <l>I grant, that men continuing what they are,</l>
               <l>Fierce, avaricious, proud, there must be war.</l>
               <l>And never meant the rule should be applied</l>
               <l>To him that fights with justice on his side.</l>
               <l>Let laurels, drench'd in pure Parnassian dews,</l>
               <l>Reward his mem'ry, dear to ev'ry muse,</l>
               <l>Who, with a courage of unshaken root,</l>
               <l>In honour's field advancing his firm foot,</l>
               <l>Plants it upon the line that justice draws,</l>
               <l>And will prevail or perish in her cause.</l>
               <l>Tis to the virtues of such men, man owes</l>
               <l>His portion in the good that heav'n bestows,</l>
               <l>And when recording history displays</l>
               <l>Feats of renown, though wrought in antient days,</l>
               <l>Tells of a few stout hearts that fought and dy'd</l>
               <l>Where duty plac'd them, at their country's side,</l>
               <l>The man that is not mov'd with what he reads,</l>
               <l>That takes not fire at their heroic deeds,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="3" facs="6"/>
Unworthy of the blessings of the brave,</l>
               <l>Is base in kind, and born to be a slave.</l>
               <l>But let eternal infamy pursue</l>
               <l>The wretch to naught but his ambition true,</l>
               <l>Who, for the sake of filling with one blast</l>
               <l>The post horns of all Europe, lays her waste.</l>
               <l>Think yourself station'd on a tow'ring rock,</l>
               <l>To see a people scatter'd like a flock,</l>
               <l>Some royal mastiff panting at their heels,</l>
               <l>With all the savage thirst a tyger feels,</l>
               <l>Then view him self-proclaim'd in a gazette,</l>
               <l>Chief monster that has plagu'd the nations yet,</l>
               <l>The globe and sceptre in such hands misplac'd,</l>
               <l>Those ensigns of dominion, how disgrac'd!</l>
               <l>The glass that bids man mark the fleeting hour,</l>
               <l>And death's own scythe would better speak his pow'r,</l>
               <l>Then grace the boney phantom in their stead</l>
               <l>With the king's shoulder knot and gay cockade,</l>
               <l>Cloath the twin brethren in each other's dress,</l>
               <l>The same their occupation and success.</l>

               <l>Is worth, with all its gold and glitt'ring store,</l>

To quell the faction that affronts the throne,</l>

               <l>Not so—the virtue still adorns our age,</l>

               <l>In him, Demosthenes was heard again,</l>
               <l>Liberty taught him her Athenian strain;</l>
               <l>She cloath'd him with authority and awe,</l>

               <l>Felt himself crush'd at the first word he spoke.</l>

            <l>He that would win the race, must guide his horse</l>

            <l>I cast them at thy feet—my only plea</l>
            <l>Is what it was, dependence upon thee;</l>
            <l>While struggling in the vale of tears below,</l>
            <l>That never fail'd, nor shall it fail me now.</l>
            <l>Angelic gratulations rend the skies,</l>
            <l>Pride falls unpitied, never more to rise,</l>
            <l>Humility is crown'd, and faith receives the prize.</l>

            <l>WHY weeps the muse for England?</l>
            <l>What appears</l>
            <l>In England's case to move the muse to tears?</l>
            <l>From side to side of her delightful isle,</l>
            <l>Is she not cloath'd with a perpetual smile?</l>
            <l>Can nature add a charm, or art confer</l>
            <l>A new found luxury not seen in her?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="104" facs="107"/>
Where under heav'n is pleasure more pursued,</l>
            <l>Or where does cold reflection less intrude?</l>
            <l>Her fields a rich expanse of wavy corn</l>
            <l>Pour'd out from plenty's overflowing horn,</l>
            <l>Ambrosial gardens in which art supplies</l>
            <l>The fervor and the force of Indian skies,</l>
            <l>Her peaceful shores, where busy commerce waits</l>
            <l>To pour his golden tide through all her gates,</l>
            <l>Whom fiery suns that scorch the russet spice</l>
            <l>Of eastern groves, and oceans floor'd with ice;</l>
            <l>Forbid in vain to push his daring way</l>
            <l>To darker climes, or climes of brighter day,</l>
            <l>Whom the winds waft where'er the billows roll,</l>
            <l>From the world's girdle to the frozen pole;</l>
            <l>The chariots bounding in her wheel-worn streets,</l>
            <l>Her vaults below where ev'ry vintage meets,</l>
            <l>Her theatres, her revels, and her sports,</l>
            <l>The scenes to which not youth alone resorts,</l>
            <l>But age in spite of weakness and of pain</l>
            <l>Still haunts, in hope to dream of youth again,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="105" facs="108"/>
All speak her happy—let the muse look round</l>
            <l>From East to West, no sorrow can be found,</l>
            <l>Or only what in cottages confin'd,</l>
            <l>Sighs unregarded to the passing wind;</l>
            <l>Then wherefore weep for England, what appears</l>
            <l>In England's case to move the muse to tears?</l>
            <l>The prophet wept for Israel, wish'd his eyes</l>
            <l>Were fountains fed with infinite supplies;</l>
            <l>For Israel dealt in robbery and wrong,</l>
            <l>There were the scorner's and the sland'rer's tongue,</l>
            <l>Oaths used as playthings or convenient tools,</l>
            <l>As Int'rest biass'd knaves, or fashion fools,</l>
            <l>Adult'ry neighing at his neighbour's door,</l>
            <l>Oppression labouring hard to grind the poor,</l>
            <l>The partial balance and deceitsul weight,</l>
            <l>The treach'rous smile, a mask for secret hate,</l>
            <l>Hypocrisy, formality in pray'r,</l>
            <l>And the dull service of the lip were there.</l>
            <l>Her women insolent and self-caress'd,</l>
            <l>By vanity's unwearied finger dress'd,</l>

Forgot the blush that virgin fears impart</l>
            <l>To modest cheeks, and borrowed one from art;</l>
            <l>Were just such trifles without worth or use,</l>
            <l>As silly pride and idleness produce,</l>
            <l>Curl'd, scented, furbelow'd and flounc'd around,</l>

            <l>They stretch'd the neck, and roll'd the wanton eye,</l>
            <l>And sigh'd for ev'ry fool that flutter'd by.</l>
            <l>He saw his people slaves to ev'ry lust,</l>
            <l>Lewd, avaricious, arrogant, unjust,</l>
            <l>He heard the wheels of an avenging God</l>
            <l>Groan heavily along the distant road;</l>
            <l>Saw Babylon set wide her two leav'd brass</l>
            <l>To let the military deluge pass;</l>
            <l>Jerusalem a prey, her glory soil'd,</l>
            <l>Her princes captive, and her treasures spoil'd;</l>
            <l>Wept till all Israel heard his bitter cry,</l>
            <l>Stamp'd with his foot and smote upon his thigh;</l>
            <l>But wept and stamp'd and smote his thigh in vain,</l>
            <l>Pleasure is deaf when told of future pain,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="107" facs="110"/>
And sounds prophetic are too rough to suit</l>
            <l>Ears long accustom'd to the pleasing lute;</l>
            <l>They scorn'd his inspiration and his theme,</l>
            <l>Pronounc'd him frantic and his fears a dream,</l>
            <l>With self-indulgence wing'd the fleeting hours,</l>
            <l>Till the foe found them, and down fell the tow'rs.</l>
            <l>Long time Assyria bound them in her chain,</l>
            <l>Till penitence had purg'd the public stain,</l>
            <l>And Cyrus, with relenting pity mov'd,</l>
            <l>Return'd them happy to the land they lov'd:</l>
            <l>There, proof against prosperity, awhile</l>
            <l>They stood the test of her ensnaring smile,</l>
            <l>And had the grace in scenes of peace to show</l>
            <l>The virtue they had learn'd in scenes of woe.</l>
            <l>But man is frail and can but ill sustain</l>
            <l>A long immunity from grief and pain,</l>
            <l>And after all the joys that plenty leads,</l>
            <l>With tip-toe step vice silently succeeds.</l>
            <l>When he that rul'd them with a shepherd's rod,</l>
            <l>In form a man, in dignity a God,</l>
            <l>

Came not expected in that humble guise,</l>
            <l>To sift, aud search them with unerring eyes,</l>
            <l>He found conceal'd beneath a fair outside,</l>
            <l>The filth of rottenness and worm of pride,</l>
            <l>Their piety a system of deceit,</l>
            <l>Scripture employ'd to sanctify the cheat,</l>
            <l>The pharisee the dupe of his own art,</l>
            <l>Self-idolized and yet a knave at heart.</l>
            <l>When nations are to perish in their sins,</l>
            <l>'Tis in the church the leprosy begins:</l>
            <l>The priest whose office is, with zeal sincere</l>
            <l>To watch the fountain, and preserve it clear,</l>
            <l>Carelessly nods and sleeps upon the brink,</l>
            <l>While others poison what the flock must drink;</l>
            <l>Or waking at the call of lust alone,</l>
            <l>Infuses lies and errors of his own:</l>
            <l>His unsuspecting sheep believe it pure,</l>
            <l>And tainted by the very means of cure,</l>
            <l>Catch from each other a contagious spot,</l>
            <l>The foul forerunner of a general rot:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="109" facs="112"/>
Then truth is hush'd that heresy may preach,</l>
            <l>And all is trash that reason cannot reach;</l>

            <l>The graces of a life that wins the skies,</l>
            <l>Loses at once all value and esteem,</l>
            <l>Pronounc'd by gray beards a pernicious dream:</l>
            <l>Then ceremony leads her bigots forth,</l>
            <l>Prepar'd to fight for shadows of no worth,</l>

            <l>Directs thee to that eminence they reach'd,</l>
            <l>Heroes and worthies of days past, thy sires?</l>
            <l>Or his, who touch'd their hearts with hallow'd fires?</l>
            <l>Their names, alas! in vain reproach an age</l>
            <l>Whom all the vanities they scorn'd, engage,</l>
            <l>And his that seraphs tremble at, is hung</l>

Pleasure herself perhaps suggests a plea,</l>
            <l>If int'rest move thee, to persuade ev'n thee:</l>
            <l>By ev'ry charm that smiles upon her face,</l>

            <l>And if the feast of freedom cloy thee not,</l>

            <l>Held by the tenure of his will alone,</l>
            <l>Like angels in the service of their Lord,</l>
            <l>Remain with thee, or leave thee at his word;</l>
            <l>That gratitude and temp'rance in our use</l>

            <l>That thankless waste and wild abuse destroy.</l>
            <l>But above all reflect, how cheap soe'er</l>
            <l>Those rights that millions envy thee, appear,</l>
            <l>And though resolv'd to risk them, and swim down</l>
            <l>The tide of pleasure, heedless of his frown,</l>
            <l>That blessings truly sacred, and when giv'n</l>
            <l>Mark'd with the signature and stamp of Heav'n,</l>

The word of prophecy, those truths divine</l>
            <l>Which make that Heav'n, if thou desire it, thine;</l>

            <l>With cold disgust or philosophic pride,</l>
            <l>And that judicially withdrawn, disgrace,</l>
            <l>Error and darkness occupy their place.</l>
            <l>A world is up in arms, and thou, a spot</l>

            <l>A bolder still, a contest with the skies?</l>
            <l>Remember, if he guard thee and secure,</l>
            <l>Whoe'er assails thee, thy success is sure;</l>
            <l>But if he leave thee, though the skill and pow'r</l>
            <l>Of nations sworn to spoil thee and devour,</l>
            <l>Were all collected in thy single arm,</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="139" facs="142"/>
That strength would fail, oppos'd against the push</l>
            <l>And feeble onset of a pigmy rush.</l>
            <l>Say not (and if the thought of such defence</l>
            <l>Should spring within thy bosom, drive it thence)</l>
            <l>What nation amongst all my foes is free</l>
            <l>From crimes as base as any charg'd on me?</l>
            <l>Their measure fill'd—they too shall pay the debt.</l>
            <l>Which God, though long forborn, will not forget;</l>
            <l>But know, that wrath divine, when most severe,</l>
            <l>Makes justice still the guide of his career,</l>
            <l>And will not punish in one mingled crowd,</l>
            <l>Them without light, and thee without a cloud.</l>
            <l>Muse, hang this harp upon yon aged beech,</l>
            <l>Still murm'ring with the solemn truths I teach,</l>
            <l>And while, at intervals, a cold blast sings</l>
            <l>Through the dry leaves, and pants upon the strings,</l>
            <l>My soul shall sigh in secret, and lament</l>
            <l>A nation scourg'd, yet tardy to repent.</l>
            <l>I know the warning song is sung in vain,</l>

But if a fweeter voice, and one design'd</l>
            <l>A blessing to my country and mankind,</l>
            <l>Reclaim the wand'ring thousands, and bring home</l>
            <l>A flock so scatter'd and so wont to roam,</l>
            <l>Then place it once again between my knees,</l>
            <l>The sound of truth will then be sure to please,</l>
            <l>And truth alone, where'er my life be cast,</l>
            <l>In scenes of plenty or the pining waste,</l>

The poor, inur'd to drudgery and distress,</l>
            <l>Act without aim, think little and feel less,</l>
            <l>And no where but in feign'd Arcadian scenes,</l>
            <l>Taste happiness, or know what pleasure means.</l>
            <l>Riches are pass'd away from hand to hand,</l>
            <l>As fortune, vice or folly may command;</l>
            <l>As in a dance the pair that take the lead</l>
            <l>Turn downward, and the lowest pair succeed,</l>
            <l>So shifting and so various is the plan</l>

            <l>Vicissitude wheels round the motley crowd,</l>
            <l>The rich grow poor, the poor become purse-proud:</l>
            <l>Bus'ness is labour, and man's weakness such,</l>
            <l>Pleasure is labour too, and tires as much,</l>
            <l>The very sense of it foregoes its use,</l>
            <l>By repetition pall'd, by age obtuse.</l>
            <l>Youth lost in dissipation, we deplore</l>
            <l>Through life's sad remnant, what no sighs restore,</l>
            <l>Our years, a fruitless race without a prize,</l>

            <l>Once thought of nothing, and now thinks in vain,</l>
            <l>Whose eye reverted weeps o'er all the past,</l>

Streams edg'd with osiers, fatt'ning ev'ry field</l>

            <l>Man feels the spur of passions and desires,</l>

From infancy through childhood's giddy maze,</l>
            <l>Froward at school, and fretful in his plays,</l>
            <l>The puny tyrant burns to subjugate</l>

            <l>Perhaps a grave physician, gath'ring fees,</l>

            <l>And he that blames what they have blindly chose,</l>

Of all that deck the lanes, the fields, the bow'rs,</l>

And they might enter at his open door,</l>
            <l>Ev'n till his spacious hall would hold no more.</l>
            <l>He sent a servant forth by ev'ry road,</l>

            <l>That all might mark, knight, menial, high and low,</l>

            <l>No! the decree was just and without flaw,</l>

            <l>His sov'reign pow'r and pleasure unrestrain'd,</l>

            <l>Yet half mankind maintain a churlish strife</l>
            <l>With him, the donor of eternal life,</l>
            <l>Because the deed by which his love confirms</l>
            <l>The largess he bestows, prescribes the terms.</l>
            <l>Compliance with his will your lot insures,</l>

And sure it is as kind to smile and give,</l>

            <l>Love is not pedlars trump'ry, bought and sold,</l>
            <l>He <hi>will</hi> give freely, or he <hi>will</hi> withold,</l>
            <l>His soul abhors a mercenary thought,</l>
            <l>And him as deeply who abhors it not;</l>
            <l>He stipulates indeed, but merely this,</l>
            <l>That man will freely take an unbought bliss,</l>
            <l>Will trust him for a faithful gen'rous part,</l>
            <l>Nor set a price upon a willing heart.</l>

Such is the clamor of rooks, daws, and kites,</l>

            <l>Adieu, Vinoso cries, e'er yet he sips,</l>

            <l>Without good works, whatever some may boast,</l>
            <l>Mere folly and delusion—Sir, your toast.</l>
            <l>My firm persuasion is, at least sometimes,</l>
            <l>That heav'n will weigh man's virtues and his crimes,</l>
            <l>With nice attention in a righteous scale,</l>
            <l>And save or damn as these or those prevail.</l>

I plant my foot upon this ground of trust,</l>
            <l>And silence every fear with—God is just;</l>

            <l>A thought intrude that says, or seems to say.</l>
            <l>If thus th' important cause is to be tried,</l>
            <l>Suppose the beam should dip on the wrong side,</l>
            <l>I soon recover from these needless frights,</l>
            <l>And God is merciful—sets all to rights.</l>
            <l>Thus between justice, as my prime support,</l>
            <l>And mercy fled to, as the last resort,</l>
            <l>I glide and steal along with heav'n in view,</l>
            <l>And—pardon me, the bottle stands with you.</l>
            <l>I never will believe, the col'nel cries,</l>
            <l>The sanguinary schemes that some devise,</l>
            <l>Who make the good Creator, on their plan,</l>
            <l>A being of less equity than man.</l>
            <l>If appetite, or what divines call lust,</l>
            <l>Which men comply with, e'en because they must,</l>
            <l>Be punish'd with perdition, who is pure?</l>

If sentence of eternal pain belong</l>
            <l>To ev'ry sudden slip and transient wrong,</l>
            <l>Then heav'n enjoins the fallible and frail,</l>
            <l>An hopeless task, and damns them if they fail.</l>
            <l>My creed (whatever some creed-makers mean</l>
            <l>By Athanasian nonsense or Nicene)</l>
            <l>My creed is, he is safe that does his best,</l>

            <l>Right, says an ensign, and for aught I see,</l>
            <l>Your faith and mine substantially agree:</l>
            <l>The best of ev'ry man's performance here,</l>

            <l>A lawyer's dealing should be just and fair,</l>
            <l>Honesty shines with great advantage there;</l>
            <l>Fasting and pray'r sit well upon a priest,</l>
            <l>A decent caution and reserve at least.</l>
            <l>A soldier's best is courage in the field,</l>
            <l>With nothing here that wants to be conceal'd,</l>
            <l>Manly deportment, gallant, easy, gay,</l>
            <l>An hand as lib'ral as the light of day,</l>

               <pb n="161" facs="165"/>
The soldier thus endow'd, who never shrinks,</l>
            <l>Nor closets up his thought what'er he thinks,</l>
            <l>Who scorns to do an injury by stealth,</l>

            <l>Is still found fallible, however wise,</l>
            <l>And differing judgments serve but to declare</l>
            <l>That truth lies somewhere, if we knew but where.</l>
            <l>Of all it ever was my lot to read</l>
            <l>Of critics now alive or long since dead,</l>
            <l>The book of all the world that charm'd me most</l>

            <l>To take with gratitude what heav'n bestows,</l>
            <l>With prudence always ready at our call,</l>
            <l>To guide our use of it, is all in all.</l>
            <l>Doubtless it is—to which of my own store</l>

            <l>Where bold enquiry diving out of sight,</l>
            <l>Brings many a precious pearl of truth to light,</l>
            <l>Where nought eludes the persevering quest,</l>
            <l>That fashion, taste, or luxury suggest.</l>

As when a felon whom his country's laws</l>

            <l>The warder at the door his key applies,</l>

            <l>Joy, far superior joy, that much outweighs</l>

Who seeks to praise thee, and to make thee known</l>

            <l>Come, prompt me with benevolent desires,</l>
            <l>Teach me to kindle at thy gentle fires,</l>
            <l>And though disgrac'd and slighted, to redeem</l>
            <l>A poet's name, by making thee the theme.</l>
            <l>God working ever on a social plan,</l>
            <l>By various ties attaches man to man:</l>
            <l>He made at first, though free and unconfin'd,</l>

            <l>That ev'ry tribe, though plac'd as he sees best,</l>

            <l>As ever mingled with heroic dust,</l>
            <l>Steer'd Britain's oak into a world unknown,</l>
            <l>And in his country's glory sought his own,</l>
            <l>Wherever he found man, to nature true,</l>
            <l>The rights of man were sacred in his view:</l>

He sooth'd with gifts and greeted with a smile</l>
            <l>The simple native of the new-found isle,</l>
            <l>He spurn'd the wretch that slighted or withstood</l>
            <l>The tender argument of kindred blood,</l>
            <l>Nor would endure that any should controul</l>
            <l>His free-born brethren of the southern pole.</l>
            <l>But though some nobler minds a law respect,</l>

            <l>In baser souls unnumber'd evils meet,</l>

            <l>No—Mammon makes the world his legatee</l>
            <l>Through fear not love, and heav'n abhors the fee:</l>

The hand that siew 'till it could slay no more,</l>

            <l>Their prince as justly seated on his throne,</l>
            <l>As vain imperial Philip on his own,</l>

            <l>God stood not, though he seem'd to stand aloof,</l>
            <l>And at this hour the conqu'ror feels the proof.</l>
            <l>The wreath he won drew down an instant curse,</l>

Thou that hast wasted earth, and dared despise</l>
            <l>Alike the wrath and mercy of the skies,</l>
            <l>Thy pomp is in the grave, thy glory laid</l>
            <l>Low in the pits thine avarice has made.</l>
            <l>We come with joy from our eternal rest,</l>

            <l>Art thou the God the thunder of whose hand</l>

            <l>Shook principalities and kingdoms down,</l>
            <l>And made the mountains tremble at his frown?</l>
            <l>The sword shall light upon thy boasted pow'rs,</l>

            <l>T' associate all the branches of mankind,</l>

Each climate needs what other climes produce,</l>

            <l>No land but listens to the common call,</l>
            <l>And in return receives supply from all;</l>
            <l>This genial intercourse and mutual aid,</l>

            <l>Capricious taste itself can crave no more,</l>
            <l>Than she supplies from her abounding store;</l>
            <l>She strikes out all that luxury can ask,</l>
            <l>And gains new vigour at her endless task.</l>
            <l>Hers is the spacious arch, the shapely spire,</l>

She guides the finger o'er the dancing keys,</l>

            <l>These are the gifts of art, and art thrives most</l>

            <l>Imports what others have invented well,</l>
            <l>And stirs his own to match them, or excel.</l>
            <l>'Tis thus reciprocating each with each,</l>
            <l>Alternately the nations learn and teach;</l>

A bold remark, but which if well applied,</l>
            <l>Would humble many a tow'ring poet's pride:</l>
            <l>Perhaps the man was in a sportive fit,</l>

            <l>Perhaps enchanted with the love of fame,</l>

            <l>Perhaps—whatever end he might pursue,</l>
            <l>The cause of virtue could not be his view.</l>
            <l>At ev'ry stroke wit flashes in our eyes,</l>
            <l>The turns are quick, the polish'd points surprise,</l>
            <l>But shine with cruel and tremendous charms,</l>
            <l>That while they please possess us with alarms:</l>
            <l>So have I seen, (and hasten'd to the sight</l>
            <l>On all the wings of holiday delight)</l>
            <l>Where stands that monument of antient pow'r,</l>
            <l>Named with emphatic dignity, the tow'r,</l>
            <l>Guns, halberts, swords and pistols, great and small,</l>
            <l>In starry forms disposed upon the wall;</l>
            <l>We wonder, as we gazing stand below,</l>

But though we praise th' exact designer's skill,</l>
            <l>Account them implements of mischief still.</l>
            <l>No works shall find acceptance in that day</l>
            <l>When all disguises shall be rent away,</l>
            <l>That square not truly with the Scripture plan,</l>

            <l>And though the soul shall seek superior orbs,</l>
            <l>Whate'er this world produces, it absorbs,</l>
            <l>So self starts nothing but what tends apace</l>
            <l>Home to the goal where it began the race.</l>
            <l>Such as our motive is our aim must be,</l>

            <l>Captivity led captive rose to claim</l>
            <l>The wreath he won so dearly, in our name,</l>

            <l>And shines as if impatient to bestow</l>
            <l>Life and a kingdom upon worms below;</l>

Like him, the soul thus kindled from above,</l>

            <l>Each heart would quit its prison in the breast,</l>
            <l>And flow in free communion with the rest.</l>
            <l>The statesman skill'd in projects dark and deep,</l>
            <l>Might burn his useless Machiavel, and sleep;</l>
            <l>His budget often filled yet always poor,</l>

No longer prey upon our annual rents,</l>

            <l>Disbanded legions freely might depart,</l>
            <l>And slaying man would cease to be an art.</l>
            <l>No learned disputants would take the field,</l>
            <l>Sure not to conquer, and sure not to yield,</l>
            <l>Both sides deceiv'd if rightly understood,</l>
            <l>Pelting each other for the public good.</l>
            <l>Did Charity prevail, the press would prove</l>
            <l>A vehicle of virtue, truth and love,</l>
            <l>And I might spare myself the pains to show</l>
            <l>What few can learn, and all suppose they know.</l>
            <l>Thus have I sought to grace a serious lay</l>
            <l>With many a wild indeed, but flow'ry spray,</l>
            <l>In hopes to gain what else I must have lost,</l>

            <l>But if unhappily deceiv'd I dream,</l>
            <l>And prove too weak for so divine a theme,</l>
            <l>Let Charity forgive me a mistake</l>
            <l>That zeal not vanity has chanc'd to make,</l>

It views the truth with a distorted eye,</l>

Or recollected only to gild o'er</l>

Much less to feed and fan the fatal fires</l>

To bid the pleadings of self-love be still,</l>

Eternity's unknown expanse appears</l>

Nor these alone prefer a life recluse,</l>

            <l>And hate the tumult half the world enjoys,</l>
            <l>The lure of av'rice, or the pompous prize</l>

            <l>The fruits that hang on pleasure's flow'ry stem,</l>
            <l>Whate'er enchants them are no snares to them.</l>
            <l>To them the deep recess of dusky groves,</l>
            <l>Or forest where the deer securely roves,</l>
            <l>The fall of waters and the song of birds,</l>
            <l>And hills that echo to the distant herds,</l>
            <l>Are luxuries excelling all the glare</l>
            <l>The world can boast, and her chief fav'rites share.</l>
            <l>With eager step and carelessly array'd,</l>

The warblings of the black-bird, clear and strong,</l>

            <l>He likes the country, but in truth must own,</l>
            <l>Most likes it, when he studies it in town.</l>
            <l>Poor Jack—no matter who—for when I blame</l>
            <l>I pity, and must therefore sink the name,</l>
            <l>Liv'd in his saddle, lov'd the chace, the course,</l>
            <l>And always, e'er he mounted, kiss'd his horse.</l>
            <l>Th' estate his sires had own'd in antient years,</l>
            <l>Was quickly distanc'd, match'd against a peer's.</l>
            <l>Jack vanish'd, was regretted and forgot,</l>
            <l>'Tis wild good-nature's never-failing lot.</l>

            <l>My lord, alighting at his usual place,</l>
            <l>The crown, took notice of an ostler's face.</l>
            <l>Jack knew his friend, but hop'd in that disguise</l>

            <l>

And whistling as if unconcern'd and gay,</l>
            <l>Curried his nag and look'd another way.</l>
            <l>Convinc'd at last upon a nearer view,</l>
            <l>'Twas he, the same, the very Jack he knew,</l>
            <l>O'erwhelm'd at once with wonder, grief and joy,</l>
            <l>He press'd him much to quit his base employ,</l>
            <l>His countenance, his purse, his heart, his hand,</l>
            <l>Infl'ence and pow'r were all at his command.</l>
            <l>Peers are not always gen'rous as well-bred,</l>
            <l>But Granby was, meant truly what he said.</l>
            <l>Jack bow'd and was oblig'd—confess'd 'twas strange</l>

            <l>But knew no medium between guzzling beer,</l>

            <l>Thus some retire to nourish hopeless woe,</l>
            <l>Some seeking happiness not found below,</l>
            <l>Some to comply with humour, and a mind</l>
            <l>To social scenes by nature disinclin'd,</l>
            <l>Some sway'd by fashion, some by deep disgust,</l>

But few that court Retirement, are aware</l>

            <l>Lucrative offices are seldom lost</l>
            <l>For want of pow'rs proportion'd to the post:</l>
            <l>Give ev'n a dunce th' employment he desires,</l>
            <l>And he soon finds the talents it requires;</l>
            <l>A business with an income at its heels,</l>
            <l>Furnishes always oil for its own wheels.</l>
            <l>But in his arduous enterprize to close</l>
            <l>His active years with indolent repose,</l>
            <l>He finds the labours of that state exceed</l>
            <l>His utmost faculties, severe indeed.</l>
            <l>'Tis easy to resign a toilsome place,</l>
            <l>But not to manage leisure with a grace,</l>
            <l>Absence of occupation is not rest,</l>
            <l>A mind quite vacant is a mind distress'd.</l>
            <l>The vet'ran steed excused his task at length,</l>
            <l>In kind compassion of his failing strength,</l>
            <l>And turn'd into the park or mead to graze,</l>

There feels a pleasure perfect in its kind,</l>

            <l>To taste a joy like that he has bestow'd,</l>
            <l>He proves, less happy than his favour'd brute,</l>

Pushing her bold enquiry to the date</l>

            <l>Shook the young leaves about her ears,</l>
            <l>And fill'd her with a thousand fears,</l>
            <l>Lest the rude blast should snap the bough,</l>
            <l>And spread her golden hopes below.</l>
            <l>But just at eve the blowing weather,</l>
            <l>And all her fears were hush'd together:</l>
            <l>And now, quoth poor unthinking Raph,</l>

            <head>REPORT
Of an adjudged Case not to be found in any of the Books.</head>
            <lg n="1">
               <head>1.</head>
               <l>BETWEEN Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose,</l>
               <l>The spectacles set them unhappily wrong;</l>
               <l>The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,</l>
               <l>To which the said spectacles ought to belong.</l>
            </lg>

               <head>2.</head>
               <l>So the Tongue was the lawyer and argued the cause</l>
               <l>With a great deal of skill, and a wig full of learning,</l>
               <l>While chief baron Ear sat to balance the laws,</l>
               <l>So fam'd for his talent in nicely discerning.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg n="3">
               <head>3.</head>
               <l>In behalf of the Nose, it will quickly appear,</l>
               <l>And your lordship he said, will undoubtedly find,</l>
               <l>That the Nose has had spectacles always in wear,</l>
               <l>Which amounts to possession time out of mind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg n="4">
               <head>4.</head>
               <l>Then holding the spectacles up to the court—</l>
               <l>Your lordship observes they are made with a
straddle,</l>
               <l>As wide as the ridge of the Nose is, in short,</l>
               <l>Design'd to sit close to it, just like a saddle.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg n="5">
               <head>5.</head>
               <l>Again would your lordship a moment suppose</l>
               <l>('Tis a case that has happen'd and may be again)</l>
               <l>That the visage or countenance had not a Nose,</l>
               <l>Pray who wou'd or who cou'd wear spectacles then?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg n="6">
               <pb n="317" facs="320"/>
               <head>6.</head>
               <l>On the whole it appears, and my argument shows</l>
               <l>With a reasoning the court will never condemn,</l>
               <l>That the spectacles plainly were made for the Nose,</l>
               <l>And the Nose was as plainly intended for them.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg n="7">
               <head>7.</head>
               <l>Then shifting his side as a lawyer knows how,</l>
               <l>He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes,</l>
               <l>But what were his arguments few people know,</l>
               <l>For the court did not think they were equally
wise.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg n="8">
               <head>8.</head>
               <l>So his lordship decreed with a grave solemn tone,</l>
               <l>Decisive and clear without one if or but—</l>
               <l>That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on</l>
               <l>By day-light or candle-light—Eyes should be
shut.</l>

            <l>THUS says the prophet of the Turk,</l>

            <l>Such Mahomet's mysterious charge,</l>

            <l>They might with safety eat the rest;</l>

            <l>From the whole hog to be debarr'd,</l>

Much controversy strait arose,</l>

            <l>By some 'tis confidently said</l>
            <l>He meant not to forbid the head,</l>

            <l>You laugh—'tis well—the tale apply'd</l>
            <l>May make you laugh on t'other side.</l>
            <l>Renounce the world, the preacher cries—</l>
            <l>We do—a multitude replies.</l>
            <l>While one as innocent regards</l>
            <l>A snug and friendly game at cards;</l>
            <l>And one, whatever you may say,</l>
            <l>Can see no evil in a play;</l>
            <l>Some love a concert or a race,</l>
            <l>And others, shooting and the chase.</l>

            <head>THE NIGHTINGALE AND GLOW-WORM.</head>
            <l>A Nightingale that all day long</l>
            <l>Had cheer'd the village with his song,</l>
            <l>Nor yet at eve his note suspended,</l>
            <l>Nor yet when even tide was ended,</l>
            <l>Began to feel as well he might</l>
            <l>The keen demands of appetite;</l>
            <l>When looking eagerly around,</l>
            <l>He spied far off upon the ground,</l>
            <l>A something shining in the dark,</l>
            <l>And knew the glow-worm by his spark,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="327" facs="330"/>
So stooping down from hawthorn top,</l>
            <l>He thought to put him in his crop;</l>
            <l>The worm aware of his intent,</l>
            <l>Harangu'd him thus right eloquent.</l>
            <l>Did you admire my lamp, quoth he,</l>
            <l>As much as I your minstrelsy,</l>
            <l>You would abhor to do me wrong,</l>
            <l>As much as I to spoil your song,</l>
            <l>For 'twas the self-same power divine,</l>
            <l>Taught you to sing, and me to shine,</l>
            <l>That you with music, I with light,</l>
            <l>Might beautify and cheer the night.</l>
            <l>The songster heard his short oration,</l>
            <l>And warbling out his approbation,</l>
            <l>Releas'd him as my story tells,</l>
            <l>And found a supper somewhere else.</l>
            <l>Hence jarring sectaries may learn,</l>
            <l>Their real int'rest to discern:</l>
            <l>That brother should not war with brother,</l>
            <l>And worry and devour each other,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="328" facs="331"/>
But sing and shine by sweet consent,</l>
            <l>'Till life's poor transient night is spent,</l>
            <l>Respecting in each other's case</l>
            <l>The gifts of nature and of grace.</l>
            <l>Those christians best deserve the name</l>
            <l>Who studiously make peace their aim;</l>
            <l>Peace, both the duty and the prize</l>

            <l>THE pine apples in triple row,</l>
            <l>Were basking hot and all in blow,</l>
            <l>A bee of most discerning taste</l>
            <l>Perceiv'd the fragrance as he pass'd,</l>
            <l>On eager wing the spoiler came,</l>
            <l>And search'd for crannies in the frame,</l>
            <l>Urg 'd his attempt on ev'ry side,</l>

               <pb n="331" facs="334"/>
But still in vain, the frame was tight</l>
            <l>And only pervious to the light.</l>
            <l>Thus having wasted half the day,</l>
            <l>He trimmed his flight another way.</l>
            <l>Methinks, I said, in thee I find</l>
            <l>The sin and madness of mankind;</l>
            <l>To joys forbidden man aspires,</l>
            <l>Consumes his soul with vain desires;</l>
            <l>Folly the spring of his pursuit,</l>
            <l>And disappointment all the fruit.</l>
            <l>While Cynthio ogles as she passes</l>
            <l>The nymph between two chariot glasses,</l>
            <l>She is the pine apple, and he</l>
            <l>The silly unsuccessful bee.</l>
            <l>The maid who views with pensive air</l>
            <l>The show-glass fraught with glitt'ring ware,</l>
            <l>Sees watches, bracelets, rings, and lockets,</l>
            <l>But sighs at thought of empty pockets,</l>
            <l>Like thine her appetite is keen,</l>

            <l>We long for pine apples in frames,</l>
            <l>With hopeless wish one looks and lingers,</l>
            <l>One breaks the glass and cuts his fingers,</l>
            <l>But they whom truth and wisdom lead,</l>
            <l>Can gather honey from a weed.</l>

            <l>Then with a voice exceeding low,</l>
            <l>No matter if you hear or no.</l>
            <l>Alas! and is domestic strife,</l>
            <l>That forest ill of human life,</l>
            <l>A plague so little to be fear'd,</l>

            <l>The kindest and the happiest pair,</l>
            <l>Will find occasion to forbear,</l>
            <l>And something ev'ry day they live</l>
            <l>To pity, and perhaps, forgive.</l>
            <l>But if infirmities that fall</l>
            <l>In common to the lot of all,</l>
            <l>A blemish, or a sense impair'd,</l>
            <l>Are crimes so little to be spar'd,</l>
            <l>Then farewel all that must create</l>
            <l>The comfort of the wedded state,</l>

Instead of harmony, 'tis jar</l>
            <l>And tumult, and intestine war.</l>
            <l>The love that cheers life's latest stage,</l>
            <l>Proof against sickness and old age,</l>
            <l>Preserv'd by virtue from declension,</l>
            <l>Becomes not weary of attention,</l>
            <l>But lives, when that exterior grace</l>
            <l>Which first inspir'd the flame, decays.</l>
            <l>'Tis gentle, delicate and kind,</l>
            <l>To faults compassionate or blind,</l>
            <l>And will with sympathy endure</l>
            <l>Those evils it would gladly cure.</l>
            <l>But angry, coarse, and harsh expression</l>
            <l>Shows love to be a mere profession,</l>
            <l>Proves that the heart is none of his,</l>
            <l>Or soon expels him if it is.</l>

            <l>THERE was a time when Aetna's silent fire</l>
            <l>Slept unperceiv'd, the mountain yet entire,</l>
            <l>When conscious of no danger from below,</l>
            <l>She towr'd a cloud-capt pyramid of snow.</l>
            <l>No thunders shook with deep intestine sound</l>
            <l>The blooming groves that girdled her around,</l>
            <l>Her unctuous olives and her purple vines,</l>
            <l>(Unfelt the fury of those bursting mines)</l>
            <l>The peasant's hopes, and not in vain, assur'd,</l>
            <l>In peace upon her sloping sides matur'd.</l>

When on a day, like that of the last doom,</l>
            <l>A conflagration lab'ring in her womb,</l>
            <l>She teem'd and heav'd with an infernal birth,</l>
            <l>That shook the circling seas and solid earth.</l>
            <l>Dark and voluminous the vapours rise,</l>
            <l>And hang their horrors in the neighb'ring skies,</l>
            <l>While through the stygian veil that blots the day,</l>
            <l>In dazzling streaks the vivid light'nings play.</l>
            <l>But oh! what muse, and in what pow'rs of song,</l>
            <l>Can trace the torrent as it burns along?</l>
            <l>Havock and devastation in the van,</l>
            <l>It marches o'er the prostrate works of man,</l>
            <l>Vines, olives, herbage, forests disappear,</l>

            <l>Now <hi>in</hi> the water, and now <hi>out.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>'Twere better to be born a stone</l>
            <l>Of ruder shape and feeling none,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="363" facs="366"/>
Than with a tenderness like mine,</l>
            <l>And sensibilities so fine;</l>
            <l>I envy that unfeeling shrub,</l>
            <l>Fast-rooted against ev'ry rub.</l>
            <l>The plant he meant grew not far off,</l>
            <l>And felt the sneer with scorn enough,</l>
            <l>Was hurt, disgusted, mortified,</l>
            <l>And with asperity replied.</l>
            <l>When cry the botanists, and stare,</l>
            <l>Did plants call'd sensitive grow there?</l>
            <l>No matter when—a poet's muse is</l>
            <l>To make them grow just where she chuses.</l>
            <l>You shapeless nothing in a dish,</l>
            <l>You that are but almost a fish,</l>
            <l>I scorn your coarse insinuation,</l>
            <l>And have most plentiful occasion</l>
            <l>To wish myself the rock I view,</l>
            <l>Or such another dolt as you.</l>
            <l>For many a grave and learned clerk,</l>
            <l>And many a gay unletter'd spark,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="364" facs="367"/>
With curious touch examines me,</l>
            <l>If I can feel as well as he;</l>
            <l>And when I bend, retire and shrink,</l>
            <l>Says, well—'tis more than one would think—</l>
            <l>Thus life is spent, oh fie upon't!</l>
            <l>In being touch'd, and crying, don't.</l>
            <l>A poet in his evening walk,</l>
            <l>O'erheard and check'd this idle talk.</l>
            <l>And your fine sense, he said, and yours,</l>
            <l>Whatever evil it endures,</l>
            <l>Deserves not, if so soon offended,</l>
            <l>Much to be pitied or commended.</l>
            <l>Disputes though short, are far too long,</l>
            <l>Where both alike are in the wrong;</l>
            <l>Your feelings in their full amount,</l>
            <l>Are all upon your own account.</l>
            <l>You in your grotto-work inclos'd</l>
            <l>Complain of being thus expos'd,</l>
            <l>Yet nothing feel in that rough coat,</l>
            <l>Save when the knife is at your throat,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="365" facs="368"/>
Wherever driv'n by wind or tide,</l>
            <l>Exempt from every ill beside.</l>
            <l>And as for you, my Lady Squeamish,</l>
            <l>Who reckon ev'ry touch a blemish,</l>
            <l>If all the plants that can be found</l>
            <l>Embellishing the scene around,</l>
            <l>Should droop and wither where they grow,</l>
            <l>You would not feel at all, not you.</l>
            <l>The noblest minds their virtue prove</l>
            <l>By pity, sympathy, and love,</l>
            <l>These, these are feelings truly fine,</l>
            <l>And prove their owner half divine.</l>
            <l>His censure reach'd them as he dealt it,</l>
            <l>And each by shrinking shew'd he felt it.</l>
