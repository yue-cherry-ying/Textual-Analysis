         <p>They no sooner enter'd the Room, but all of them show'd in their Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haviour some Suspicion of each o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther; some turning away their Heads with an Air of Contempt; others squinting with a Leer that show'd at once Fear and Indignation, each with a haggard abstracted Mien, the lively Picture of <hi>Scorn, Solitude,</hi> and <hi>short Commons.</hi> So when a Keeper feeds his hungry Charge, of Vul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tures, Panthers, and of <hi>Lybian</hi> Leo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pards, each eyes his Fellow with a fiery Glare: High hung, the bloody Liver tempts their Maw.

                  <hi>Resolv'd,</hi> That above all, some effectual Ways and Means be found to encrease the Joint Stock of the Reputation of this Society, which at present is exceedingly low, and to give their Works the greater Currency; whether by raising the Denomination of the said Works by counterfeit Title Pages, or mixing a greater Quantity of the fine Me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tal of other Authors, with the Al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>loy of this Society.</item>

         <p>These Resolutions being taken, the Assembly was ready to break up, but they took so near a-part in Mr. <hi>Curll</hi>'s Afflictions, that none of them could leave him without gi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ving some Advice to re-instate him in his Health.</p>
         <p>Mr. <hi>Gildon</hi> was of Opinion, That in order to drive a <hi>Pope</hi> out of his <hi>Belly,</hi> he should get the Mummy of some deceas'd Moderator of the General Assembly in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be taken inwardly as an effectual Anti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dote against Antichrist; but Mr. <hi>Oldmixon</hi> did conceive, that the <hi>Li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver</hi> of the Person who administred
<pb n="20" facs="18"/>
the Poison, boil'd in Broth, would be a more certain Cure.</p>
         <p>While the Company were expe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cting the Thanks of Mr. <hi>Curll,</hi> for these Demonstrations of their Zeal, a whole Pile of <hi>Essays</hi> on a sudden fell on his Head; the Shock of which in an Instant brought back his Dili<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rium. He immediately rose up, o<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver-turn'd the Close-stool, and beshit the <hi>Essays</hi> (which may probably oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>casion a <hi>second Edition</hi>) then without putting up his Breeches, in a most furious Tone, he thus broke out to his Books, which his distemper'd Imagination represented to him as alive, coming down from their Shelves, fluttering their Leaves, and flapping their Covers at him.</p>

         <p>Having said this, and at the same Time recollecting that his own was yet unwiped, he abated of his Fury, and with great Gravity, apply'd to that Function the unfinish'd Sheets of the Conduct of the E<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters" rend="content:_+">
