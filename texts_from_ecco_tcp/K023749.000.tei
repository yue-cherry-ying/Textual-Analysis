            <hi>The Vision,</hi> A POEM. Being an ANSWER to the Lord <hi>Beilhaven</hi>'s SPEECH.</head>
         <byline>By a Person of Quality.</byline>
         <l>COme hither ye Dreamers of Dreams,</l>
         <l>Ye Soothsayers, Vizards and Witches,</l>
         <l>That puzzle the World with hard Names,</l>
         <l>And without any meaning make Speeches:</l>
         <l>Here's a Lord in the North,</l>
         <l>Near <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Frith;</l>
         <l>Tho little has been said of his Name or his Worth;</l>
         <l>He's seen such a Vision, no Mortal can reach it,</l>
         <l>I challenge the Clan of <hi>Egyptians</hi> to match it.</l>
         <l>And first, in the dark it was told him,</l>
         <l>Which might very well appall us,</l>
         <l>That the World was a fighting of old time,</l>
         <l>From <hi>Nimrod</hi> to <hi>Sardanapalus</hi>;</l>
         <l>That it's all Revelation,</l>
         <l>You may pawn your Salvation,</l>
         <l>For the Devil a History gives the relation,</l>
         <l>But it's all in the Deeps, no Mortal can reach it,</l>
         <l>We may challenge the Clan of <hi>Egyptians</hi> to match it,</l>
         <l>
            <pb n="2" facs="2"/>Then <hi>Scotland</hi> comes next on the Stage,</l>
         <l>For in Visions you must not be nice,</l>
         <l>And a skip of three thousand Years age,</l>
         <l>Is nothing where Men are Concise;</l>
         <l>I name it the rather</l>
         <l>Because you may gather,</l>
         <l>How that every Man is the Son of his Father,</l>
         <l>A Truth for the future no Mortal can doubt,</l>
         <l>Whatever they might, before he found it out.</l>
         <l>But heark, now the Wonders begin,</l>
         <l>And take care least the Vision should fright ye;</l>
         <l>For if it should make you unclean,</l>
         <l>He has not told how he would dight ye.</l>
         <l>First the National Church,</l>
         <l>Left quite in the Lurch,</l>
         <l>Was a truckling down to the Steeple and Porch,</l>
         <l>But what is still worse, she's afraid of her Friends,</l>
         <l>So Fevers make frantick Men-hasten their Ends.</l>
         <l>Was ever such Conjuring known,</l>
         <l>Or the Church so claw'd by the Steeple,</l>
         <l>Non-jurors are her Champions grown,</l>
         <l>And the Prelatists vote for the People.</l>
         <l>Protesters appear</l>
         <l>And the <hi>Jacques</hi> they adhere,</l>
         <l>And Anti-christ votes the true Church to secure,</l>
         <l>O <hi>Scotland!</hi> Was ever such Conjuring known,</l>
         <l>That the Mitre supports the same Church pull'd her down.</l>
         <l>Then the Nation in Sack-cloth appear'd,</l>
         <l>And the Visionest sadly bewail'd her,</l>
         <l>For Mischiefs the like were ne'er heard,</l>
         <l>Her Priv'lege of Slavery fail'd her.</l>
         <l>For the Mob he complain'd</l>
         <l>That being born Chain'd,</l>
         <l>Blest Bondage was lost, and damn'd Freedom remain'd,</l>
         <l>So with Liberty scar'd, and afraid to grow Rich;</l>
         <l>They su'd for Repentance in a dolorous Speech.</l>
         <l>And first our Amazement 'll increase.</l>
         <l>The Souldiers disbanded appear,</l>
         <l>
            <pb n="3" facs="3"/>Poor Drudges put Prentices to Peace,</l>
         <l>For want of the Blessings of War;</l>
         <l>For tho it's in the Book,</l>
         <l>Yet the Scripture mistook,</l>
         <l>When it told us, our Swords should to Plow-shares be broke:</l>
         <l>It might be long ago a Happiness there,</l>
         <l>But it's plain by the Vision it's otherwise here.</l>
         <l>The Merchants are next on the Stage;</l>
         <l>The Enchantment has circl'd them in;</l>
         <l>For fear they in Wealth should engage,</l>
         <l>They resolve they'll never begin</l>
         <l>The Burghs are afraid</l>
         <l>They shall have too much Trade,</l>
         <l>And the Nation to Plenty be safely betray'd,</l>
         <l>So they gravely Address, that to keep them secure,</l>
         <l>As you find them, you leave them, both Foolish and Poor.</l>
         <l>The next is indeed a sad Sight,</l>
         <l>The like on't has rarely been known,</l>
         <l>'Twill ruin the Country quite,</l>
         <l>It will never recover its own;</l>
         <l>The Plow Man's undone,</l>
         <l>From Father to Son;</l>
         <l>For a terrible draw-back on Corn will come on,</l>
         <l>In plenty they'll Ship it, be there never so much;</l>
         <l>And to load us with Money, sell all to the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
         </l>
         <l>O ye Virgins! (both Sexes) draw near,</l>
         <l>And tho it's but in Spectrum showen,</l>
         <l>In sympathy lend us a Tear,</l>
         <l>As the Case may sometime be your own;</l>
         <l>The Ladies Condition</l>
         <l>Deserves your Compassion;</l>
         <l>'Tis very severe to make Beauty petition:</l>
         <l>Yet here his strange Tragedies turn'd to a Jigg,</l>
         <l>That the Men want Employments, yet the Ladies shou'd Beg.</l>
         <l>Then a Crew of old Sailers were brought,</l>
         <l>At their true Benefactors to Rail;</l>
         <l>Their Freight for strange Nations was bought,</l>
         <l>And this will cut off the Entail;</l>
         <l>
            <pb n="4" facs="4"/>They thought it was hard</l>
         <l>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships to discard,</l>
         <l>And to force the poor <hi>Scots</hi> their own Trade to regard,</l>
         <l>For Liberty claims a Freedom to ill,</l>
         <l>And it's hard to get Money against a Man's Will</l>
         <l>And now the Exorcist in turn</l>
         <l>Like a Ghost in a Circle arises,</l>
         <l>Without any Tears he can mourn.</l>
         <l>He is Extasies all and Surprises.</l>
         <l>But what's wildest of all,</l>
         <l>And does strangely appall,</l>
         <l>Two hours he talk'd, and said nothing at all:</l>
         <l>But let drop a few hypocritical Tears,</l>
         <l>So the Crocodale weeps on the Carcase she tears;</l>
         <l>Then in strange Hebrew words he bewail'd ye,</l>
         <l>Tho the Jest was by few understood,</l>
         <l>
            <hi>Tu quoque mi fili Squadrone,</hi>
         </l>
         <l>Or in Scots, <hi>the Parliament</hi>'s <hi>wood,</hi>
         </l>
         <l>So <hi>Coesar</hi> they say,</l>
         <l>Cry'd out in a fray,</l>
         <l>When they kill'd him, because he'd his Country betray,</l>
         <l>For <hi>Brutus</hi> his Country's Liberty sought,</l>
         <l>Was a Simily e're-soon happily brought?</l>
         <l>Thus he rummag'd the Histories old,</l>
         <l>Like the Tale of the Bear, and the Fiddle;</l>
         <l>For as 'twas unluckily told,</l>
         <l>So the Story broke off in the middle.</l>
         <l>Some said my Lord cry'd,</l>
         <l>Tho others deny'd;</l>
         <l>Which Matter of Moment it's hard to decide,</l>
         <l>But here's a more difficult Matter remains,</l>
         <l>To tell if he shew'd us less Manners or Brains.</l>
