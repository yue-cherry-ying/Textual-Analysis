            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is matter of great doubt whether any dedicatory address was ever freer from taint of flattery, than the present; if we pronounce you the best illustrator of, and the best <hi>living comment</hi> on, SHAKESPEARE, that ever has ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>peared, or possibly ever will grace the British stage, it is merely echoing the public voice, and concurring with that unparalleled unanimity of praise, which, during so long a course of years, hath attended your incomparable merit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="3"/>This compact edition of SHAKE<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>SPEARE is offered you as a grateful, tho' small, return, for the infinite pleasure, and extensive information, derived from your exquisite perfor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mance, and judicious remarks, by,</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
               <signed>Your most obedient humble servants, THE EDITORS.</signed>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>SHAKESPEARE's admirers, even the enthusiastic ones, who worship him as <hi>the god of their idolatry,</hi> have never scru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pled to admit that his most regular pieces produce some scenes and passages, highly derogatory to his incomparable general me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rit; he frequently trifles, is now and then obscure, and, sometimes, to gratify a vitiated age, indelicate: but can any degree of cri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tical taste wish the preservation of dark spots, because they have grown upon dramatic sun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shine? is not the corrective hand frequently proved to be the kindest? critics, like pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rents, should neither spare the rod, nor use it wantonly.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt but all our author's faults may justly be attributed to the loose, quibbling, licentious taste of his time; he, no doubt, upon many occasions, wrote wildly, merely to gratify the public; as DRYDEN wrote bombastically, and CON<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>GREVE obscenely, to indulge the humour, and engage the favour of their audiences: no man can suppose that the former consi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dered his rhiming dialogues as marks of sublimity, nor that the latter imagined his
<pb n="6" facs="5"/>
               <hi>double entendres</hi> were wit; one wanted money, the other fame; for which, pompous sounds and gross ideas, were then popular baits; consequently, chaste criticism and delicacy were without scruple, sacrificed to their several views.</p>
            <p>Our author did not go quite so far, but very frequently preserved himself free from taint, reining his fiery PEGASUS with an able masterly hand; why then should not the noble monuments he has left us, of unri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>valled ability, be restored to due proportion and natural lustre, by sweeping off those cobwebs, and that dust of depraved opinion, which SHAKESPEARE was unfortunately forced to throw on them; forced, we say, for it is no strain of imagination, to suppose that the Goths and Vandals of criticism, who frequented the theatre, in his days, would, like those who over-ran the <hi>Roman</hi> empire, have destroyed and consigned to bar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>barous oblivion, the sublime beauties which they could not relish; and it is matter of great question with us, whether the fool, in <hi>King Lear,</hi> was not a more general fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vourite, than the old monarch himself.</p>
            <p>The above considerations first started the idea, and induced the undertaking, of this edition; and as the THEATRES, especially
<pb n="7" facs="6"/>
of late, have been generally right in their omissions, of this author particularly, we have printed our <hi>text</hi> after their regulations; and from this part of our design, an evident use will arise; that those who take books to the THEATRE, will not be so puzzled them<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves to accompany the speaker; nor so apt to condemn performers of being imperfect, when they pass over what is designedly omit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted. Upon this point, however, it is to be observed, that the difference of power, of voice and execution, between different per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formers, may make one erase more than ano<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther; nevertheless we come so near the mark of all, that scarce any perplexity can arise, in tracing them; besides we would hope, that a reasonable standard being thus laid down, professors of the drama will not be so forward, as capriciously and arbitrarily to deviate from it; it is commendable to consult the extent of expression, but thro' idleness to retrench what is beautiful and necessary, or through vanity to retain what is heavy and unessential to action, we deem an affront to the public, and a disgrace to the performer.</p>
            <p>As an author, replete with spirited ideas, and a full flow of language, especially one possessing <hi>a muse of fire,</hi> cannot stop exactly where stage utterance and public attention
<pb n="8" facs="7"/>
require; some passages, of great merit for the closet, are never spoken; such, though omitted in the text, we have carefully pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>served in the notes.</p>
            <p>And now, being upon this part of our subject, we hold ourselves bound in justice and gratitude to Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> to mention a delicate fear, which he suggested, when we first solicited his sanction and assistance. This fear was, lest the prunings, transpositions, or other alterations, which, in his province as a manager he had often found necessary to make, or adopt, with regard to the text, for the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venience of representation, or accommoda<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion to the powers and capacities of his per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formers, might be misconstrued into a cri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tical presumption of offering to the literati a reformed and more correct edition of our author's works; this being by no means his intention, we hope it will not become liable to such an unmerited misconstruction. In justification of ourselves also, we take this opportunity of declaring, that to expect any thing more of this work, than as <hi>a com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>panion to the theatre,</hi> is to mistake the pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose of the editors.</p>
            <p>Having been long convinced that multi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plying conjectural verbal criticisms, tends rather to perplex, than inform readers; we
<pb n="9" facs="8"/>
have given those readings which to us ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pear most consonant to our author's manner and meaning, without obtruding one capri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cious opinion on another.</p>
            <p>We have furnished an explanation of technical and obsolete terms; pointed out the leading beauties, as they occur, without descanting so much as to anticipate the rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der's conception and investigation; we have shewn, with a becoming impartiality, what ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pear to us to be blemishes and imperfections: the requisites for representing every character of importance are defined, and the mode of performance essential for scenes pecu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liarly capital, is clearly pointed out.</p>
            <p>We have earnestly consulted correctness, neatness, ornament, utility, and cheapness of price; we have avoided all ostentation of criticism, compacting our notes as much as possible; in regard whereof, it may be justly said, that we could have enlarged the number, and extended the phraseology, with much less trouble, than it cost us to give them their present form; it has been our peculiar endeavour to render what we call the essence of SHAKESPEARE, more in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>structive and intelligible; especially to the ladies and to youth; glaring indecencies be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing removed, and intricate passages explain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed;
<pb n="10" facs="9"/>
and lastly, we have striven to supply plainer ideas of criticism, both in public and private, than we have hitherto met with.</p>
            <p>A general view of each play is given, by way of introduction.</p>
            <p>Though this is not an edition meant for the profoundly learned, nor the deeply studious, who love to find out, and chace their own critical game; yet we flatter our<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves both parties may perceive fresh ideas started for speculation and reflection.</p>

         <head>ESSAY ON ORATORY.</head>
         <p>THOUGH it is not strictly within the limits of our plan, to range at large over the ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tensive field of oratorical correctness, fancy and excellence, as it respects the pulpit, senate, and bar; yet it is hoped we shall so far touch on the essentials of them all, as to give hints, which may prove useful to each of the three degrees.</p>
         <p>If we say that an orator, like a poet, to excel, should be born such, it will be no strained asser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion; and if we add that he must be more indebted to nature, than a son of the muses, it will be easily admitted. Cultivated imagination, regulated by judgment, constitutes one; who, totally void of external requisites, may shine from his closet, tho' ever so deformed in figure, rude in features, weak in voice, or blemish'd in appearance.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="12" facs="11"/>The other, though he may, by peculiar excel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lence of delivery, and the help of a feeling sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject well treated on, be able to impress an audience, with little more than a good voice; yet experience powerfully convinces us that a graceful person, re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spectable marking features, expressive eyes, and ornamental gesture, are of the utmost utility: it is no argument to say, that a man, as in the case of Sir <hi>John Fielding,</hi> tho' the visual gates of sympa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thy be shut, may show strong marks of oratorical merit; for the question naturally follows, would he not be much more powerful in expression, if the indexes of thought enjoyed their natural and proper vigour, especially where particular feelings are to be excited?</p>
         <p>It is too common for ignorance and avarice, to misapply the talents of youth, especially in this point of view; many are destined for, and brought up to the most serious, the most important con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerns of life, wherein public speaking is required, who labour under glaring defects and imbecilities of expression; hence so many drowsy, irksome preachers, so many senatorical cyphers; and such a number of imperfect pleaders: this parental blunder is much the same as breeding a purblind boy to watchmaking, or one hard of hearing to music.</p>
         <p>Supposing a person qualified by nature, let us see how far art may be called in. The complete orator must have a general and intimate knowledge of himself, the world and mankind; a clear con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ception of the passions and affections of those he is to instruct and persuade; a perfect acquaintance with the various distinctions of virtue and vice; he should be critically intimate with all the beau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties and blemishes of the ancient writers; he should
<pb n="13" facs="12"/>
be an historian and a logician; possessing a correct idea of, and taste for, the liberal arts; if a com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>petent knowledge of the mechanical ones is added, so much the better; he should possess a quick con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ception, and a retentive memory; he should be able to break thro', with ease, the cobwebs of so<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phistry, and, above all, enjoy that grand ingre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dient recommended by CICERO, social philosophy.</p>
         <p>He should be master of all the arguments, for and against his subject; in short, to sum up all with the great <hi>Roman</hi> orator's own words,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"he should be furnished with logical acuteness, phi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>losophical wisdom, and poetical imagination, embellished with the most polished elocution and gesture of the stage."</q>
         </p>
         <p>To expatiate upon the obvious advantages de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riveable from each of the above qualifications re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quired to complete this very comprehensive cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racter we are considering, would be to spin out a needless length of explanation; which could an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swer no end, but anticipating the reader's reflec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tive investigation; wherefore we shall quit this point, with observing, that when so many requi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sites, both internal and external are necessary, it is no wonder that a complete orator is so very scarce a character.</p>
         <p>Declaimers, who may be justly stiled the pageants of oratory, possess the flowery, but not the argu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mentative, part; they appeal boldly to fancy and the passions, but cautiously shun rational inquisi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion; shew and plausibility completely <hi>set</hi> up one of this dangerous kind of public speakers, who oftener make proselytes among the weak and igno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rant, than sound orators do; as they are mostly pleasing, tho' seldom instructive. Bishop <hi>Sprat,</hi> speaking of them, in his history of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi>
            <pb n="14" facs="13"/>
emphatically says,
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"of all the studies of men, no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing can be sooner obtained, than a vicious abundance of phrase; the trick of metaphors, and a volubility of tongue."</q>
         </p>
         <p>Having come thus far, the three celebrated ora<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tors of antiquity seem to fall in the way; DEMOS<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>THENES, ISOCRATES and CICERO; the first spoke from the heart, the second from the head; the first was animated by his subject and powerfully enforced it; the second decked it profusely with rhetorical flowers; one flashed conviction, by ir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>resistable imagery; the other amused imagination, with fantastical allusions: of ISOCRATES we may say, his eloquence resembled a pleasant, but shal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low, stream, which tickles the ear with an agree<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able murmuring: DEMOSTHENES a deep majestic current, that in its course thunders on attention, and bears down all opposition: ISOCRATES pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sesses ease and elegance, DEMOSTHENES power and perswasion; CICERO who rises far above the former, does not in our idea come up to the latter; he is however a very masterly mixture of both, and therefore more likely to obtain general admi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ration, than either of his predecessors.</p>
         <p>Oratory is well defined <hi>the exercise of eloquence</hi>; eloquence the <hi>fluency of speech</hi>; and rhetoric the <hi>guide of both.</hi> It is odd that these three terms should frequently be used as synonimous, when they so essentially differ.</p>
         <p>Oratorical composition should be founded on a progressive unity of parts, but not like some of our sermons, which are disgraced with insipid metho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dical formality commonly stiled <hi>heads</hi>; it should enter modestly upon, warm into the subject, and, if required, kindle to fire, when the audience are ready to receive heated impressions; an impas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sioned
<pb n="15" facs="14"/>
exordium generally produces a cold conclu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion; and that piece, which endeavours to catch attention too suddenly, will either not catch it at all, or be obliged soon to let it slip.</p>
         <p>FENELON, ARCHBISHOP OF CAMBRAY, de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scribing the Beauties of Eloquence, speaks to the following effect:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Of what use can any ornament be, that does not tend to prove, to paint, or to affect? those ornaments, which only please, are false beauties; those which please and persuade, solid ones; the just and natural emotions of an orator have much grace and beauty in them; his correct and spirited painting charms us; all the essential parts of eloquencce tend to please; but merely pleasing is not the most important aim; ideas and expressions, which only tickle the ear, may be deemed quaint turns; all graces of style, which serve to invigorate persuasion, are to be wish'd for; but all witty, punning conceits, all quibbling upon words, all strained metaphors, all forced glaring imagery, and all luxurance of idea, which only serve to flash and glitter upon fancy, disgrace sound oratory."</q>
         </p>
         <p>In public speaking, as well as in poetry and painting, art should be carefully concealed: where perceptible, it has a coarse and mean aspect. The orator should so intirely possess his audience of the subject, as to make them forget the speaker.</p>
         <p>From the affecting exclamation of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Cicero,</hi> and a dilation of it, we per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceive how expression strengthens, or enervates, a subject:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Wretched man that I am! whither shall I turn myself? where can I go? to the Capitol? it swims with my brother's blood! shall I go to to my own house? there to see my wretched mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther dissolved in tears, and overwhelmed with
<pb n="16" facs="15"/>
sorrow?"</q>
This is a beautiful, bold, and affect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing picture of perplexed grief: mark how faded the tints of originality appear in the following faint copy:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"I know not where to go, nor whi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther I shall turn myself, amidst my misfor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tunes—the Capitol is the place where my bro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther's blood was shed; and at home I shall find my unhappy mother lamenting her sad con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dition."</q>
With very narrow comprehension and very dull feelings we may readily perceive the fall<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing off, in this languid extension and variation of phrase.</p>
         <p>We shall offer an instance of the turgid and chaste, in the following comparative contrast. Suppose a person addressing an <hi>English</hi> audience, on a pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sumed decay of <hi>English</hi> liberty, should thus de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>claim;
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"Most renowned <hi>Britons</hi>—in the magna<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nimous volume of Time we may read—even purblind eyes may see the glaring type, that there was a period, when liberty, diaphanous as sun-beams at noon, exhilarated this oceanic isle; when like the bird of <hi>Jove</hi> it soar'd aloft, and gazed with pleasure on the face of day; now it faintly glimmers, like the fog-wrapped moon, and our glorious eagle is become a bird of night."</q>
         </p>
         <p>Now let us see how the same subject may be treated, in opposition to this over-charged, bloated, tabernacle harangue; which, delivered in the <hi>Moorfield</hi> manner, must prove a laughable mor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sel of mirth, to divert common sense, and astonish ignorance.</p>
         <p>
            <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Fellow citizens, there was a time, when li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berty diffused its blessings thro' this once happy isle; when its value was known, and its worth revered; when, like the sun, it was a common
<pb n="17" facs="16"/>
comforter; the parent of pleasure, ease, and security: now corruption and our own depra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vity have brought it to so enfeebled and preca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rious a state, that every real friend of his coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try must tremble, as I do, at the painful idea of its speedy and inevitable dissolution."</q>
         </p>
         <p>If eloquence (a very dangerous weapon in the hands of ill-designing men) is used to any other purposes than the following, we may consider it as in a censurable state of perversion.</p>
         <p>It should enforce the clearest proof of any use<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful truth, with such interesting motives as may af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect the hearers, and work their passions to virtu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous purposes; to raise indignation against ingrati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tude; horror against cruelty; detestation against vice; abhorrence against slavery; compassion for misery; love for virtue; reverence for religion; obedience to superiors; and benevolence to all. Thus employed, eloquence appears in its full force and beauty: mere harangues seldom fail to catch the ear, but rarely touch the heart, and as seldom inform the head.</p>
         <p>It is necessary that an orator should call the pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sions to his aid; but then he should be very cau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tious not to impose on, or assail, them too violent<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly: the one is cruel, the other impolitic. He should be clear in his ideas, and concise in his ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pression: he should perfectly understand just ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rangement of matter, and the proper climax of ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gument: he should be thoroughly possessed of every principle and part of his subject: he should pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vide a sufficient number of apposite, affecting figures. Thus prepared, he must speak, and ef<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fectually, from an untrammel'd imagination.</p>
         <p>The following passages, from Bishop <hi>Burnet</hi>'s discourse on the Pastoral Care, seems well calculated
<pb n="18" facs="17"/>
for the improvement of Lay, as well as Pulpit, speakers.
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"The extempore orator should fre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quently converse with himself, to let his thoughts flow freely from him; especially when he feels an edge and heat upon his mind; for then hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>py expressions will spontaneously come to his mouth. He must also write essays on all kinds of subjects; for, by writing, he will bring him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self to a facility and correctness of thinking and speaking: and thus, by close application for two or three years, a man may render himself such a master this way, that he can never be sur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prized; nor will new thoughts ever dry up up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on him. If, in his meditations, happy thoughts and noble pathetic expressions offer themselves, he must not lose, but write them down."</q>
         </p>
         <p>We perfectly agree with the right reverend Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thor, that much oratorical merit may be derived from frequent, well-regulated soliloquies, and essay-writing; and are induced to offer a few more of his thoughts, though not in the exact words nor confined light wherein he has proposed them.</p>
         <p>One most essential point is, that an orator should have a due and deep sense of the truth and utility of his subject: he must have a life and glow in his thoughts, with relation to it: he should very sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sibly feel in himself those things which he explains and recommends to others: he should speak as if what he uttered came from the heart: the orator, unless he really is, or seems to be, in earnest, will never make any material impression. There is a degree of authority, even in the simplest matters that can be treated of, if they appear genuine, while the most important points fall into neglect, when conveyed through the cold vehicle of languid expression.</p>

               <p>Since you urge the point, I acknowledge it: my compositions are infinitely more beautified, than thine.

I exhi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bit the same thing under twenty different shapes: when people heard my orations, they could not help admiring my parts, nor being surprized at my art: they were constantly shouting, and interrupting me with vehemence of applause.

               <speaker>DEMOSTHENES.</speaker>
               <p>Thy observations on both, are true; but the inference drawn from them, is thy mistake. Thou took'st up the audience with thyself; I engaged it only with the affairs I spoke upon. People admired thee; I was forgot by the au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ditors; who saw nothing but the course I wish'd them to take. Thou didst entertain with flashes of wit: I struck down with bolts of thunder. Thou madest men say, How finely he speaks! I made them exclaim, Come, let us take the field against <hi>Philip!</hi> They praised thee: they were too much dispossessed of themselves, to praise me. Thy harangues came forth adorned; none ever discovered in me any ornament: there was nothing in my pieces, but precise, strong, clear argument; and thence impulses like light<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ning, which nothing could resist. Thou wert a perfect orator, when thou wert like me—simple, grave, austere, without apparent art; in a word, when thou wert <hi>Demosthenical:</hi> but when wit, turn, and art shone in thy dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>courses,

then wert mere <hi>Cicero</hi>; departing so far from perfection, as thou departedst from my character.</p>

         <p>Mr. RAPIN, in his Reflections upon Eloquence, observes, that there are two extremes, which should be equally and carefully avoided; the frigid style, and the boyish. The former renders discourses dry and insipid, by a languid flatness of expression; the latter ungrateful and shocking, by a turgid loftiness, and affected amplification. Those who use the frigid style, call in pompous expressions, when the subject requires plain ones; and they who affect the boyish one, employ low expressions in the loftiest themes. The frigid style properly includes all such expressions as are too strong, or too sparkling, strained metaphors, and frequent witticisms: the boyish style comprehends strokes of humour, and quaint conceits, upon serious subjects; loose and heavy repetitions, in that part of an oration which ought to be close and concise; too violent exaggerations, and too labo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rious figures.</p>

            <pb n="22" facs="21"/>Stage <hi>delivery</hi> (for theatrical expression cannot be stiled <hi>oratory</hi>) including more variety, and more force of passion, is consequently more diffi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cult. It requires the finest, and most significant feelings, in the performer, to create, by sympathy, proper sensations in the audience.</p>
         <p>That noble and almost peculiar sense of human nature, Sympathy, makes us not only share in the distress of a fellow creature, but also pity the miserable brute: it varies shapes and strength, ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cording to the objects and circumstances which occur. There are two principal degrees; sympa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thy of compulsion and sympathy of election: the first is, when irresistable motives arrest the heart; the second, when it becomes interested, by choice. Compulsive sympathy instructs us to sigh with successless love; to kindle with real or well painted rage; to weep with grief; and to mourn for virtue in distress: elective sympathy is when we make choice of objects in different situations, and be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>come, without any personal knowledge or imme<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diate concern, anxious for their success: in cases of competition, whether of a pleasurable or of a serious nature, man cannot remain a spectator to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tally indifferent; he must assist one side or the other, with a sympathetic wish: in the choice he is free; yet that choice is frequently so capricious, that no firm reason can be offered, why it becomes fixed.</p>
         <p>Imagination is the vehicle which conveys sym<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pathy to, and draws it meliorated from, the heart: that which the Theatre raises, is produced by the bold painting of the Poet's pen, aided by the na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tural and forcible talents of a good Actor; who is, in every sentence, an illustrative comment upon his author's idea.</p>
         <p>
            <pb n="23" facs="22"/>This is that kind of sympathy, which the inge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nious Dr. SMITH, in his Theory of Moral Senti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments, describes to arise from the view of emotions in another person: the passions may be transfused from one person to another, instantaneously, and antecedent to any knowledge of what excited them in the person principally concerned. Grief and Joy, strongly expressed in the look and gestures of any one, exclusive of voice, at once affect the specta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tor with some degree of a like painful or agreeable emotion: a smiling face is to every one who sees it a cheerful object; as a sorrowful countenance, on the other hand, is a melancholy one.</p>
         <p>What the ingenious Professor says of mankind at large, may be brought to the point we have im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mediately in view. Every faculty in one man, when he judges of propriety, is the measure by which he decides upon the like faculty in another: I judge of your sight, by my sight; of your ear, by my ear; of your reason, by my reason; of your re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sentment, by my resentment; of your love, by my love: I neither have nor can have any other way of judging, about them. This position granted, we are not to wonder at the endless variety of, and frequent absurd critical opinions upon, the <hi>real</hi> and <hi>mimic</hi> stages of life.</p>
         <p>If an actor creates sympathy (which to do should be his foremost aim) he will command attention: if not, vain are the best requisites, and all the ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ventitious aids of theatrical decoration.</p>

            <hi>For what follows we have been obliged to a pam<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phlet, written by Mr.</hi> GENTLEMAN<hi>, some few years since.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>READING and DECLAMATION consist of <hi>em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phasis, climax, modulation, pauses, breaks, transi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions, tones, cadences,</hi> and <hi>gesture.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>EMPHASIS may be divided into two branches, <hi>explanatory</hi> and <hi>expressive:</hi> by the first is meant that stress of utterance, which presents more clear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly to conception the meaning of what we deliver; as for example:—<q rend="inline">"A <hi>popular</hi> man is, in <hi>truth,</hi> no better than a <hi>prostitute</hi> to <hi>common fame,</hi> and to the <hi>people:</hi> he lies down to <hi>every</hi> one he meets, for the <hi>hire</hi> of <hi>praise,</hi> and his <hi>humility</hi> is only a <hi>disguised ambition.</hi>"</q>—By marking the preceding passage <hi>so,</hi> the meaning strikes immediately, with full force; whereas, if the stress was laid upon other words, or if the whole was uttered with <hi>monotony</hi> (a sameness of tone) the sense would be confused; and to a hearer, whose apprehension was not very quick, perhaps quite unintelligible.—In cases where the sense is doubtful, proper <hi>emphasis</hi> is indispensably necessary; for instance: "Did the Englishman deserve to die?—If I lay the stress upon <hi>did,</hi> then it marks a question arising from surprise; if <hi>Englishman</hi> is distinguished, then it im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plies that <hi>others</hi> were concerned, and that I would know <hi>his</hi> case <hi>particularly.</hi>—If <hi>die</hi> is marked, then it appears that I <hi>admit guilt,</hi> but want to know if his crime was of such a nature as to deserve <hi>capital</hi> punishment.</p>
         <p>
            <hi>Expressive emphasis</hi> is that which we use to ren<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der a passage, whose meaning is obvious, more for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cible;

         <p>By laying the <hi>emphasis</hi> on <hi>spiry,</hi> in the first line, the peculiar form of the trees mentioned is ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plained; whereas, had the stress been laid upon <hi>firs,</hi> it would leave us at liberty to think upon <hi>oaks, elms,</hi> &amp;c. spiry too.—The word <hi>arise</hi> is marked, as being the purport of a command; and though, in general, the voice falls, at the end of a line, yet, in this case, the meaning re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quires it should be raised, but not too high, nor abruptly.</p>
         <p>In the second line, <hi>vig'rous</hi> is marked as a pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perty of the cedar: indeed all <hi>epithets,</hi> whether
<pb n="26" facs="25"/>
they precede or follow, require <hi>emphasis.—Pierce</hi> is noted as painting a quickness and boldness of vegetation, while the imagination is raised to a more than ordinary height, by particularising <hi>skies.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>In the third line, <hi>chill</hi> is distinguished as a cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racteristic quality of the climate of Lebanon.</p>
         <p>
            <hi>Fearless,</hi> in the fourth line, is pointed out as an extraordinary attribute of a bird; and <hi>conflicting storms</hi> are emphatical, as a proof of that attribute; enlarging the idea much more than the simple word <hi>fearless,</hi> unassisted, would have done.</p>
         <p>In the fifth line, <hi>tow'ring</hi> is distinguished as an <hi>epithet</hi>; and <hi>cradle,</hi> which happily describes the <hi>stork</hi>'s nest in that rocking situation, is pointed out as the motive of the bird's resolution.</p>
         <p>In the last line, <hi>high</hi> is marked as a material cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstance of the imagery, and <hi>sounding</hi> not only as an <hi>epithet,</hi> but also as referring to its turbulent situation among whistling or roaring gales.</p>
         <p>I have chosen the above stanza from the Psalms, as picturesque poetry rests more upon <hi>emphasis,</hi> than any other species of writing; and I have been so minute in the explanation of it, not only that my meaning might be understood, as to this branch of expression, but likewise to show that <hi>emphasis</hi> should be founded on reason, not laid merely for a jingle, or variation of sound.—Having thus marked and explained one stanza, I shall propose two more for the exercise of the student, without any marks of distinction.</p>

         <p>Another reason against making the Bible an early book among learners, is the frequency of periods, and peculiarity of style, in which it differs widely from most other compositions. It is not rare to find many persons, who, by laboriously conning over the chapters, can stumble their way pretty tolerably through any part of it; yet put them to any other book, you shall find them lamentably hampered, and frequently at an absolute stand.</p>
         <p>But to return more particularly to my subject.—As no absolute rules can be laid down for <hi>emphasis,</hi> in general, we must be content with remarks upon particular cases; such as, that opposition, or <hi>anti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thesis,</hi> requires an <hi>emphasis</hi> upon each of the op<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posed words; and that most monosyllables, begin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ning a question, must be strongly marked: as, <hi>Why</hi> did he so? <hi>What</hi> can he mean? <hi>How</hi> did she look? In compound words, that are opposed to others, the <hi>emphasis,</hi> or rather <hi>accent,</hi> properly falls on the distinguishing syllables: for instance, The <hi>virtuous</hi> are <hi>modest</hi>—the <hi>vicious immodest</hi>—the <hi>righteous</hi> are <hi>blessed</hi>—the <hi>unrighteous</hi> are <hi>mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serable.</hi>—Here I have opposed simple to simple, and compound to compound; were the words <hi>im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>modest</hi> and <hi>unrighteous</hi> to be pronounced without opposition, the accent would fall upon the <hi>second</hi> syllable, instead of the <hi>first.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>
            <pb n="29" facs="28"/>In <hi>explanatory emphases</hi> the very same words are differently marked, according to the writer's de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sign: as, What did my master say? If I lay the stress upon <hi>what,</hi> it is a general interrogation; if I place it upon <hi>my,</hi> it implies that other masters were concerned; if <hi>master</hi> is distinguished, it notes that there were other persons; and if the <hi>emphasis</hi> lies boldest upon <hi>say,</hi> it shows I want to know his particular words.</p>
         <p>Both the cause and the effect in any sentence require an <hi>emphasis.</hi>—Example: To <hi>live</hi> WELL, is to <hi>die</hi> HAPPY—only to be GOOD, is to be GREAT—GUILT is the source of SORROW.</p>
         <p>CLIMAX is that progressive force and exaltation of expression, which more powerfully impresses each subject on the mind; and is not only of in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dispensible use, but also highly ornamental. In the execution of this, there is much nicety, as the rise, in most cases, should be gradual, always har<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monious, and upon many occasions very forcible.—To illustrate the matter, I shall offer several ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>amples of different degrees of <hi>climax.</hi> First from Shakespeare's Brutus; which should rise with a full, smooth, philosophic weight and dignity.</p>

         <p>BREAKS, as I have before hinted, are only <hi>pauses</hi> of a different nature, more abrupt and sudden, as when a passion cuts short before the meaning is fully explained: these most frequently occur in violent grief and impetuous rage; and the tone of voice alters as the passion rises or falls. One general rule in the expression of grief is, that, when gradual, the tones should swell pathetically; but, when sudden, they should burst forth and break the voice, still avoiding any dissonant scream
<pb n="47" facs="46"/>
or croak.—In these lines of Shakespeare we find pauses of grief swelling slowly, and working upon themselves.</p>

            </l>
            <l>

            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>And whistles in the sound</hi>—Last scene of all,</l>
            <l>Which ends this strange eventful history,</l>
            <l>Is second childishness and mere oblivion;</l>

         </q>
         <p>Every <hi>emphasis</hi> and variation of voice should be founded on reason; it may be proper, therefore, to show why the several parts of the preceding lines are thus distinguished. In the first age of infancy, the upper notes are most descriptive of that tender time, as they are also of the whimpering school-boy; and their softness likewise suits the sighing of the lover. The forward confidence of the soldier demands a full-spirited medium; and the corpulent importance, generally imputed to magistracy, is well pictured by the jolly swell of the <hi>base</hi> notes, while the feebleness of fast declining age calls for the <hi>counter-tenor,</hi> tremulated, as it were, with weakness.</p>
         <p>Thus much for general explanation, which I have delivered in as full and clear a manner as the nature of my design would possibly admit; and, having set forth such examples as, explained by <hi>teachers,</hi> or carefully investigated by <hi>students,</hi> may give a full idea of what is intended, I shall pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceed to some brief remarks upon <hi>utterance</hi> and
<pb n="50" facs="49"/>
            <hi>action,</hi> in which, though it is not probable that many will excel, yet most may be improved.</p>
         <p>First then, if a voice is naturally harsh, great care should be taken to avoid guttural expres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion; nor should the tongue be allowed to play too much between the teeth; the breath, drawn, as it were, from the stomach, and vibrated upon <hi>within</hi> the mouth, will soften harsh notes, and render them much more tuneable; on the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trary, a weak shrill voice should borrow solidity and force from the throat: as too great an expan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion of the lips is disgraceful to the features, so un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>natural contraction of them will render expression unmeaning and imperfect.</p>
         <p>
            <hi>Stops</hi> and <hi>cadences</hi> are a most essential point of consideration, and cannot be better set forth than in the following remarks of a French author:
<q rend="inline margSglQuotes">'It is necessary for us,'
says he,
'to respire from time to time, but the voice does not repose equally at the conclusion of every sense; in a sentence of considerable length, we respire at every <hi>comma</hi>; but this short pause is made in such a manner as to show, by the tone of conti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nuance, that we are to go farther, the ear re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>maining unsatisfied, because the pronunciation continues suspended till the sentence is completely finished; as for example: <hi>At such a time, the King, having taken these matters into consideration, determined,</hi> here Attention is inquisitive to know what follows; the <hi>colon</hi> and <hi>semicolon</hi> are marks of more considerable respiration, yet still leave Judgment in suspence till the period unfolds the whole, and calls for a concluding cadence.<p>'In every part, or parts of a sentence there is elevation and depression of the voice, which never absolutely reposes but at the conclusion of
<pb n="51" facs="50"/>
a period, all other respiration being of conti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nuance.'</p>
            </q>
         </p>
         <p>There is undoubtedly much judgment in the composition of harmonious and comprehensive pe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riods; a dissonant unconnected style will take greatly from the beauty and force of expression, as a discordant piece of music must disgrace a perfor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mance of the ablest master, and injure the utter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance of the most perfect instruments.</p>
         <p>Frequent use strengthens and meliorates the or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gans of expression, and practice will teach a most essential point, that of pitching the voice to any place or number of persons. There is considera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble nicety in knowing the different effect which the same notes of voice may have in places of equal dimensions, but of different construction, of a place containing but few auditors, or thronged with a large number; and this point of excellence must be attained by much practice and observation. Only thus much may be observed in general of the operations of sound; that where it undulates con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>siderably, the louder a <hi>reader</hi> or <hi>declaimer</hi> goes beyond the just pitch, the more indistinct he will be, of which we find very frequent instances in <hi>cathedral</hi> churches: a full audience in any place will require at least twice the force of expression of a thin one; which, exclusive of some buzz that must unavoidably attend a numerous assembly, may be philosophically accounted for by an essen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tial density of air, from the conjunct respiration of so many people.</p>
         <p>The voice being pitched, and modulated thro' the several variations which may be found necessary, it remains to consider, to comprehend, and to feel the subject; without which expression must be languid, unaffecting, and wearisome. What we
<pb n="52" facs="51"/>
            <hi>read</hi> or <hi>speak</hi> unfelt, must be like painting with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out light or shade; there may be just symmetry of parts and good colouring; but unless they are raised and brought forward, both pall on the view, and die upon the canvass.</p>
         <p>Spirit and feeling are necessary to idea as well as to sight; for which reason <hi>teachers</hi> should not only make their <hi>pupils</hi> understand every word they <hi>read,</hi> but their general sense in a state of connec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion: a point of care seldom attended to.</p>
         <p>Emphatic expression, feeling, and taste, are par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticularly essential to poetry, as that, in general, appeals oftner to the passions than any other species of writing. <hi>Cadences</hi> also are more critical in num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bers than in prose; in both they should be smooth, gradual, and die away almost insensibly, yet so as to preserve and to impress the last syllable both upon the ear and mind, without snapping short the breath or sound, which is extremely grating to a judicious hearer.</p>
         <p>How often is verse of every kind miserably mangled! A sort of unmeaning pedantic recitative, tedious from a repetition of misplaced unharmonious tones, is substituted for dignity; thus we find many, who make a tolerable shift with prose, the moment they see any number of measured syllables, throw aside nature, reason, nay even common sense, to display their knowledge of versification, and what they think its peculiar importance.—What can be more absurd? Genuine poetry needs no pom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pous affectation to dignify it; for as by transposing the words you cannot reduce it to prose, neither can you take from its harmony by plain, natural expression.</p>
         <p>I know not any thing which has done our lan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guage, and the reading of it, more injury than the
<pb n="53" facs="52"/>
gingle of rhime, especially that which is thrown into heroic measure, it being certain that the more correct an author in that way is, the more he will lead to monotony. Instance Mr. Pope, who has been so critically exact in accenting particular syl<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lables, that very few of his pieces can be read with any tolerable variation of voice; for which reason I would have learners kept from rhime in heroic measure till they are well grounded in a just mode of utterance. Indeed we are not to wonder that the <hi>generality</hi> chaunt verse in so lamentable a man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner, when some of those who have sketched rules for reading, insist upon such a servile obedience to the author, as not only to change the accented syllable, but even to favour his bad rhime, with false pronunciation; for example, to sound the last syllable of <hi>liberty,</hi> as an exact <hi>rhime</hi> either to <hi>flee</hi> or <hi>fly.</hi>—To prescribe a stop or half pause at the end of a line, whether the sense requires it or not, is another rule that has been given, equally erro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neous and disgustful.</p>
         <p>In <hi>reading,</hi> properly so called, <hi>action</hi> has no concern, but <hi>declamation</hi> is very defective without it; yet, except upon the <hi>stage,</hi> and among many there miserably methodized, we scarce find any.—When I recommend <hi>action,</hi> I would not be supposed to intend that a speaker should be in continual motion; or that, puppet-like, he is to lift up first one hand and then another, merely to lay them down again.—No—I would have motions few, easy, graceful; and, for my own part, I know not how a declaimer can possibly feel and stand stock-still: but, admit the possibility of this, I will venture to say there is but little probability that his audience will think him in earnest: I know that some delicate persons are afraid of be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>coming
<pb n="54" facs="53"/>
too <hi>theatrical</hi>; but there is a very wide difference between the <hi>action</hi> of an <hi>orator</hi> and an <hi>actor,</hi> unless when the latter judiciously represents the former; but I shall no further urge the neces<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sity of a point so obvious, let us proceed to the thing itself.</p>
         <p>First, then, <hi>action</hi> should be entirely reserved for those passages which contain somewhat inte<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>resting or important, as demonstration, or the en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>forcing of a charge. This should be attended with the right arm stretched forward to the full extent, the fingers even, and the palm of the hand downwards, or sometimes the hand turned side<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ways, the fore finger only pointing: if the cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstance demonstrated, or given in charge, be very momentous, the well known and admired action of St. Paul preaching at Athens, stretching forth both arms, palms downwards, has much force and propriety.</p>
         <p>Where <hi>grief</hi> is to be expressed, the right hand laid slowly to the left breast, the head and chest bending forward, is a just indication of it. To express <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>resolution,</hi> the same hand must move to the same place, but with quickness and vigour, recoiling as it were from the heart, which thereby seems to meet it. With this action the head should be thrown back and the chest for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ward. The expression of <hi>ardent affection,</hi> is to close both hands warmly at half arm's length, the fingers intermingling, and to bring them to the breast with spirit. If <hi>expansion</hi> of <hi>mind,</hi> or any thing similar, is to be pointed out, then both arms should be cast different ways, in a parallel line, and the chest thrown open. Folding arms, with a drooping of the head, describe contemplation; erection of the head speaks dignity, or, with suit<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able
<pb n="55" facs="54"/>
features, contempt. There are some few other instances of action which may be graceful, and serves for variation, though not absolutely ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessary; but these must be left to the choice and discretion of the declaimer, and to the uncon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>strained operation of judicious feeling: only thus much it may be necessary to observe, that the left hand should seldom or never be used by itself; and that all action should move between the tip of the shoulder and the seat of the heart; all above is what Shakespeare justly styles sawing the air; all below both unmeaning and ungraceful. Upon the whole, every motion should be the natural attendant of what is spoken: if an extreme cannot be avoided, I would rather recommend <hi>no</hi> action than <hi>too much,</hi> or than such as must offend judici<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ous eyes.—<hi>Attitudes,</hi> or positions of the body, when happily struck off and well applied, are not only picturesque but striking, all description of them with a pen must be faint and confused, where<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore we refer to the pencil of some able painter.</p>
         <p>To what has been already offer'd we shall sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>join some useful remarks from an ingenious Trea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tise on the Art of Speaking.</p>
         <p>
            <q rend="inline">
               <p>"If nature, unassisted, could form the eminent speaker, where were the use of art and culture? which no one pretends to question: art is but na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture improved upon and refined; and before im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>provement is applied, genius is but a mass of ore in the mine, without lustre and without value, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause unknown and unthought of: the ancients used to procure masters for pronunciation from the theatres, and had youth taught gesture and attitude, by the Palaestritae, who taught much the same among them, as dancing-masters do among us.</p>
