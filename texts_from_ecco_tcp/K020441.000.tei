            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is needless to say the following Opera is taken from FIELDING'S celebrated novel of <hi>Tom Jones;</hi> a production so replete with wit, hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mour, and character, that it can never want ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mirers while the English language remains. My extreme veneration for the memory of the truly-witty and ingenious novelist, naturally led me to <hi>preserve</hi> as much of FIELDING throughout my Opera, as the nature of my plan would allow. Nay, when it was thought necessary to shorten the piece, lest it should be too long in representation, I readily <hi>parted with my own,</hi> to <hi>retain</hi> as much as possible of the <hi>invaluable Original.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have made many material deviations from the novel, both in point of fable, and character. I have stripp'd its hero of his libertinism, to render him, as I imagined, more amiable and interesting; and have metamorphos'd Parson <hi>Supple</hi> into a country 'squire, to avoid giving offence to the <hi>cloth.</hi> The characters of <hi>Western</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> I have divested of their provinciality; lest the at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tention of the performers, to the pronunciation of an uncouth and difficult dialect, should produce an <hi>Inattention</hi> to the more material business of the drama. I have also endeavoured to purge Wes<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tern's character of its coarseness and indelicacy, in conformity to the refined taste of the present age; and of its Jacobitism, from an opinion that such political sect no longer exists, as well as from
<pb facs="4"/>a conviction that nothing of party should ever ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pear within the walls of a theatre.</p>
            <p>While I was writing the last act of this Opera (which was in June, 1765), the <hi>French</hi> Tom Jones fell into my hands. I found its plan so very confined, and so materially different from mine, that I could reap little or no benefit from it. The only particulars, of which I have availed my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self from Mons. POINSINET, are the hint of <hi>legi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timating</hi> Jones, and the thought, which gave rise to my <hi>second</hi> air. I have quoted the lines, from which I received advantage in the latter instance:</p>

                  <p>I'm sorry, ma'am, to see you look so grave this afternoon. I'm afraid Mr. Jones runs in your head.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>So.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. Jones runs in my head! What is Mr. Jones to me?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hon.</speaker>
                  <p>Nothing, ma'am. He's not a proper match for you to be sure: with your fortune you may command one of the greatest lords of the land; therefore you won't cer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tainly stoop to marry a beggar and a foundling.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>So.</speaker>
                  <p>I don't know what you mean by taking these li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>berties with Mr. Jones! The misfortune of his birth is not his crime.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hon.</speaker>
                  <p>Ma'am, if it was a disgrace, Mr. Jones has a great many people, that carry their heads very high, to keep him in countenance—well, he's one of the sweetest gentlemen that ever trod on shoe-leather! Every body likes him: all the neighbourhood, for five miles round, would run through fire and water for him—if I were in your cloaths, and he loved me, as much as I believe he loves you—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>So.</speaker>
                  <p>Loves me, Honour! I don't understand you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hon.</speaker>
                  <p>Ma'am, I may be mistaken, it's true; because, as the man says, we can be sure of nothing in this world but death and taxes: however I could tell you something, that looks very like it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>So.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay! pray what's that, Honour?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hon.</speaker>
                  <p>He came into the room, as I was sitting at work, and what should be upon the table but the muff you gave me, and my gentleman whips his hands into it. "La, Mr. Jones, you'll spoil it," says I; but he still kept his hands in it, and kiss'd it, and mumbled it, and kiss'd it—for my part I never saw such kisses in my life as he gave it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>So.</speaker>
                  <p>When was this?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hon.</speaker>
                  <p>Let me see—it was the day after I dreamt that I was married to Sir Timothy Tipple—last Thursday—ay it was on Thursday.—But that is not all neither—yesterday, as you were playing on the harpsichord, he was in the next room, and look'd melancholly—says I, "What's the matter, Mr.
<pb n="4" facs="10"/>Jones? A penny for your thoughts"—"Hussy," says he, starting up as from a dream, "what can I be thinking of, when that angel your mistress is playing?"—But I'm afraid you're offended, ma'am?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>So.</speaker>
                  <p>No, no—proceed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hon.</speaker>
                  <p>Then squeezing my hand—he squeez'd so hard, that I thought he would have forc'd the blood out of my finger-ends—"Oh! Mrs. Honour, says he, how happy will that man be"—and then he sigh'd—Upon my faith his breath is as sweet as a nosegay—but for heaven's sake, ma'am, don't speak of this; for he gave me a guinea never to mention it. However, as I did not swear it, it's only a promise, and what signifies a promise?</p>

That judgment, which can penetrate into the cabinets of princes, and discern the secret springs, which move the state-wheels in all the political machines in Europe, can surely very easily find out what passes in the rude, uninform'd mind of a girl.</p>

It's well for thee that thou'rt a woman, or I'd have lent thee many a flick, for talking to me so much court-nonsense. I'd have thrash'd thy jacket for thee, I promise thee.</p>

                  <p>Ay, ay, in that flicking and thrashing lies all your fancied superiority: Your bodies, not your brains, are stronger than ours. 'Tis with you as with the brute creation in general; the greater your bulk and strength, the smaller your intellects.</p>

                  <p>Since you condescend to ask my advice, you may propose the match to Allworthy yourself. There is no indecorum in the proposal's coming from a parent. King Alcinous offers, in Pope's Odyssey, his daughter to Ulysses.</p>

                  <p>There can be no hopes of her father's consent; and Mr. Allworthy would never pardon an attempt to marry her without it—nay I could scarce pardon myself. Conscience teaches me, that to repay the friendships of hospitality by this worst kind of robbery, is to be the meanest, the basest of all robbers.—Yet is there not a great difference between clandestinely marrying a friend's daughter from a motive of love, and doing it from a sordid motive of interest?—Cer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tainly—but then her father would disclaim her; and shall I, whose sole support flows from Mr. Allworthy's unmerited bounty, involve her in my distress? Her, who has been brought up with such tenderness, elegance, and delicacy?—That, that hath determined me—No, no, no; let me not make her unhappy, however miserable I may be myself—I must think no more of her.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="33"/>fast as possible: I begin to have some ugly fears about Dowling! It is very lucky that he is now in London—I must conceal Sophia's coldness, and tell her father she has given me a most favourable reception, as that will be the only means to hasten the match—here he comes!</p>

The junction of our forces, tho' we should have no infan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try, must inevitably cause a great effusion of money; and your revenues are not of the largest.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>If they fall short, I presume my dear ally will have no objection to furnish her quota, as her finances are in so flourishing a state.</p>

                  <p>You might perhaps be intitled to a subsidy from me as an ally. I don't mean as a British ally; for the allies of this island, instead of contributing to the expences
<pb n="33" facs="41"/>of a war, are often well paid for doing nothing—except defending their own territories—but do you really think we could live happily together?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sup.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly: with the most cordial affection; not with the fashionable indifference, I might call it aversion, of modern couples.</p>

                  <p>A run-away scheme—I suppose somewhat like your own, my dear.

                  <p>How! What a plague is this! Màrry at fifty-three! Why, sister, did not you promise me, when my wife died, if I would live single, that you would never marry?</p>

                  <p>Brother, I must own I esteem Mr. Supple, as he is a man of sense, and a great admirer of female understandings. He has already made some amorous ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vances; and should he besiege me in form, after I have held out a few months, I may possibly be inclined to listen to terms of capitulation.</p>

                  <speaker>Sup.</speaker>
                  <p>A few months? dear madam, that will be too long a blockade. If you're resolv'd to defend the garrison to the last extremity, I find I must begin the attack by storm.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wes.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, ay, cuz; begin with storming, and I warrant you'll carry her.—Come, sister, you may as well con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent, and we'll have both marriages together.</p>
