            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HOWEVER sparing modern Authors
are in giving due praise to their Cotempora<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ries,
they seem to be more united in acknow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledging
the merit of those who, to use the
language of the Psalmist, <q rend="inline">"have ceased from
their labours."</q> Writers, whose works have
stood the test of years, have acquired a kind
of prescriptive title to celebrity, not on ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count
of that superior wisdom which is often
attributed to times we have survived, or the
supposed degeneracy of the present, but be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cause,
what has been long known has been
more reflected upon, and what undergoes this
examination is better understood.</p>
            <p>In the catalogue of Authors, whose wri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tings
have met with public reception, none
have been more justly celebrated than those
of POPE, and <hi>his Cotemporaries</hi>; insomuch,
<pb n="ii" facs="4"/>
that their names have not only been honour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ably
recorded, but the period in which they
lived has been pre-eminently distinguished by
the title of the <hi>Augustan Age.</hi> Other points
of time have here and there given birth to
a great genius, who, like a leading star, has
enlightened the horizon of literature, but no
particular aera, at least of our history, has
produced so general, and collected a light as
this; a light which, at once, shone upon every
part of science, at the same time that it il<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>luminated
the circle of morality.</p>
            <p>What could have been the cause why such
a cluster of great men flourished at the same
period of time, and why we have had no similar
succession ever since? Whether the first arose
from the emulation of authorship, which, like
the collision of hard bodies, struck a fire from
each other, or that the latter was occasioned
by the number of finished pieces they gave
to the world, which has ever since occasioned
a kind of literary satiety, is a question, per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps,
not so readily decided. This however
<pb n="iii" facs="5"/>
is as generally known, as assented to, that
from the very few eminent geniuses who
have arisen since the flourishing days of this
illustrious Junto, nature seems to have in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dulged
herself in a temporary repose.</p>
            <p>When Authors, therefore, have thus long
engaged the public attention, when their
works are read with avidity, and universally
receive a classical stamp, those who can add
any thing to their illustration, and recover
by time what has eluded former diligence,
bring an acceptable present to the public.
It is with good Authors as with good men;
the nearer, and more intimately they are
viewed, the more we are able to set a proper
value upon their characters, and look up to
them as more enforcing examples of imitation
and instruction.</p>
            <p>Under this idea, the Editor thinks he need
make no apology in presenting the public
with two additional volumes to the Works of
Mr. POPE, which contain such of that celebrated
Bard's pieces, in prose and verse, together with
<pb n="iv" facs="6"/>
many of his Cotemporaries, as for particular
and local reasons were then suppressed, might
have been mislaid, or perhaps got into too
remote hands to be collected with ease. He
is aware, at the same time, that the public
rage for the remains of celebrated men, has
occasioned many spurious productions being
fathered on them, under the well-known titles
of <hi>second parts,</hi> and <hi>posthumous works.</hi> Our
best Authors, and principally our best, have
been subject to such impositions, which, tho'
they have been in time detected, have yet
answered the illiberal purposes of such a tem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>porary
publication. The Editor of the pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent
Work, to get clear of the shadow of
an imputation in this line, is the first to
remind the public, that several of the pieces
here exhibited originally appeared in <hi>The St.
James's Chronicle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The favourable reception they met with
in that fugitive mode of publication, first
suggested to him a wish to give them a more
durable form; he accordingly communicated
<pb n="v" facs="7"/>
this wish to his friends, who assisted him in
his design, so much beyond his expectation,
that instead of <hi>one</hi> volume (his original in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tention)
he has, by their favour, been able
to make out <hi>two</hi>; composed of such materials,
as he flatters himself will acquit him of the
charge of an hasty, or self-interested compiler.</p>
            <p>Many of the <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Poems,</hi> of which
this publication consists, were transcribed
with accuracy from the originals, in the
collections of the late Lords Oxford and
Bolingbroke, who are well known to have
lived in the strictest intimacy with Mr. POPE,
as well as his literary friends and associates.
Some of the <hi>latter</hi> will be found no way in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferior
to other productions of the same Au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thors.
All of the fragments, more or less,
carry the marks of a master. Others of the
Letters are taken from pamphlets printed
some years ago, which, in the detached man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner
they then appeared, will, it is to be hoped,
fully justify their present mode of publica<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion.
They, for the most part, treat of cri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tical,
<pb n="vi" facs="8"/>
friendly, humorous, and literary sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jects,
and abstracted from these, throw new
lights upon the character of Mr. POPE, as a
man.</p>
            <p>His Letters to his favourite Miss Blount
lead to the support of a charge often urged
against him — <hi>his want of original inven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion</hi>;
for tho' the extent of his erudition, and
his elegant turn of thinking, gave him a
superiority to all his Cotemporaries in polishing,
to a degree of <hi>originality,</hi> other people's sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timents;
yet here, whether from the careless<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
arising from intimate friendship, idleness,
or the supposition of his not being detected
by his fair correspondent, he has committed
a plagiarism on Voiture, which would be un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>worthy
a much less celebrated pen than his.</p>
            <p>His Letter to Jabez Hughes, Esq. brother
to the author of the Siege of Damascus, with
that of his to Mr. Dennis, the critic, are
melancholy proofs that the greatest genius
cannot always shield men from duplicity of
conduct in their literary characters, and bring
<pb n="vii" facs="9"/>
another corroboration to the testimony of
Gay's assertion, that
<q>
                  <l>"Wits are game-cocks to each other."</l>
               </q>
But if these Letters shew the weaknesses,
perhaps the inseparable weaknesses from hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man
nature, others will shew some of its
fairest, and brightest sides; they will exhibit
the strongest <hi>traits</hi> of his humanity and
friendship, his wit, his learning, and his
morals; they will confirm his more than
Roman affection to his parents, and parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cularly
to his aged mother, whose life he
watched over with such soothing solicitude
and exemplary reverence, as force us for a
while to turn from the lustre of his talents to
admire the superiority of his silial character.</p>
            <p>A few Poems and Letters will be found
in this collection, which appeared only in
some of the editions of his works, in none
of them quite perfect, which are particularly
distinguished in the latter, by the additional
paragraphs being printed in Italics. This will
<pb n="viii" facs="10"/>
justify their republication here, more parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cularly
as many of them are written in that
unreserved, open manner, which his original
Editor might have a wish to conceal for many
reasons, that now no longer remain; at pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent,
the restoration of them can neither in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dulge
vanity, nor gratify spleen: they may be
read without any other reason than the desire
of pleasure, and are therefore only to be
praised as that object is obtained.</p>
            <p>To many, in an age like this, where
hypocrisy in morals is much practised, (as
is shewn by our dramatic, and other writers,)
perhaps a few of the Poems may appear
too loose and descriptive, particularly "The
Farewel to London," the conclusion of the
"Address to Miss Blount on leaving Town,"
and some passages in "The Sober Advice
from Horace, &amp;c." by Mr. POPE; together
with the Poem called "Virtue in Danger," and
others by Lady Mary Wortley Montague: but
on a proper examination this charge of in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>decency
will be found to lie more in the
readers turn of thinking, than the defects of
<pb n="ix" facs="11"/>
the writer. A poet who wants to give his sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject
due force, should comply with the rules
of his profession, by using <q rend="inline">"proper words in
proper places,"</q> and provided he keeps a
steady eye on the moral of his piece, the more
he colours from nature, the more he assists
his design, whilst the <hi>hint</hi> and <hi>double entendrez,</hi>
those mock draperies of delicacy, often create
a more indecent meaning than the circum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stance
will allow, and urge the young and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>experienced
reader more to the exercise of his
passions than his reason.</p>
            <p>Swift's delicacy has been often arraigned
on the same principle; and his "Lady's
Dressing Room," and others of his Poems
of a similar stamp, are ever sure to be ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duced
as convincing proofs of this charge.
But where is the woman of real sense and
cleanliness offended at it? Conscious she de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serves
no such reprehension in her own con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duct,
she sees the general force of the satire
only directed to the slatterns of her sex, and
is pleased with the hope of a consequent
reformation. In short, the Editor is entirely
<pb n="x" facs="12"/>
of opinion, that the same rule respecting
decency, which a modern artist has laid down
in painting, will equally hold good in poetry.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">"It is not in shewing, or concealing the
naked, that modesty or lewdness depend.
They arise entirely from the choice and
intentions of the artist himself. A great
mind can raise great, or pleasing ideas,
though he shews all the parts of the body
in their natural way, whilst the Cheapside
prints of the <hi>Buck and Quaker Girl,</hi> the
charms of the <hi>Garter</hi> and <hi>High-wind,</hi> are
proofs that very lewd ideas might be pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duced,
though little or nothing of the
naked be discovered; and there is no doubt,
but that the <hi>Venus De Medicis</hi> might be
converted into a very lewd figure <hi>by dressing
her out for that purpose</hi>
                  <note place="bottom" n="*">Barry on the Arts.</note>."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The letters which passed between Mr.
POPE, and his booksellers, which are to be
found in the second of these volumes, may
appear to those who are to be no otherwise
<pb n="xi" facs="13"/>
pleased with human genius than seeing it
eternally on the stretch, rather too trisling;
and as the public voice is not a little raised
upon like occasions, the Editor thinks it
may be necessary to say something on this
subject.</p>
            <p>It is objected, that most of our great wri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters
no sooner establish a reputation for their
works, but there are never wanting interested
people, who preferring a private lucre either
to the fame of the author, or national honour,
busy themselves in gleaning up their most un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>interesting
thoughts on the most uninteresting
subjects; such as letters to tradesmen, &amp;c.
and that kind of domestic correspondence,
which, to use the language of a modern au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thor,
<q rend="inline">"a wise man should be ashamed to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>member."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Was a collection of this kind purposely
made for the filling up a volume without the
least regard to amusement, curiosity, or in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>struction,
it must soon defeat its own pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poses;
for, however common readers may for
<pb n="xii" facs="14"/>
a while be pleased with the novelty, the re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>probation
it must receive from men of sense,
would soon distinguish it as the <hi>mortal part</hi> of
an author, and in this state consign it to ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>livion.
But trifling as these Letters ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pear
to be, many of them referring to literary
business, help to settle dates, and explain re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferences,
which perhaps before were not quite
so intelligible, and like those well digested
questions on a legal examination, which how<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever
simple they may appear in respect to
their immediate enquiries are yet important, as
they strengthen, or elucidate a fact in their
connections. Others will serve to shew the
degree of intimacy between the poet and book<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>seller
of that time, the process of publica<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
and many other little anecdotes of par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties
and places, too <hi>trifling</hi> to be otherwise
recorded, but by this mode of preservation,
and yet too <hi>curious</hi> (at least to literary enqui<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rers)
to fall down the stream of obscurity.</p>
            <p>The Editor having now made those apo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>logies
which he thought necessary for offering
these volumes to the public, he will no longer
<pb n="xiii" facs="15"/>
detain them from the exercise of their own
judgement. He cannot, however, conclude
without assuring them that his design in this
compilation was no more than to collect in one
view, such pieces of our celebrated English
Bard, and his Cotemporaries, as may be lost
to the world from a fugitive mode of pub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lication,
and others which might be equally
lost from their being only open to the inspec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
of the few. In this, as he has spared
no industry, or expence himself, and stands
much indebted to the researches and interest
of many of his friends, he hopes to have
the merit of a faithful and useful Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piler,
and that these volumes may not be
thought improper appendages to the present
edition of POPE'S WORKS.</p>

               <l>Like his own person, large and fair—</l>

               <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
               <p>OF all kinds of poetry the Didascalic is the most
valuable, if aiming at the good of mankind be what
justly entitles any thing to that character. The de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scriptive
kind is like a fine landskip, where you meet
with two or three principal figures; the rest is all
rocks, rivulets, hanging woods and verdant lawns,
amusing to the eye, shewing the taste of the painter,
but carrying little instruction along with it. But
the Didascalic is like a curious piece of history paint<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing,
where every figure must be highly wrought,
every passion strongly represented, all contributing in
their several degrees to express the main design; in
short, it must be a finished piece.</p>
               <p>That this is a very difficult work may be collected
from the small number of those poets who have ever
attempted it. In the early ages of the Grecians, I
remember none who have wrote any thing in this way
but old Hesiod, Aratus, and Nicander; for Diony<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sius,
the Periegetic, and <note place="bottom" n="*">Agesilaus, Oppian's father, was a man of great learning and merit as well as wealth and power, in the city of Anazarbus in Cilicia, where he liv'd: Severus making a progress, came to that town, and Agesilaus being not at the procession to meet the Emperor at his entrance, probably on account of his age and infirmities, that prince, to punish him for so heinous a crime, banish'd the poor old man to Malta. Oppian, to amuse his father under his misfortune, took to writing of poetry, and after<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards dedicated his Halieutics to the Emperor's son. The Emperor was so pleas'd with the poem, that he or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der'd him a piece of gold for each line, and offer'd him any other favour he would ask. The first part of the story is not at all wonderful, but I must confess the last part is a little surprizing.</note> Oppian, liv'd not 'till the
<pb n="60" facs="79"/>
time of the Roman Emperors. Hesiod's works and
days is the only piece remaining that is allow'd to be
genuine without dispute; but by Virgil's, and especi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ally
Manilius's compliments to him, 'tis highly pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bable
he wrote others, and perhaps more valuable
ones, tho' Quintilian allows him the <hi>Palma in illo
medio genere dicendi</hi> only, and Le Fevre is much more
hard upon him when he makes him little better than
an almanack-maker, and his work a mean perform<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance.
Paterculus and Plutarch set him next to
Homer, as well in the value of his works, as in the
period of his age, says Mr. Kennet; but perhaps that
may be the other extreme. Aratus wrote a poem, in
two books, which he calls the Phaenomena, and
Diosemeia, the one astronomical, giving an account
of the situation and the affection of the heavenly
bodies, the other astrological, shewing the particular
influences arising from their various dispositions and
relations<note place="bottom" n="†">Kennet's lives of the Greek poets.</note>. Tully commends him for his versifica<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
<pb n="61" facs="80"/>
and Quintilian says, he has fully answer'd his
argument, which put together, should make up a
pretty good character. As to Nicander, Vossius
places him amongst his Greek historians, but allows
him to have been <hi>egregius grammaticus, poeta, &amp;

medicus.</hi> His surviving works are, however, only
poetry upon poisons, and the methods of cure for
them. Of the two latter Greek poets, Dionysius
and Oppian, the one wrote a survey of the world,
and the other Cynegetics and Halieutics, in both which
'tis certain there are very fine parts, however judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments
may differ about them.</p>
               <p>Amongst the Romans, Lucretius and Manilius
may justly be said to be the chief of the Didascalic
poets. They both wrote with all the fire of their
youth about 'em; for neither of them liv'd to be old.
I have always fancy'd Manilius imitated Lucretius in
his manner, the beginning of his books being pretty
much in the same way, besides, that he loses no oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>casion
of launching out into descriptions, and is
florid to a fault. He has likewise some reflections<note place="bottom" n="*">The beginning of the fourth book.</note> on
the follies of men, so very much of a piece with what
you meet with in the 5th book of Lucretius, that one
would almost think them taken from thence. In
general it may be said, they are both very noble poems,
tho' that of Manilius is far from being finish'd, as it
might have been, if the author had liv'd. What
errors are to be found in the philosophy of the one,
<pb n="62" facs="81"/>
and the astronomy of the other, are owing, perhaps,
as much to the age of the world at that time, as
their own, and their beauties may, in some measure,
atone for their faults.</p>
               <p>Virgil's Georgics are in the same kind, tho' the
subjects are of less dignity; and I don't know whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
I might not likewise add Ovid, on the account
of his Fasti, the most correct of all his works:
Gratius too, about the same time, wrote his Cynege<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tics,
which are very justly esteem'd.</p>
               <p>Amongst the moderns, Fracastorius's <hi>Syphilis,</hi> Quil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>let's
<hi>Callipaedia,</hi> and Vida's Art of Poetry, are the
best poems of this sort; Rapin of gardens, and
Vanier's <hi>Praedium Rusticum,</hi> are not without their
merit, but much inferior to the others. In our own
language too we have some poems of this instructive
kind: The Essays on Poetry, Translated Verse, and
Criticism, are fine instances of the worth and excel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lency
of this manner of writing, to which may be
very truly apply'd what Dr. Young says of Satyr,<q>
                     <l>" Heroes and gods make other poems fine,</l>
                     <l>" Plain satyr calls for sense in every line<note place="bottom" n="*">Universal Passion, Sat. II.</note>."</l>
                  </q> The strength of just observations, convey'd in smooth
and flowing numbers, has a prevailing influence,
insinuates itself into the mind almost imperceptibly,
and makes a more lasting impression there than one
would easily imagine. 'Tis true these subjects are
purely critical, and so of less consequence to man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kind
<pb n="63" facs="82"/>
in general; but yet, polishing the understand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing,
improving the judgment, and regulating the
taste, are far from being things indifferent to the
world, since they tend not a little to the shaming
out of it that rusticity and barbarism, those follies
and affectations, in one word, all that littleness of
mind which is so effectual a bar in the way of ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nerous
and noble undertakings. But we have had of
late an undeniable proof that the finest and most use<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful
sort of philosophy, which consists in the know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge
of ourselves, may be convey'd in such clear,
strong, easy, and affecting strains, at the same time
convincing and captivating the understanding, that
there remains no doubt but that poetry in the hands
of a great genius, may be made as beneficial as ever
it has been entertaining to mankind. The latter
effect is indeed what has been generally most aim'd at,
as it is compass'd with less difficulty to the writer, and
meets with a more universal reception amongst the
common sort of readers.<note place="bottom" n="*">

                  </note> Imagery, fine colour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing,
and bright antitheses, often disguise the want of
justness and force, and by pleasing the imagination,
do, as it were, steal away from the judgment, or

with weak, distemper'd or fanciful men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Os magna sonaturum</hi> of Horace would make
one almost think the muse must never appear without
<pb n="64" facs="83"/>
her buskins, and that all simplicity of expression were
to be totally banish'd out of poetical writings. 'Tis
true, the Epic Poem, the Ode, and the Tragedy very
often require, and consequently justify the use of ele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vated
language, as it may be more suitable to the
greatness of the subjects, and better fitted to raise the
several passions they are design'd to work upon. But
where the appeal lies only to the understanding, self<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>evident
truths, naturally and beautifully express'd, can
never fail of the approbation of a sound head and a
good taste: And even Horace himself, as elevated
and great a poet as he must be allow'd in his <hi>Odes,</hi>
appears to much more advantage in his <hi>Sermones</hi> and
<hi>Epistles,</hi> where, as my Lord Roscommon observes on
another occasion,<q>
                     <l>" Fancy labours less, but judgment more."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Sir John Denham's Cooper's Hill has met with
universal applause, tho' its subject seems rather de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scriptive
than instructing; but 'tis not the hill, the
river, nor the stag chace; 'tis the good sense and the
fine reflections so frequently interspers'd, and as it were
interwoven with the rest, that gives it the value, and
will make it, as was said of true wit, everlasting like
the sun.</p>
               <p>The late Mr. Prior's Solomon seems to have cost
him much time and pains, and was, I believe, his
favourite performance: He is in some doubt whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
to call it a Didascalic or Heroic poem. It has,
<pb n="65" facs="84"/>
indeed, something of both, and yet strictly speaking,
is perfectly neither: It has not fable, machinery,
nor variety enough to be an Heroic poem, and it is
too diffusive and luxuriant in the style, too florid
and full of descriptions to be of the Didascalic sort.
In general, it may be justly said to be a very fine
piece; though I must confess I cannot help giving the
preference to his Alma, in which the design is more
closely pursued, carried on with more spirit, and
never loses your attention.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, what Mr. Dryden has said in the
preface to his <hi>Religio Laici,</hi> is, I think, very true.
<q rend="inline">"The expressions of a poem, design'd purely for
instruction, ought to be plain and natural, and
yet majestic: for here the poet is presum'd to
be a kind of lawgiver, and those three qualities
which I have named, are proper to the legislative
style. The florid, elevated and figurative way,
is for the passions; for love and hatred, fear and
anger are begotten in the soul by shewing their
objects out of their true proportion; either greater
than the life or less; but instruction is to be given
by shewing them what they naturally are. A man
is to be cheated into passion, but to be reasoned
into truth."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The following short piece may be perhaps a little
too pompously introduced by the foregoing obser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vations;
all I shall say for it is, I endeavoured to
<pb n="66" facs="85"/>
follow Mr. Dryden's rules: how far I have succeeded,
I can be no proper judge myself. But whatever may
be said of the poetry, and about that I am very indif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent,
the sentiments must surely be allowed to be
just and good; and I am entirely of Mr. Prior's opi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nion:
<q rend="inline">"I had rather be thought a good Englishman,
(which is but another word for an honest man)
than the best poet, or greatest scholar that ever
wrote."</q>

Life was printed soon after the Essay on Man was ushered into the world

for the performance was pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bably taken from Dr. Swift's letter, July 23, 1737,

natural absurdities, as he had not discernment enough to discover that
they were only foothing him to paint for them gratis, or diverting themselves
at the expence of his credulity. Sir Godfrey had drawn for Pope the statues

               <l>One can live without money on plains,</l>

                  <p>THAT the Duchess of Queensberry is surpriz'd
and well pleas'd that the King hath given her so agree<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able
a command as to stay from Court, where she never
came for diversion, but to bestow a great civility upon
the King and Queen. She hopes by such an unpre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cedented
order as this, that the King will see as few
as he wishes at his court (particularly such as dare
think or speak the truth.) I dare not do otherwise,
and ought not; nor could I have imagined that it
would not have been the highest compliment that I
could possibly pay the King, to endeavour to support
truth and innocence in his house.</p>
                  <l>C. QUEENSBERRY.</l>
                  <p>Particularly when the King and Queen had both
told me that they had not read Mr. Gay's play. I
have certainly done right then to stand to my own
word, rather than his Grace of Grafton's, who hath
neither made use of truth, judgment or honour
through this whole affair, either for himself or his
friends.</p>

               <l>So when, in visionary trains, by night</l>
               <l>Attending angels bless'd good Jacob's sight,</l>

               <l>DEAR doctor, here comes a young virgin untainted,</l>
               <l>To your shrine at Bermudas, to be married and sainted;</l>
               <l>I am young, I am soft, I am blooming and tender,</l>
               <l>And of all that I have, I make you a surrender.</l>
               <l>My innocence, led by the voice of your fame,</l>
               <l>To your person and virtue must put in its claim;</l>
               <l>And now I behold you, I truly believe,</l>
               <l>That you're as like Adam as I am like Eve:</l>
               <l>But then (as in you a new race has begun)</l>

               <l>Before, the dire serpent their virtue betray'd,</l>
               <l>And taught them to fly from the sun to the shade,</l>

persuading</l>
               <l>To go, and to live, and be wise in your Eden.</l>
               <l>Oh let me go with you; oh pity my youth;</l>
               <l>Oh take me from hence, let me not lose my truth.</l>
               <l>Sure you, that have virtue so much in your mind,</l>
               <l>Can't think to leave me, who am virtue, behind.</l>
               <l>If you make me your wife, sir, in time you may fill a</l>
               <l>Whole town with your children, and likewise your villa:</l>
               <l>I famous for breeding, you famous for knowledge,</l>
               <l>I'll found a whole nation, you'll found a whole college:</l>
               <l>And when many long ages in joys we have spent,</l>
               <l>Our souls we'll resign with the utmost content;</l>

               <l>Observe a great variety;</l>
               <l>Both walks, walls, meadows, and parterres,</l>
               <l>Windows and doors, and rooms and stairs;</l>
               <l>And hills and dales, and woods and fields,</l>
               <l>And hay, and grass, and corn it yields;</l>
               <l>All to your haggard brought so cheap in,</l>

               <l>Like tears a-down a wrinkled cheek,</l>

very inconsiderable. He kept no house, but was a boarder. He was much
esteemed, and so frequently invited to the tables of gentlemen in the
neighbourhood, that he had seldom occasion to dine at home. An ancient
inhabitant of Hampstead, now living, was present at his funeral. He was
supposed to be very indigent at the time of his death, as he was interred
on the 12th of February 1726 in the meanest manner, his coffin being little
better than those allotted by the parish to their poor who are buried from
the workhouse; neither did a single friend, or relation, attend him to the
grave. No memorial was placed over his remains; but they lie just under a
holly tree which formed a part of a hedgerow that was once the boundary of the
church-yard.</note>, M. D. Author of the Tragedy of Sir <hi>Walter

               <l>To bless by turns and plague my wise,</l>
               <l>In conscience I'm oblig'd to do</l>

               <l>An antidote, if such there be,</l>

               <l>Hear then, great bard, who can alike inspire</l>
               <l>With Waller's softness, or with Milton's fire;</l>

               <l>Cease then, and leave some fitter bard to tell</l>

            <head>Upon a GOOSE.</head>
            <byline>By Lord MIDDLESEX.</byline>
            <lg>
               <l>NOW the full barns with yellow sheaves are stor'd,</l>
               <l>That yield a double product to their Lord;</l>
               <l>To glean the fields, the Geese direct their way,</l>
               <l>And far from hence through unknown stubbles stray.</l>
               <l>The jolly farmer views with joyful eyes</l>
               <l>The sacred light of Michael's dawn arise,</l>
               <l>While new-shorn vales a pleasant prospect yield,</l>
               <l>And Geese unnumber'd whiten all the field.</l>
               <l>Obedient to his voice and well-known call,</l>
               <l>A grateful victim to their saint they fall.</l>
               <l>Before his hospitable gate he stands,</l>
               <l>And welcomes in his guest with greeting hands.</l>
               <l>And now the neat though homely cloth display'd,</l>
               <l>And earthern plates in shining order laid</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="155" facs="174"/> Provoke each hungry guest. The Goose appears,</l>
               <l>The reeking load a bending servant bears;</l>
               <l>With sage well stuff'd to add a sav'ry taste,</l>
               <l>And sugar'd apples crown the rich repast.</l>
               <l>Brimful with ale the nut-brown bowls go round,</l>
               <l>While every voice of Geese the praises sound:</l>
               <l>The gods themselves might envy such a feast,</l>
               <l>And thund'ring Jove might wish to prove a guest.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And thus, O sacred bird, each coming year</l>
               <l>You keep the strictest bands of friends sincere.</l>
               <l>Oh could I sing your far-resounding praise</l>
               <l>In Prior's smooth, or Pope's sublimer lays!</l>
               <l>Then should the Mantuan Swan exult no more,</l>
               <l>Nor higher than the British Goose should soar:</l>
               <l>Thy glory should the plains and vallies fill,</l>
               <l>While muses could inspire, or Geese afford a quill.</l>

               <l>SUCH artless art did ever mortal see,</l>
               <l>Or politicks so void of policy?</l>
               <l>To wit and humour there is fair pretence,</l>
               <l>But none to just design or solid sense.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Let sourer criticks point each faulty place,</l>
               <l>I'll e'en let Tickell and Avignon pass.</l>
               <l>Let boys their loyalty huzzaing show,</l>
               <l>And kind Louisa teach our girls to go.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But on immortal Joseph let us fix,</l>
               <l>That pattern rare of whiggish politicks;</l>
               <l>Slave to vain glory, out of danger stout,</l>
               <l>Who prints on Brunswick—after Preston's rout;</l>
               <l>Coward to blame, and envious to commend,</l>
               <l>A sneaking patriot, and a half-fac'd friend.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Sell not French claret at the Ormond's head,</l>
               <l>But hang up Horace Walpole in his stead;</l>
               <l>Nor at the Devil tavern make your sport:—</l>
               <l>The Devil always has a friend at court.</l>
               <l>What bard but this could Pelham's train compare</l>
               <l>To Roman Scipio's thunder-bolts of war?</l>

               <l>With foreign treasures and with Spanish spoil?</l>
               <l>But hark! and stare with all your ears and eyes!</l>
               <l>Walpole is friend to Universities!</l>
               <l>Who crost the clause (so generous has he been)</l>
               <l>Which Sandys with his advice had usher'd in.</l>
               <l>Tho' whigs of forty-one may raise a cry,</l>
               <l>New livings he permits them still to buy.</l>
               <l>His part of odium let Sir Robert bear,</l>
               <l>Or Sandys his moiety of glory share,</l>
               <l>For'twould have puzzled Knighthood's craft, no doubt,</l>
               <l>Had it been ne'er brought in, to throw it out.</l>
               <l>Hail politician bard! we ask not whether</l>
               <l>A whig or tory; thou art both and neither.</l>
               <l>Poultney and Walpole each adorn thy lays,</l>
               <l>Which one for love, and one for money praise.</l>
               <l>Alike are mention'd, equally are sung</l>
               <l>Will. Shippen staunch, and slight Sir Wm. Young.</l>
               <l>Bromley and Wyndham share the motley strain,</l>

               <l>SINCEREST critick of my prose or rhime,</l>
               <l>Tell, how thy pleasing Stowe employs thy time.</l>
               <l>Say, Cobham, what amuses thy retreat,</l>
               <l>Or schemes of war, or stratagems of state?</l>
               <l>Dost thou recall to mind with joy or grief,</l>
               <l>Great Marlbrough's actions? that immortal chief,</l>
               <l>Whose slightest trophies rais'd in each campaign</l>
               <l>More than suffic'd to signalize a reign.</l>
               <l>Does thy remembrance rising warm thy heart</l>
               <l>With glory past, where thou thyself hadst part?</l>
               <l>Or dost thou grieve indignant now, to see,</l>
               <l>The fruitless end of all that victory?</l>
               <l>To see the audacious foe so late subdu'd,</l>
               <l>Dispute the terms for which so long they su'd,</l>
               <l>As if Britannia now were sunk so low</l>

               <l>Each vexing thought and heart-devouring woe?</l>
               <l>And fix thy mind alone on rural scenes,</l>
               <l>To turn the levell'd lawns to liquid plains;</l>
               <l>To raise the creeping rills from humble beds,</l>

               <l>On watry columns capitals to rear,</l>
               <l>That lift their flowing curls with upper air?</l>
               <l>Or dost thou, weary grown, these works neglect,</l>
               <l>No temples, statues, obelisks erect?</l>
               <l>But seek the morning breeze from fragrant meads,</l>

               <l>Or slowly walk alone the mazy wood,</l>
               <l>To meditate on all that's wise and good?</l>
               <l>For nature bountiful in thee has join'd</l>
               <l>A person pleasing, with a worthy mind;</l>
               <l>Not given thee form alone, but means and art,</l>

            <byline>By Lady MARY WORTLEY MONTAGUE, </byline>
            <head type="sub">on Mrs. LOWTHER, Lord LONSDALE's Sister.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>AS Chloris on her downy pillow lay,</l>
               <l>'Twixt sleep and wake the morning slid away.</l>
               <l>Soft at her chamber door a tap was heard,</l>
               <l>She listen'd, and again no one appear'd.</l>
               <l>Who's there, the sprightly nymph with courage cries?</l>
               <l>Madam, 'tis one who for your la'ship dyes.</l>
               <l>Sure! 'tis delusion! what! a dying Lover!</l>
               <l>Yet speak once more: what is't you say, discover.</l>
               <l>A second time these accents pierc'd the air:</l>
               <l>Sweet was the sound, transported was the fair.</l>
               <l>At length, mankind are just, her la'ship said;</l>
               <l>Threw on her gown, and stepping out of bed</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="174" facs="193"/> Look'd in her glass; confess'd him to be
right;—</l>
               <l>Who thinks me not a beauty, 'tis meer spite.</l>
               <l>Assemble ye coquets! with envy frown</l>
               <l>To see the wonders that my eyes have done.</l>
               <l>In vain your pert and forward airs you try,</l>
               <l>Mankind, the more you court, the farther fly,</l>
               <l>And 'tis for me, and only me, they die.</l>
               <l>But how shall I receive him? cry'd the dame;</l>
               <l>Prudence allows not pity:—I must blame.</l>
               <l>Perhaps, poor soul! he has sigh'd in secret long,</l>
               <l>Ere the presumptuous thought escap'd his tongue.</l>
               <l>I am the cause, yet innocent, by Heaven:—</l>
               <l>Why were these eyes for such destruction given?</l>
               <l>'Tis not my fault; I did not make one feature:—</l>
               <l>Then turn'd her look to view the <hi>dying creature.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Butah! who should the enamour'd swain now prove?—</l>
               <l>A wretch who <hi>dyes</hi> by <hi>Trade</hi> and not by <hi>Love.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>No mortal pen can figure her surprize,</l>
               <l>Willing to trust her ears but not her eyes:</l>
               <l>Th' approaching storm her swelling bosom show'd,</l>
               <l>Awhile now pale, then red with anger glow'd.</l>
               <l>She wept, she rav'd, invok'd the pow'rs above,</l>
               <l>Who give no ear when old maids talk of love.</l>
               <l>Fruitless her pray'rs, and impotent her rage,</l>
               <l>Yet sierce as when two female scolds engage.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="175" facs="194"/> At length the fire was spent, all was serene;</l>
               <l>A calm succeeded this tempestuous scene.</l>
               <l>And thus she spoke:</l>
               <l>Ye blooming maids! let my example prove</l>
               <l>How oft your sex mistaken are in love!</l>
               <l>When young, we're cruel, and with beauty play,</l>
               <l>Which while we vainly parley, fades away.</l>
               <l>When old, to encrease the rigour of our fate,</l>
               <l>We wish and talk of lovers when too late.</l>
               <l>As idle travellers who've lost the day,</l>
               <l>And hope in night through shades to find the way;</l>
               <l>Forlorn they tread the thorny paths in vain,</l>
               <l>Not of themselves, but their hard fate complain.</l>
               <l>So peevish maids when past their youthful bloom,</l>
               <l>On sad remains, and fancy'd charms presume;</l>
               <l>Lonely they wander, no companion find,</l>
               <l>Then rail, and quarrel with all human kind.</l>
               <l>But let us to ourselves for once be just,</l>
               <l>And see our own decays and wrinkles first.</l>
               <l>Whene'er to melting sighs we lend an ear,</l>
               <l>Think, youth and beauty make the men sincere.</l>
               <l>No other powers their stubborn hearts can move:—</l>
               <l>Did ever virtue light the torch of love?</l>
               <l>From sad experience I this truth declare;</l>
               <l>I am now abandon'd, though I once was fair.</l>

               <l>I have no more to wish, nor you to dread;</l>
               <l>I ask not life, for life to me were vain,</l>
               <l>And death a refuge from severer pain.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="183" facs="202"/> My only hope in these last lines I try;</l>
               <l>I would be pity'd, and I then would die.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Long had I liv'd as sordid as my fate,</l>
               <l>Nor curs'd the destiny that made me wait,</l>
               <l>A sordid slave: content with homely food,</l>
               <l>The gross instinct of appetite pursu'd,</l>
               <l>Youth gave me sleep at night, and warmth of blood.</l>
               <l>Ambition yet had never touch'd my breast;</l>
               <l>My lordly master knew no sounder rest;</l>
               <l>With labour healthy, in obedience blest.</l>
               <l>But when I saw—Oh had I never seen—</l>
               <l>That wounding softness, that engaging mien,</l>
               <l>The mist or wretched education flies;</l>
               <l>Shame, fear, desire, despair and love arise,</l>
               <l>The new creation of those beauteous eyes.</l>
               <l>But yet that love pursu'd no guilty aim,</l>
               <l>Deep in my heart I hid the secret flame:</l>
               <l>I never hop'd my fond desire to tell,</l>
               <l>And all my wishes were—to serve you well.</l>
               <l>Heav'ns! how I flew, when wing'd by your command,</l>
               <l>And kiss'd the letters giv'n me by your hand!</l>
               <l>How pleas'd, how proud, how fond was I to wait,</l>

               <l>And every sense was in the rapture drown'd!</l>
               <l>Tho' bid to go, I quite forgot to move—</l>

               <l>But oh! the torment not to be express'd,</l>
               <l>The grief, the rage, the hell, that fir'd this breast,</l>
               <l>When my great rivals, in embroidry gay,</l>
               <l>Sat by your side, or led you from the play!</l>
               <l>I still</l>
               <l>contriv'd near as I could to stand,</l>
               <l>(The flambeau trembling in my careless hand)</l>
               <l>I saw, or thought I saw, those fingers press'd;</l>
               <l>For thus their passion by my own I guess'd,</l>
               <l>And jealous fury all my soul possess'd:</l>
               <l>Like torrents, love and indignation meet,</l>
               <l>And madness would have thrown me at your feet.</l>
               <l>Turn, lovely nymph, (for so I would have said)</l>
               <l>Turn from those triflers who make love a trade;</l>
               <l>This is true passion in my eyes you see;</l>
               <l>They cannot, no—they cannot love like me.</l>
               <l>Frequent debauch has pall'd their sickly taste,</l>
               <l>Faint their desire, and in a moment past:</l>
               <l>They sigh not from the heart, but from the brain;</l>
               <l>Vapours of vanity and more champagne.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="185" facs="204"/> Too dull to feel what forms, like yours,
inspire,</l>
               <l>After long talking of their painted fire,</l>
               <l>To some lewd brothel they at night retire;</l>
               <l>There pleas'd with fancy'd quality and charms,</l>
               <l>Enjoy your beauties in a strumpet's arms.</l>
               <l>Such are the joys those toasters have in view,</l>
               <l>And such the wit and pleasure they pursue:—</l>
               <l>And is this love that ought to merit you?</l>
               <l>Each Opera night, a new address begun,</l>
               <l>They swear to thousands what they swear to one.</l>
               <l>Not thus I sigh—but all my sighs are vain—</l>
               <l>Die, wretched Arthur, and conceal thy pain;</l>
               <l>'Tis impudence to wish, and madness to complain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Fix'd on this view, my only hope of ease,</l>
               <l>I waited not the aid of slow disease;</l>
               <l>The keenest instruments of death I sought,</l>
               <l>And death alone employ'd my lab'ring thought.</l>
               <l>Thus all the night—when I remember well</l>
               <l>The charming tinkle of your morning bell,</l>
               <l>Fir'd by the sound, I hasten'd with your tea,</l>
               <l>With one last look to smooth the darksome way—</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="186" facs="205"/> But oh, how dear that fatal look cost!</l>
               <l>In that fond moment my resolves were lost.</l>
               <l>Hence all my guilt, and all my sorrows rise—</l>
               <l>I saw the languid softness of your eyes;</l>
               <l>I saw the dear disorder of your bed;</l>
               <l>Your cheeks all glowing with a tempting red;</l>
               <l>Your night-clothes tumbled with resistless grace;</l>
               <l>Your flowing hair play'd careless round your face;</l>
               <l>Your night-gown fasten'd with a single pin—</l>
               <l>Fancy improv'd the wondrous charms within!</l>
               <l>I fix'd my eyes upon that heaving breast,</l>
               <l>And hardly, hardly, I forebore the rest;</l>
               <l>Eager to gaze, unsatisfy'd with sight,</l>
               <l>My head grew giddy with the near delight:—</l>
               <l>Too well you know the fatal, following night!</l>

               <l>Condemn'd by you, I wait the righteous doom,</l>
               <l>Careless and fearless of the woes to come.</l>

            <head>Mr. JOHN PHILIPS's designed Dedication to his Poem called THE SPLENDID
SHILLING.</head>
            <head>To W. BROME, Esq. of <hi>Ewithington,</hi> in the County of
<hi>Hereford.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT would be too tedious an under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>taking
at this time to examine the rise and progress
of Dedications. The use of them is certainly an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cient,
as appears both from Greek and Latin authors;
and we have reason to believe that it was continued
without any interruption till the beginning of this
century, at which time, mottos, anagrams, and
frontispieces being introduced, Dedications were
mightily discouraged, and at last abdicated. But to
discover precisely when they were restored, and by
whom they were first usher'd in, is a work that far
transcends my knowledge; a work that can justly
be expected from no other pen but that of your
operose Doctor Bentley. Let us therefore at present
acquiesce in the dubiousness of their antiquity, and
think the authority of the past and present times a
<pb n="189" facs="208"/>
sufficient plea for your patronizing, and my dedi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cating
this poem. Especially since in this age Dedi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cations
are not only fashionable, but almost necessary;
and indeed they are now so much in vogue, that a
book without one, is as seldom seen as a bawdy-house
without a Practice of Piety, or a poet with money.
Upon this account, Sir, those who have no friends,
dedicate to all good christians; some to their book<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sellers;
some for want of a sublunary patron to the
manes of a departed one. There are, that have de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dicated
to their whores: God help those hen-peck'd
writers that have been forced to dedicate to their own
wives! but while I talk so much of other mens
patrons, I have forgot my own; and seem rather to
make an essay on Dedications, than to write one.
However, Sir, I presume you will pardon me for
that fault; and perhaps like me the better for saying
nothing to the purpose. You, Sir, are a person
more tender of other mens reputation than your own;
and would hear every body commended but yourself.
Should I but mention your skill in turning, and the
compassion you shew'd to my fingers ends when you
<pb n="190" facs="209"/>
gave me a tobacco stopper, you would blush and be
confounded with your just praises. How much more
would you, should I tell you what a progress you
have made in that abstruse and useful language, the
Saxon? Since, therefore, the recital of your excel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lencies
would prove so troublesome, I shall offend
your modesty no longer. Give me leave to speak a
word or two concerning the poem, and I have done.
This poem, Sir, if we consider the moral, the new<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
of the subject, the variety of images, and the
exactness of the similitudes that compose it, must
be allowed a piece that was never equalled by the
moderns or ancients. The subject of the poem is
myself, a subject never yet handled by any poets.
How it to be handled by all, we may learn by those
few divine commendatory verses written by the ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mirable
Monsieur le Bog. Yet since I am the sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject,
and the poet too, I shall say no more of it,
lest I should seem vain-glorious. As for the moral,
I have took particular care that it should lie in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cognito,
not like the ancients who let you know at
first sight they design something by their verses. But
<pb n="191" facs="210"/>
here you may look a good while, and perhaps, after
all, find that the poet has no aim or design, which
must needs be a diverting surprize to the reader.
What shall I say of the similes that are so full of
geography, that you must get a Welshman to un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derstand
them? that so raise our ideas of the things
they are apply'd to? that are so extraordinarily quaint
and well chosen that there's nothing like them? So
that I think I may, without vanity, say <hi>Avia Pieri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dum
peragro loca, &amp;c.</hi> Yet however excellent this
poem is, in the reading of it you will find a vast dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ference
between some parts and others; which pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceeds
not from your humble servant's negligence, but
diet. This poem was begun when he had little
victuals, and no moneys, and was finished when he
had the misfortune at a virtuous lady's house to meet
with both. But I hope, in time, Sir, when hunger
and poverty shall once more be my companions, to
make amends for the defaults of this poem, by an
essay on Minced Pies, which shall be devoted to you
with all submission, by,</p>

               <salute>DEAR Jo,</salute> 
            </opener>
            <p>I Am entering into proposals with a
bookseller for printing a little miscellany of my own
performances, consisting of some originals and select
Translations. I beg you to be altogether silent in
the matter. Mr. Pope has used so little of the 23d
Odyssey that I gave Dr. Younge, that if I put it in
among the rest I shall hardly incur any danger of
the penalty concerning the patent. However, I will
not presume to publish a single line of it after Mr.
Pope's Translation, if you advise me (as I desire you
to do sincerely) to the contrary. I shall send you a
small specimen of my Translation, which if you
approve of, I can assure you the remainder of the
book is not inferior to it.</p>

            <p>PRAY inform my Lord Harley that
I have on Thursday last seen the daughter of Milton
the poet. I carry'd with me two or three different
<pb n="196" facs="215"/>
prints of Milton's picture, which she immediately
knew to be like her father; and told me her mother-in-law
(if living in Cheshire) had two pictures of
him, one when he was a school boy, and the other
when he was about twenty. She knows of no other
picture of him, because she was several years in
Ireland, both before and after his death. She was
the youngest of Milton's daughters by his first wife,
and was taught to read to her father several languages.</p>
            <p>Mr. Addison was desirous to see her once, and
desired she would bring with her testimonials of be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
Milton's daughter, but as soon as she came into
the room he told her she needed none, her face
having much of the likeness of the pictures he had
seen of him.</p>
            <p>For my part, I find the features of her face very
much like the prints. I showed her the painting I
have to engrave, which she believes not to be her
father's picture, it being of a brown complexion,
and black hair, and curled locks. On the contrary,
he was of a fair complexion, a little red in his
cheeks, and light brown lank hair.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="216"/>
I desire you would acquaint Mr. Prior I was so
unfortunate to wait on him on Thursday morning
last, just after he was gone out of town. It was
with the intent to enquire of him if he remembers
a picture of Milton in the late Lord Dorset's col<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lection,
as I am told this was; or if he can inform
me how I shall enquire or know the truth of this
affair, I should be much obliged to him, being very
willing to have all the certainty on that account
before I begin to engrave the plate, that it may be
the more satisfactory to the publick, as well as to
myself.</p>

               <p>WE are indebted to Heaven for all
things, and above all for our sense and genius (in
whatever degree we have it); but to fancy yourself
indebted to any thing else, moves my anger at your
modesty. The regard I must bear you, seriously
proceeds from myself alone; and I will not suffer
even one I like so much as Mrs. H. to have a share
in causing it. I challenge a kind of relation to you
on the <hi>soul's</hi> side, which I take to be better than
either on a father's or mother's; and if you can
overlook an ugly <hi>body</hi> (that stands much in the way
of any friendship, when it is between different sexes)
I shall hope to find you a true and constant kinswo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man
in Apollo. Not that I would place all my
pretensions upon that poetical foot, much less con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fine
them to it; I am far more desirous to be ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mitted
<pb n="202" facs="221"/>
as yours, on the more meritorious title of
friendship. I have ever believed this as a sacred
maxim, that the most ingenious natures were the
most sincere; and the most knowing and sensible
minds made the best friends. Of all those that I
have thought it the felicity of my life to know, I
have ever found the most distinguished in capacity,
the most distinguished in morality: and those the
most to be depended on, whom one esteemed so
much as to desire they should be so. I beg you to
make me no more compliments. I could make you
a great many, but I know you neither need them,
nor can like them: be so good as to think I do not.
In one word, your writings are very good, and very
entertaining; but not so good, nor so entertaining,
as your life and conversation. One is but the effect
and emanation of the other. It will always be a
greater pleasure to me, to know you are well, than
that you write well, though every time you tell me
the one, I must know the other. I am willing to
spare your modesty; and therefore, as to your wri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ting,
may perhaps never say more (directly to your<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self)
than the few verses I send here; which (as a
<pb n="203" facs="222"/>
proof of my own modesty too) I made so long ago
as the day you sate for your picture, and yet never
till now durst confess to you.</p>

I shall grow more and more happy, the longer I live

               <p>THOUGH I am extremely obliged
by your agreeable letter, I will avoid all mention of
the pleasure you give me, that we may have no more
words about compliments; which I have often ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>served
people talk themselves into, while they en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deavour
to talk themselves out of. It is not more
the diet of friendship and esteem, than a few thin
wafers and marmalade were of so hearty a stomach
as Sancho's. In a word, I am very proud of my
new relation, and like Parnassus much the better,
since I found I had so good a neighbour there. Mrs.

sincerity; and when I am so happy as to meet

yours is.</p>

it was; there is in it a sensible melancholy,
and too true a picture of human life; so true an
one, that I can scarce wish the verses yours at the
expence of your thinking that way, so early. I
rather wish you may love the town (which the
author of those lines cannot <hi>immoderately</hi> do) these
many years. It is time enough to like, or affect to
like, the country, when one is out of love with all
but one's-self, and therefore studies to become agree<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able
or easy to one's-self. Retiring into one's-self
is generally the <hi>pis-aller</hi> of mankind. Would you
have me describe my solitude and grotto to you?
What if, after a long and painted description of
them in verse (which the writer I have just been

But soft recesses for th' uneasy mind,</l>

                     <l>Lies down to die (the arrow in his heart);</l>
                     <l>There hid in shades, and wasting day by day,</l>

                  </q>
If these lines want poetry, they do not want sense.
God Almighty long preserve you from a feeling of
them! The book you mention, Bruyere's Characters,
will make any one know the world; and I believe
at the same time despise it (which is a sign it will
make one know it thoroughly). It is certainly the
proof of a master-hand, that can give such striking
likenesses, in such slight sketches, and in so sew
strokes on each subject. In answer to your question
about Shakespear, the book is about a quarter printed,
and the number of emendations very great. I have
never indulged my own conjectures, but kept meerly
to such amendments as are authorized by old editions,
in the author's life-time: but I think it will be a
year at least before the whole work can be finished.
In reply to your very handsome (I wish it were a very

to observe, by what natural, gentle degrees I have
sunk to the humble thing I now am: first from a pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tending

to be the most agreeable in the world to any author,
That you are determined to write no more—It is
now the time then, not for me only, but for every
body, to write without fear, or wit: and I shall
give you the first example here. But for this assu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rance,
it would be every way too dangerous to cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>respond
with a lady, whose very first sight and very
first writings had such an effect, upon a man used to
what they call fine sights, and what they call fine
writings. Yet he has been dull enough to sleep
quietly, after all he has seen, and all he has read;
till yours broke in upon his stupidity and indolence,
and totally destroyed it. But, God be thanked, you
will write no more; so I am in no danger of in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>creasing

I am told, you named lately in a letter a place
called Twitenham, with particular distinction. That

your ignorance in the geography of these parts has
made you confound together. You will unthink<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ingly
do honour to a paltry hermitage (while you
speak of Twitenham) where lives a creature altoge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
unworthy your memory or notice, because he
really wishes he had never beheld you, nor yours.
You have spoiled him for a solitaire, and a book,
all the days of his life; and put him into such a
condition, that he thinks of nothing, and enquires
of nothing but after a person who has nothing to say
to him, and has left him for ever without hope of
ever again regarding, or pleasing, or entertaining
him, much less of seeing him. He has been so mad
with the idea of her, as to steal her picture, and
passes whole days in sitting before it, talking to him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self,
and (as some people imagine) making verses;

any of hers, he can never turn his head to his own,
it is so much better entertained.</p>

               <p>I Am touched with shame when I look
on the date of your letter. I have answered it a
hundred times in my own mind, which I assure you
has few thoughts, either so frequent or so lively, as
those relating to you. I am sensibly obliged by you,
in the comfort you endeavour to give me upon the
loss of a friend. It is like the shower we have had
this morning, that just makes the drooping trees
hold up their heads, but they remain checked and
withered at the root: the benediction is but a short
relief, though it comes from Heaven itself. The
loss of a friend is the loss of life; after that is gone
from us, it is all but a gentler decay, and wasting
and lingering a little longer. I was the other day

birth-day: and thinking of the greatest climax of
felicity I could raise, step by step, to end in this—a Friend. I fancy I have succeeded in the gradation,

               <p>YOUR last letter tells me, that if
I do not write in less than a month, you will fancy
the length of yours frighted me. A consciousness
that I had upon me of omitting too long to answer
it, made me look (not without some fear and trem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bling)
for the date of it: but there happened to be
none; and I hope, either that you have forgot how
long it is, or at least that you cannot think it so
long as I do, since I writ to you. Indeed a multi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tude
of things (which singly seem trifles, and yet
all together make a vast deal of business, and wholly
take up that time which we ought to value above all
such things) have from day to day made me wanting,
as well to my own greatest pleasure in this, as to my
own greatest concerns in other points. If I seem to
neglect any friend I have, I do more than seem to
neglect myself, as I find daily by the increasing ill
constitution of my body and mind. I still resolve
this course shall not, nay I see it cannot, be long;
<pb n="215" facs="234"/>
and I determine to retreat within myself to the only
business I was born for, and which I am only good
for (if I am entitled to use that phrase for any thing).
It is great folly to sacrifice one's self, one's time,
one's quiet (the very life of life itself), to forms,
complaisances, and amusements, which do not in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wardly
please me, and only please a sort of people
who regard me no farther than a meer instrument of
their present idleness, or vanity. To say truth, the
lives of those we call great and happy are divided
between those two states; and in each of them, we
poetical fiddlers make but part of their pleasure, or
of their equipage. And the misery is, we, in our
turns, are so vain (at least I have been so) as to
chuse to pipe without being paid, and so silly to be
pleased with piping to those who understand musick
less than ourselves. They have put me of late upon
a task before I was aware, which I am <hi>sick</hi> and <hi>sore</hi>

amply atoned for. I saw a few lines of yours to her,

imagined: if you put <hi>my welfare</hi> into the small num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber
of things which you heartily wish (for a sensible
person, of either sex, will never wish for many), I
ought to be a happier man than I ever yet deserved
to be.</p>
               <p>Upon a review of your papers, I have repented of
some of the trivial alterations I had thought of,
which were very few. I would rather keep them till
I have the satisfaction to meet you in the winter,

there is sometimes in men as well as in women, a

and to have told it her in distant or bashful terms,
would have appeared so like coldness in my sense of
good qualities (which I cannot find out in any one,

a great warmth for them) that I was quite at a loss

what to write, or in what stile, to you. But I am
resolved, plainly to get over all objections, and faith<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fully
to assure you, if you will help a bashful man
to be past all preliminaries, and forms, I am ready
to treat with you for your friendship. I know
(without more ado) you have a valuable soul; and
wit, sense, and worth enough, to make me reckon

you.</p>
               <p>I do not know, on the other hand, what you can

you shall find me a much better man, that is, a
much better friend, or at least a much less faulty
one, than I am a poet. That whatever zeal I may
have, or whatever regard I may shew, for things I

yet I shall still have more for your person,

play the critick to improve your verses. I have

I do not wonder that you decline the poetical
amusement I proposed to you, at this time. I know
(from what little I know of your heart) enough at
least to convince me, it must be too deeply concerned
at the loss, not only of so great, and so near a rela<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion;
but of a good man (a loss this age can hardly
ever afford to bear, and not often can sustain). Yet
perhaps it is one of the best things that can be said
of poetry, that it helps us to pass over the toils
and troubles of this tiresome journey, our life; as
horses are encouraged and spirited up, the better to
bear their labour, by the jingling of bells about
their heads. Indeed, as to myself, I have been used
to this odd cordial, so long, that it has no effect
upon me: but you, Madam, are in your honey<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>moon
of poetry; you have seen only the smiles, and
enjoyed the caresses, of Apollo. Nothing is so
pleasant to a Muse as the first children of the Ima<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gination;
but when once she comes to find it meer
conjugal duty, and the care of her numerous progeny
daily grows upon her, it is all a sour tax for past
pleasure. As the Psalmist says on another occasion,
the age of a Muse is scarce above five and twenty:

all the rest is labour and sorrow. I find by experi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ence

               <p>AFTER a very long expectation
and daily hopes of the satisfaction of seeing and
conversing with you, I am still deprived of it in a
manner that is the most afflicting, because it is oc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>casioned

               <p>I wish sincerely your condition were not such as
to debar me from telling you in person how truly I
am yours. I wish I could do you any little offices of
friendship, or give you any amusements, or help you
to what people in your present state most want,
better spirits. If reading to you, or writing to you,

you to a livelier relish of life, how well should I
think my time employed! indeed I should, and think
it a much better end of my poor studies, than all
the vanities of fame, or views of a character that
way, which engage most men of my fraternity.</p>
               <p>If you thoroughly knew the zeal with which I

and to throw up your spirits by intervals of moderate
company; not to let your distemper fix itself upon
your mind at least, though it will not entirely quit
your body. Do not indulge too much solitariness.
Though most company be not proper or supportable
during your illness, force yourself to enter into such
as is good and reasonable, where you may have your

                        <l>In Tempe's shades the living lyre was strung,</l>
                        <l>And the first Pope (immortal Phoebus) sung,</l>
                        <l>These happy shades, where equal beauty reigns,</l>
                        <l>Bold rising hills, slant vales, and far-stretch'd plains,</l>
                        <l>The grateful verdure of the waving woods,</l>
                        <l>The soothing murmur of the falling floods,</l>

                        <l>Than that which Phoebus stampt on Tempe's field:</l>

                  </note> BEDINGTON: I could wish you tried something
in the descriptive way on any subject you please,
mixed with vision and moral; like pieces of the old
provençal poets, which abound with fancy, and are
the most amusing scenes in nature. There are three
or four of this kind in Chaucer admirable: "The
Flower and the Leaf" every body has been de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lighted
with.</p>
               <p>I have long had an inclination to tell a Fairy tale,
the more wild and exotic the better; therefore a
<pb n="234" facs="253"/>
                  <hi>vision,</hi> which is confined to no rules of probability,
will take in all the variety and luxuriancy of de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scription
you will; provided there be an apparent
moral to it. I think, one or two of the Persian
Tales would give one hints for such an invention:
and perhaps if the scenes were taken from real places
that are known, in order to compliment particular
gardens and buildings of a fine taste (as I believe
several of Chaucer's descriptions do, though it is
what nobody has observed), it would add great
beauty to the whole.</p>
               <p>I wish you found such an amusement pleasing to
you: if you did but, at leisure, form descriptions
from objects in nature itself, which struck you most
livelily, I would undertake to find a tale that should
bring them all together: which you will think an
odd undertaking, but in a piece of this fanciful and
imaginary nature I am sure is practicable. Excuse
this long letter; and think no man is more</p>

            <p>☞ IN the Preface to an edition of Monsieur POUILLY
DE CHAMPEAUX's Works very lately published, is the
Extract of a Letter from Lord BOLINGBROKE to that
Gentleman. The original and translation are inserted
here. The comment is left to the reader.</p>
            <p>It may be necessary to add, That Monsieur POUILLY
DE CHAMPEAUX is a writer much esteemed on account
of the elegance and spirit of humanity that breathe
throughout his literary productions. The chief of these
is his Theory of Agreeable Sensations. As to his political
powers, they have never yet been celebrated by his country<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>men
in such a strain as to authorize the following compli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
to him on the part of Lord BOLINGBROKE.</p>

cette foule d'hommes que j'ai pu connoitre, et
dont j'ai cherché à étudier l'esprit et le charactère,
je n'en ai vu que TROIS qui m'aient paru dignes
qu'on leur confiât le soin de gouverner des nations.
Nôtre amitié est trop etroite, elle est, ainsi que
le diroit Montaigne, trop libre et trop franche dans
ses allures, pour que je m'enveloppe avec vous

de cette fausse modestie, dont il faut quelquefois

men whom it may have fallen in my way to
know, and whose understandings and characters
I have endeavoured to study, I have not yet
marked out above THREE that appeared to me
worthy of being trusted with the care of govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing

as Montaigne would perhaps choose to express
himself, too frank and free in its paces for me to
need, with you, the wrapping myself up in that
false modesty, of which there is sometimes a ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessity
for making a shield against envy. I shall
then tell you boldly that these three men are YOU,
