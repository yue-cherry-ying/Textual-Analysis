To Mr. GARRICK, upon his ARRIVAL.</head>
         <lg>
            <l>RETURN'D from travel to your native shore</l>

            <l>To turn your back, we hope, no more,</l>
            <l>Nor from your colours fly;</l>
         </lg>

            <l>Whether you fled for health, or quiet,</l>
            <l>Harrass'd with rule, or sick of riot,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="4"/>
Or whether you have kept us lean,</l>
            <l>As slander says,</l>
            <l>With lenten plays,</l>
            <l>To make our appetites more keen;</l>
            <l>Whether it be or this or that,</l>
            <l>No matter what,</l>
            <l>For we before the curtain see but blindly;</l>
            <l>Now you are come,</l>
            <l>To us, and home,</l>
            <l>We greet you, Sir, and greet you kindly.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>My Muse is honest, as she's bold,</l>
            <l>A forward Miss,</l>
            <l>Who loves to prate—but hold—</l>

No bird of prey, with wild uproar,</l>
            <l>Like CHURCHILL, to disturb the grove;</l>
            <l>Nor comes she, like the harmless dove,</l>
            <l>To bill, and coo, and love,</l>
            <l>—And nothing more.</l>
         </lg>

            <l>In short, to speak more plainly,</l>

            <l>Averse to flattery and spite,</l>
            <l>She is a modest, sober dame,</l>

            <l>Denote her wit, and sluttishness:</l>

The Critick's pen has various uses,</l>
            <l>It praises now, and now abuses,</l>

            <l>An APE there was, an APE of merit,</l>
            <l>A lively, sportive, pleasant thing,</l>
            <l>Had so much fancy, whim, and spirit,</l>
            <l>And made such sport,</l>
            <l>He got to Court,</l>
            <l>And shew'd his tricks before the LION-KING.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>Such honour gave him fame,</l>
            <l>And rais'd his name;</l>
            <l>From far and near they came to see</l>

               <pb n="8" facs="10"/>
Though none were more expert and quick,</l>
            <l>In tumbling backward o'er a stick;</l>
            <l>Though none with a more lordly pride,</l>

               <hi>The rugged, Russian bear</hi>;</l>

            <l>Physick, Divinity, or Law,</l>

In ridicule's enchanted glass,</l>

            <l>A neighbour, and her bosom friend:</l>

            <l>The GOAT look'd wise, and wagg'd his beard;</l>
            <l>The SPANIEL shook his ears;</l>
            <l>The Fox turn'd up his pointed nose;</l>
            <l>Thoughtful and dull the CAT appear'd,</l>

PUG sickens, mopes, and looks like death,</l>

A perriwig-pated block:</l>
            <l>Physicians for the Brutes were Fowls,</l>

            <l>His learning back'd by penetration,</l>

            <l>A rarity without dispute!</l>

            <l>Yet with this genius, worth, and knowledge,</l>
            <l>He had a stain, a deep disgrace,</l>

But hold—our hero out of sight,</l>
