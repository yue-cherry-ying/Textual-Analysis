            <p>THIS Paper is a Sort of Bill of Complaint, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gun many years since, and drawn up by snatches, as the several Occasions offer'd. I had no thoughts of publishing it, till it pleas'd some Persons of Rank and Fortune [the Authors of <hi>Verses to the Imitator of Horace,</hi> and of an <hi>Epistle to a Doctor of Divinity from a Nobleman at Hampton Court,</hi>] to attack in a very extraordinary manner, not only my Writings (of which being publick the Publick judge) but my <hi>Person, Morals,</hi> and <hi>Family,</hi> whereof to those who know me not, a truer Information may be requisite. Being di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vided between the Necessity to say something of <hi>Myself,</hi> and my own Laziness to undertake so awkward a Task, I thought it the shortest way to put the last hand to this Epistle. If it have any thing pleasing, it will be That by which I am most desirous to please, the <hi>Truth</hi> and the <hi>Sentiment;</hi> and if any thing offensive, it will be only to those I am least sorry to offend, the <hi>Vicious</hi> or <hi>the Ungenerous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many will know their own Pictures in it, there be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing not a Circumstance but what is true; but I have, for
<pb facs="3"/>
the most part spar'd their <hi>Names,</hi> and they may escape being laugh'd at, if they please.</p>
            <p>I would have some of them know, it was owing to the Request of the learned and candid Friend to whom it is inscribed, that I make not as free use of theirs as they have done of mine. However I shall have this Advan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tage, and Honour, on my side, that whereas by their pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceeding, any Abuse may be directed at any man, no Injury can possibly be done by mine, since a Nameless Character can never be found out, but by its <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Likeness.</hi>
