               <l>I came from Country here to try my Fate,</l>

               <l>Law! how I star'd!—I thought,—who knows, but I,</l>
               <l>For want of Monsters, may be made a Pye;</l>
               <l>Rather than tarry here for Bribe or Gain,</l>

               <l>She turn'd the World top down, as I may say,</l>
               <l>She chang'd the Day to Neet, the Neet to Day!</l>
               <l>I was so sheam'd with all her freakish Ways,</l>
               <l>She wore her Gear so short, so low her Stays—</l>

               <l>There are but three on's—Measter, I, and Cat.</l>
               <l>Did you but see us all, as I'm a Sinner,</l>

               <l>My Wages all depend on this Night's Piece,</l>

            <l>Shall we of Rank be told what's right and wrong?</l>
            <l>Had you ten Epilogues you shou'd not speak 'em,</l>

            <l>Behold a Gentleman!—and that's enough!—</l>
            <l>Laugh if you please—I'll take a Pinch of Snuff!</l>
            <l>I come to tell you—(let it not surprise you)</l>
            <l>That I'm a Wit—and worthy to advise you.—</l>
            <l>How could you suffer that same Country Booby,</l>
            <l>That Pro-logue speaking Savage,—that great Looby,</l>
            <l>To talk his Nonsense?—give me Leave to say</l>
            <l>'Twas low—damn'd low!—but save the Fellow's Play—</l>
            <l>Let the poor Devil eat,—allow him that,</l>

               <hi>And give a Meal to</hi> Measter, Mon, <hi>and</hi> Cat,</l>
            <l>But why attack the Fashions?—Senseless Rogue!—</l>
            <l>We have no Joys but what result from Vogue:</l>
            <l>The Mode shou'd all Controll—nay, ev'ry Passion,</l>
            <l>Sense, Appetite, and all, give way to Fashion;</l>

               <pb facs="4"/>
               <hi>I hate as much as he, a</hi> Turtle-Feast,</l>

            </l>
            <l>I'd ride a hundred Miles to make myself a Beast.</l>
            <l>I have no Ears,—yet Op'ras I adore!—</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Always prepar'd</hi> to die—to sleep—no more!</l>
            <l>The Ladies too were carp'd at, and their Dress,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>He wants 'em all ruff'd up like good Queen</hi> Bess!</l>
            <l>They are, forsooth, too much expos'd, and free—</l>
            <l>Were more expos'd, no ill Effects I see,</l>
            <l>For more, or less, 'tis all the same to me.</l>
            <l>Poor Gaming too, was mauld among the rest,</l>
            <l>That precious Cordial to a high-life Breast!</l>
            <l>When Thoughts arise I always game, or drink,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>An</hi> English <hi>Gentleman shou'd never think—</hi>

            <l>Which always ends in Politicks or Madness:</l>
            <l>I therefore now propose—by your Command,</l>
            <l>That Tragedies no more shall cloud this Land;</l>
            <l>

            <p>The Author of the Prologue and Epilogue, would not have publish'd them had it not been customary to print them with the Play. He is very sensible that they can have little or no Merit in the Reading, their Effect wholly depending upon the Characters which speak them, and the Novelty of introducing them. They were likewise written at a very short Warning, for the Author of the Play, had not provided these usual, and therefore necessary, Parts of the Performance, which Mr. GARRICK thought proper to provide at all Events.</p>

               <l>True: We have conquer'd now. ALGIERS is mine,</l>
