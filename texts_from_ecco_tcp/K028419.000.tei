               <hi>The following Piece is taken from an underplot in The First Part of King Edward the Fourth, written by Thomas Heywood; the dialogue has been altered a little, to render it fit for modern representation; and a few passages have been added for connexion and conclusion.</hi>

            <p>The Dramatic Piece of <hi>"The King in the Country,"</hi> was compiled and performed last summer, imme<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diately on <hi>His Majesty's</hi> return from Cheltenham; when Entertainments of various kinds were exhi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bited at the different Places of Public Amusement, having relation to the Royal Excursion. The Ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lamity which, to the grief of every good mind, has since befallen <hi>Our Beloved Sovereign,</hi> does not, it is pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sumed, render the publication of this Drama im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proper; had the Editor thought it so, it would cer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tainly have been withheld: for, having been honoured with <hi>The Royal Authority</hi> to superintend Theatrical Entertainments these ten years past (during which period it has been necessary for him to adapt pieces of a local, or temporary nature, to Provincial Theatres), no one can entertain a more proper sense of duty, respect, loyalty, and affection, to <hi>Our most gracious King,</hi> whom God preserve and restore!</p>

               <l>At morn, at noon, by evening-taper,</l>
               <l>Of Cheltenham-water, wooden-house,</l>
               <l>Now left to prowling rat or mouse;</l>
               <l>With smart bon-mots, and anecdotes</l>
               <l>Of Prince and Peasant, Crowns and Cotes;</l>
               <l>And how, surprised, the rustics ran</l>
               <l>To see the King was but a man;</l>
               <l>Wond'ring that blue-coat and bob-wig</l>
               <l>Were worn by one they thought so big,</l>
               <l>Great Gog or Magog's coat of mail</l>
               <l>To cover him would surely fail:</l>
               <l>How stars and garters clowns did scare,</l>
               <l>And make them at a distance stare;</l>
               <l>With Mayors, most loyally addressing,</l>
               <l>To beg of Majesty the blessing</l>
               <l>Of one short visit to their city,</l>
               <l>Which they, no doubt, had trimm'd up pretty:</l>

               <l>Most courteous adds, "God bless the cryer!"</l>

               <l>Antique the phrase, and coarse the manners,</l>
               <l>Yet such as suited Kings and Tanners</l>
               <l>Who lived three hundred years ago,</l>
               <l>When few could to a goose say Bo!</l>
               <l>And needy Kings would beg or borrow</l>
               <l>What their poor subjects' toil and sorrow</l>
               <l>Had scraped together: happier now!</l>

               <l>Nor King demands, nor subjects grieve,</l>
               <l>Beneath our vines content we live!</l>

                        <q>Mr. Urban, I should be obliged to any of your topographical friends, to inform me, why so many towns in North Wiltshire have the addition of <hi>Basset</hi> to their names, as <hi>Wotton Basset, Compton Basset, Berwick Basset,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.? Every singularity of the kind should be traced to its source; as it frequently produces exemplifications of an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cient customs, or leads imperceptibly to discussions of antiquity, that seldom fail of rewarding us with some knowledge, that was before lost to all but the incurious tenant of the soil.

                        </q>
                        <q>The several towns in North Wiltshire which have the addition of <hi>Basset</hi> to their names, derive it from their owner <hi>Philip Basset,</hi> who had considerable property in the county, and was a younger branch of the Bassets of Edendon there. See Dugdale's Bar. l. 383, 385. P.P. <bibl>

                  <speaker>Hobbs.</speaker>
                  <p>Courser, call'st thou him? he's too fine for me! thy skittish jade will neither carry my leather, horns, nor hides. But if I were so mad to change, what would'st thou give me to boot?</p>

                  <speaker>Hobbs.</speaker>
                  <p>Ha, ha, ha! that's a merry jig! why, man, Brock, my mare, knows <hi>ha</hi> and <hi>ree;</hi> will stand when I cry <hi>ho,</hi> let me get up when I say <hi>hi,</hi> and down when I say <hi>hee.</hi>

                  <p>Well, I'll give thee a noble if I like her pace; lay thy cow-hides on my saddle, and let's jog towards Drayton.</p>

                  <speaker>Hobbs.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>

                  <p>Mass, they say King Harry's a very advowtry man.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Hobbs.</speaker>
                  <p>He's a frank franion, a merry companion, and loves a wench well; they say he has married a poor widow because she is fair.</p>

                  <speaker>Hobbs.</speaker>
                  <p>No, by my feckens, but the better; for though I be but a plain Tanner, I love a fair lass myself.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hobbs.</speaker>
                  <p>Faith, as poor folks love holidays.—Glad to have them now and then, but to have them come too often would undo them; so to see the King now and then is a comfort, but to behold him every day would beggar us; and I may say to thee, under the rose, we fear we shall be troubled to lend him money, for we doubt he's but needy.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>Would'st thou not lend him money if he should need it?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hobbs.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, by my holydame! he shall have half my purse, and I'll sell sole-leather to help him to more.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>In faith now, which lov'st thou best, Harry or Edward?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hobbs.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, that's a secret! and two may keep it, if one be away.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>Shall I say my conscience? I think Harry is the true King.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hobbs.</speaker>
                  <p>Art advised of that? Harry's of the old house of Lancaster, and that progenity do I love.</p>

                  <speaker>King.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hobbs.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, no; for I am just a-kin to Sutton wind-mill; I can grind which way soe'er the wind blow: If it be Harry, I can say well fare Lancaster! if it be Edward, I can sing, York, York for my money!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p>Thou art of my mind, for I say Harry is the lawful King; Edward is but a usurper; fool and a coward.</p>
