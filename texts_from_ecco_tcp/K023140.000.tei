            <l>WELL, if it be my time to quit the Stage,</l>
            <l>Adieu to all the Follies of the Age!</l>
            <l>I die in Charity with Fool and Knave,</l>
            <l>Secure of Happiness beyond the Grave.</l>
            <l>I've had my <hi>Purgatory</hi> here betimes,</l>
            <l>And paid for all my Satires, all my Rhymes:</l>
            <l>The Poet's Hell, its Tortures, Fiends and Flames,</l>
            <l>To this were Trifles, Toys, and empty Names.</l>

            <l>With foolish <hi>Pride</hi> my Heart was never fir'd,</l>
            <l>Nor the vain Itch <hi>t'admire,</hi> or <hi>be admir'd;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I hop'd for no <hi>Commission</hi> from his Grace;</l>
            <l>I bought no <hi>Benefice,</hi> I begg'd no <hi>Place;</hi>

            <l>Yet went to COURT!—the Dev'l wou'd have it so.</l>
            <l>But, as the Fool, that in reforming Days</l>
            <l>Wou'd go to Mass in jest, (as Story says)</l>
            <l>Could not but think, to pay his <hi>Fine</hi> was odd,</l>
            <l>Since 'twas no form'd Design of serving God:</l>
            <l>Such was my Fate; whom Heav'n adjudg'd as <hi>proud,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>As prone to <hi>Ill,</hi> as negligent of <hi>Good,</hi>
            </l>
