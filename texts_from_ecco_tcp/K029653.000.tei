            <l>ACTING, dear <hi>Bonnell,</hi> it's Perfection draws</l>
            <l>From no Observance of mechanic Laws.</l>
            <l>No settled Maxims of a fav'rite Stage,</l>
            <l>No Rules deliver'd down from Age to Age,</l>
            <l>Let Players nicely mark them as they will,</l>
            <l>Can e'er entail hereditary Skill.</l>
            <l>If 'mongst the humble Hearers of the Pit,</l>
            <l>At some lov'd Play the old Man chance to sit,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="4"/>Am I pleas'd more because 'twas acted so</l>
            <l>By <hi>Booth</hi> and <hi>Cibber</hi> thirty Years ago?</l>
            <l>The Mind recalls an Object held more dear,</l>
            <l>And hates the Copy that it comes so near.</l>
            <l>Why lov'd we <hi>Wilks's</hi> Air, <hi>Booth's</hi> nervous Tone?</l>
            <l>In them 'twas natural, 'twas all their own.</l>
            <l>A <hi>Garrick's</hi> Genius must our Wonder raise,</l>
            <l>But gives his Mimic no reflected Praise.</l>
            <l>Thrice happy Genius, whose unrival'd Name</l>
            <l>Shall live for ever in the Voice of Fame!</l>
            <l>'Tis thine to lead with more than magic Skill,</l>
            <l>The Train of captive Passions at thy Will;</l>
            <l>To bid the bursting Tear spontaneous flow</l>
            <l>In the sweet Sense of sympathetic Woe.</l>
            <l>Through ev'ry Vein I feel a Chilness creep,</l>
            <l>When Horrors such as thine <hi>have murder'd Sleep.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="5"/>And at the old Man's Look and frantic Stare</l>
            <l>'Tis <hi>Lear</hi> alarms me, for I see him there.</l>
            <l>Nor yet confin'd to tragic Walks alone</l>
            <l>The comic Muse too claims thee for her own.</l>
            <l>With each delightful Requisite to please,</l>
            <l>Taste, Spirit, Judgment, Elegance, and Ease,</l>
            <l>Familiar Nature forms thy only Rule,</l>
            <l>From <hi>Ranger's</hi> Rake to <hi>Drugger's</hi> vacant Fool.</l>
            <l>With Powers so pliant, and so various blest,</l>
            <l>That what we see the last, we like the best.</l>
            <l>Not idly pleas'd at Judgment's dear Expence</l>
            <l>But burst ourageous with the laugh of Sense.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>PERFECTION'S Top with weary Toil and Pain</l>
            <l>'Tis Genius only that can hope to gain.</l>
            <l>The Play'r's Profession (tho' I hate the Phrase,</l>
            <l>'Tis so <hi>mechanic</hi> in these modern Days)</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="6"/>Lies not in Trick, or Attitude, or Start,</l>
            <l>Nature's true Knowledge is his only Art.</l>
            <l>The strong-felt Passion bolts into the Face,</l>
            <l>The Mind untouch'd, what is it but Grimace?</l>
            <l>To this one Standard make your just Appeal</l>
            <l>Here lies the golden Secret; learn to FEEL.</l>
            <l>Or Fool or Monarch, happy or distrest,</l>
            <l>No Actor pleases that is not <hi>possess'd.</hi>
            </l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>ONCE on the Stage in <hi>Rome's</hi> declining Days,</l>
            <l>When Christians were the Subject of their Plays,</l>
            <l>Ere Persecution dropp'd her iron Rod,</l>
            <l>And Mortals wag'd an impious War with God,</l>
            <l>An Actor flourish'd of no vulgar Fame,</l>
            <l>Nature's Disciple, and <hi>Genest</hi> his Name.</l>
            <l>A noble Object for his Skill he chose,</l>
            <l>A Martyr dying midst insulting Foes.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="7"/>Resign'd with Patience to Religion's Laws,</l>
            <l>Yet braving Monarchs in his <hi>Saviour's</hi> Cause.</l>
            <l>Fill'd with th' Idea of the sacred Part,</l>
            <l>He felt a Zeal beyond the reach of Art,</l>
            <l>While Look and Voice, and Gesture all exprest</l>
            <l>A kindred Ardour in the Player's Breast,</l>
            <l>Till as the Flame thro' all his Bosom ran,</l>
            <l>He lost the Actor and commenc'd the Man:</l>
            <l>Profest the Faith, his pagan Gods denied,</l>
            <l>And what he acted then, he after died.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>THE Player's Province they but vainly try,</l>
            <l>Who want these pow'rs <hi>Deportment, Voice,</hi> and <hi>Eye.</hi>
            </l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>THE Critic Sight 'tis only <hi>Grace</hi> can please</l>
            <l>No Figure charms us if it has not <hi>Ease.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb n="6" facs="8"/>There are who think the Stature all in all,</l>
            <l>Nor like the Hero if he is not tall.</l>
            <l>The feeling Sense all other Wants supplies,</l>
            <l>I rate no Actor's Merit from his Size.</l>
            <l>Superior Hight requires superior Grace,</l>
            <l>And what's a Giant with a vacant Face?</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>THEATRIC Monarchs in their tragic Gait</l>
            <l>Affect to mark the solemn Pace of State.</l>
            <l>One Foot put forward in Position strong,</l>
            <l>The other like its Vassal dragg'd along.</l>
            <l>So grave each Motion, so exact and slow,</l>
            <l>Like wooden Monarchs at a Puppet-Show.</l>
            <l>The Mien delights us that has native Grace</l>
            <l>But Affectation ill supplies its Place.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <pb n="7" facs="9"/>
            <l>UNSKILFUL Actors, like your mimic Apes,</l>
            <l>Will writhe their Bodies in a thousand Shapes;</l>
            <l>However foreign from the Poet's Art,</l>
            <l>No tragic Hero but admires a Start.</l>
            <l>What though unfeeling of the nervous Line,</l>
            <l>Who but allows his <hi>Attitude</hi> is fine?</l>
            <l>While a whole Minute equipoiz'd he stands,</l>
            <l>Till Praise dismiss him with her echoing Hands.</l>
            <l>Resolv'd, though Nature hate the tedious Pause,</l>
            <l>By Perseverance to extort Applause.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Romeo</hi> sorrowing at his <hi>Juliet's</hi> Doom,</l>
            <l>With eager Madness bursts the canvass Tomb,</l>
            <l>The sudden Whirl, stretch'd Leg, and lifted Staff,</l>
            <l>Which please the Vulgar, make the Critic laugh.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <pb n="8" facs="10"/>
            <l>TO point the Passion's Force, and mark it well,</l>
            <l>The proper Action Nature's Self will tell.</l>
            <l>No pleasing Pow'rs Distortions e'er express,</l>
            <l>And nicer Judgment always loaths Excess.</l>
            <l>In Sock or Buskin who o'erleaps the Bounds,</l>
            <l>Disgusts our Reason, and the Taste confounds.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>OF all the Evils which the Stage molest</l>
            <l>I hate your Fool who overacts his Jest.</l>
            <l>Who murders what the Poet finely writ,</l>
            <l>And like a Bungler haggles all his Wit,</l>
            <l>With Shrug, and Grin, and Gesture out of Place,</l>
            <l>And writes a foolish Comment with his Face.</l>
            <l>Old <hi>Johnson</hi> once, tho' <hi>Cibber's</hi> perter Vein,</l>
            <l>But meanly groupes him with a num'rous Train,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="9" facs="11"/>With steady Face, and sober hum'rous Mien,</l>
            <l>Fill'd the strong Outlines of the comic Scene.</l>
            <l>What was writ down, with decent Utterance spoke,</l>
            <l>Betray'd no Symptom of the conscious Joke;</l>
            <l>The very Man in Look, in Voice, in Air,</l>
            <l>And though upon the Stage, he seem'd no Play'r.</l>
            <l>The Word and Action should conjointly suit,</l>
            <l>But acting Words is labour too minute.</l>
            <l>Grimace will ever lead the Judgment wrong,</l>
            <l>While sober Humour marks th' Impression strong.</l>
            <l>Her proper Traits the fixt Attention hit,</l>
            <l>And bring me closer to the Poet's Wit;</l>
            <l>With her delighted o'er each Scene I go,</l>
            <l>Well-pleas'd, and not asham'd of being so.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>'TIS not enough the <hi>Voice</hi> be sound and clear,</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="10" facs="12"/>When desperate Heroines grieve with tedious Moan,</l>
            <l>And whine their Sorrows in a see-saw Tone;</l>
            <l>The same soft Sounds of unimpassioned Woes</l>
            <l>Can only make the yawning Hearers doze.</l>
         </lg>

            <l>THE Voice all Modes of Passion can express,</l>
            <l>That marks the proper Word with proper Stress.</l>
            <l>But none emphatic can that Actor call,</l>
            <l>Who lays an equal Emphasis on <hi>all.</hi>

            <l>Their Words, like Stage-Processions stalk along.</l>
            <l>All Affectation but creates Disgust,</l>
            <l>And e'en in speaking <hi>We</hi> may seem <hi>too</hi> just.</l>

            <l>For them in vain the pleasing Measure flows</l>
            <l>Whose Recitation runs it all to Prose;</l>
            <l>Repeating what the Poet sets not down,</l>
            <l>The Verb disjointing from its friendly Noun.</l>
            <l>While Pause, and Break, and Repetition join</l>

         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>SOME placid Natures fill th' allotted Scene</l>
            <l>With lifeless Drone, insipid and serene;</l>
            <l>While others thunder ev'ry Couplet o'er,</l>
            <l>And almost crack your Ears with Rant and Roar.</l>
            <l>In so much Noise but little Sense is found,</l>

            <l>And <hi>Hamlet's</hi> hollow Voice and fixt Amaze,</l>

            <l>THERE is a Fault which stirs the Critic's Rage,</l>
            <l>A Want of due Attention on the Stage.</l>
            <l>There have been Actors, and admir'd ones too,</l>
            <l>Whose tongues wound up set forward from their cue.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="14" facs="16"/>In their own Speech who whine, or roar away,</l>
            <l>Yet unconcern'd at what the rest may say.</l>
            <l>Whose Eyes and Thoughts on diff'rent Objects roam</l>
            <l>Until the Prompter's Voice recall them home.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>DIVEST yourself of Hearers if you can,</l>
            <l>And strive to speak, and be the very Man.</l>
            <l>Why should the well-bred Actor wish to know</l>
            <l>Who sits above To-night, or who below.</l>
            <l>So mid th' harmonious Tones of Grief or Rage,</l>
            <l>Italian Squallers oft disgrace the Stage.</l>
            <l>When with a simp'ring Leer, and Bow profound,</l>
            <l>The squeaking <hi>Cyrus</hi> greets the Boxes round;</l>
            <l>Or proud <hi>Mandane</hi> of imperial Race,</l>
            <l>Familiar drops a Curtsie to her Grace.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <pb n="15" facs="17"/>
            <l>TO suit the Dress demands the Actor's Art,</l>
            <l>Yet there are those who over-dress the Part.</l>
            <l>To some prescriptive Right gives settled Things,</l>
            <l>Black Wigs to Murd'rers, feather'd Hats to Kings.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Michel Cassio</hi> might be drunk enough,</l>
            <l>Tho' all his Features were not grim'd with Snuff.</l>
            <l>Why shou'd <hi>Pol Peachum</hi> shine in sattin Cloaths?</l>
            <l>Why ev'ry Devil dance in scarlet Hose?</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>BUT in Stage-Customs what offends me most</l>
            <l>Is the Slip-door, and slowly-rising Ghost.</l>
            <l>Tell me, nor count the Question too severe,</l>
            <l>Why need the dismal powder'd Forms appear?</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>WHEN chilling Horrors shake th' affrighted King,</l>
            <l>And Guilt torments him with her Scorpion Sting;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="16" facs="18"/>When keenest Feelings at his Bosom pull,</l>
            <l>And Fancy tells him that the Seat is full,</l>
            <l>Why need the Ghost usurp the Monarch's Place,</l>
            <l>To frighten Children with his mealy Face?</l>
            <l>The King alone should form the Phantom there,</l>
            <l>And talk and tremble at the vacant Chair.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>IF <hi>Belvidera</hi> her lov'd Loss deplore,</l>
            <l>Why for twin Spectres bursts the yawning Floor?</l>
            <l>When with disorder'd Starts, and horrid Cries,</l>
            <l>She paints the murder'd Forms before her Eyes,</l>
            <l>And still pursues them with a frantic Stare:</l>
            <l>'Tis pregnant Madness brings the Visions there.</l>
            <l>More instant Horror would enforce the Scene,</l>
            <l>If all her Shuddrings were at Shapes unseen.</l>

            <l>POET and Actor thus with blended Skill,</l>
            <l>Mould all our Passions to their instant Will;</l>
            <l>'Tis thus, when feeling <hi>Garrick</hi> treads th' Stage,</l>
            <l>(The speaking Comment of his <hi>Shakespear's</hi> Page.)</l>
            <l>Oft as I drink the Words with greedy Ears,</l>
            <l>I shake with Horror, or dissolve with Tears.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>O ne'er may Folly seize the Throne of Taste,</l>
            <l>Nor Dulness lay the Realms of Genius waste.</l>
            <l>No bouncing Crackers ape the Thundrer's Fire,</l>
            <l>No Tumbler float upon the bending Wire.</l>
            <l>More natural Uses to the Stage belong,</l>
            <l>Than Tumblers, Monsters, Pantomime, or Song.</l>
            <l>For other Purpose was that Spot design'd;</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="18" facs="20"/>To give to Nature all the Force of Art,</l>

               <hi>Thornton,</hi> to Thee I dare with Truth commend,</l>
            <l>The decent Stage as Virtue's natural Friend.</l>
            <l>Tho' oft debas'd with Scenes profane and loose,</l>
            <l>No Reason weighs against it's proper Use.</l>

            <l>Who teach the Mind it's proper Force to scan,</l>
            <l>And hold the faithful Mirrour up to Man,</l>
            <l>Shall their Profession e'er provoke Disdain,</l>

            <l>YET, hapless Artist, tho' thy Skill can raise</l>

            <l>Know Fame awards Thee but a partial Breath,</l>

            <l>Poets to Ages yet unborn appeal,</l>

            <l>Tho' blended here the Praise of Bard and Play'r,</l>
            <l>While more than Half becomes the Actor's Share,</l>
            <l>Relentless Death untwists the mingled Fame,</l>
            <l>And sinks the Player in the Poet's Name.</l>
