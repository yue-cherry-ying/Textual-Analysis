            <p>THE very favourite Song of, "How stands the glass around, my boys?" is so pecu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liarly adapted to the situation in which it is in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>troduced, that the Author hopes he will not be censured for the sacrifice he has made of origi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nality in adopting it. It is moreover written in a spirit and taste which is much easier to admire than equal. As to the rest of the songs, they are all his own; and he fears he must trust more to the indulgence of the public in regard to them, than to any thing he can say, or has written in their favour.</p>

                  <p>What, is it the Brandy you mean? By my soul, there's no danger of that: brandy's a French spi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rit, and that never got into an Englishman's head or his heart either when he was going to battle; therefore as I am an Irishman, there's no fear of me; so here goes, I am sure it won't choak me. <stage>(Drinks and exit.)</stage>

                  <p>You were my father's friend; he put me under your care when I came into the army, and I have ever looked up to you as to himself.</p>

                  <p>And is this a time to think of such sol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lies? just when you are going to action! Recollect yourself, boy, you are a soldier, your father was one; dishonour never changed his cheek, and don't you bring a blush there in his old age.</p>

                  <p>But give me leave to do away the very shadow of cause for this degrading notion being enter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tained of my nature. I meant only to have told you, that the lovely woman in whom my whole life and happiness are wrapped up, is this very night to be conveyed privately to Barbary, in order to be married to Solomon the Jew, whom you have often seen at her father's.</p>

                  <p>An Arabian slave, in whom she places great confidence, told me of it; but it is no matter, you have convinced me of the impropriety of my passion, and I resign her.</p>

                  <p>No, no, Frank, you shan't lose her neither, if in my power to prevent it. Let me see; <stage>(looks at his watch)</stage> I'll give you an hour; go see her, and learn the time, and in what manner she and her Hebrew partner set off.</p>

                  <p>Not at all; he purchased me at Cairo from an Arabian merchant when I was but four years old. I never saw the father who begat me, nor the mother who brought me into the world. He knows I have no brother, no sister, no tie of kindred upon earth, to make my affections wander from this spot. He thinks I look up to him as my only relation, but my attachment to my dear mistress, united to the natural passion of man for liberty, which only with life leaves us, makes me do a violence to my nature, and for the first time deceive him.</p>

                  <p>Two heads, to be sure, would be a great ornament to a man, but with the additions generally made by a fashionable wife, they are more, I am sure, than any man could carry upon his shoulders—but you'll not forget your promise, madam?</p>

                  <p>Eat and drink, and sleep as we do, Jenny! why, to be sure, there is this observation I have made on the people of Barbary: they never eat when they have got nothing to sit down to; as to drinking, it's much the same; and as to sleeping, in the whole course of my travels through the country, I never met with man, woman or child, able to get a wink of sleep, who was not extremely drowzy.</p>

                  <p>Vantage! why we have taken five, sunk two, and blown up one; that's all. It's a great pity there were not a few more to give a good account of.</p>

                  <p>I request, sir, you would go instantly with your dispatches to the Governor: this is a piece of intelligence which once more dispels the gloom from Gibraltar. Let the whole garrison salute the fleet, for the strength and bulwark of England at all times has proved her navy.</p>
