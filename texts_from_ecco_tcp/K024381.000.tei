               <p>Yes, and it was my fault too, that they did not discover us.—A house!—then all my fears are over. I thought we should never have found an end to this black wood; and, to tell you the truth, I had made up my mind to the comfortable pros<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pect of passing the night in the arms of one of the bears that were howling about us.—Won't you go in, Sir?—though I see nobody there to open the door to us.</p>

Now wou'dn't it be more natural to get back to Warsaw as fast as we can, and wait there, 'till her father sends for the princess home again? It must happen sooner or later.
