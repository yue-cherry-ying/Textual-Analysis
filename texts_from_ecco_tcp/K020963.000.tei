            <l>HOW much mistaken are the men, who think</l>
            <l>That all who will, without restraint, may drink,</l>
            <l>May largely drink, e'en till their bowels burst,</l>
            <l>Pleading no right but merely that of thirst,</l>
            <l>At the pure waters of the living well,</l>
            <l>Beside whose streams the MUSES love to dwell!</l>
            <l>Verse is with them a knack, an idle toy,</l>
            <l>A rattle gilded o'er, on which a boy</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="4"/>May play untaught, whilst, without art or force,</l>
            <l>Make it but jingle, Musick comes of course.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>Little do such men know the toil, the pains,</l>
            <l>The daily, nightly racking of the brains,</l>
            <l>To range the thoughts, the matter to digest,</l>
            <l>To cull fit phrases, and reject the rest,</l>
            <l>To know the times when HUMOUR, on the cheek</l>
            <l>Of MIRTH may hold her sports, when WIT should speak,</l>
            <l>And when be silent; when to use the pow'rs</l>
            <l>Of Ornament, and how to place the flow'rs,</l>
            <l>So that they neither give a tawdry glare,</l>
            <l>Nor waste their sweetness in the desart air;</l>
            <l>To form (which few can do, and scarcely one,</l>
            <l>One Critick in an age can find, when done)</l>
            <l>To form a plan, to strike a grand Outline,</l>
            <l>To fill it up, and make the picture shine</l>
            <l>A full, and perfect piece; to make coy rime</l>
            <l>Renounce her follies, and with sense keep time,</l>
            <l>To make proud sense against her nature bend,</l>
            <l>And wear the chains of rime, yet call her friend.</l>

            <l>With various <hi>tints,</hi> let Clouds be <hi>lac'd</hi> or <hi>fring'd,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They have their wish; like idle monarch Boys,</l>
            <l>Neglecting things of weight, they sigh for toys;</l>
            <l>Give them the crown, the sceptre, and the robe,</l>

            <l>Railing at needful Ornament, depend</l>
            <l>On Sense to bring them to their journey's end.</l>
            <l>They would not (Heav'n forbid) their course delay,</l>
            <l>Nor for a moment step out of the way,</l>
            <l>To make the barren road those graces wear,</l>

         <lg>

            <l>Ne'er find a passage to the heart of man;</l>
            <l>Who, bred 'mongst fogs in Academic land,</l>
            <l>Scorn ev'ry thing they do not understand;</l>
            <l>Who, destitute of Humour, Wit, and Taste,</l>
            <l>Let all their little knowledge run to waste,</l>
            <l>And frustrate each good purpose, whilst they wear</l>
            <l>The robes of Learning with a sloven's air.</l>
            <l>Tho' solid Reas'ning arms each sterling line,</l>
            <l>Tho' Truth declares aloud, "This work is mine,"</l>
            <l>Vice, whilst from page to page dull Morals creep,</l>
            <l>Throws by the book, and Virtue falls asleep.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>Sense, <hi>mere, dull, formal</hi> Sense, in this gay town</l>
            <l>Must have some vehicle to pass her down,</l>

               <pb n="5" facs="7"/>Nor can She for an hour ensure her reign,</l>

            <l>And, with the voice of trumpets, thro' the streets</l>
            <l>Deal lectures out to ev'ry one She meets,</l>
            <l>Half who pass by are deaf, and t'other half</l>
            <l>Can hear indeed, but only hear to laugh.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>Quit then, Ye graver Sons of letter'd Pride,</l>
            <l>Taking for once Experience as a guide,</l>
            <l>Quit this grand Errour, this dull <hi>College</hi> mode;</l>
            <l>Be your pursuits the same, but change the road;</l>

         <lg>
            <l>In vain for such mistakes they pardon claim,</l>
            <l>Because they wield the pen in Virtue's name.</l>
            <l>Thrice sacred is that Name, thrice bless'd the Man</l>
            <l>Who thinks, speaks, writes, and lives on such a plan!</l>
            <l>This, in himself, himself of course must bless,</l>
            <l>But cannot with the world promote success.</l>
            <l>He may be strong, but, with effect to speak,</l>
            <l>Should recollect his readers may be weak;</l>

               <pb n="6" facs="8"/>Plain, rigid Truths, which Saints with comfort bear,</l>
            <l>Will make the Sinner tremble, and despair.</l>
            <l>True Virtue acts from Love, and the great end,</l>
            <l>At which She nobly aims, is to amend;</l>
            <l>How then do those mistake, who arm her laws</l>
            <l>With rigour not their own, and hurt the cause</l>
            <l>They mean to help, whilst with a zealot rage</l>
            <l>They make that Goddess, whom they'd have engage</l>
            <l>Our dearest Love, in hideous terrour rise!</l>
            <l>Such may be honest, but they can't be wise.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>In her own full, and perfect blaze of light,</l>
            <l>Virtue breaks forth too strong for human sight:</l>
            <l>The dazzled eye, that nice but weaker sense,</l>
            <l>Shuts herself up in darkness for defence.</l>
            <l>But, to make strong conviction deeper sink,</l>
            <l>To make the callous feel, the thoughtless think,</l>
            <l>Like God made Man, she lays her glory by,</l>
            <l>And beams mild comfort on the ravish'd eye.</l>
            <l>In earnest most, when most she seems in jest,</l>
            <l>She worms into, and winds around the breast,</l>
            <l>To conquer vice, of vice appears the friend,</l>
            <l>And seems unlike herself to gain her end.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="7" facs="9"/>The Sons of Sin, to while away the time</l>
            <l>Which lingers on their hands, of each black crime</l>
            <l>To hush the painful memory, and keep</l>
            <l>The tyrant Conscience in delusive sleep,</l>
            <l>Read on at random, nor suspect the dart</l>
            <l>Until they find it rooted in their heart.</l>
            <l>'Gainst Vice they give their vote, nor know at first</l>

            <l>They see not, till they fall into the snares,</l>
            <l>Deluded into Virtue unawares.</l>
            <l>Thus the shrewd doctor, in the spleen-struck mind</l>
            <l>When pregnant horrour sits, and broods o'er wind,</l>
            <l>Discarding drugs, and striving how to please,</l>

            <l>The patient to those manly sports, which bind</l>

            <l>SENSE in their works maintains her proper state,</l>

            <l>GRACE makes the whole look elegant, and gay,</l>

            <l>So nice the Master's touch, so great his care,</l>

            <l>Mutually giving, and receiving aid,</l>
            <l>They set each other off, like light and shade,</l>
            <l>And, as by stealth, with so much softness blend,</l>
            <l>'Tis hard to say, where they begin, or end.</l>

            <l>She wept‚Äîbut wept not long; to arms she flew,</l>
            <l>At Honour's call th' avenging sword She drew,</l>
            <l>Turn'd all her terrors on the Tyrant's head,</l>
            <l>And sent him in despair to beg his bread,</l>
            <l>Whilst she (may ev'ry State in such distress</l>
            <l>Dare with such zeal, and meet with such success)</l>
            <l>Whilst She (may GOTHAM, should my abject mind</l>
            <l>Chuse to enslave, rather than free mankind,</l>
            <l>Pursue her steps, tear the proud Tyrant down,</l>
            <l>Nor let me wear if I abuse the crown)</l>
            <l>Whilst She (thro' ev'ry age, in ev'ry land,</l>
            <l>Written in gold let REVOLUTION stand)</l>
            <l>Whilst She, secur'd in <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Found what She sought, a Saviour in NASSAU.</l>
