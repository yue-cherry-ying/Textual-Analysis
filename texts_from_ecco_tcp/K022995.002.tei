Mr. POPE.</head>
               <p>I HAVE this moment receiv'd the fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vour
of yours of the 8th instant; and
will make you a true excuse, (tho' per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps
no very good one) that I defer'd the
troubling you with a letter, when I sent
back your Papers, in hopes of seeing you
at <hi>Binfield</hi> before this time. If I had met
with any fault in your performance, I
should freely now (as I have done too pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sumptuously
in conversation with you) tell
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
you my opinion; which I have frequently
ventur'd to give you, rather in compliance
with your desires than that I could think it
reasonable. For I am not yet satisfied upon
what grounds I can pretend to judge of
Poetry, who never have been practic'd in
the Art. There may possible be some hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>py
genius's, who may judge of some of
the natural beauties of a Poem, as a man
may of the proportions of a building,
without having read <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> or knowing
any thing of the rules of architecture: But
this, tho' it may sometimes be in the right,
must be subject to many mistakes, and is
certainly but a superficial knowledge;
without entring into the art, the methods,
and the particular excellencies of the whole
composure, in all the parts of it.</p>
               <p>Besides my want of skill I have another
reason why I ought to suspect my self, by
reason of the great affection I have for
you, which might give too much biass, to
be kind to every thing that comes from
you; but after all, I must say (and I do it
with an old-fashion'd sincerity) that I en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tirely
approve of your Translation of those
Pieces of <hi>Homer,</hi> both as to the versifica<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
and the true sense that shines thro' the
whole; nay I am confirm'd in my former
application to you, and give me leave to
renew it upon this occasion, that you
<pb n="5" facs="5"/>
wou'd proceed in translating that incompa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rable
Poet, to make him speak good <hi>En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>glish,</hi>
to dress his admirable characters in
your proper, significant, and expressive con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceptions,
and to make his works as useful
and instructive to this degenerate age, as
he was to our friend <hi>Horace,</hi> when he
read him at <hi>Proeneste, Qui, quid sit pul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chrum,
quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</hi> &amp;c.
I break off with that <hi>quid non?</hi> with which
I confess I am charm'd.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter I intreat you to
send this presently to be added to the Mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cellanies,
and I hope it will come time
enough for that purpose.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say of my Nephew
B.'s observations, for he sent them to me
so late, that I had not time to consider
them; I dare say he endeavour'd very
faithfully (tho' he told me very hastily) to
execute your commands.</p>
               <p>All I can add is, that if your excess of mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>desty
shou'd hinder you from publishing this
<hi>Essay,</hi> I shall only be sorry that I have no
more credit with you, to persuade you to
oblige the publick, and very particularly,

               <p>I Send you <hi>Dennis</hi>'s remarks on the<note place="bottom" n="*">On Criticism.</note> 
                  <hi>Es<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>say,</hi>
which equally abound in just Cri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticisms
and fine Railleries: The few obser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vations
in my hand in the margins, are
what a mornings leisure permitted me
to make, purely for your perusal. For I
am of opinion that such a Critic as you
will find him by the latter part of his
book, is but one way to be properly an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swer'd,
and that way I wou'd not take
after what he informs me in his preface,
that he is at this time persecuted by For<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tune.
This I knew not before; if I had,
his name had been spar'd in the Essay,
for that only reason. I can't conceive
what ground he has for so excessive a re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sentment;
nor imagine how those <note place="bottom" n="†">
                     <q>
                        <l>But <hi>Appius</hi> reddens at each word you speak,</l> 
                        <l>And stares tremendous with a threatning eye,</l> 
                        <l>Like some fierce Tyrant in old Tapestry.</l>
                     </q>
                  </note> three
lines can be call'd a reflection on his <hi>Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son,</hi>
which only describe him subject a little
to Anger on some occasions. I have heard
of combatants so very furious, as to fall
<pb n="7" facs="7"/>
down themselves with that very blow which
they design'd to lay heavy on their anta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gonists.
But if Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s rage proceeds
only from a zeal to discourage young and
unexperienc'd writers from scribling, he
shou'd frighten us with his Verse not Prose:
for I have often known, that when all
the precepts in the world would not re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>claim
a sinner, some very sad example has
done the business<note place="bottom" n="*">This Thought we find afterwards put into Verse in the <hi>Dunciad, Book</hi> 1.</note>. Yet to give this man
his due, he has objected to one or two
lines with reason, and I will alter 'em in
case of another edition; I will make my
enemy do me a kindness where he meant
an injury, and so serve instead of a friend.
What he observes at the bottom of page
20th of his reflections, was objected to by
your self, and had been mended but for
the haste of the press: 'Tis right <hi>Hiber<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nian,</hi>
and I confess it what the <hi>English</hi> call
a <hi>Bull</hi> in the expression, tho' the sense be
manifest enough: Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi>'s Bulls are
seldom in the expression, they are always
in the sense.</p>
               <p>I shall certainly never make the least
reply to him, not only because you advise
me, but because I have ever been of opi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nion,
that if a book can't answer for itself
<pb n="8" facs="8"/>
to the publick, 'tis to no sort of purpose
for its author to do it. If I am wrong in
any sentiment of that Essay, I protest sin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerely,
I don't desire all the world should
be deceiv'd (which wou'd be of very ill
consequence) meerly that I my self may be
thought right, (which is of very little con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sequence).
I'd be the first to recant, for
the benefit of others, and the glory of my
self; for (as I take it) when a man owns
himself to have been in an error, he does
but tell you in other words, that he is wiser
than he was. But I have had an advan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tage
by the publishing that book of <hi>D<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters" rend="content:_+">
                        <desc>blank</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi>'s
which otherwise I should never have
known: It has been the occasion of ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>king
me friends, and open abetters, of se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veral
gentlemen of known sense and wit;
and of proving to me what I have till
now doubted, that my writings are taken
some notice of by the world in general,
or I should never be attack'd thus in par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticular.
I have read that 'twas a custom
among the <hi>Romans,</hi> while a General rode
in triumph, to have common soldiers in
the streets that rail'd at him and reproach'd
him; to put him in mind, that tho' his
services were in the main approved and
rewarded, yet he had faults enough to keep
him humble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="9"/>
You will see by this, that whoever sets
up for wit in these days ought to have the
constancy of a primitive christian, and be
prepar'd to suffer martyrdom in the cause
of it. But sure this is the first time that
a Wit was attack'd for his <hi>Religion,</hi> as you'll
find I am most zealously in this treatise:
and you know Sir, what alarms I have had
from the <note place="bottom" n="*">See the ensuing Letters.</note> opposite side on this account.
Have I not reason to cry out with the poor
fellow in <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Quid jam misero mihi denique restat?</l>

               </p>
               <p>'Tis however my happiness that you, Sir,
are impartial,

                     <l>For you well know, that Wit's of no Religion.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The manner <gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 word" rend="content:〈◊〉">
                     <desc>illegible</desc>
                  </gap> which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> takes to
pieces several particular lines, detach'd from
their natural places, may shew how easy
it is to a caviller to give a new sense, or
<pb n="10" facs="10"/>
a new nonsence to any thing. And in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed
his constructions are not more wrest<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed
from the genuine meaning, than theirs
who objected to the heterodox parts, as they
call'd 'em.</p>
               <p>Our friend the <hi>Abbè</hi> is not of that sort,
who with the utmost candour and free<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom,
has modestly told me what others
thought, and shewn himself one (as he
very well expresses it) rather of a <hi>Number</hi>
than a <hi>Party.</hi> The only difference between
us in relation to the Monks, is, that he
thinks most sorts of learning flourish'd a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mong
'em, and I am of opinion that only
some sort of learning was barely kept alive
by 'em: he believes, that in the most na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tural
and obvious sense, that line (<hi>A second
deluge Learning over-run</hi>) will be under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stood
of Learning in general; and I fancy
'twill be understood only (as 'tis meant) of
polite Learning, Criticism, Poetry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
is the only learning concern'd in the subject
of the Essay. It is true, that the <hi>Monks</hi>
did preserve what learning there was about
<hi>Nicholas</hi> the Fifth's time; but those who
succeeded fell into the depth of Barba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rism,
or at least stood at a stay while others
rose from thence, insomuch that even <hi>Eras<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mus</hi>
and <hi>Reuchlin</hi> could hardly laugh them
out of it. I am highly oblig'd to the <hi>Ab<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>be</hi>'s
zeal in my commendation, and good<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
<pb n="11" facs="11"/>
in not concealing what he thinks my
error. And his testifying some esteem for
the book, just at a time when his brethren
rais'd a clamour against it, is an instance
of great generosity and candor, which I
shall ever acknowledge.</p>

               <p>IN your last you informed me of the
mistaken zeal of some people, who
seem to make no less their business to
persuade men they are erroneous, than Do<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ctors
do that they are sick; only that they
may magnify their own cure, and triumph
over an imaginary distemper. The Simile
objected to in my Essay.<q>
                     <l>(Thus wit, like faith, by each man is apply'd</l>
                     <l>To one small Sect, and all are damn'd beside.)</l>
                  </q> Plainly concludes at this second line, where
stands a full stop: and what follows <hi>Mean<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly
they seek,</hi> &amp;c.) speaks only of <hi>Wit,</hi>
(which is meant by <hi>that blessing,</hi> and <hi>that
sun</hi>) for how can the sun of <hi>faith</hi> be said
<pb n="12" facs="12"/>
to <hi>sublime the southern wits,</hi> and to <hi>ripen the
genius's of the northern climates?</hi> I fear these
gentlemen understand grammer as little as
they do criticisim; and perhaps out of good
nature to the Monks, are willing to take
from 'em the censure of ignorance, and to
have it to themselves. The word <hi>They</hi>
refers (as I am sure I meant, and as I
thought every one must have known) to
those critics there spoken of, who are par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tial
to some perticular sett of writers, to
the prejudice of all others. And the very
simile it self, if twice read, may convince
them, that the censure here of damning
lies not on our Church at all, unless they
call our Church <hi>one small Sect</hi> and the
cautious words, (<hi>by each man</hi>) manifestly
show it a general reflection on all such
(whoever they are) who entertain those
narrow rnd limited notions of the mercy
of the Almighty; which the Reform'd mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nisters
and Presbyterians are as guilty of as
any people living.</p>
               <p>Yet after all, I promise you Sir, if the
alteration of a word or two will gratify any
man of sound faith tho' weak understand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing,
I will (tho' it were from no other
principal than that of common good na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture)
comply with it. And if you please
but to particularize the spot where their
objection lies, (for it is in a very narrow
<pb n="13" facs="13"/>
compass) that stumbling-block, tho' it be
but a little pebble, shall be removed out
of their way. If the heat of these good
disputants (who I am afraid being bred up
to wrangle in the schools, cannot get rid
of the humor all their lives) shou'd pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceed
so far as to personal reflections upon
me, I assure you notwithstanding I will
do, or say nothing, however provok'd (for
some people can no more provoke than
oblige) that is unbecoming the character
of a true Catholick. I will set before me
the example of that great man, and great
Saint <hi>Erasmus</hi>; who in the midst of ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lumny
proceeded with all the calmness of
innocence, and the unrevenging spirit of
primitive christianity. However I wou'd
advise them to suffer the mention of <hi>him</hi>
to pass unregarded, lest I shou'd be forc'd
to do that for his reputation which I
wou'd never do for my own; I mean, to
vindicate so great a light of our Church
from the malice of past times, and the ig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>norance
of the present, in a language which
the Trifle about Criticism is writen. I wish
these gentlemen wou'd be contented with
finding fault with me only, who will sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mit
to 'em right or wrong, as far as I on<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly

               <p>THE concern which you more than
seem to be affected with for my
reputation, by the several accounts you have
so obligingly given of what reports and
censures the holy Vandals have thought fit
to pass upon me, makes me desirous of
telling so good a friend my whole thoughts
of this matter; and of setting before you
in a clear light the true state of it.</p>
               <p>I have ever believ'd the best piece of
service one cou'd do to our religion, was
openly to express our detestation and scorn
of all those mean artifices and <hi>Pioe fraudes,</hi>
which it stands so little in need of, and
which have laid it under so great a scan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dal
amongst its enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="15"/>
Nothing has been so much a scarecrow
to them, as that too peremptory and seem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ingly-uncharitable
assertion of an utter <hi>Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>possibility</hi>
of <hi>Salvation</hi> to all but ourselves;
<hi>invincible</hi> ignorance excepted, which in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed
some people define under so great li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mitations
and with such exclusions, that
it seems as if that word were rather in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vented
as a salvo, or expedient, not to be
thought too bold with the thunder-bolts
of God (which are hurl'd about so freely
on almost all mankind by the hands of
ecclesiasticks) than as a real exception to
almost-universal damnation. For besides
the small number of the truly faithful in
our Church, we must again subdivide;
the <hi>Jansenist</hi> is damn'd by the <hi>Jesuit,</hi> the
<hi>Jesuit</hi> by the <hi>Jansenist,</hi> the <hi>Scotist</hi> by the
<hi>Thomist,</hi> and so forth.</p>
               <p>There may be Errors I grant, but I can't
think'em of such consequenceas to destroy
utterly the charity of mankind; the very
greatest bond in which we are ingag'd by
God to one another. Therefore I own to
you, I was glad of any opportunity to ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>press
my dislike of so shocking a sentiment
as those of the religion I profess are com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monly
charg'd with; and I hop'd, a slight
insinuation, introduc'd so easily by a ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sual
similitude only, cou'd never have gi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven
offence; but on the contrary must
<pb n="16" facs="16"/>
needs have done good; in a nation and
time, wherein we are the smaller party
and consequently most misrepresented, and
most in need of vindication.</p>
               <p>For the same reason, I took occasion to
mention the <hi>Superstition</hi> of some ages after
the subversion of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> which
is too manifest a truth to be deny'd, and
does in no sort reflect upon the present
professors of our faith who are free from
it. Our silence in these points may with
some reason make our adversaries think we
allow and persist in those biggotries; which
yet in reality all good and sensible Men
despise, tho' they are persuaded not to
speak against 'em; I can't tell why, since
now, 'tis no way the interest even of the
worst of our Priesthood (as it might have
been then) to have them smother'd in si<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lence:
For as the opposite Sects are now
prevailing, 'tis too late to hinder our Church
from being slander'd; 'tis our business now
to show it is slander'd unjustly, and to
vindicate our selves from being thought
abettors of what they charge us with.
This can't so well be brought about with
serious faces; we must laugh with them
at what deserves it; and then we need not
doubt of being clear'd, ev'n in their opi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="17"/>
As to particulars; you cannot but have
observ'd that at first the whole objection
against the simile of wit and faith lay to
the word <hi>They</hi>: When that was beyond
contradiction removed (the very Grammar
serving to confute 'em) then the objection
lies against the <hi>Simile itself</hi>; or if that si<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mile
will not be objected to (sense and
common reason being indeed a little stub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>born,
and not apt to give way to every
body) next the mention of <hi>Superstition</hi>
must become a crime (as if <hi>Religion</hi> and
she were sisters, or that scandal upon the
family of <hi>Christ,</hi> to say a word against
the Devil's bastard.) Afterwards, more
mischief is discover'd in a place that seem'd
innocent at first, the two lines about <hi>Schis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>matics,</hi>
at the bottom of page 24. An or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dinary
man wou'd imagine the author
plainly declar'd against those schismatics,
for quitting the true faith out of contempt
of the understanding of some few of its
believers: But these believers are call'd
<hi>Dull,</hi> and because that I say <hi>those schis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>matics</hi>
think <hi>some</hi> believers <hi>dull,</hi> therefore
these charitable interpreters of my mean<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
will have it, that <hi>I</hi> think <hi>all</hi> believers
dull. I was telling lately Mr. <gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 word" rend="content: _____ ">
                     <desc>blank</desc>
                  </gap> these
objections: who assur'd me I had said no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing
which a Catholick need to disown,
<pb n="18" facs="18"/>
and I have cause to know that gentle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man's
fault (if he has any) is not want of
zeal: He put a notion into my head which
I confess I can't but perfectly acquiesce
in; that when a sett of people are piqu'd
at any truth which they think to their
own disadvantage, their method of re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venge
on the truth-speaker is to attack
his reputation a By-way, and not openly
to object to the place they are really gall'd
by: What these therefore (in his opinion)
are in earnest angry at, is, that <hi>Erasmus</hi>
whom their tribe oppress'd and persecuted
shou'd be vindicated after an age of ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>loquy
by one of their own people, willing
to utter an honest truth in behalf of the
dead, whom no man sure will flatter,
and to whom few will do justice. Others,
you know were as angry that I mention'd
Mr. <hi>Walsh</hi> with honour who as he never
refus'd to any one of merit of any party
the praise due to him, so honestly deserv'd
it from all others, tho' of ever so diffe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rent
interests or sentiments. May I be
ever guilty of this sort of liberty, and la<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>titude
of principle! which gives us the
hardiness of speaking well of those whom
envy oppresses ev'n after death. As I
wou'd always speak well of my living
friends when they are absent, nay because
<pb n="19" facs="19"/>
they are absent; so would I much more
of the dead, in that eternal absence; and
the rather because I expect no thanks
forit.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, you see I do in my Conscience
persist in what I have written; yet in my
friendship I will recant and alter what<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever
you please, in case of a second edi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
(which I think the book will not so
soon arrive at, for <hi>Tonson</hi>'s printer told me
he drew off a thousand copies in this first
impression, and I fancy a treatise of this
nature, which not one gentleman in three<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>score

can hardly exceed the vent of
that number.) You shall find me a true

Besides the publick acquaintance I long had

knowledge of his parts and capacity by
private conversation, and ever thought it

the short stay she makes there. She went

humour, as well as comfort and pity, the

near Allies of mine for their conduct of
late towards this Lady, which has given me
a great deal of anger as well as sorrow.
All I shall say to you of 'em at present is,
that they have not been my relations these
two months: The consent of opinions in
our minds, is certainly a nearer tye than
can be contracted by all the blood in our
bodies; and I am proud of finding I have
something congenial with you. Will you

I am afraid to insinuate to you how much
I esteem you: Flatterers have taken up the
stile which was once peculiar to friends,
and an honest man has now no way left
to express himself besides the common one
of knaves: so that true friends now-a-days
differ in their address from flatterers, much
as right mastiffs do from spaniels, and
show themselves by a dumb surly sort of
fidelity, rather than by their complaisant
and open kindness.—Will you never
leave commending my Poetry? In fair
truth Sir, I like it but too well my self
already—Expose me no more, I beg you,
to the great danger of Vanity, (the rock of
all men, but most of young men) and be

               <p>I AM at a solitude, an house between
<hi>Hampstead</hi> and <hi>London</hi> wherein Sir

me a thinking and ruminating upon the
employments in which Men of wit exer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cise

wise men both delight in, and are quali<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fy'd

solitude, or publick life. In the former,

useful to all states, should be like gentle
streams, that not only glide thro' lonely
valleys and forests amidst the flocks and
the shepherds, but visit populous towns in
their course and are at once of ornament
and service to them. But there are an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>other

solitude, such I mean as have more to hide

               <p>YOU formerly observ'd to me, that
nothing made a more ridiculous figure
in a man's life, than the disparity we often
find in him sick and well: Thus one of
an unfortunate constitution is perpetually
exhibiting a miserable example of the weak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
of his mind, and of his body, in their
turns. I have had frequent opportunities
of late to consider my self in these diffe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rent
views, and I hope have receiv'd some
<pb n="30" facs="30"/>
advantage by it, if what Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> says
be ture, that
<q>
                     <l>The soul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,</l>
                     <l>Lets in new light thro' chincks that time has
made.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then surely sickness, contributing no less
than old age to the shaking down this
scaffolding of the body, may discover the
inward structure more plainly. Sickness
is a sort of early old age; it teaches us a
diffidence in our earthly state and inspires
us with the thoughts of a future, better
than a thousand volumes of philosiphers
and divines. It gives so warning a con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cussion
to those props of our vanity, our
strength and youth, that we think of for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tifying
our our selves within, when there is so
little dependance upon our out-works.
Youth at the very best is but a betrayer
of human life in a gentler and smoother
manner than age: 'Tis like a stream that
nourishes a plant upon a bank, and causes
it to flourish and blossom to the sight, but
at the same time is undermining it at the
root in secret. My youth has dealt more
fairly and openly with me, it has afforded
several Prospects of my danger, and given
me an advantage not very common to
young men, that the attractions of the
<pb n="31" facs="31"/>
world have not dazzle me very much;
and I begin where most people end, with
a full conviction of the emptiness of all
sorts of ambition, and the unsatisfactory
nature of all human pleasure. When a
smart fit of sickness tells me this scurvy
tenement of my body will fall in a little
time, I am e'en as unconcern'd as was that
honest <hi>Hiberniam,</hi> who being in bed in the
great storm some years ago, and told the
house would tumble over his head, made
answer, What care I for the house? I
am only a lodger. I fancy 'tis the best
time todie when one is in the best hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mour,
and so excessively weak as I now
am I may say with conscience, that I am
not at all uneasy at the thought that ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny
men whome I never had any esteem
for, are likely to enjoy this world after me.
When I reflect what an inconsiderable little
attom every single man is, with respect to
the whole creation, methinks 'tis a shame
to be concern'd at the removal of such a
trivial animal as I am. The morning af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter
my Exit, the sun will rise as bright as
ever, the flowers smell as sweet, the plants
spring as green, the world will proceed in
its old course, people will laugh as hear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tily,
and marry as fast as they were us'd to
do. The memory of man, (as it is ele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gantly
express'd in the wisdom of <hi>Solomon</hi>)
<pb n="32" facs="32"/>
passeth away as the Remembrance of a guest

enough, in the fourth chapter of the

with the prospect of death. <hi>For ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nourable
age is not that which standeth in
length of time, or is measur'd by number of

and an unspotted life is old age. He was

               <p>I Was the other day in company with
five of six men of some learning; where
chancing to mention the famous verses which
the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> spoke on his death<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bed,
they were all agreed that 't was a
piece of Gaiety unworthy of that Prince
in those circumstances. I could not but
differ from this opinion: Methinks it was
by no means a gay, but a very serious so<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liloquy
to his soul at the point of his de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parture;
in which sense I naturally took
<pb n="33" facs="33"/>
the verses at my first reading them when I
was very young, and before I knew what
interpretation the world generally put up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
them.<q>

the future fate of his soul will seem
so far from being the effect of want of
thought, that 'twas scarce reasonable he
should think otherwise; not to mention
that here is a plain confession included of
his belief in its immortality. The dimi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nutive

little uncharitable, (<q rend="inline">"that he might fear

third verse he plainly testifies his apprehen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion

<hi>whither</hi> his soul was going? As to what
you mention of his using gay and ludicrous
expressions, I have own'd my opinion to
be that the expressions are not so, but

               <p>YOU have at length comply'd with
the request I have often made you,
for you have shown me, I must confess,
several of my faults in the sight of those
letters. Upon a review of them, I find
<pb n="39" facs="39"/>
many things that would give me shame,
if I were not more desirous to be thought
honest than prudent: so many things freely
thrown out, such lengths of unreserv'd
friendship, thoughts just warm from the
brain, without any polishing or dress, the
very dishabille of the understanding. You
have prov'd your self more tender of an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>other's
embroyo's than the fondest mothers
are of their own, for you have preserv'd
every thing that I miscarry'd of. Since I
know this, I shall in one respect be more
afraid of writing to you than ever, at this
careless rate, because I see my evil works
may again rise in judgment against me:
Yet in another respect I shall be less afraid,
since this has given me such a proof of
the extreme indulgence you afford to my
slightest thoughts. The revisal of these let<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters
has been a kind of examination of
conscience to me; so fairly and faithfully
have I set down in 'em from time to time
the true and undistinguish'd state of my
mind. But I find that these, which were
intended as sketches of my friendship, give
as imperfect images of it, as the little
landscapes we commonly see in black
and white, do of a beautiful country;
they can represent but a very small part
of it, and that depriv'd of the life and lustre
of nature. I perceive that the more I en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deavour'd
<pb n="40" facs="40"/>
to render manifest the real affe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ction
and value I ever had for you, I did
but injure it by representing less and less
of it: as glasses which are design'd to make
an object very clear, generally contract
it. Yet as when people have a full
idea of a thing, first, upon their own
knowledge, the least traces of it serve to
refresh the Remembrance, and are not dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pleasing
on that score: So I hope the fore<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>knowledge
you had of my esteem for you,
is the reason that you do not dislike my
letters.</p>
               <p>They will not be of any great service
(I find) in the design I mentioned to you:
I believe I had better steal from a richer
man, and plunder your letters, (which I
have kept as carefully as I would Letters
Patents, since they intitle me to what I
more value than titles of honour.) You
have some cause to apprehend this usage
from me, if what some say be true, that
I am a great Borrower; however I have
hitherto had the luck that none of my
creditors have challeng'd me for it: and
those who say it are such, whose writings
no man ever borrow'd from, so have the
least reason to complain: Their works are
granted on all hands to be but too much
their own.—Another has been pleas'd
to declare, that my Verses are corrected by

other men: I verily believe theirs were ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver

mine have not, 'twas not my fault, I have

               <p>THough any thing you write is sure
to be a pleasure to me, yet I must
own your last letter made me uneasy: You
really use a style of compliment, which I
expect as little as I deserve it. I know 'tis
a common opinion that a young scribler
is as ill pleas'd to hear truth as a young
Lady. From the moment one sets up for
an author, one must be treated as ceremo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>niously,
that is as unfaithfully,
<q>As a King's Favourite, or as a King.</q>
This proceeding, join'd to that natural va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity
which first makes a man an author,
is certainly enough to render him a cox<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>comb
for life. But I must grant it is but
a just judgement upon Poets, that they whose
chief pretence is Wit, shou'd be treated just
as they themselves treat Fools, that is, be
cajoll'd with praises. And I believe, Poets
are the only poor fellows in the world
whom any body will flatter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="44"/>
I would not be thought to say this as if
the obliging letter you sent me deserv'd this
imputation, only it put me in mind of it;
and I fancy one may apply to one's friend
when <hi>Caesar</hi> said of his Wife; <hi>It was not
sufficient that he knew her to be chaste himself,
but she shou'd not be so much as suspected by
others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the wonderful discoveries, and
all the good news you are pleas'd to
tell me of my self; I treat it as you who
are in the Secret treat common news,
groundless reports of things at a distance
which I who look into the true springs of the
affair at home, in my own breast, know to
have no foundation at all. For <hi>Fame</hi> tho' it
be as <hi>Milton</hi> finely calls it, <hi>The last Infirmity
of noble Minds,</hi> is scarce so strong a temp<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tation
as to warrant our loss of time here:
It can never make up lie down contentedly
on a death-bed (as some of the ancients
are said to have done with that thought).
You Sir have your self taught me, that an
easy situation at that hour, can proceed
from no ambition less noble than that of
an eternal felicity, which is unattainable by
the strongest endeavours of the Wit, but
may be gain'd by the sincere intentions of
the Heart only. As in the next world,
so in this, the only solid blessings are owing
to the goodness of the mind, not the ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tent
<pb n="45" facs="45"/>
of the capacity: Friendship here is an
emanation from the same source as Beati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tude
there: the same benevolence and grate<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful
disposition that qualifies us for the one,
if extended farther, makes us partakers of
the other. The utmost point of my de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sires
in my present state terminates in the
society and good-will of worthy men, which
I look upon as no ill earnest and fore-taste
of the society and alliance of happy souls
hereafter.</p>
               <p>The continuance of your favours to me
is what not only makes me happy, but
causes me to set some value upon my self
as a part of your care. The instances I
daily meet with of these agreeable awa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kenings

               <p>I Have been almost every day employ'd in
following your advice and amusing my
self in Painting, in which I am most particularly
<pb n="46" facs="46"/>
obliged to Mr. <hi>Jervas,</hi> who gives me
daily instructions and examples. As to poe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tical
affairs, I am content at present to be a
bare looker-on, and from a practitioner turn
an admirer, which is (as the world goes)
not very usual. <hi>Cato</hi> was not so much the
wonder of <hi>Rome</hi> in his days, as he is of
<hi>Britain</hi> in ours; and tho' all the foolish
industry possible has been used to make
it thought a Party-play, yet what the au<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thor
once said of another may the most
properly in the world be apply'd to him
on this occasion.<q>
                     <l>Envy itself is dumb, in wonder lost,</l>
                     <l>And Factions strive, who shall applaud him

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The numerous and violent claps of the
Whig-party on the one-side of the theatre,
were eccho'd back by the Tories on the
other; while the Author sweated be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hind
the scenes with concern, to find
their applause proceeding more from the
hand than the head. This was the case
too of the Prologue-writer, who was
clapp'd into a stanch Whig, at almost
ev'ry too lines. I believe you have
heard, that after all the applauses of the
opposite Faction, my Lord <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> sent
for <hi>Booth</hi> who play'd <hi>Cato,</hi> into the box,
<pb n="47" facs="47"/>
between one of the acts, and presented him
with fifty guinea's; in acknowledgment
(as he exprest it) for defending the cause
of <hi>Liberty</hi> so well against a <hi>Perpetual Di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ctator.</hi>
The Whigs are unwilling to be
distanc'd this way, (as 'tis said) and there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore
design a present to the same <hi>Cato</hi> very
speedily; in the mean time they are get<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ting
ready as good a Sentence as the for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mer
on their side: So betwixt them, 'tis
probable that <hi>Cato</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Garth</hi> exprest

their part of, Envy and Calumny. To be
uncensur'd and to be obscure, is the same
thing. You may conclude from what I
here say, that 'twas never in my thoughts
to have offer'd you my pen in any direct
reply to such a Critic, but only in some
little raillery; not in defence of you, but
in contempt of him. <note place="bottom" n="*">This relates to the Paper occasion'd by <hi>Dennis</hi>'s remarks upon <hi>Cato,</hi> call'd Dr. <hi>Norris</hi>'s <hi>Narative of the Frenzy of</hi> John Den<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters" rend="content:_+">

against every thing the world has approv'd

               <p>YOUR last is the more obliging, as it

prompt you to recommend to me, and
which (so trivial as things of this nature

people whom every body talks of, and
every body as he pleases. 'Tis a sort of

As I hope and would flatter my self,
that you know me and my thoughts so
entirely as never to be mistaken in either,
so 'tis a pleasure to me that you guess'd so
right in regard to the Author of that
<hi>Guardian</hi> you mention'd. But I am sorry
to find it has taken air that I have some
hand in those Papers, because I write so
very few as neither to deserve the credit of
such a report with some people, nor the
disrepute of it with others. An honest
<hi>Jacobite</hi> spoke to me the sense or non-sense
of the weak part of his Party ve<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry
fairly, that the good people took it
ill of me, that I writ with <hi>Steele,</hi> tho'
upon never so indifferent subjects—This I know you will laugh at as well as I
do: yet I doubt not but many little ca<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lumniators
and persons of sower disposi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
will take occasion hence to bespatter
me. I confess I scorn narrow souls, of all
parties, and if I renounce my reason in
religious matters, I'll hardly do it in any
other.</p>
               <p>I can't imagine whence it comes to pass
that the few <hi>Guardians</hi> I have written are
so generally known for mine: that in par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticular
which you mention I never disco<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver'd

me of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="54"/>
The true reason that Mr. <hi>Steele</hi> laid down
the Paper, was a quarrel between him and
<hi>Jacob Tonson.</hi> He stood ingag'd to his
bookseller, in articles of Penalty, for all
the <hi>Guardians:</hi> and by desisting two days
and altering the title of the paper to that
of the <hi>Englishman,</hi> was quit of his obliga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion:
these papers being printed by <hi>Buck<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to his taking a more Politick turn, I
cannot any way enter into that secret, nor
have I been let into it, any more than into
the rest of his politicks. Tho' 'tis said, he
will take into these papers also several sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jects
of the politer kind, as before: But I
assure you as to my self, I have quite done
with 'em, for the future. The little I
have done, and the great respect I bear
Mr. <hi>Steele</hi> as a Man of Wit, has render'd
me a suspected Whig to some of the vio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lent,
but (as old <hi>Dryden</hi> said before me)
'Tis not the Violent I design to please.</p>
               <p>I generally employ the mornings in paint<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing

                  <note place="bottom" n="*">See Mr. <hi>Pope's</hi> Epistle to him in Verse, writ about this time.</note>; and the evenings in

The best way I know of overco<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ming

imagination, this week and more, and
watching what thoughts came up in
the whirl of the fancy, that were worth
communicating to you in a letter. But I
am at length convinc'd that my rambling

you, when I am conscious I write with
more unreservedness than ever man wrote,
or perhaps talk'd to another. I trust your
good nature with the whole range of my

               <p>Good Good! What an incongruous ani<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mal
is Man? how unsettled in his best part,
his Soul; and how changing and variable
in his frame of Body? The constancy of
the one shook by every Notion, the tempe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rament
of the other affected by every blast
of wind! What is Man altogether, but one
mighty Inconsistency! Sickness and Pain is
the lot of one half of us; Doubt and Fear
the portion of the other! What a bustle we
make about passing our time, when all our
space is but a point? What aims and am<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bitions
are crowded into this little instant
of our life, which (as <hi>Shakespear</hi> finely
words it) is <hi>Rounded with a Sleep?</hi> Our
whole extent of Being no more, in the
eyes of him who gave it, than a scarce
perceptible motion of duration. Those
animals whose circle of living is limited to
three or four hours, as the Naturalists assure
us, are yet as long-lived and possess as wide
a scene of action as a man, if we consider
him with an eye to all Space, and all
Eternity. Who knows what plots, what
atchievements a mite may perform in his
kingdom of a grain of dust, within his life
of some minutes? and of how much less
<pb n="58" facs="58"/>
consideration than even this, is the life of
man in the fight of that God, who is from
Ever, and for Ever!</p>

<pb n="59" facs="59"/>
and a few others, by writing. 'Tis no com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fortable
prospect to be reflecting, that so
long a siege as that of <hi>Troy</hi> lies upon my
hands, and the campagne above half over,
before I have made any progress, Indeed
the <hi>Greek</hi> fortification upon a nearer ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proach
does not appear so formidable as it
did, and I am almost apt to flatter my self,
that <hi>Homer</hi> secretly seems inclin'd to a cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>respondence
with me, in letting me into
a good part of his intentions. There are
indeed, a sort of underling auxiliars to the
difficulty of a work, call'd Commentators
and Critics, who wou'd frighten many peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple
by their number and bulk, and perplex
our progress under pretence of fortifying
their author. These lie very low in the
trenches and ditches they themselves have
digg'd, encompass'd with dirt of their own
heaping up, but I think there may be
found a method of coming at the main
works by a more speedy and gallant way
than by mining under ground, that is, by
using the Poetical Engines, Wings, and fly<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
over their heads.</p>
               <p>While I am engag'd in the fight, I find
you are concern'd how I shall be paid, and
are sollicitous that I may not have the ill
fate of many discarded Generals, to be first
envy'd and malign'd, then perhaps prais'd,
and lastly neglected. The former (the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stant
<pb n="60" facs="60"/>
attendant upon all great and lau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dable
enterprizes) I have already experi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>enc'd.
Some have said I am not a Master
in the <hi>Greek,</hi> who either are so themselves
or are not: If they are not, they can't
tell; and if they are, they can't without
having catechiz'd me. But if they can
read (for I know some Critics can, and
others cannot) there are fairly lying be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore
them some specimens of my tran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>slation
from this Author in the <hi>Miscel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lanics,</hi>
which they are heartily welcome
to. I have met with as much malignity
another way, some calling me a Tory,
because the heads of that party have been
distinguishingly favourable to me; some
a Whig because I have been favour'd with
yours, Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> his
friendship, and of late with my Lord <hi>Hal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lifax</hi>'s
Patronage. How much more natu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral
a conclusion might be form'd, by any
good-natur'd man, that a person who has
been well us'd by all sides, has been offen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sive
to none. This miserable age is so sunk
between animosities of Party and those of
Religion, that I begin to fear, most men
have politicks enough to make (thro' vio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lence)
the best Scheme of Government a
bad one; and faith enough to hinder their
own Salvation. I hope for my own part,
never to have more of either than is con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sistent

with common justice and charity, and
always as much as becomes a christian and
honest man. Tho' I find it an unfortunate
thing to be bred a <hi>Papist</hi> here, where one
is obnoxious to four parts in five as being
so too much, and to the fifth part as being
so too little; I shall yet be easy under both
their mistakes, and be what I more than

                  </hi> and Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> I shall an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swer
in a few words. Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> did ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>press
himself with much indignation against
me one evening at <hi>Button</hi>'s Coffee-house (as
I was told) saying, That I was enter'd into
a Cabal with Dean <hi>Swift</hi> and others to
write against the <hi>Whig-Interest,</hi> and in par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticular
to undermine his own reputation,
and that of his friends <hi>Steel</hi> and <hi>Addison.</hi>
But Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> never open'd his lips to
my face, on this or any like occasion,
tho' I was almost every night in the same
room with him, nor ever offer'd me any
indecorum. Mr. <hi>Addison</hi> came to me a
night or two after <hi>Philips</hi> had talk'd in
this idle manner, and assur'd me of his dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>belief
of what had been said, of the friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship
we should always maintain, and de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sir'd
I would say nothing further of it.
My Lord <hi>Hallifax</hi> did me the honour to
stir in this matter, by speaking to several
people to obviate a fal&amp;se aspersion, which
might have done me no small prejudice
with one Party. However <hi>Philips</hi> did all
<pb n="65" facs="65"/>
he could, secretly to continue the report
with the <hi>Hanover</hi> Club, and kept in his
hands the Subscriptions paid for me to him,
as Secretary to that Club. The heads of it
have since given him to understand, that
they take it ill; but (upon the terms I
ought to be with a man whom I think a
scoundrel) I wou'd not even ask him for
this money, but commission'd one of the
<hi>Players,</hi> his equals, to receive it. This is
the whole matter; but as to the secret
grounds of <hi>Philips</hi>'s malignity, they will
make a very pleasant History when we
meet. Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> and some others have
been much diverted with it, and most of
the Gentlemen of the <hi>Hanover</hi> Club have
made it the subject of their ridicule on their
Secretary. It is to this management of
<hi>Philips,</hi> that the world owes Mr. <hi>Gay</hi>'s

               <p>YOU mention the account I gave you
some time ago of the things which
<hi>Philips</hi> said in his foolishness; but I can't
tell from any thing in your Letter, whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
you receiv'd a long one from me a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bout
a fortnight since. It was principally
intended to thank you for the last obliging
favour you did me; and perhaps for that
reason you pass it in silence. I there
launch'd into some account of my tem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poral
affairs, and intend now to give you
some hints of my spiritual. The conclu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion
of your Letter draws this upon you,
where you tell me, you <hi>pray'd</hi> for me:
Your proceeding, Sir, is contrary to that
of most other Friends, who never talk of
praying for a Man after they have done
<pb n="67" facs="67"/>
him a service, but only when they will do
him none. Nothing can be more kind
than the hint you give me of the vanity
of human Sciences, which I assure you I
am daily more and more convinc'd of; and
indeed I have for some years past, look'd
upon all of 'em no better than amusements.
To make them the ultimate end of our
pursuit, is a miserable and short ambition,
which will drop from us at ev'ry little dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>appointment
here, and even in case of no
disappointments here, will infallibly desert
us hereafter. The utmost fame they are
capable of bestowing, is never worth the
pains they cost us, and the time they lose
us. If you attain the top of your desires
that way, all those who envy you will do
you harm; and of those who admire you,
few will do you good. The unsuccessful
writers are your declared enemies, and pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bably
the successful your secret ones: For
those hate not more to be excell'd, than
these to be rivall'd. And at the upshot,
after a life of perpetual application, to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>flect
that you have been doing nothing for
your self, and that the same or less In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dustry
might have gain'd you a Friendship
that can never deceive or end, a satisfaction
which praise cannot bestow, nor vanity feel,
and a glory which (tho' in one respect like
same, not to be had 'till after death,) yet
<pb n="68" facs="68"/>
shall be felt and enjoy'd to eternity. These,
dear Sir, are unfeignedly my sentiments,
whenever I think at all; for half the things
that employ our heads deserve not the name
of thoughts, they are only stronger dreams
or impressions upon the imagination: Our
schemes of government, our systems of phi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>losophy,
our golden worlds of poetry, are all
but so many shadowy images, and airy pros<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pects,
which arise to us but so much the
livelier and more frequent, as we are more
o'ercast with the darkness, and disturb'd
with the fumes of human vanity.</p>
               <p>The same thing that makes old men wil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ling
to leave this world, makes me willing
to leave poetry, long-habit, and weariness
of the same track. <hi>Homer</hi> will work a
cure upon me; fifteen thousand verses are
equivalent to fourscore years, to make one
old in Rhime: And I shou'd be sorry and
ashamed, to go on jingling to the last step,
like a waggoner's horse, in the same road,
and so leave my <hi>Bells</hi> to the next silly ani<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mal
that will be proud of 'em. That man
makes a mean figure in the eyes of reason,
who is measuring syllables and coupling
rhimes, when he shou'd be mending his own
Soul, and securing his own immortality. If
I had not this opinion, I shou'd be unwor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thy
even of those small and limited parts
<pb n="69" facs="69"/>
which God has given me; and unworthy

which is, in his blindness. I am per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>petually
afflicted with headach's, that very
much affect my sight; and indeed since my

agreeably, except that in which I read your
letter. I would seriously have you think,
you have no man who more truly knows to
place a right value on your friendship, than
he who least deserves it on all other ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>counts
than his due sense of it. But let
me tell you, you can hardly guess what a
task you undertake, when you profess your

               <p>I find by dear experience, we live in an
age, where it is criminal to be moderate;
and where no one man can be allowed to be
just to all men. The notions of right and
wrong are so far strain'd that perhaps to be
in the right so very violently, may be of
worse consequence than to be easily and qui<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>etly
in the wrong. I really wish all men so
well, that I am satisfied but few can wish
me so; but if those few are such as tell me
they do, I am content, for they are the best
people I know: While you believe me what
I profess as to Religion, I can bear any thing
the bigotted may say; while Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>
likes my poetry, I can endure <hi>Dennis</hi> and a
thousand more like him; while the most
honest and moral of each party think me no
ill man, I can easily support it, tho' the most
violent and mad of all parties rose up to
throw dirt at me.</p>
               <p>I must expect an hundred attacks upon
the publication of my <hi>Homer.</hi> Whoever in
our times would be a professor of learning
above his fellows, ought at the very first to
enter the world with the constancy and re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>solution
of a primitive Christian, and be
prepared to suffer all sort of publick Perse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cution.

is immediately treated as a common enemy,
instead of being look'd upon as a common
friend; and assaulted as generally, as if his
whole design were to prejudice the State,
and ruin the publick. I will venture to say,
no man ever rose to any degree of prefection
in writing, but through obstinacy and an in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veterate
resolution against the stream of man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kind:
So that if the world has receiv'd any
benefit from the labours of the Learned, it
was in its own despite. For when first they
essay their parts, all people in general are
prejudiced against new beginners; and when
they have got a little above contempt, then
some particular person who were before un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fortunate
in their own attempts, are sworn
foes to them only because they succeed.—Upon the whole, one may say of the best
writers, that they pay a severe fine for their
fame, which it is always in the power of the
most worthless part of mankind to levy
upon them when they please.</p>

               <p>I Am just enter'd upon the old way of
life again, sleep and musing. It is my
employment to revive the old of past ages
to the present, as it is yours to transmit
the young of the present, to the future. I
am copying the great Master in one art, with
the same love and diligence with which the
Painters hereafter will copy you in another.</p>
               <p>Thus I should begin my Epistle to you,
if it were a <hi>Dedicatory</hi> one. But as it is
a friendly letter, you are to find nothing
mention'd in your own praise but what
only one in the world is witness to, your
particular good-natur'd offices to me. What<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever
mankind in general would allow you,
that I am not to give you to your face; and
if I were to do it in your absence, the
world would tell me I am too partial to be
permitted to pass any judgment of you.</p>
               <p>So you see me cut out from any thing but
common acknowledgments, or common dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>course.
The first you wou'd take ill, tho'
I told you but half what I ought; so in short
the last only remains.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="73"/>
And as for the last, what can you expect
from a man who has not talk'd these five
days? who is withdrawing his thoughts as
far as he can, from all the present world,
its customs and its manners, to be fully
possest and absorpt in the past? When people
talk of going fo Church, I think of Sacri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fices
and libations; when I see the parson,
I address him as <hi>Chryses</hi> priest of <hi>Apollo</hi>;
and instead of the Lord's Prayer, I begin
<q>—God of the silver Bow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
While you in the world are concerned about
the <hi>Protestant</hi> Succession, I consider only
how <hi>Menalaus</hi> may recover <hi>Helen,</hi> and the
<hi>Trojan</hi> war be put to a speedy conclusion.
I never inquire if the Queen be well or
not, but heartily wish to be at <hi>Hector</hi>'s fu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neral.
The only things I regard in this life,
are whether my friends are well? whether
my Translation go well on? whether <hi>Den<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nis</hi>
be writing criticisms? whether any body
will answer him, since I don't? and whether

see what passes under my nose, and hear
nothing that is said about me. To fol<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low
Poetry as one ought, one must forget
father and mother, and cleave to it alone.
My <hi>Rêverie</hi> has been so deep, that I have
scarce had an interval to think myself un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>easy
in the want of your Company. I now

I fancy no friendship is so likely to prove
lasting as ours, because I am pretty sure
there never was a friendship of so easie a
nature. We neither of us demand any
mighty things from each other; what Va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity
we have expects its gratification from
other people. It is not I, that am to tell
you what an Artist you are, nor is it you
that are to tell me what a Poet I am;
but 'tis from the world abroad we hope,
(piously hope) to hear these things. At
home we follow our business, when we
have any; and think and talk most of each
other when we have none. 'Tis not unlike
the happy friendship of a stay'd man and
his wife, who are seldom so fond as to hin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der
the business, of the house from going
on all day, or so indolent as not to find
consolation in each other every evening.
Thus well-meaning couples hold in amity
to the last, by not expecting too much from
human nature; while romantick friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ships,
like violent loves, begin with dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quiets,
proceed to jealousies, and conclude
in animosities. I have liv'd to see the fierce
advancement, the sudden turn, and the
abrupt period of three or four of these
enormous friendships, and am perfectly con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vinc'd
of the truth of a Maxim we once
agreed in, That nothing hinders the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stant
agreement of people who live toge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther,

but meer vanity; a secret insisting
upon what they think their dignity or
merit, and an inward expectation of such
an Over-measure of deference and regard,
as answers to their own extravagant false
scale; and which no body can pay, because
none but themselves can tell, exactly, to
what pitch it amounts?</p>

The Task I undertook<note place="bottom" n="*">The Translation of <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Iliad.</hi>
                  </note>, tho' of weight
enough in itself, has had a voluntary in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>crease
by the inlarging my design of the
<hi>Notes</hi>; and the necessity of consulting a
number of books has carry'd me to <hi>Ox<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ford:</hi>
But I fear, thro' my Lord <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s
and Dr. <hi>Clarke</hi>'s means, I shall be more con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versant
with the pleasures and company of
<pb n="77" facs="77"/>
the place, than with the Books and Manu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scripts of it.</p>
               <p>I find still more reason to complain of
the negligence of the Geographers in their
Maps of <hi>old Greece,</hi> since I look'd upon two
or three more noted names in the publick
libraries here. But with all the care I am
capable of, I have some cause to fear the
Engraver will prejudice me in a few situ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ations.
I have been forced to write to him
in so high a style, that were my epistle in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tercepted,
it would raise no small admira<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
in an ordinary man. There is scarce
an order in it of less importance, than to
remove such and such mountains, alter the
course of such and such Rivers, place a large
city on such a coast, and raze another in
another country. I have set bounds to the
sea, and said to the land, <hi>thus far shalt
thou advance</hi> and <hi>no further</hi>
                  <note place="bottom" n="*">This relates to the Map of ancient <hi>Greece,</hi> laid down by
our Author in his Observations on the second <hi>Iliad.</hi>
                  </note>. In the mean
time, I who talk and command at this rate,
am in danger of losing my horse, and stand
in some fear of a country Justice. To dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>arm
me indeed may be but prudential, con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sidering
what armies I have at present on
foot, and in my service: a hundred thou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sand
<hi>Grecians</hi> are no contemptible boby;
for all that I can tell, they may be as for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>midable
<pb n="78" facs="78"/>
as four thousand <hi>Priests</hi>; and they
seem proper forces to send against those in
<hi>Barcelona.</hi> That siege deserves as fine a
poem as the <hi>Iliad,</hi> and the machining part
of poetry would be the juster in it, as they
say the inhabitants expect Angels from hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven
to their assistance. May I venture to
say, who am a <hi>Papist,</hi> and to say to you
who are a <hi>Papist,</hi> that nothing is more a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stonishing
to me, than that people so greatly
warm'd with a sense of Liberty, should be
capable of harbouring such weak Supersti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
and that so much bravery, and so
much folly, can inhabit the same breasts?</p>
               <p>I could not but take a trip to <hi>London,</hi> on
the death of the <hi>Queen,</hi> mov'd by the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon
curiosity of mankind, who leave their
own business to be looking upon other men's.
I thank God that as for my self, I am be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low
all the accidents of State-changes by my
circumstances, and above them by my phi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>losophy.
Common charity of man to man,
and universal good will to all, are the points
I have most at heart; and I am sure those
are not to be broken for the sake of any go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vernors,
or government. I am willing to
hope the best, and what I more wish than
my own or any particular man's advance<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,
is, that this turn may put an end
entirely to the divisions of <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory</hi>;
that the parties may love each other as
<pb n="79" facs="79"/>
well as I love them both; or at least hurt
each other as little as I would either; and
that our own people may live as quietly as
we shall certainly let theirs; that is to say,
that want of <hi>power</hi> it self in us may not
be a surer prevention of harm, than want
of <hi>will</hi> in them. I am sure if all <hi>Whigs</hi>
and all <hi>Tories</hi> had the spirit of one <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi>
that I know, it would be well
for all <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi>; and if all <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi>
had always had that spirit, it had
been well for all others, and we had never
been charg'd with so wicked a spirit as
that of Persecution.</p>
               <p>I agree with you in my sentiment of
the state of our nation since this change:
I find my self just in the same situation
of mind you describe as your own, hear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tily
wishing the good, that is the quiet of
my country, and hoping a total end of all
the unhappy divisions of mankind by party-spirit,
which at best is but the madness of
many for the gain of a few.</p>

               <p>I Have a particular to tell you at this time,
which pleases me so much, that you
must expect a more than ordinary alacrity
in every turn. You know I could keep you
in suspence for twenty lines, but I will tell
you directly that Mr. <hi>Addison</hi> and I have had
a conversation, that it would have been worth
your while to have been plac'd behind
the wainscot, or behind some half-length
Picture to have heard. He assur'd me that
he wou'd make use not only of his interest,
but of his art to do you some service; he
did not mean his Art of Poetry, but his Art
at Court; and he is sensible that nothing
can have a better air for himself, than
moving in your favour, especially since in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sinuations
were spread that he did not care
you shou'd prosper too much as a Poet.
He protests that it shall not be his fault if
there is not the best intelligence in the
world, and the most hearty friendship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
He owns, he was afraid Dr. <hi>Swift</hi> might
have carry'd you too far among the enemy
during the heat of the animosity, but now
<pb n="81" facs="81"/>
all is safe, and you are escap'd even in his
opinion. I promis'd in your name, like a
good Godfather, not that you should re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nounce
the devil and all his works, but that
you would be delighted to find him your
friend merely for his own sake; therefore
prepare your self for some civilities.</p>
               <p>I have done <hi>Homer</hi>'s head, shadow'd and
heighten'd carefully; and I inclose the out<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>line

or reduc'd to make room for feuillage or
laurel round the oval, or about the square
of the Busto? Perhaps there is something
more solemn in the Image itself, if I can

               <p>What you mention'd of the friendly

and has seem'd to be no very just one
to me; so I must own to you I expect no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing
but civility from him, how much
soever I wish for his friendship: And as
for any offices of real kindness or service
which it is in his power to do me, I should
be asham'd to receive 'em from any man
who had no better opinion of my morals,
than to think me a party-man; nor of my
temper, than to believe me capable of ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ligning
<pb n="83" facs="83"/>
or envying another's reputation as
a Poet. So I leave it to time to convince
him as to both, to shew him the shallow
depths of those half-wited creatures who
mis-inform'd him, and to prove that I am
incapable of endeavouring to lessen a person
whom I would be proud to imitate, and
therefore asham'd to flatter. In a word,
Mr. <hi>Addison</hi> is sure of my respect at all
times, and of my real friendship when<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever
he shall think fit to know me for
what I am.</p>
               <p>For all that pass'd betwixt Dr. <hi>Swift</hi> and
me, you know the whole (without reserve)
of our correspondence: The engagements
I had to him were such as the actual ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vices
he had done me, in relation to the
subscription for <hi>Homer,</hi> obliged me to. I
must have leave to be grateful to him, and
to any one who serves me, let him be
never so obnoxious to any party: nor did
the <hi>Tory-party</hi> ever put me to the hardship
of asking this leave, which is the greatest
obligation I owe to it; and I expect no
greater from the <hi>Whig-party</hi> than the same
liberty.—A curse on the word <hi>Party,</hi>
which I have been forc'd to use so often
in this period! I wish the present Reign
may put an end to the distinction, that there
may be no other for the future than that
of honest and knave, fool and man of sense;
<pb n="84" facs="84"/>
these two sorts must always be enemies,
but for the rest, may all people do as you
and I, believe what they please and be
friends.</p>

friends who omits no opportunities of
gratifying me, that you have lately been
pleas'd to speak of me in a manner which
nothing but the real respect I have for
you can deserve. May I hope that some
late malevolencies have lost their effect?
Indeed it is neither for me, nor my ene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mies,
to pretend to tell you whether I am
your friend or not; but it you would judge
by probabilities, I beg to know which of
your poetical acquaintance has so little In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terest
in pretending to be so? Methinks
no man should question the real friendship
of one who desires no real service: I am
only to get as much from the <hi>Whigs,</hi> as I
got by the <hi>Tories,</hi> that is to say, Civility;
being neither so proud as to be insensible
of any good office, nor so humble, as not
<pb n="85" facs="85"/>
to dare heartily to despise any man who
does me an injustice.</p>
               <p>I will not value my self upon having
ever guarded all the degrees of respect for
you; for (to say the truth) all the world
speaks well of you, and I should be under
a necessity of doing the same, whether I
car'd for you or not.</p>
               <p>As to what you have said of me, I shall
never believe that the Author of <hi>Cato</hi> can
speak one thing and think another. As a
proof that I account you sincere, I beg a
favour of you: It is, that you would look
over the two first books of my translation
of <hi>Homer,</hi> which are now in the hands of
my Lord <hi>Halifax.</hi> I am sensible how much
the reputation of any poetical work will
depend upon the character you give it:
'tis therefore some evidence of the trust I
repose in your good will, when I give you
this opportunity of speaking ill of me with
justice, and yet expect you will tell me your
truest thoughts, at the same time that you
tell others your most favourable ones.</p>
               <p>I have a farther request, which I must
press with earnestness, My Bookseller is
reprinting the <hi>Essay on Criticism,</hi> to which
you have done too much honour in your

               <p>MEthinks when I write to you, I am
making a confession, I have got (I
can't tell how) such a custom of throwing
my self out upon paper without reserve.
You were not mistaken in what you judg'd
of my temper of mind when I writ last.
My faults will not be hid from you, and
perhaps it is no dispraise to me that they
will not. The cleanness and purity of one's
mind is never better prov'd, than in dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>covering
its own faults at first view: as
when a Stream shows the dirt at its bot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tom,
it shows also the transparency of the
water.</p>

                  </note> abusive, angry
Critick could write of me. I take very
kindly your heroick manner of congra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tulation
upon this scandal; for I think
nothing more honourable, than to be in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>volved
in the same fate with all the great
<pb n="89" facs="89"/>
and the good that ever lived; that is, to be
envy'd and censur'd by bad writers.</p>
               <p>You do no more than answer my ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pectations
of you, in declaring how well
you take my freedom in sometimes neg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lecting
as I do, to reply to your Letters so
soon as I ought, those who have a right

can wave the ceremonial. A Friend is
the only one that will bear the omission;
and one may find who is not so, by the
very trial of it.</p>
               <p>As to any anxiety I have concerning the
fate of my <hi>Homer,</hi> the care is over with
me. The world must be the judge, and I
shall be the first to consent to the justice of
its judgment, whatever it be. I am not
so arrant an Author, as even to desire, that
if I am in the wrong, all mankind should
be so.</p>
               <p>I am mightily pleas'd with a saying of

               <p>THE Farce of the <hi>What-d'ye-call-it,</hi>
has occasioned many different specu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lations
in the town. Some look'd upon it as
meer jest upon the tragic poets, others as a
satire upon the late war. Mr. <hi>Cromwell</hi>
hearing none of the words, and seeing the
action to be tragical, was much astonished
to find the audience laugh; and says, the
Prince and Princess must doubtless be un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der
no less amazement on the same account.
Several templers, and others of the more
<pb n="91" facs="91"/>
vociferous kind of criticks, went with a re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>solution
to hiss, and confest they were forced
to laugh so much, that they forgot the de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sign
they came with. The Court in gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ral
has in a very particular manner come
into the jest, and the three first Nights,
(notwithstanding two of them were court-nights)
were distinguish'd by very full audi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ences
of the first quality. The common
people of the pit and gallery, receiv'd it
at first with great gravity and sedateness,
some few with tears; but after the third
day they also took the hint, and have ever
since been very loud in their claps. There
are still some sober men who cannot be of
the general opinion, but the laughers are
so much the majority, that one or two
criticks seem determined to undeceive the
town at their proper cost, by writing grave
dissertations against it: To encourage them
in which laudable design, it is resolv'd a

               <p>Yesterday Mr. <hi>Steel</hi>'s affair was decided:
I am sorry I can be of no other opinion

only been punish'd by others, but suffer'd
much even from his own party in the point
of character, nor (I believe) receiv'd any

amends in that of interest, as yet; what<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever
may be his Prospects for the future.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman, among a thousand
others, is a great instance of the fate of all
who are carried away by party-spirit, of
any side. I wish all violence may succeed

since she cannot do, I will.</p>
               <p>It was the enterprizing Mr. <hi>Lintott,</hi> the

in <hi>Windsor-forest.</hi> He said, he heard I de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sign'd
for <hi>Oxford,</hi> the seat of the muses, and
would, as my bookseller, by all means ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>company
me thither.</p>
               <p>I ask'd him where he got his horse? He
answer'd, he got it of his publisher: <q rend="inline">"For
that rogue, my printer, (said he) disap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pointed
me: I hoped to put him in good
humour by a treat at the tavern, of a
brown fricassee of rabbits which cost two
shillings, with two quarts of wine, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sides
my conversation. I thought myself
cocksure of his horse, which he readily
promis'd me, but said, that Mr. <hi>Tonson</hi>
had just such another design of going to
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> expecting there the copy of
<hi>a Comment upon the Revelations</hi>; and if
<pb n="97" facs="97"/>
Mr. <hi>Tonson</hi> went, he was preingag'd to
attend him, being to have the printing
of the said copy."</q>
               </p>
               <p>So in short, I borrow'd this stonehorse of
my publisher, which he had of Mr. <hi>Old-mixon</hi>
for a debt; he lent me too the pret<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty
boy you see after me; he was a smutty
dog yesterday, and cost me near two hours
to wash the ink off his face: but the De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vil
is a fair-condition'd Devil, and very
forward in his catechise: if you have any
more baggs, he shall carry them.</p>
               <p>I thought Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi>'s civility not to
be neglected, so gave the boy a small bagg,
containing three shirts and an Elzevir <hi>Vir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gil</hi>;
and mounting in an instant procceded
on the road, with my man before, my
curteous stationer beside, and the aforesaid
Devil behind.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> began in this manner. <q rend="inline">"Now

into the news-paper, how you and I

               </p>
               <p>Hereupon I enquir'd of his son. <q rend="inline">"The

sickly, <hi>much as you are</hi>—I spare

Pray don't you think <hi>Westminster</hi>
to be the best school in <hi>England?</hi> most
of the <hi>late Ministry</hi> came out of it, so

the Universities do but make Pedants,

               </p>
               <p>As Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> was talking, I observ'd
he sate uneasy on his saddle, for which I
express'd some sollicitude: Nothing says he,
I can bear it well enough; but since we
have the day before us, methinks it would
be very pleasant for you to rest a-while
under the Woods. When were alighted,
<q rend="inline">"See here, what a mighty pretty <hi>Horace</hi> I
have in my pocket? what if you amus'd
your self in turning an Ode, till we mount
again? Lord! if you pleas'd, what a

we ride on; the motion is an aid to my
fancy; a round trott very much awakens
my spirits. Then jog on apace, and I'll
think as hard as I can.</p>
               <p>Silence ensu'd for a full hour; after
which Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> lug'd the reins, stopt

<hi>Horace</hi> the <hi>quickest</hi> of any man in <hi>En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gland.</hi>

               <p>Pray Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi> (said I) now you talk
of Translators, what is your method of ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>naging
them? <q rend="inline">"Sir (replied he) those are
the saddest pack of rogues in the world:
In a hungry fit, they'll swear they un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derstand
all the languages in the uni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verse:
I have known one of them take
down a <hi>Greek</hi> book upon my counter

it from the latter end. By G<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter" rend="content:_">

never be sure in these fellows, for I nei<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther
understand <hi>Greek, Latin, French,</hi>
nor <hi>Italian</hi> my self. But this is my
way: I agree with them for ten shillings
<hi>per</hi> sheet, with a proviso, that I will
have their doings corrected by whom I
<pb n="100" facs="100"/>
please; so by one or other they are led
at last to the true sense of an author;
my judgment giving the negative to all
my Translators."</q> But how are you se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cure
that those correctors may not impose
upon you? <q rend="inline">"Why I get any civil genetle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man,
(especially any <hi>Scotchman</hi>) that
comes into my shop, to read the origi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nal
to me in <hi>English</hi>; by this I know
whether my first Translator be deficient,
and whether my Corrector merits his

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I'll tell you what happen'd to me last

to the corrector to compare with the

translation, and found it the same word

what d'ye think I did? I arrested the

the <hi>Corrector's pay</hi> too, upon this proof

               <p>Pray tell me next how you deal with
the Critics? <q rend="inline">"Sir (said he) nothing more

of them; the rich one's for a sheet a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piece
of the blotted manuscript, which
costs me nothing. They'll go about

they had it from the author, who
submitted to their correction: this has
given some of them such an air, that in

and dedicated to, as the top critics of
the town.—As for the poor Critics,
I'll give you one instance of my manage<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,
by which you may guess at the
rest. A lean man that look'd like a very
good scholar, came to me t'other day;
he turn'd over <hi>Homer,</hi> shook his head,
shrug'd up his shoulders, and pish'd at
every line of it; <hi>One would wonder</hi>
(says he) <hi>at the strange presumption of
men</hi>; Homer <hi>is</hi> no such easy task, that
every <hi>Stripling,</hi> every <hi>Versifier</hi>—he
was going on when my Wife call'd to
dinner: Sir, said I, will you please to
eat a <hi>piece of beef</hi> with me? Mr. <hi>Lintott,</hi>
said he, <hi>I am sorry you should be at the

               </p>
               <p>Now Sir (concluded Mr. <hi>Lintott</hi>) in re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn
to the frankness I have shewn, pray
tell me, <q rend="inline">"Is it the opinion of your friends

the memory of so many agreeable conver<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sations
as we have pass'd together. I wish
it were a compliment to say such conver<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sations
as are not to be found on this side

Party affects us all, even the wits,
tho' they gain as little by politicks as they
do by their wit. We talk much of fine
sense, refin'd sense, and exalted sense; but
for use and happiness give me a little com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon
sense. I say this in regard to some
gentlemen, profess'd wits of our acquain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tance,
who fancy they can make Poetry of
consequence at this time of day, in the
midst of this raging fit of Politicks. For
they tell me, the busy part of the nation are
not more divided about <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory,</hi>
than these idle fellows of the Feather about
Mr. <hi>Tickel</hi>'s and my Translation. I (like
the <hi>Tories</hi>) have the town in general, that
is the mob, on my side; but 'tis usual with
the smaller Party to make up in industry
what they want in number, and that's the
case with the little Senate of <hi>Cato.</hi> How<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever,
if our Principles be well consider'd, I

in general, he to gratify the inordi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nate
desires of One man only. We have
it seems, a great <hi>Turk</hi> in Poetry, who can ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver
bear a Brother on the throne; and has
his Mutes too, a sett of Nodders, Winkers,
and Whisperers, whose business is to strangle
all other offsprings of wit in their birth.
The new Translator of <hi>Homer</hi> is the hum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>blest
slave he has, that is to say, his first
Minister; let him receive the honours he
gives him, but receive them with fear and
trembling: let him be proud of the ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>probation
of his absolute Lord; I appeal
to the People, as my rightful judges and
masters; and if they are not inclin'd to
condemn me, I fear no arbitrary high-flying
proceedings from the small Court-faction
at <hi>Button</hi>'s. But after all I have said
of this great Man, there is no rupture be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tween
us: We are each of us so civil and
obliging, that neither thinks he is obliged.
And I for my part treat with him, as we
do with the <hi>Grand Monarch</hi>; who has too
many great qualities not to be respected,
tho' we know he watches any occasion to
oppress us.</p>

I heartily joyn with you in wishing Quiet
to our native country: Quiet in the state,
which like charity in religion, is too much
the perfection and happiness of either, to
be broken or violated on any pretence or
prospect whatsoever: Fire and sword, and
fire and faggot are equally my aversion.
I can pray for opposite parties, and for
opposite religions, with great sincerity. I
think to be a lover of one's Country is a glo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rious

a one as to be a lover of Mankind.</p>

This has been applauded so much, that I
am in danger of commencing Poet, perhaps

<hi>Frank</hi> and <hi>Betty</hi> (that constant Pair) can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not

I fancy they will be forced to make their

as Dr. <hi>Parnelle</hi> and Dr. <hi>Swift.</hi> I hope
the spring will restore you to us, and
with you all the beauties and colours of
nature. Not but I congratulate you on the
pleasure you must take in being admir'd in
your own Country, which so seldom hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pens
to Prophets and Poets. But in this you
<pb n="121" facs="121"/>
have the Advantage of Poets; you are
Master of an Art that must prosper and
grow rich, as long as people love, or are
proud of themselves, or their own persons.
However, you have stay'd long enough, me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thinks,
to have painted all the numberless
Histories of old <hi>Ogygiae.</hi> If you have begun
to be Historical, I recommend to your
hand the story which every pious <hi>Irishman</hi>
ought to begin with, that of St. <hi>Patrick:</hi>
To the end you may be obliged (as Dr. P.
was, when he translated the <hi>Batrachomuo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>machia</hi>)
to come into <hi>England</hi> to copy the
Frogs, and such other Vermine as were ne<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver
seen in that land since the time of that
Confessor.</p>
               <p>I long to see you a History Painter. You
have already done enough for the Private,
do something for the Publick; and be not
confined, like the rest, to draw only such
silly stories as our own faces tell of us. The
Ancients too expect you should do them
right; those Statues from which you learn'd
your beautiful and noble Ideas, demand it
as a piece of Gratitude from you, to make
them truly known to all nations, in the ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count
you intend to write of their <hi>Charac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters.</hi>
I hope you think more warmly than
ever of that noble design.</p>
               <p>As to your enquiry about your House,
when I come within the walls, they put
<pb n="122" facs="122"/>
me in mind of those of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where
your Friend, like the wandring <hi>Trojan,</hi>
                  <q>Animunt Pictura pascit inani.</q>
For the spacious Mansion, like a <hi>Turkish</hi>
Caravanserah, entertains the Vagabond with
only bare Lodging. I rule the Family very
ill, keep bad Hours, and lend out your
Pictures about the Town. See what it is
to have a Poet in your House! <hi>Frank</hi> in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deed
does all he can in such a Circumstance,
for considering he has a wild Beast in it,
he constantly keeps the Door chain'd.
Every time it is open'd, the Links rattle,
the rusty Hinges roar, the House seems
so sensible that you are its support, that it
is ready to drop in your Absence; but I
still trust my self under its Roof, as depend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
that Providence will preserve so many
<hi>Raphaels, Titian's</hi> and <hi>Guido's,</hi> as are lodg'd
in your Cabinet. Surely the Sins of one
Poet can hardly be so heavy, as to bring
an old House over the Heads of so many
Painters. In a word, your House is fal<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ling,

your letter of the 10th <hi>Aug. O. S.</hi> It

and the Subjects follow at a distance.
The Ladies are of all parties, by which
means the conversation of the Men is very
much softned and fashioned from those
blunt disputes on Politicks, and rough Jests,
we are so guilty of; while the Freedom of
the Women takes away all Formality and
Constraint. I must own, at the same time,
these Beauties are a little too artificial for
my Taste; you have seen a <hi>French</hi> Picture,
the Original is more painted, and such a
crust of Powder and essence in their Hair,
that you can see no difference between
<pb n="124" facs="124"/>
black and red. By disusing Stays, and in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dulging
themselves at Table, they are run

may give a good reason, they prefer Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>veniency

               <p>I Have long had it in my thoughts to
trouble you with a Letter, but was
discouraged for want of something that I
could think worth sending fifteen hundred
Miles. <hi>Italy</hi> is such an exhausted Subject,
that, I dare say, you'd easily forgive my
saying nothing of it; and the imagination
of a Poet, is a thing so nice and delicate,
that it is no easy matter to find out Images
capable of giving Pleasure to one of the
few, who (in any Age) have come up to
that Character. I am nevertheless lately
return'd from an Island, where I passed three
or four Months, which, were it set out in
its true Colours, might methinks amuse
you agreeably enough for a minute or two.
The Island <hi>Inarime,</hi> is an Epitome of the
whole Earth, containing within the compass
of eighteen Miles, a wonderful variety of
Hills, Vales, ragged Rocks, fruitful Plains,
and barren Mountains, all thrown together
in a most romantic Confusion. The Air is
<pb n="126" facs="126"/>
in the hottest Season, constantly refreshed
by cool breezes from the Sea. The Vales
produce excellent Wheat and <hi>Indian</hi> Corn,
but are mostly covered with Vineyards, in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>termixt
with Fruit-trees. Besides the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon
kinds, as Cherries, Apricots, Pea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ches,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> they produce Oranges, Limes,
Almonds, Pomegranates, Figs, Water Me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lons,
and many other Fruits unknown to
our Climates, which lie every where open
to the Passenger. The Hills are the greater
part covered to the top with Vines, some
with Chesnut Groves, and others with
thickets of Myrtle and Lentiscus. The
Fields in the Northern side are divided by
hedge-rows of Myrtle. Several Fountains
and Rivulets add to the Beauty of this Land<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>scape,
which is likewise set off by the va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riety
of some barren Spots, and naked Rocks.
But that which crowns the Scene, is a large
Mountain, rising out of the middle of the
Island (once a terrible <hi>Volcano,</hi> by the An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cients
called <hi>Mons Epomeus</hi>) its lower parts
are adorned with Vines, and other Fruits,
the middle affords Pasture to flocks of Goats
and Sheep, and the top is a sandy pointed
Rock, from which you have the finest Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spect
in the World, surveying at one view,
besides several pleasant Islands lying at your
Feet, a tract of <hi>Italy</hi> about three hundred
Miles in length, from the Promontory of
<pb n="127" facs="127"/>
                  <hi>Antium,</hi> to the Cape of <hi>Palinurus.</hi> The
greater part of which, hath been sung by
<hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> as making a considerable
part of the Travels and Adventures of their
two Heroes. The Islands <hi>Caprea, Prochyta,</hi>
and <hi>Parthenope,</hi> together with <hi>Cajeta, Cumae,</hi>
                  <hi>Monte Miseno,</hi> the Habitations of <hi>Circe,</hi>
the <hi>Syrens,</hi> and the <hi>Lestrygones,</hi> the Bay
of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Promontory of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and
the whole <hi>Campagnia felice,</hi> make but a
part of this noble Landscape; which would
demand an Imagination as warm, and num<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bers
as flowing as your own, to describe it.
The Inhabitants of this delicious Isle, as
they are without Riches and Honours, so
are they without the Vices and Follies that
attend them; and were they but as much
strangers to Revenge, as they are to Ava<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rice
or Ambition, they might in fact answer
the poetical Notions of the Golden Age.
But they have got, as an alloy to their Hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piness,
an ill habit of murdering one
another on slight Offences. We had an
Instance of this the second Night after our
Arrival; a Youth of eighteen, being shot
dead by our Door: And yet by the sole secret
of minding our own Business, we found
a means of living securely among these
dangerous People. Would you know how
we pass the time at <hi>Naples?</hi> Our chief En<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tertainment
is the Devotion of our Neigh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bours.
<pb n="128" facs="128"/>
Besides the gayety of their Churches
(where Folks go to see what they call <hi>una
bella Devotione</hi> (i. e.) a sort of Religious
Opera) they make Fireworks almost every
Week, out of Devotion; the Streets are
often hung with Arras, out of Devotion;
and (what is still more strange) the Ladies
invite Gentlemen to their Houses, and treat
them with Musick and Sweetmeats, out of
Devotion; in a word, were it not for this
Devotion of its Inhabitants, <hi>Naples</hi> would
have little else to recommend it, beside the
Air and Situation. Learning is in no very
thriving state here, as indeed no where else
in <hi>Italy.</hi> However, among many pretenders,
some Men of taste are to be met with. A
Friend of mine told me not long since,
that being to visit <hi>Salvini</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> he
found him reading your <hi>Homer.</hi> He liked
the Notes extreamly, and could find no
other fault with the Version, but that he
thought it approached too near a Paraphrase;
which shews him not to be sufficiently ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quainted
with our Language. I wish you
Health to go on with that noble Work, and
when you have that, I need not wish
you Success. You will do me the Justice
to believe, that whatever relates to your
Welfare is sincerely wished, by</p>

               <p>THE old project of a Window in the
bosom, to render the Soul of Man
visible, is what every honest friend has
manifold reason to wish for; yet even that
would not do in our case, while you are so
far separated from me, and so long. I be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gin
to fear you'll die in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that
the Denunciation will be fulfilled upon you,
<hi>Hibernus es, &amp; in Hiberniam reverteris</hi>—I should be apt to think you in <hi>Sancho</hi>'s
case; some Duke has made you Governor
of an Island, or wet place, and you are ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ministring
Laws to the wild <hi>Irsh.</hi> But I
must own, when you talk of <hi>Building</hi> and
<hi>Planting,</hi> you touch my String; and I am
as apt to pardon you, as the Fellow that
thought himself <hi>Jupiter</hi> would have par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>don'd
the other Madman who call'd him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self
his Brother <hi>Neptune.</hi> Alas, Sir, do you
know whom you talk to? One that had
been a Poet, was degraded to a Transla<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tor,
and at last thro' meer dulness is turn'd
an Architect. You know <hi>Martial</hi>'s Censure—<hi>Praeconem
facito, vel Architectum.</hi> However
I have one way left, to plan, to <hi>elevate,</hi> and
<pb n="130" facs="130"/>
                  <hi>to surprize</hi> (as <hi>Bays says.</hi>) The next you
may expect to hear, is that I am in Debt.</p>
               <p>The History of my Transplantation
and Settlement which you desire, would
require a Volume, were I to enumerate the
many projects, difficulties, vicissitudes, and
various fates attending that important part
of my Life: Much more, should I describe
the many Draughts, Elevations, Profiles,
Perspectives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of every Palace and Gar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>den
propos'd, intended, and happily raised,
by the strength of that Faculty wherein all
great Genius's excel, Imagination. At last,
the Gods and Fate have fix'd me on the
borders of the <hi>Thames,</hi> in the Districts of
<hi>Richmond</hi> and <hi>Twickenham.</hi> It is here I
have past an entire Year of my life, without
any fix'd abode in <hi>London,</hi> or more than
casting a transitory glance (for a day or two
at most in a Month) on the pomps of the
Town. It is here I hope to receive you, Sir,
return'd in triumph from Eternizing the
<hi>Ireland</hi> of <hi>this Age.</hi> For you my Structures
rise; for you my Colonades extend their
Wings; for you my Groves aspire, and
Roses bloom. And to say truth, I hope
Posterity (which no doubt will be made
acquainted with all there things) will look
upon it as one of the principal Motives of
my Architecture, that it was a Mansion
prepar'd to receive you, against your own
<pb n="131" facs="131"/>
should fall to dust, which is destin'd to be
the Tomb of poor—and—and the
immortal Monument of the Fidelity of two
such Servants, who have excell'd in Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stancy
the very Rats of your Family.</p>
               <p>What more can I tell you of myself?
so much, and yet all put together so little, that
I scarce care, or know, how to do it. But the
very reasons that are against putting it upon
Paper, are as strong for telling it you in
Person; and I am uneasy to be so long de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny'd
the satisfaction of it.</p>
               <p>At present I consider you bound in by
the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea, like the Ghosts in <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                  <q>

and I can't express how I long to renew
our old intercourse and conversation, our
morning Conferences in bed in the same
Room, our evening Walks in the Park, our
amusing Voyages on the Water, our philo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sophical
Suppers, our Lectures, our Disser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tations,
our Gravities, our Reveries, our
Fooleries, our what not?—This awak<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ens
the memory of some of those who
have made a part in all these. Poor <hi>Parnelle,</hi>
                  <hi>Garth, Rowe!</hi> You justly reprove me for
not speaking of the Death of the last:
<hi>Parnelle</hi> was too much in my mind, to
<pb n="132" facs="132"/>
whose Memory I am erecting the best Mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nument
I can. What he gave me to publish,
was but a small part of what he left behind
him, but it was the best, and I will not make
it worse by enlarging it. I'd fain know if
he be buried at <hi>Chester,</hi> or <hi>Dublin</hi>; and what
care has been, or is to be taken for his
Monument, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet I have not neglected
my Devoirs to Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi>; I am writing
this very day his Epitaph for <hi>Westminster-Abbey</hi>After these, the best natur'd of
Men, Sir <hi>Samuel Garth,</hi> has left me in
the truest concern for his loss. His Death
was very Heroical, and yet unaffected enough
to have made a Saint, or a Philosopher fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mous:
But ill Tongues, and worse Hearts
have branded even his last Moments, as
wrongfully as they did his Life, with Ir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>religion.
You must have heard many
Tales on this Subject; but if ever there was
a good Christian without knowing himself
to be so, it was Dr. <hi>Garth.</hi>

               <p>I Had pleas'd myself sooner in writing
to you, but that I have been your Suc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cessor
in a Fit of Sickness, and am not yet
so much recovered, but that I have thoughts
of using your <note place="bottom" n="*">Asses.</note> Physicians. They are as
grave Persons as any of the Faculty, and
(like the Antients) carry their own Medi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>caments
about with them. But indeed the
Moderns are such lovers of Raillery, that
nothing is grave enough to escape them.
Let 'em laugh, but People will sill have

I am glad you are so much in a better
state of Health, as to allow me to jest
about it. My concern, when I heard of
your Danger, was so very serious, that I
almost take it ill Dr. <hi>Evans</hi> should tell you
of it, or you mention it. I tell you fairly,
if you and a few more such people were to
leave the World, I would not give six-pence
to stay in it.</p>
               <p>I am not so much concern'd as to the
point, whether you are to live fat or lean:
Most Men of Wit or Honesty are usually
decreed to live very lean; so I am inclined
to the opinion that 'tis decreed you shall:
However be comforted, and reflect that
you'll make the better Busto for it.</p>
               <p>'Tis something particular in you, not to
be satisfied with sending me your own
Books, but to make your Acquaintance
continue the frolick. Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> forc'd
me to take <hi>Gorboduc,</hi> which has since done
me great credit with several people, as it
has done <hi>Dryden</hi> and <hi>Oldham</hi> some dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>kindness,
in shewing there is as much diffe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rence
between their <hi>Gorbuduc,</hi> and this,
as between Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> and King <hi>George.</hi>
It is truly a <hi>scandal,</hi> that Men should
write with contempt of a Piece which
they never once saw, as those two Poets
did, who were ignorant even of the Sex,
as well as Sense, of <hi>Gorboduc.</hi>

               <p>TO convince you how little pain I

Men of good Nature, and good Understand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing,
you see I omit to answer your Letters

<pb n="138" facs="137"/>
therefore you are ever moved on my ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>count

rest of this Paper, it should be spotted and
diversified with Conceits all over; you
should be put out of breath with Laughter
at each Sentence, and pause at each Period,
to look back over how much Wit you had
pass'd. But I have found by experience,
that people now a-days regard Writing as
little as they do Preaching: The most we
can hope is to be heard, just with Decency
and Patience, once a week, by Folks in the
Country: Here in Town we hum over a
piece of fine Writing, and we whistle at a
Sermon. The Stage is the only place we
seem alive at; there indeed we stare, and
roar, and clap hands for K. <hi>George</hi> and the
Government. As for all other Virtues but
this Loyalty, they are an obsolete Train,
so ill-dress'd, that Men, Women, and Chil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dren
hiss 'em out of all good Company.
Humility knocks so sneakingly at the door,
<pb n="139" facs="138"/>
that every Footman out-raps it, and makes
it give way to the free Entrance of Pride,
Prodigality, and Vain-glory.</p>
               <p>My Lady <hi>Scudamore,</hi> from having rusti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cated
in your Company too long, really
behaves herself scandalously amongst us: She
pretends to open her eyes for the sake of
seeing the Sun, and to sleep because it is
Night; drinks Tea at nine in the Morn<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing,
and is thought to have said her Prayers
before; talks without any manner of shame
of good Books, and has not seen <hi>Cibber</hi>'s
Play of the <hi>Non-juror.</hi> I rejoyced the other
day to see a Libel on her Toilette, which
gives me some hope that you have at least
a Taste of Scandal left you, in defect of all
other Vices.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter, I heartily wish
you well; but as I cannot entirely desire
the ruin of all the Joys of this City, so all
that remains is to wish you wou'd keep
your Happiness to yourselves, that the
happiest here may not die with Envy at
a Bliss which they cannot attain to.</p>

however to say truth has rather been em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ploy'd

I find it is in the Finishing a Book, as in

it very late. There are many unlook'd-for
Incidents to retard the Clearing <hi>any publick

plagued my self, like great Ministers, with
undertaking too much for one Man, and
with a Desire of doing more than was expect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed
from me, have done less than I ought.</p>
               <p>For having design'd Four very laborious
and uncommon sorts of Indexes to <hi>Homer,</hi>
I'm forced, for want of time, to publish
two only; the design of which you will own
to be pretty, tho' far from being fully exe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cuted.
I've also been oblig'd to leave un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>finish'd
in my desk the Heads of two Essays,
one on the <hi>Theology</hi> and <hi>Morality</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi>
and another on the <hi>Oratory</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> and

               <p>I think of you every day, I assire you,
even without such good Memorials of you

Elder Sons wish they had Fathers to their

               <p>I can't touch upon the subject of filial
Love, without putting you in mind of an
old Woman, who has a sincere, hearty, old<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fashion'd
respect for you, and constantly
blames her Son for not having writ to you
oftner, to tell you so.</p>
               <p>I very much wish (but what signifies my

beneath an unclouded Sun, at the same time
that its Banks retain the Verdure of Showers:
Our Gardens are offering their first Nosegays;

curiosity of the Passenger from the River,
where, upon beholding a mixture of Beauty

I am building, is, that it will afford me a
few pleasant Rooms for such a Friend as
yourself, or a cool situation for an hour or
two for Lady <hi>Scudamore,</hi> when she will do
me the honour (at this Publick House on
the Road) to drink her own Cyder.</p>

               <p>YOUR Doctor is going to the <hi>Bath,</hi>
and stays a Fortnight or more: Per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps
you would be comforted to have a
Sight of him, whether you need him or
not. I think him as good a Doctor as any
for one that is ill, and a better Doctor than
any one for one that is well. He would
do admirably for Mrs. <hi>Mary Digby:</hi> She
needed only to follow his Hints, to be in
eternal business and amusement of mind,
and even as active as she could desire. But
indeed I fear she would out-walk him: For
(as Dean <hi>Swift</hi> observ'd to me the very first
time I saw the Doctor) <hi>He is a Man that can
do every thing, but walk.</hi> His Brother, who
is lately come into <hi>England,</hi> goes also to the
<hi>Bath</hi>; and is a more extraordinary Man than
he, worth your going thither on purpose to
know him. The Spirit of <hi>Philanthropy,</hi> so
long dead to our World, is reviv'd in him:
He is a Philosopher all of fire; so warmly,
nay so wildly in the right, that he forces all
others about him to be so too, and draws
them into his own <hi>Vortex.</hi> He is a Star that
<pb n="146" facs="145"/>
looks as if it were all Fire, but is all Benig<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nity,
all gentle and beneficial Influence.
If there be other men in the world that
would serve a Friend, yet He is the only one
I believe that could make even an Enemy
serve a Friend.</p>
               <p>As all human Life is chequer'd and mixed
with Acquisitions and Losses (tho' the latter
are more certain and irremediable, than the
former lasting or satisfactory) so at the time
I have gain'd the acquaintance of one wor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thy
Man I have lost another, a very easy,
humane, and gentlemanly Neighbour, Mr.
<hi>Stonor.</hi> It's certain the Loss of one of this
Character puts us naturally upon setting a
greater Value on the few that are left, tho'
the degree of our Esteem may be different.
Nothing, says <hi>Seneca,</hi> is so melancholy a
circumstance in human life, or so soon re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>conciles
us to the thought of our own death,
as the reflection and prospect of one Friend
after another dropping round us! Who
would stand alone, the sole remaining Ruin,
the last tottering Column of all the Fabrick
of Friendship; once so large, seemingly so
strong, and yet so suddenly sunk and buried?</p>

               <p>I Have belief enough in the goodness of

be pleas'd that I am arriv'd in safety at
<hi>Twickenham</hi>; tho' 'tis a sort of Earnest, that
you will be troubled again with me at <hi>Sher<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>borne,</hi>

One of your places, it may be in that as in
liking One of your family; when one sees

the happiness they may want, and the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinuance
of all the happiness they have; and
I take the latter to comprize a great deal
more than the former. I must separate Lady
<hi>Scudamore</hi> from you, as I fear she will do
herself, before this letter reaches you: So I
wish her a good journey, and I hope one
day to try if she lives as well as You do;
tho' I much question if she can live as quiet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly:
I suspect the Bells will be ringing at her
arrival, and on her own and Miss <hi>Scudamore</hi>'s

Man than to content myself with thanking
him in the common way. I am in as sincere
a sense of the word, His Servant, as you are
his Son, or he your Father.</p>
               <p>I must in my turn insist upon hearing how
my last fellow-travellers got home from <hi>Cla<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rendon,</hi>

               <p>YOUR making a sort of Apology for
your not writing, is a very genteel
reproof to me. I know I was to blame,
but I know I did not intend to be so, and
(what is the happiest Knowledge in the

I'm told you are all upon removal
very speedily, and that Mrs. <hi>Mary Digby</hi>
talks in a Letter to Lady <hi>Scudamore,</hi> of
seeing my Lord <hi>Bathurst</hi>'s Wood in her
way. How much I wish to be her Guide
thro' that enchanted Forest, is not to be
exprest: I look upon myself as the Magi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cian
appropriated to the place, without
whom no mortal can penetrate into the
Recesses of those sacred Shades. I could
pass whole Days, in only describing to
<pb n="150" facs="149"/>
her the future, and as yet visionary Beau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties,
that are to rise in those Scenes:
The Palace that is to be built, the Pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>villions
that are to glitter, the Colonnades
that are to adorn them: Nay more, the
meeting of the <hi>Thames</hi> and the <hi>Severn,</hi>
which (when the noble Owner has finer
Dreams than ordinary) are to be led into
each others Embraces thro' secret Caverns
of not above twelve or fifteen Miles, till
they rise and openly celebrate their Mar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>riage
in the midst of an immense Amphi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>theatre,
which is to be the Admiration of
Posterity a hundred Years hence. But till
the destin'd time shall arrive that is to
manifest these Wonders, Mrs. <hi>Digby</hi> must
content herself with seeing what is at
present no more than the finest Wood
in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Objects that attract this part of
the world, are of a quite different Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture.
Women of Quality are all turn'd
Followers of the <hi>Camp</hi> in <hi>Hyde-Park</hi>
this Year, whither all the Town resort to
magnificent Entertainments given by the
Officers, &amp;c. The <hi>Scythian</hi> Ladies that
dwelt in the Waggons of War, were not
more closely attached to the Luggage.
The Matrons, like those of <hi>Sparta,</hi> attend
their Sons to the Field, to be the Witnesses
of their glorious Deeds; and the Maidens
<pb n="151" facs="150"/>
with all their Charms display'd, provoke the
Spirit of the Soldiers: Tea and Coffee sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ply
the place of <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> black Broth.
This Camp seems crowned with perpetual
Victory, for every Sun that rises in the
Thunder of Cannon, sets in the Musick
of Violins. Nothing is yet wanting but
the constant presence of the <hi>Princess,</hi> to

Expectation to see you in Town. Indeed
since the willing Confinement I have lain
under here with my Mother, (whom it is
natural and reasonable I should rejoice with

your Absence from <hi>London,</hi> for I could
hardly have seen you there; and it would
not have been quite reasonable to have drawn
you to a sick Room hither from the first
Embraces of your Friends. My Mother is

Nature to look upon her. I may recom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mend

(and that a favourite) Account, that it is the

               <p>A Fever carry'd me on the high Gallop

You are all of one Heart and one Soul, as

like the Kingdom of the Just upon Earth;
not a wicked Wretch to interrupt you; but
a Set of try'd, experienc'd Friends, and fel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low

of Folly Militant, when you may reign for

I appeal to a Third Lady in your

and the least warp'd by idle Fashion
and Custom, of you all; I appeal to Her,
if you are not every Soul of you better Peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple,

would, or durst speak her Sense, and em<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ploy
that Reasoning which God has given
her, to infuse more Thoughtfulness into you
all; those Arguments could not fail to put
you to the blush, and keep you out of Town,
like People sensible of your own Felicities.
I am not without hopes, if She can detain

sitting, or rather reclining, on a Bank, fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tigu'd
with over much Dancing and Sing<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
at his unwearied Request and Instigation.
I know your love of Ease so well, that you
might be in danger of being too Quiet to
enjoy Quiet, and too Philosophical to be a
Philosopher; were it not for the Ferment
Lord <hi>B.</hi> will put you into. One of his Lord<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship's
Maxims is, that a total Abstinence
from Intemperance or Business, is no more
<hi>Philosophy,</hi> than a total Consopition of the
Senses is <hi>Repose</hi>; one must <hi>Feel</hi> enough of
its Contrary to have a Relish of either.
But after all, let your Temper work, and
be as sedate and contemplative as you will,
I'll engage you shall be fit for his Lordship
when you come to Town in the Winter.
Folly will laugh you into all the Customs
of the Company here; nothing will be able
to prevent your Conversion to her, but In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>disposition,
which I hope will be far from
you. I am telling the worst that can come

Folly is many an honest Man's, nay every

               </p>
               <p>So much for your Diversions next Winter,
and for mine. I envy you much more at
present, than I shall then; for if there be on
Earth an Image of Paradise, it is in such
perfect Union and Society as you all possess.
I wou'd have my innocent Envies and
Wishes of your State known to you all;
which is far better than making you Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pliments,
for it is inward Approbation and
Esteem. My Lord <hi>Digby</hi> has in me a sin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cere

               <p>I AM glad your Travels delighted you,
improve you I am sure they could not;
you are not so much a Youth as that, tho'
you run about with a King of Sixteen, and
<pb n="160" facs="159"/>
(what makes him still more a Child) a King
of <hi>Frenchmen.</hi> My own Time has been
more melancholy, spent in an Attendance
upon Death, which has seized one of our
Family, my poor old Nurse. My Mother
is something better, though at her advanc'd
Age every Day is a Climacterick. There
was join'd to this an Indisposition of my own,
which I ought to look upon as a slight one,
compar'd with my Mother's, (because my
Life is not of half the Consequence to any
Body, that hers is to me.) All these Inci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dents
have hinder'd my more speedy Reply
to your obliging Letter.</p>
               <p>The Article you enquire of, is of as little
Concern to me as you desire it shou'd;
namely the Railing Papers about the <hi>Odyssey.</hi>
If the Book has Merit, (and since you like it,
it must) it will extinguish all such nasty Scan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dal,
as the Sun puts an end to stinks, meerly
by <hi>coming out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I wish I had nothing to trouble me more;
an honest Mind is not in the power of any
dishonest one: To break its Peace, there must
be some Guilt or Consciousness, which is
inconsistent with its own Principles. Not
but Malice and Injustice have their Day,
like some poor short-liv'd Vermine, that die
of shooting their own Stings. <hi>Falshood is
Folly</hi> (says <hi>Homer</hi>) and Liers and Calumni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ators
at last hurt none but themselves, even
<pb n="161" facs="160"/>
in this World: In the next, 'tis Charity
to say, God have Mercy on them! They
were the Devil's Vice-gerents upon Earth,
who is the Father of Lies, and I fear has a
Right to dispose of his Children.</p>
               <p>I've had an Occasion to make these Re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>flections
of late, more justly than from any
thing that concerns my Writings, for it is
one that concerns my Morals, and (which I
ought to be as tender of as my own) the
good Character of another very innocent
Person, who I'm sure shares your Friendship
no less than I do. **** No Creature has
better natural Dispositions, or would act
more rightly, or reasonably, in every Duty,
did she act by herself, or from herself: But

               <p>IT is now the Season to wish you a good
End of one Year, and a happy Beginning
of another: but both these you know how
to make yourself, by only continuing such
<pb n="162" facs="161"/>
a Life as you have been long accustomed to
lead. As for Good Works, they are things
I dare not name, either to those that do
them, or to those that do them not; the first
are too modest, and the latter too selfish, to
bear the mention of what are become either
too old-fashion'd, or too private, to consti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tute
any Part of the Vanity or Reputation
of the present Age. However, it were to
be wish'd People would now and then look
upon Good Works as they do upon old
Wardrobes, meerly in case any of'em should
by chance come into Fashion again; as an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cient
Fardingales revive in modern Hoop'd
Petticoats, (which may be properly compar'd
to Charities, as they cover a multitude of
Sins.)</p>
               <p>They tell me that at—certain anti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quated
Charities, and obsolete Devotions are
yet subsisting: That a thing called Christian
Chearfulness, (not incompatible with <hi>Christ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mas</hi>
Pyes and Plum-broth) whereof frequent
is the mention in old Sermons and Alma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nacks,
is really kept alive and in Practise:
That feeding the Hungry, and giving Alms
to the Poor, do yet make a Part of good
House-keeping, in a Latitude not more re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mote
from <hi>London</hi> than fourscore Miles:
And lastly, that Prayers and Roast-beef
actually make some People as happy, as a
Whore and a Bottle. But here in Town
<pb n="163" facs="162"/>
I assure you, Men, Women, and Children
have done with these things. Charity not
only begins, but ends, at home. Instead of
the four Cardinal Virtues, now reign four
Princely ones: We have Cunning for Pru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dence,
Rapine for Justice, Time-serving for
Fortitude, and Luxury for Temperance.
Whatever you may fancy where you live
in a State of Ignorance, and see nothing but
Quiet, Religion and Good Humour, the
Case is just as I tell you where People under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stand
the World, and know how to live
with Credit and Glory.</p>
               <p>I wish that Heaven would open the
Eyes of Men, and make 'em sensible <hi>which</hi>
of these is right: Whether upon a due
Conviction, we are to quit Faction, and
Gaming, and High-feeding and Whoring,
and take to your Country Way? or you
to leave Prayers, and Almsgiving, and Read<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
and Exercise, and come into our Mea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sures?

               <p>I Know of nothing that will be so Inte<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ressing
to you at present, as some cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstances
of the last Act of that eminent
Comick Poet, and our Friend, <hi>Wycherly.</hi>
He had often told me, as I doubt not he did
all his Acquaintance, that he would Marry
as soon as his life was despair'd of. Accord<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ingly
a few days before his Death he un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derwent
the Ceremony; and join'd together
those two Sacraments which wise Men say
should be the last we receive; For if you ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>serve,
Matrimony is plac'd after Extreme
<pb n="168" facs="165"/>
Unction in our Catechism, as a kind of Hint
of the Order of Time in which they are to
be taken. The old Man then lay down,
satisfy'd in the Conscience of having,
by this one Act paid his just Debts, obliged
a Woman who (he was told) had Merit, and
shewn an heroick resentment of the ill usage
of his next Heir. Some hundred pounds
which he had with the Lady, discharg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed
those Debts; a Jointure of four hundred
a year made her a Recompense; and the
Nephew he left to comfort himself as well
as he could, with the miserable Remains of
a mortgaged Estate. I saw our Friend
twice after this was done, less peevish in
his Sickness than he used to be in his Health;
neither much afraid of Dying, nor (which in
him had been more likely) much ashamed
of Marrying. The Evening before he ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pired,
he called his young Wife to the bed<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>side,
and earnestly entreated her not to deny
him one request, the last he should make.
Upon her Assurances of consenting to it, he
told her, <hi>My Dear, it is only this; that you
will never marry an old Man again.</hi> I can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not
help remarking, that Sickness which
often destroys both Wit and Wisdom, yet
seldom has power to remove that Talent
which we call <hi>Humour:</hi> Mr. <hi>Wycherley</hi>
shew'd his, even in this last Compliment;
tho' I think his request a little hard; for
<pb n="169" facs="166"/>
why should he bar her from doubling her
Jointure on the same easy Terms?</p>
               <p>So trivial as these Circumstances are, I
should not be displeas'd my self to know
such Trifles, when they concern or charac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terise
any eminent Person. The wisest and
wittiest of Men are seldom wiser or wittier
than others in these sober Moments. At least,
our Friend ended much in the Character he

               <p>I Am just return'd from the Country'
whither Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> accompanied me, and
pass'd a Week in the Forest. I need not tell
you how much a Man of his Turn entertain'd
me; but I must acquaint you there is a Vi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vacity
and Gaiety of Disposition almost pe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>culiar
to him, which make it impossible to
part from him without that uneasiness which
<pb n="170" facs="167"/>
generally succeeds all our pleasures. I have
been just taking a solitary walk by Moon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shine,
full of reflections on the transitory na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture
of all human delights; and giving my
Thoughts a loose in the contemplation of
those Satisfactions which probably we may
hereafter taste in the Company of separate
Spirits, when we shall range the Walks a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bove,
and perhaps gaze on this World at as
vast a distance as we now do on those
Worlds. The pleasures we are to enjoy in
that Conversation must undoubtedly be of
a nobler kind, and (not unlikely) may pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceed
from the Discoveries each shall commu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nicate
to another, of God and of Nature;
for the Happiness of Minds can surely be
nothing but Knowledge.</p>
               <p>The highest Gratification we receive here
from Company is <hi>Mirth,</hi> which at the best
is but a fluttering unquiet Motion, that
beats about the breast for a few Moments,
and after leaves it void and empty.</p>
               <p>Keeping good Company, even the best,
is but a less shameful Art of losing Time.</p>
               <p>What we here call <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Study,</hi> are
little better: The greater number of Arts
to which we apply ourselves are mere Grop<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
in the Dark; and even the search of our
most important Concerns in a future being,
is but a needless, anxious, and uncertain
haste to be knowing, sooner than we can,
<pb n="171" facs="168"/>
what without all this sollicitude we shall
know a little later. We are but <hi>Curious
Impertinents</hi> in the case of Futurity. 'Tis
not our business to be guessing what the State
of Souls shall be, but to be doing what may
make our own State happy; We cannot be
Knowing, but we can be Virtuous.</p>
               <p>If this be my Notion of a great part of
that high Science, Divinity; you will be so
civil as to imagine I lay no mighty Stress up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
the rest. Even of my darling Poetry I
really make no other use, than Horses of the
Bells that gingle about their Ears (tho' now
and then they toss their Heads as if they
were proud of 'em) only to Jogg on a little
more merrily.</p>
               <p>Your Observations on the narrow concep<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
of Mankind in the point of Friend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ship,
confirm me in what I was so fortu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nate
as at my first knowledge of you to
hope, and since so amply to experience. Let
me take so much decent Pride and Dignity
upon me, as to tell you, that but for Opini<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ons
like these, which I discover'd in your
Mind, I had never made the Trial I have
done; which has succeeded so much to mine,
and I believe not less to your Satisfaction:
For if I know you right, your Pleasure is
greater in obliging me, than I can feel on my
part, till it falls in my power to oblige you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="169"/>
Your Remark, that the Variety of opini<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
in Politicks or Religion is often rather
a Gratification, than Objection, to people
who have Sense enough to consider the beau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tiful
order of Nature in her Variations;
makes me think you have not construed
<hi>Joannes Secundus</hi> wrong, in the Verse which
precedes that which you quote: <hi>Bene nota
Fides,</hi> as I take it, does no way signify the
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholic Religion, tho' <hi>Secundus</hi>
was of it. I think it was a generous thought,
and one that flow'd from an exalted mind,
that it was not improbable but God might
be delighted with the various methods of
worshipping him, which divided the whole
World. I am pretty sure You and I should
no more make good <hi>Inquisitors</hi> to the mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dern
Tyrants in Faith, than we could have
been qualify'd for <hi>Lictors</hi> to <hi>Procrustes,</hi> when
he converted refractory Members with the
Rack. In a word, I can only repeat to you
what I think I have formerly said; that I as
little fear God will damn a Man who has
Charity, as I hope that any Priest cans save
him without it.</p>

               <p>I Find that a real concern is not only a
Hindrance to Speaking, but to Writing
too: The more time we give our selves to
think over one's own, or a Friends unhappi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness,
the more unable we grow to express the
grief that proceeds from it. It is as natural
to delay a Letter, at such a Season as this,
as to retard a melancholy Visit to a Person
one cannot relieve. One is ashamed in
that Circumstance, to pretend to entertain
people with trifling, insignificant affectations
of Sorrow on the one hand, or unseasonable
and forced Gayeties on the other. 'Tis a
kind of profanation of things sacred; to
treat so solemn a matter as a generous vo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>luntary
Suffering, with Compliments or
Heroic Gallantries. Such a Mind as
your's has no need of being Spirited up in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to
Honour, or like a weak Woman, Praised
into an opinion of its own Virtue. 'Tis
enough to do and suffer what we ought;
and Men should know, that the noble pow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>er
of Suffering bravely is as far above that
of Enterprizing greatly, as an unblemish'd
Conscience and inflexible Resolution are a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bove
<pb n="174" facs="171"/>
an accidential Flow of Spirits, or a sud<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>den
Tide of Blood. If the whole Religious
Business of Mankind be included in Resigna<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
to our Maker, and Charity to our Fel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low
Creatures; there are now some People
who give us the Opportunity of affording as
bright an Example in practising the one, as
themselves have given an infamous Instance
of the Violation of the other. Whoever is
really brave, has always this Comfort when
he is opprest, that he knows himself to be
superior to those who injure him: For the
greatest Power on Earth can no sooner do
him that Injury, but the brave Man can
make himself greater by forgiving it.</p>
               <p>If it were generous to seek for allevia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ting
Consolations in a Calamity of so much
Glory, one might say that to be ruin'd thus
in the Gross, with a whole People, is but
like perishing in the General Conflagra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
where nothing we can value is left
behind us.</p>
               <p>Methinks in our present Condition, the
most heroic thing we are left capable of
doing, is to endeavour to lighten each other's
Load, and (opprest as we are) to succour
such as are yet more opprest. If there are
too many who cannot be assisted but by
what we cannot give, our Money, there are
yet others who may be relieved by our Coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sel,
by our Countenance, and even by our
<pb n="175" facs="172"/>
Chearfulness. The Misfortunes of private
Families, the Misunderstandings of People
whom Distresses make suspicious, the Cold<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nesses
of Relations whom Change of Religi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on
may dis-unite, or the Necessities of half<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ruin'd
Estates render unkind to each other;
these at least may be soften'd in some de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>grees,
by a general well-manag'd Humanity
among ourselves, if all those who have your
Principles of Belief, had also your Sense and
Conduct. But indeed most of 'em have
given lamentable <note place="bottom" n="†">This was written in the Year of the Affair of <hi>Preston.</hi>
                  </note> proofs of the contrary;
and 'tis to be apprehended that they who
want Sense, are only religious thro' weakness,
and good-natur'd thro' Shame: These are
narrow-minded Creatures that never deal
in Essentials; their Faith never looks be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>yond
Ceremonials, nor their Charity be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>yond
Relations. As poor as I am, I would
gladly relieve any distressed, conscientious
<hi>French</hi> Refugee at this instant: What must
my Concern then be, when I perceive
so many Anxieties now tearing those Hearts
which I have desired a place in, and Clouds
of Melancholy rising on those Faces which
I have long look'd upon with Affection? I
begin already to feel both what some ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prehend,
and what others are yet too stu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pid
<pb n="176" facs="173"/>
to apprehend. I grieve with the Old,
for so many additional Incoveniencies, and
Chagrins, more than their small Remain of
Life seem'd destin'd to undergo; and with the
Young, for so many of those Gayeties and
Pleasures (the Portion of Youth) which they
will by this means be depriv'd of. This
brings into my mind one or other of those
I love best, and among them the Widow and
Fatherless, late of—As I am certain
no People living had an earlier and truer
Sense of others Misfortunes, or a more gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rous
resignation as to what might be their
own; so I earnestly wish, that whatever
part they must bear may be render'd as sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>portable
to them as it is in the power of
any Friend to make it.</p>
               <p>But I know you have prevented me in
this Thought, as you always will any
thing that's good, or generous: I find by a
Letter of your Lady's (which I have seen)
that their Ease and Tranquility is part
of your Care. I believe there's some Fata<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lity
in it, that you should always, from time
to time, be doing those particular things that
make me enamour'd of you,</p>
               <p>I write this from <hi>Windsor</hi> Forest, of which
I am come to take my last look. We here
bid our Neighbours adieu, much as those

them a few weeks after. I parted from
honest Mr. <hi>D<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters" rend="content:_+">

from old Sir <hi>William Trumball</hi> as from a
venerable Prophet, foretelling with lifted

is just going to be remov'd himself.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, now I have learnt so far as
<q>—Nos dulcia linquimus arva,</q>

               <p>Let that, and all else be as Heaven pleases!
I have provided just enough to keep me a
Man of Honour. I believe you and I shall
never be asham'd of each other. I know

               <p>IF a Regard both to Publick and Private
Affairs may plead a lawful Excuse in
behalf of a negligent Correspondent, I have
really a very good Title to it: I cannot say
<pb n="178" facs="175"/>
whether 'tis a Felicity or Unhappiness, that
I am obliged at this time to give up my
whole Application to <hi>Homer</hi>; when without
that Employment, my Thoughts must turn
upon what is less agreeable, the Violence, Mad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
and Resentment of modern War-makers,
which are likely to prove (to some People at
least) more fatal, than the same Qualities in
<hi>Achilles</hi> did to his unfortunate Country<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>men.</p>
               <p>Tho' the change of my Scene of Life,
from <hi>Windsor</hi> Forest to the Side of the
<hi>Thames,</hi> be one of the grand <hi>Aera's</hi> of my
days, and may be called a notable Period
in so inconsiderable a History? yet you can
scarce imagine any Hero passing from one
Stage of Life to another, with so much
Tranquility, so easy a Transition, and so
laudable a Behaviour. I am become so truly
a Citizen of the World (according to <hi>Pla<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to</hi>'s
Expression) that I look with equal In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>difference
on what I have lost, and on what
I have gained. The Times and Amusements
past are not more like a Dream to me, than
those which are present: I lie in a refresh<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
kind of Inaction, and have one Comfort
at least from Obscurity, that the <hi>Darkness</hi>
helps me to <hi>sleep</hi> the better. I now and
then reflect upon the Enjoyment of my
Friends, whom I fancy I remember much
as separate Spirits do us, at tender Intervals,
<pb n="179" facs="176"/>
neither interrupting their own Employ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments
nor altogether careless of ours, but
in general constantly wishing us well, and
hoping to have us one day in their Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pany.</p>
               <p>To grow indifferent to the World is to
grow Philosophical, or Religious; (which<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>soever
of those Turns we chance to take)
and indeed the World is such a thing as
one that thinks pretty much, must either
laugh at, or be angry with: but if we
laugh at it, they say we are proud; and if
we are angry with it, they say we are ill<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>natur'd.
So the most politic Way is to seem
always better pleas'd than one can be,
greater Admirers, greater Lovers, and in
short greater Fools, than we really are:
So shall we live comfortably with our Fami<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lies,
quietly with our Neighbours, favour'd
by our Masters, and happy with our Mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tresses.

               <p>I Think your leaving <hi>England</hi> was like
a good Man's leaving the World,
with the blessed Conscience of having acted
<pb n="180" facs="177"/>
well in it: And I hope you have received
your Reward, in being happy where you
are. I believe, in the Religious Country
you now inhabit, you'll be better pleas'd to
find I consider you in this light, than if I
compared you to those <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi>
whose Constancy in suffering Pain, and whose
Resolution in pursuit of a generous End, you
would rather imitate than boast of.</p>
               <p>But I had a melancholy hint the other
day, as if you were yet a Martyr to the fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tigue
your Virtue made you undergo on this
side the Water. I beg if your health be re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stor'd
to you, not to deny me the Joy of
knowing it: Your endeavours of Service and
good Advices to the poor Papists, put me in
mind of <hi>Noah</hi>'s preaching forty years to
those folks that were to be drowned at last.
At the worst I heartily wish your Ark may
find an <hi>Ararat,</hi> and the Wife and Family,
(the hopes of the good Patriarch) land safe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly
after the Deluge upon the Shore of <hi>Tot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I durst mix prophane with sacred
history, I would chear you with the old Tale
of <hi>Brutus</hi> the wandering Trojan, who found
on that very Coast the happy End of his
Peregrinations and Adventures.</p>
               <p>I have very lately read <hi>Jeffery</hi> of <hi>Mon<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mouth</hi>
(to whom your <hi>Cornwall</hi> is not a little
beholden) in the Translation of a Clergyman
<pb n="181" facs="178"/>
in my neighbourhood. The poor Man is
highly concerned to vindicate <hi>Jeffery</hi>'s vera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>city
as an Historian; and told me he was
perfectly astonished, we of the <hi>Roman</hi> com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>munion
could doubt of the Legends of his
Giants, while we believe those of our Saints?
I am forced to make a fair Composition with
him; and, by crediting some of the wonders
of <hi>Corinaeus</hi> and <hi>Gogmagog,</hi> have brought
him so far already, that he speaks respect<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fully
of St. <hi>Christopher</hi>'s carrying Christ, and
the Resuscitation of St. <hi>Nicholas Tolentine</hi>'s
Chickens. Thus we proceed apace in Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verting
each other from all manner of Infi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>delity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Hector</hi> are no more compared
to <hi>Corinaeus</hi> and <hi>Arthur,</hi> than the <hi>Guelphs</hi>
and <hi>Ghibellines</hi> were to the <hi>Mohocks</hi> of ever<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dreadful
memory. This amazing Writer
has made me lay aside <hi>Homer</hi> for a week,
and when I take him up again, I shall be
very well prepared to translate with belief,
and reverence the Speech of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Horse.</p>
               <p>You'll excuse all this trifling, or any
thing else which prevents a Sheet full of
Compliment: and believe there is nothing
more true (even more true than any thing
in <hi>Jeffery</hi> is false) than that I have a con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stant

               <p>THE Question you proposed to me is
what at present I am the most unfit

one of the best of Fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="180"/>
He had liv'd in such a Course of Tem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perance
as was enough to make the longest
Life agreeable to him, and in such a Course
of Piety as suffic'd to make the most sud<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>den
Death so also. Sudden indeed it was:
However, I heartily beg of God to give me
such an one, provided I can lead such a Life.
I leave him to the Mercy of God, and to
the Piety of a Religion that extends beyond
the Grave: <hi>Si qua est ea cura,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He has left me to the ticklish Management
of a narrow Fortune, where every false Step
is dangerous. My Mother is in that dispi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rited
State of Resignation, which is the ef<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect
of long Life, and the Loss of what is
dear to us. We are really each of us in
want of a Friend, of such an humane Turn
as yourself, to make almost any thing desira<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble
to us. I feel your Absence more than
ever, at the same time I can less express my
Regards to you than ever; and shall make
this, which is the most sincere Letter I ever
writ to you, the shortest and faintest per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>haps
of any you have receiv'd. 'Tis enough
if you reflect, that barely to remember any
Person, when one's Mind is taken up with a
sensible Sorrow, is a great degree of Friendship.
I can say no more but that I love you, and all
that are yours; and that I wish it may be very
long before any of yours shall feel for you
what I now feel for my Father. Adieu.</p>

               <p>YOUR kind Letter has overtaken me
here, for I have been in and about
this Country ever since your departure. I
am pleas'd to date this from a place so
well known to Mrs. <hi>Blount,</hi> where I write
as if I were dictated by her Ancestors,
whose faces are all upon me. I fear none
so much as Sir <hi>Christopher Guise,</hi> who be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
in his Shirt, seems as ready to combate
me, as her own Sir <hi>John</hi> was to demolish
Duke <hi>Lancastere.</hi> I date say your Lady
will recollect his Figure. I look'd upon
the Mansion, Walls, and Terraces; the
Plantations, and Slopes, which Nature has
made to command a variety of Vallies
and rising Woods; with a Veneration mixt
with a Pleasure, that represented her to
me in those puerile Amusements, which
engaged her so many Years ago in this
place: I fancy'd I saw her sober over a
Sampler, or gay over a joynted Baby. I
dare say she did one thing more, even in
<pb n="185" facs="182"/>
those early times; <hi>remember'd her Creator
in the Days of her Youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You describe so well your Hermitical
state of life, that none of the ancient An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chorites
could go beyond you, for a Cave
in a Rock, with a fine Spring, or any of
the Accommodations that befit a Solitary.
Only I don't remember to have read, that
any of those venerable and holy Persona<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ges
took with them a Lady, and begat
Sons and Daughters. You must modestly be
content to be accounted a Patriarch. But were
you a little younger, I should rather rank
you with Sir <hi>Amadis,</hi> and his fellows. If
Piety be so Romantick, I shall turn Her<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mit
in good earnest; for I see one may
go so far as to be Poetical, and hope to
save one's Soul at the same time. I really
wish myself something more, that is, a
Prophet; for I wish I were as <hi>Habakkuk,</hi>
to be taken by the Hair of the Head, and
visit <hi>Daniel</hi> in his Den. You are very ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liging
in saying, I have now a whole Fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mily
upon my hands, to whom to dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>charge
the part of a Friend: I assure you
I like 'em all so well, that I will never
quit my Hereditary Right to them; you
have made me yours, and consequently them
mine. I still see them walking on my Green
at <hi>Twickenham,</hi> andgratefully remember (not
<pb n="186" facs="183"/>
only their green Gowns) but the Instructions
they gave me how to slide down, and trip
up the steepest Slopes of my Mount.</p>
               <p>Pray think of me sometimes, as I shall

               <p>YOUR very kind and obliging man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner
of enquiring after me, among the

should have been sooner answer'd and ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>knowledg'd.
I sincerely rejoice at your re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>covery
from an Illness which gave me less
pain than it did you, only from my Igno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rance
of it. I should have else been seri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ously
and deeply affected, in the thought of
your danger by a Fever. I think it a fine
and a natural thought, which I lately read
in a private Letter of <hi>Montaigne,</hi> giving an
account of the last Words of an intimate
Friend of his: <q rend="inline">'Adieu my Friend! the pain
I feel will soon be over, but I grieve for

for life.'</q>
               </p>
               <p>I joyn with your Family in giving God
thanks for lending us a worthy Man some
what longer. The Comforts you receive
from their Attendance put me in mind of
what old <hi>Fletcher</hi> of <hi>Saltoune</hi> said one day
to me. <q rend="inline">'Alas, I have nothing to do but to
dye; I am a poor Individual; no Crea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture

death: 'Tis the only reason I have to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pent

               </p>
               <p>I hope the Gout will soon go after the
Fever, and all evil things remove far from
you. But pray tell me, when will you move
towards us? If you had an Interval to get
hither, I care not what fixes you afterwards,
except the Gout. Pray come, and never stir
from us again. Do away your dirty Acres,
cast 'em to dirty People, such as in the

               <p>YOU may truly do me the Justice to
think no Man is more your sincere
well-wisher than myself, or more the sin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cere
<pb n="189" facs="186"/>
well-wisher of your whole Family;
with all which, I cannot deny but I have a
mixture of Envy to you all, for loving
one another so well; and for enjoying the
sweets of that life, which can only be tasted
by people of good will.</p>

                  <l>They from all Shades the Darkness can exclude,</l>
                  <l>And from a Desart banish Solitude.</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>Torbay</hi> is a Paradise, and a Storm is but
an amusement to such people. If you
drink Tea upon a Promontory that over<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>hangs
the Sea, it is preferable to an Assem<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bly;
and the whistling of the Wind better
Musick to contented and loving Minds, than
the Opera to the Spleenful, Ambitious, Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>eas'd,
Distasted, and Distracted Souls, which
this World affords; nay, this World affords
no other. Happy they! who are banish'd
from us: but happier they, who can banish
themselves; or more properly, banish the
World from them!<q>Alas! I live at <hi>Twickenham!</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I take that Period to be very Sublime, and to
include more than a hundred Sentences that
might be writ to express Distraction, Hurry,
Multiplication of Nothings, and all the fati<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guing
perpetual Business of having no Busi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness to
do. You'll wonder I reckon translating
the <hi>Odyssey</hi> as nothing? But whenever I think
<pb n="190" facs="187"/>
seriously (and of late I have met with so many
Occasions of thinking seriously, that I begin
never to think otherwise) I cannot but think
these things very idle; as idle, as if a Beast
of Burden shou'd go on jingling his Bells,
without bearing any thing valuable about
him, or ever serving his Master.<q>

               </p>
               <p>Said a heathen Poet; as he is translated
by a Christian Bishop, who has, first by
his Exhortations, and since by his Example,
taught me to <hi>think</hi> as becomes a Reasonable
Creature.—But he is gone! He carry'd a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>way
more Learning than is left in this Nation
behind him: but he left us more in the noble
Example of bearing Calamity well. 'Tis
true, we want Literature very much; but
pray God we don't want Patience more! if
these Precedents are to prevail.</p>
               <p>I remember I promis'd to write to you,
as soon as I should hear you were got home.
You must look on this as the first Day I've

               <p>YOU shew your self a just Man and a
Friend in those Guesses and Supposi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
you make at the possible reasons of my
Silence; every one of which is a true one.
As to forgetfulness of you or yours, I assure
you, the promiscuous Conversations of the
Town serve only to put me in mind of bet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter,
and more quiet, to be had in a Corner
of the World (undisturb'd, innocent, serene,
and sensible) with such as you. Let no Ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cess
of any Distrust make you think of me
differently in a cloudy day from what you
do in the most sun-shiny Weather. Let the
young Ladies be assured I make nothing new
in my Gardens without wishing to see the
print of their Fairy Steps in every part of
'em. I have put the last Hand to my works
of this kind, in happily finishing the subter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>raneous
Way and Grotto; I there found a
Spring of the clearest Water, which falls
in a perpetual Rill, that ecchoes thro' the
Cavern day and night. From the Ri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver
<hi>Thames,</hi> you see thro' my Arch up a
Walk of the Wilderness to a kind of open
<pb n="192" facs="189"/>
Temple, wholly compos'd of Shells in the
Rustic Manner; and from that distance un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der
the Temple you look down thro' a slop<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
Arcade of Trees, and see the Sails on the
River passing suddenly and vanishing, as
thro' a Perspective Glass. When you shut
the Doors of this Grotto, it becomes on the
instant, from a luminous Room, a <hi>Camera
obscura</hi>; on the Walls of which all the Ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jects
of the River, Hills, Woods, and Boats,
are forming a moving Picture in their visible
Radiations: And when you have a mind to
light it up, it affords you a very different Scene:
It is finished with shells interspersed with
Pieces of Looking-glass in angular forms;
and in the Cieling is a Star of the same Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terial,
at which when a Lamp (of an orbi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cular
Figure of thin Alabaster) is hung in the
Middle, a thousand pointed Rays glitter and
are reflected over the Place. There are con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nected
to this Grotto by a narrower Passage
two Porches, with Niches and Seats; one
toward the River, of smooth Stones, full of
light and open; the other toward the Arch
of Trees, rough with Shells, Flints and Iron
Ore. The Bottom is paved with simple
Pebble, as the adjoining Walk up the Wil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derness
to the Temple, is to be Cockle-shells,
in the natural Taste, agreeing not ill with
the little dripping Murmur, and the Aquatic
Idea of the whole Place. It wants nothing
<pb n="193" facs="190"/>
to compleat it but a good Statue with an
Inscription, like that beautiful antique one
which you know I am so fond of,<q>

               <p>I Should be asham'd to own the receipt of
a very kind Letter from you, two whole
Months from the date of this; if I were not
<pb n="194" facs="191"/>
more asham'd to tell a Lye, or to make an
Excuse, which is worse than a Lye (for be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
built upon some probable Circumstances,
it makes use of a degree of Truth to falsify
with: It is a Lye <hi>Guarded.</hi>) Your Letter
has been in my Pocket in constant wearing,
till that, and the Pocket, and the Suit, are
worn out; by which means, I have read it
forty times, and I find by so doing, that I
have not enough consider'd, and reflected
upon many others you have obliged me
with; for true Friendship, as they say of good
Writing, will bear reviewing a thousand
times, and still discover new beauties.</p>
               <p>I have had a Fever, a short one, but a
violent: I am now well. So it shall take up
no more of this Paper.</p>
               <p>I begin now to expect you in Town,
to make the Winter to come more tolera<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble
to us both. The Summer is a kind of
Heaven, when we wander in a Paradisaical
Scene of Nature among Groves and Gardens:
but at this Season, we are like our poor first
Parents turn'd out of that agreeable tho' soli<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tary
life, and forc'd to look about for more
people to help to bear our labours, to get in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to
warmer Houses, and hive together in Ci<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ties.</p>
               <p>I hope you are long since perfectly restor'd,
and risen from your Gout, happy in the
delights of a contented Family, smiling at
<pb n="195" facs="192"/>
Storms, laughing at Greatness, and merry
over a Christmas-fire, exercising all the
Functions of an old Patriarch in Charity and
Hospitality. I will not tell Mrs. <hi>B.</hi> what I
think she is doing; for I conclude it is her
opinion, that he only ought to know it for
whom it is done: and she will allow herself
to be far enough advanc'd above a fine Lady,
not to desire to shine before Men.</p>
               <p>Your Daughters perhaps may have some
other thoughts, which even their Mother
must excuse them for, because she is a Mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther.
I will not however suppose those
thoughts get the better of their Devotions,
but rather excite 'em, and assist the warmth
of them; while their Prayer may be, that
they may raise up and breed as irreproach<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able
a young Family as their Parents have
done. In a Word, I fancy you all well,
easy, and happy, just as I wish you; and
next to that I wish you all with me.</p>
               <p>Next to God, is a good Man: Next in
dignity, and next in value. <hi>Minuisti eum
paullo minus ab Angelis.</hi> If therefore I wish
well to the good and the deserving, and de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sire
They only should be my companions
and Correspondents; I must very soon, and
very much think of you. I want your
Company, and your Example. Pray make
haste to Town, so as not again to leave us:
Discharge the Load of Earth that lies on you,
<pb n="196" facs="193"/>
like one of the Mountains under which the
Poets say the Giants (that is, the <hi>Men of the
Earth</hi>) are whelmed: Leave Earth to the
Sons of Earth; your Conversation is in Hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven.
Which that it may be accomplish'd in
us all, is the Prayer of him who maketh this
short Sermon, Value (to you) Three Pence.
Adieu.</p>

               <p>YOU writ me a very kind Letter some
months ago, and told me you were
then upon the point of taking a journey
into <hi>Devonshire.</hi> That hindered my an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swering
you, and I have since several times
inquir'd of you, without any Satisfaction;
for so I call the knowledge of your wel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fare,
or of any thing that concerns you. I
past two months in <hi>Sussex,</hi> and since my
Return have been again very ill. I writ
to <hi>Lintot</hi> in hopes of hearing of you, but
had no answer to that Point. Our Friend
<pb n="200" facs="196"/>
Mr. <hi>Cromwell</hi> too has been silent all this
year; I believe he has been displeas'd at
some or other of my Freedoms; which I
very innocently take, and most with those
I think most my friends. But this I know
nothing of, perhaps he may have open'd to
you: And, if I know you right, you are
of a Temper to cement Friendships, and
not to divide them. I really much love Mr.
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> and have a true affection for your
self, which if I had any Interest in the
world, or Power with those who have, I
should not be long without manifesting to
you. I desire you will not, either out of
Modesty, or a vicious Distrust of another's
value for you, (those two Eternal Foes to
Merit) imagine that your Letters and Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>versation
are not always welcome to me.
There's no Man more intirely fond of good-nature

in all my time beside. But nothing

as the News you tell me of your

when you congratulate me upon your
own good Success, for I have more People
to be happy out of, than any ill-natur'd
man can boast. I may with honesty af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>firm
to you, that notwithstanding the ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny
Inconveniencies and Disadvantages they
commonly talk of in the <hi>Res angusti domi,</hi>
I have never found any other, than the
inability of giving people of Merit the only
certain proof of our value for them, in
doing 'em some real service. For after
all, if we could but Think a little, Self<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>love
might make us Philosophers, and con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vince
us, <hi>Quantuli indiget Natura!</hi> Our<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves
are easily provided for; 'tis nothing

I hope as much of your Time as your At<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tendance

to spare to any friend, will not be thought
lost upon one who is as much so as any
man. I must also put you in mind, tho'
you are now Secretary to this Lady, that
you are likewise Secretary to Nine other

I can hardly repent my neglect, when it

that were till now imperceptible to

of a Nose or Ear, the smallest degree of
Light or Shade on a Cheek, or in a dim<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple,

look upon Lord <hi>Plausible</hi> as ridiculous,
for admiring a Lady's fine Tip of an Ear
and pretty Elbow (as the <hi>Plain-dealer</hi> has

Ugly and Disagreeable, since they may have
their retired beauties, in one Trait or other

a state I am, when every day the per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>formances

and excellent, and my own more despica<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble.
I have thrown away three Dr. <hi>Swift</hi>'s,
each of which was once my Vanity, two
Lady <hi>Bridgewaters,</hi> a Dutchess of <hi>Montague,</hi>
besides half a dozen Earls, and one Knight

as old as her mother <hi>St. Anne.</hi> Nay, what
is yet more miraculous, I have rival'd
St. <hi>Luke</hi> himself in Painting, and as 'tis said

an Angel came and finish'd his Piece, so
you would swear a Devil put the last hand

However I comfort my self with
a christian Reflection, that, I have not
broken the Commandment, for my Pi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ctures
are not the likeness of any thing

the waters under the earth. Neither will
any body adore or worship them, except
the <hi>Indians</hi> should have a fight of 'em,

and glaze it at your leisure, and polish the

cause it to be born in the Lands of both

               <p>SINCE by your letter we find you can
be content to breath in smoak, to walk
in crouds, and divert your self with noise,
nay and to make fine Pictures of this way
of life, we shou'd give you up as one aban<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doned
to a wrong choice of pleasures. We
have however so much compassion on you
as to think of inviting you to us, where
your taste for books, friendship, and ease,
may be indulg'd. But if you do not come,
pray leave to tempt us with your descrip<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
of the Court; for indeed humanity is
frail, and we cannot but remember some
particular honours which we have enjoy'd
in conversation; bate us this one point and
we stand you, still untir'd with one an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>other,
and fresh to the pleasures of the coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try.
If you wou'd have any news from us,
know that we are well at present: This I
am sure wou'd have been allow'd by you
as news from either of us a fortnight ago.
In return to this, send us every thing you
imagine diverting, and pray forget not my
commissions. Give my respects to the Dean,

               <p>I HAVE been perpetually troubled with
sickness of late, which has made me
so melancholy that the Immortality of the

chance to be but short. Dr. <hi>Swift</hi> much
approves what I proposed even to the very
title, which I design shall be, <hi>The Works
of the Unlearned,</hi> published monthly, in which
whatever Book appears that deserves praise,
shall be depreciated Ironically, and in the

undervalue Works of Value, and to commend
the high Productions of <hi>Grubstreet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall go into the country about a

proceed from nothing but your Gratitude
<pb n="210" facs="206"/>
to a few people who endeavovr'd to serve
you, and whose Politicks were never your

hope, and as I think your Principles and
mine (as Brother Poets) had ever a Byass to
the Side of Liberty, I know you will be an
honest man and an inoffensive one. Upon

being so much of either Party as to be good

               <p>One or two of your old Friends com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plain'd
they had heard nothing from you
since the <hi>Queen</hi>'s death; I told 'em, no
man living loved Mr. <hi>Gay</hi> better than I,
yet I had not once written to him in all
his Voyage. This I thought a convincing
proof, how truly one may be a friend to
another without telling him so every month.
But they had reasons too themselves to al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge
in your excuse, as men who really
value one another will never want such
as make their friends and themselves easy.
The late universal Concern in publick af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fairs,
threw us all into a hurry of Spirits;
even I who am more a Philosopher than
to expect any thing from any Reign, was
born away with the current, and full of
the expectation of the Successor: During
your Journeys I knew not whither to aim
<pb n="211" facs="207"/>
a letter after you, that was a sort of shoot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
flying: add to this the demand <hi>Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mer</hi>
had upon me, to write fifty Verses
a day, besides learned Notes, all which
are at a conclusion for this year. Rejoice
with me, O my Friend, that my La<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bour

me in much Feasting, for I to thee and thou
to me. We will feed among the Lillies. By
the Lillies I mean the Ladies, with whom
I hope you have fed to satiety: Hast thou

tasted the delights thereof? Hast thou not

               <p>I AM extremely glad to find by a Let<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter
of yours to Mr. <hi>Fortescue,</hi> that you
have receiv'd one from me; and I beg
you to keep, as the greatest of Curiosities,
that Letter of mine which you receiv'd and
I never writ.</p>
               <p>But the Truth is, that we were made
here to expect you in a short time, that
I was upon the Ramble most part of the
Summer, and have concluded the Season
in Grief, for the death of my poor fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="209"/>
I shall not enter into a detail of my
Concerns and Troubles, for two reasons;
because I am really afflicted and need no
Airs of grief, and because they are not the
concerns and troubles of any but my self.
But I think you (without too great a com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pliment)
enough my friend, to be pleas'd to
know he died easily, without a groan,. or
the sickness of two minutes; in a word, as
silently and peacefully as he lived.<q>Sic mihi contingat vivere, sicque mori!</q>
               </p>
               <p>I am not in the humour to say gay things,
nor in the affectation of avoiding them. I
can't pretend to entertain either Mr. <hi>Pulte<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ney</hi>
or you, as you have done both my Lord
<hi>Burlington</hi> and me, by your Letter to Mr.
<hi>Lowndes.</hi> I am only sorry you have no
greater quarrel to Mr. <hi>Lowndes,</hi> and wish
you paid some hundreds a year to the Land<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tax.
That Gentleman is lately become an
inoffensive person to me too; so that we
may join heartily in our addresses to him,
and (like true Patriots) rejoice in all that
Good done to the Nation and Govern<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,
to which we contribute nothing our
selves.</p>
               <p>I should not forget to acknowledge your
letter sent from <hi>Aix</hi>; you told me then
that writing was not good with the Waters,
<pb n="214" facs="210"/>
and I find since you are of my opinion, that
'tis as bad without the Waters. But I
fancy, it is not writing but thinking, that
is so bad with the Waters; and then you
might write without any manner of pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>judice,
if you writ like our Brother-poets
of these days.</p>
               <p>I have no story to tell that is worth
your hearing; you know I am no man of
Intrigue; but the Dutchess of <hi>Hamilton</hi>
has one which she says is worth my hearing,
that relates to Mr. <hi>Pulteney</hi> and your self;
and which she promises, if you won't tell
me, she will. Her Grace has won in a

of which, my Tweezercase, and all other

I can't tell who else, had your letters: Dr.
<hi>Arbuthnot</hi> and I expect to be treated like
Friends. I would send my services to Mr.
<hi>Pulteney,</hi> but that he is out of favour at
Court; and make some compliment to Mrs.
<hi>Pulteney,</hi> if she were not a Whig. My Lord

it will be detrimental to our holy Religion,

I have never been in a worse state in

me, that I must forget both together, or
neither. I'm sorry, I could not have a

it pleases me to see him, and hear of you.
Pray put Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> in mind that he has

namely Mrs. <hi>Howard.</hi> As for
Mrs. <hi>Blounts</hi> (whom you mercifully make

tell her she has forgot the first Commis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion
I ever troubled her with, and therefore
it shall be the last (the very thing I fear
she desires.) Dr. <hi>Arbuthnot</hi> is a strange
creature; he goes out of town, and leaves
his Bastards at other folks doors. I have
long been so far mistaken in him as to think

Pray let him know I made a very unfa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>shionable

               <p>I WAS very much pleas'd, not to say
oblig'd, by your kind letter, which
sufficiently warm'd my heart to have an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swer'd

(a way one is often deceiv'd) by hearkening
to women; who told me that both Lady
<hi>Burlington</hi> and yourself were immediately
to return from <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> and that my Lord
was gone to bring you back. The world
furnishes us with too many examples of
what you complain of in yours, and I as<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure
you, none of 'em touch and grieve me
so much as what relates to you. I think
your Sentiments upon it are the very same
I should entertain: I wish those we call
Great Men had the same Notions, but they
are really the most little Creatures in the
world; and the most interested, in all but
one Point; which is, that they want judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment
<pb n="220" facs="216"/>
to know their greatest Interest, to
encourage and chuse Honest men for their
Friends.</p>
               <p>I have not once seen the Person you
complain of, whom I have of late thought
to be, as the Apostle admonisheth, <hi>one Flesh
with his Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pray make my sincere compliments to
Lord <hi>Burlington,</hi> whom I have long known
to have more Mind to be a Good and ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nourable
Man, than almost any one of his
rank.</p>
               <p>I have not forgot yours to Lord <hi>Boling<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>broke,</hi>
(tho' I hope to have speedily a ful<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ler
opportunity) he returns for <hi>Flanders</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> next month.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Howard</hi> has writ you something or
other in a letter which she says she repents.
She has as much Good nature as if she had
never seen any Ill nature, and had been bred
among Lambs and Turtle-doves, instead of
Princes and Court-Ladies.</p>
               <p>By the end of this week, <hi>Fortescue</hi> will
pass a few days with me. We shall re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>member
you in our Potations, and wish you

almost of my Mother's death;
there was no circumstance that render'd it
more insupportable to me, than that I could
not leave her to see you. Your own pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sent
Escape from so imminent danger, I
pray God may prove less precarious than
my poor Mother's can be; whose Life at
her age can at best be but a short Reprieve,
or a longer Dying. But I fear, even that
is more than God will please to grant me;
for, these two days past, her most dangerous
Symptoms are returned upon her; and
unless there be a sudden change, I must in
a few Days, if not in a few Hours, be de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prived
of her. In the afflicting Prospect be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore
me, I know nothing that can so much
alleviate it as the View now given me
(Heaven grant it may encrease) of your
recovery. In the sincerity of my heart, I
am excessively concerned, not to be able to
pay you, dear <hi>Gay,</hi> any part of the debt I
very gratefully remember I owe you, on a
like sad occasion, where you was here com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>forting
me in her last great Illness. May your

health augment as fast as I fear it pleases
God hers must decline: I believe that would
be very fast—may the Life that is added
to you be past in good fortune and tran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quility
rather of your own giving to your
self, than from any Expectations or Trust
in others.—May you and I live together,
without wishing more felicity or acquisi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
than Friendship can give and receive
without obligations to Greatness—God
keep you, and three or four more of those
I have known as long, that I may have
something worth the surviving my Mother.

a week past I had hopes of being able in a
day or two more to see you. But my
poor Mother advances not at all, gains no
strength, and seems but upon the whole to
wait for the next cold day to throw her into
a Diarrhoea that must, if it return, carry her
off. This being greatly to be fear'd, makes
me not dare to go a day from her, lest
that should prove to be her last. God send
you a speedy recovery, and such a total one
as at your time of Life may be expected.
You need not call the few words I writ to
you either kind, or good; That was, and

               <p>I AM glad to hear of the progress of
your recovery, and the oftner I hear it
the better, when it becomes easy to you to

former Illness, that it doubles my Concern
at this time not to be able to be with you,
or you able to be with me. Had I lost her,
I wou'd have been no where else but with
you during your confinement. I have now
past five weeks without once going from
home, and without any company but for
three or four of the days. Friends rarely
stretch their kindness so far as ten miles.
My Lord <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi> have
not forgotten to visit me: the rest (except
Mrs. <hi>Blount</hi> once) were contented to send

you complain of this to any other, 'tis you

If you think this letter splenatick, consider
I have just receiv'd the news of the death

to serve instead of Exercise abroad. Mrs.

               <p>IF my friendship were as effectual as it is
sincere, you would be one of those
people who would be vastly advantag'd and
enrich'd by it. I ever honour'd those Popes

a sign that the old fellows <hi>loved somebody,</hi>
which is not usual in such advanced years.
And I now honour Sir <hi>Robert Walpole,</hi> for
his extensive Bounty and Goodness to his

me to the heart when I reflect, that my
friendship is so much less effectual than
theirs; nay so utterly useless that it can<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>not
give you any thing, not even a Dinner,
at this distance, nor help the General whom
I greatly love, to catch one fish. My on<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly

myself, and to begin to envy you, which
is next to hating (and excellent remedy for
Love.) How comes it that Providence has
been so unkind to me, (who am a greater

Balm and Burnet up to the chin,
with the Dutchess of <hi>Queensberry?</hi> that I

while you are happily banish'd with the
Dutchess of <hi>Queensberry?</hi> So partial is For<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tune

times more to be banish'd than you, and I
know some Ladies who merit it better than
even her Grace. After this I must not
name any, who dare do so much for you as
to send you their Services: But one there
is, who exhorts me often to write to you,
I suppose to prevent or excuse her not do<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
it herself; she seems (for that is all I'll

               <p>I MAY with great Truth return your
Speech, that I think of you daily;
oftner indeed than is consistent with
the character of a reasonable man; who is
rather to make himself easy with the
things and men that are about him, than
<pb n="233" facs="229"/>
uneasy with those which are not. And
you, whose Absence is in a manner perpe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tual
to me, ought rather to be remembred
as a good man gone, than breathed after as
one living. You are taken from us here,
to be laid up in a more blessed state with
Spirits of a higher kind: Such I reckon
his Grace and her Grace, since their Ba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nishment
from an earthly Court to an hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venly
one, in each other and their friends;
for I conclude none but true friends will
consort or associate with them afterwards.
I can't but look upon my self (so unwor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thy
as a man of <hi>Twitnam</hi> seems, to be
rank'd with such rectify'd and sublimated
Beings as you) as a separated Spirit too
from Courts and courtly Fopperies. But I
own, not altogether so divested of terrene
Matter, nor altogether so spiritualized, as
to be worthy of admission to your Depths
of Retirement and Contentment. I am
tugg'd back to the world and its regards
too often; and no wonder, when my re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>treat
is but ten miles from the Capital. I
am within Ear-shot of Reports within the
Vortex of Lyes and Censures. I hear
sometimes of the Lampooners of Beau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ty,
the Calumniators of Virtue, the Jokers
at Reason and Religion. I presume these
are creatures and things as unknown to you,
as we of this dirty Orb are to the inhabi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tants
<pb n="234" facs="230"/>
of the Planet <hi>Jupiter:</hi> Except a few
fervant Prayers reach you on the wings of
the Post, from two or three of your zea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lous
Votaries at this distance; as one Mrs.
<hi>Howard,</hi> who lifts up her Heart now and
then to you, from the midst of the <hi>Collu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vies</hi>
and Sink of human Greatness at <hi>W<gap resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters" rend="content:_+">

she grew quite a Goddess; and a few
others.</p>
               <p>To descend now to tell you what are
our Wants, our Complaints, and our Mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>series
here; I must seriously say, the Loss
of any one good Woman is too great to
be born easily; and poor Mrs. <hi>Rollinson,</hi> tho'
a private woman, was such. Her Husband
is gone into <hi>Oxfordshire</hi> very melancholy,
and thence to the <hi>Bath,</hi> to <hi>live on,</hi> for such
is our Fate, and Duty. Adieu. Write to
me as often as you will, and (to encourage
you) I will write as seldom as if you did not,

               <p>I AM something like the Sun at this Sea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>son,
withdrawing from the World, but
meaning it mighty well, and resolving to
shine whenever I can again. But I fear
the Clouds of a long Winter will over<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>come
me to such a degree, that any body
will take a farthing candle for a better
Guide, and more serviceable Companion.
My Friends may remember my brighter
days, but will think (like the <hi>Irishman</hi>) that
the <hi>Moon</hi> is a better thing when once I am
gone. I don't say this with an allusion to
my Poetical Capacity as a Son of <hi>Apollo</hi>;
but in my Companionable one, (if you'll
suffer me to use a phrase of the Earl of
<hi>Clarendon</hi>'s:) For I shall see or be seen of
few of you, this Winter. I am grown too
faint to do any good, or to give any plea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure.
I not only, as <hi>Dryden</hi> fairly says,
<hi>Feel my notes decay</hi> as a Poet, but feel my
Spirits flag as a Companion, and shall re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn
again to where I first began, my
Books. I have been putting my Library
in order, and enlarging the Chimney in it,
with equal intention to warm my Mind
and Body (if I can) to some Life. A Friend,
<pb n="236" facs="232"/>
(a Woman-friend, God help me!) with
whom I have spent three or four hours a day
these fifteen Years, advised me to pass more
time in my studies: I reflected, she must
have found some Reason for this admoni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,
and concluded she wou'd compleat all
her kindnesses to me by returning me to
the Employment I am fittest for; Conver<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sation
with the dead, the old, and the
worm-eaten.</p>
               <p>Judge therefore if I might not treat
you as a Beatify'd Spirit, comparing your
life with my stupid state. For as to my
living at <hi>Windsor</hi> with Ladies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is all
a dream; I was there but two nights, and
all the day out of that company. I shall
certainly make as little Court to others, as
they do to me; and that will be none at
all. My Fair-Weather Friends of the Sum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mer
are going away for <hi>London,</hi> and I shall
see Them and the Butterflies together, if
I live till next Year; which I would not
desire to do, if it were only for their sakes.
But we that are Writers, ought to love Po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sterity,
that Posterity may love us; and I
would willingly live to see the Children of
the present Race, meerly in hope they may
be a little wiser than their Parents.</p>

               <p>I AM astonished at the Complaints occa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion'd
by a late <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Earl</hi> of
<hi>Burlington</hi>; and I should be afflicted were
there the least just Ground for 'em. Had
the Writer attack'd <hi>Vice,</hi> at a Time when
it is not only tolerated but triumphant,
and so far from being conceal'd as a <hi>De<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect,</hi>
that it is proclaimed with Ostenta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
as a <hi>Merit</hi>; I should have been ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>prehensive
of the Consequence: Had he
satirized Gamesters of a hundred thou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sand
pounds Fortune, acquired by such Me<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thods
as are in daily practice, and almost
universally encouraged: Had he overwarm<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly
defended the <hi>Religion of his Country,</hi> a<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gainst
such Books as come from every Press,
are publickly vended in every Shop, and
greedily bought by almost every Rank of
Men; or had he called our excellent <hi>Weekly
Writings</hi> by the same Names which they
openly bestow on the greatest Men <hi>in</hi> the Mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nistry,
and <hi>out</hi> of the Ministry, for which
they are all unpunished, and most rewarded:
<pb n="238" facs="234"/>
In any of these Cases, indeed, I might have
judged him too presumptious, and perhaps
have trembled for his Rashness.</p>
               <p>I could not but hope better for this small
and modest Epistle, which attacks <hi>no one
Vice</hi> whatsoever; which deals only in <hi>Folly</hi>
and not Folly in general, but a single Spe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cies
of it; that only Branch, for the oppo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>site
Excellency to which, the noble Lord to
whom it is written must necessarily be cele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brated.
I fancied it might escape Censure,
especially seeing how tenderly these Follies
are treated, and really less accused, than
Apologized for.<q>
                     <l>Yet hence the Poor are cloath'd, the Hungry fed,</l>
                     <l>Health to himself, and to his Infants Bread</l>
                     <l>The Lab'rer bears.</l>
                  </q> Is this such a <hi>Crime,</hi> that to impute it to a
Man must be a grievous Offence? 'Tis an
<hi>Innocent Folly,</hi> and much more <hi>Beneficent</hi>
than the want of it; for <hi>Ill Taste</hi> employs
more hands, and diffuses Expence more
than a <hi>Good</hi> one. Is it a <hi>Moral</hi> Defect? No,
it is but a <hi>Natural</hi> one; a <hi>Want of Taste.</hi>
It is what the best good Man living may be
liable to: The worthiest Peer may live ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>emplary
in an ill-favour'd House, and the
best reputed Citizen be pleased with a vile
Garden. I thought (I say) the Author had
<pb n="239" facs="235"/>
the common Liberty to observe a Defect,
and to compliment a Friend for a Quality
that distinguishes him: which I know not
how any Quality should do, if we were not
to remark that it was wanting in others.</p>
               <p>But they say the Satire is <hi>Personal.</hi> I
thought it could not be so, because all its
Reflections are on <hi>Things.</hi> His Reflections
are not on the <hi>Man,</hi> but his House, Garden,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, he reflects (as one may say) the
<hi>Persons</hi> of the Gladiator, Amphitheatre, the
Nile, and the Triton: He is only sorry to
see them (as he might be to see any of his
<hi>Friends</hi>) ridiculous, by being in the wrong
Place, and in bad Company. Some fancy,
that to say a thing is <hi>Personal,</hi> is the same as
to say it is <hi>Injust,</hi> not considering that no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing
can be <hi>Just</hi> that is not <hi>Personal.</hi> I
am afraid that <q rend="inline">"all such Writings and Dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>courses
as <hi>touch no Man,</hi> will <hi>mend no
Man.</hi>"</q> The Good Natured, indeed, are
apt to be alarmed at any thing like Satire; and
the <hi>Guilty</hi> readily concur with the <hi>Weak</hi> for
a plain Reason, because the Vicious look
upon Folly as their <hi>Frontier:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Jam stroximus ardet</l>
                     <l>Ucalegon—</l>
                  </q>
No wonder those who know Ridicule be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>longs
to them, find an inward Consolation
<pb n="240" facs="236"/>
in removing it from themselves as far as they
can; and it is never so far, as when they
can get it fixed on the <hi>best Characters.</hi> No
wonder those who are Food for Satirists
should rail at them as Creatures of Prey;
every Beast born for our Use would be ready
to call a Man so.</p>
               <p>I know no Remedy, unless people in our
Age would as little frequent the Theatres,
as they begin to do the Churches; unless
Comedy were forsaken, Satire silent, and
every man left to do what seems good in his
own Eyes, as if there were no King, no
Priest, no Poet in <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I find myself obliged to touch a
Point, on which I must be more serious; it
well deserves I should: I mean the malicious
Application of the Character of <hi>Timon,</hi> which
I will boldly say, they would impute to the
Person the most different in the World from
a <hi>Man-hater,</hi> and the Person whose <hi>Taste</hi>
and <hi>Encouragement</hi> of <hi>Wit</hi> have often been
shewn in the <hi>rightest Place.</hi> The Author
of that Epistle must certainly think so, if
he has the same Opinion of his own Merit
as Authors generally have; for he has been
favoured by this very Person.</p>
               <p>Why, in God's Name, must a <hi>Portrait,</hi>
apparently collected from twenty different
Men, be apply'd to one only? Has it his
<hi>Eye?</hi> No, it is very unlike. Has it his <hi>Nose</hi>
                  <pb n="241" facs="237"/>
or <hi>Mouth?</hi> No, they are totally differing.
What then, I beseech you? Why, it has the
<hi>Mole on his Chin.</hi> Very well; but must the
Picture thereof be his, and has no other
man that blemish?</p>
               <p>Could there be a more melancholy In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stance
how much the Taste of the Publick is
vitiated, and turns the most salutary and sea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sonable
Physick into Poison, than if amidst
the Blaze of thousand bright Qualities in a
Great Man, they should only remark there is
a <hi>Shadow</hi> about him, as what Eminence is
without? I am confident the Author was
incapable of imputing any such to One,
whose whole Life (to use his own Expression
in Print of him) is <hi>a continued Series</hi> of good
and generous Actions.</p>
               <p>I know no man who would be more con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cerned,
if he gave the least Pain or Offence
to any innocent Person; and none who
would be less concerned, if the Satire were
challenged by any one at whom he would
really aim it. If ever that happens, I dare
engage he will own it, with all the Free<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dom
of one whose <hi>Censures</hi> are <hi>just,</hi> and who
sets his <hi>Name</hi> to them.</p>

Warmth of your Lordship in that
of a private Man who is innocent.</p>
               <p>It was not the <hi>Poem</hi> that deserv'd this

your Friend, I cou'd not treat you quite like

Candor, even from those who knew him

               <p>I was too well content with my Know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge

Affair, to trouble the publick about it. But
<pb n="243" facs="239"/>
since Malice and Mistake are so long a dy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing,
I have taken the opportunity of a third

me to write no more: That wou'd be making
the Town a Compliment which I think it

take very kindly. This way of Satire is dan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gerous,
as long as Slander rais'd by Fools of
the lowest Rank can find any countenance

Conduct shewn on this Occasion, I have
learnt there are some who wou'd rather be
