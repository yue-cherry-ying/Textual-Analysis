            <p>AS the OLD MAID is now adven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turing into the world, it would be proper to acquaint the mere English reader, that the subject of it, and part of the fable, were taken from a <hi>little piece,</hi> in one act, called, <hi>L'Etourderie,</hi> by Monsieur <hi>Fagan.</hi> but that the author of these scenes is sensible, how superfluous that information will be rendered by the assiduity of some people, who, no doubt, will make a notable discovery of this prodigious crime, and press it home with all the reproaches of <hi>plagiarism, pilfer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing, borrowing, robbing, translating,</hi> &amp;c. But while this writer can add any thing to the decent amusements of the public, he is willing to be abused for it, in what<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever manner the illiberal shall think fit.</p>

Here is a letter with your sister's name—Look at it, Sir,—is that her hand-writing?—</p>
