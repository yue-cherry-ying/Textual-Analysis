         <div n="1" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <p>I Have begun a new book, on purpose that I might have room enough to explain the nature of the perplexities in which my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> was involved, from the many discourses and interroga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions about the siege of <hi>Namur,</hi> where he received his wound.</p>
            <p>I must remind the reader, in case he has read the history of King <hi>William</hi>'s
<pb n="2" facs="3"/>
wars,—but if he has not,—I then inform him, that one of the most memorable at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tacks in that siege, was that which was made by the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> upon the point of the advanced counterscarp, be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore the gate of <hi>St. Nicolas,</hi> which inclo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sed the great sluice or water-stop, where the <hi>English</hi> were terribly exposed to the shot of the counter-guard and demi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bastion of <hi>St. Roch:</hi> The issue of which hot dispute, in three words, was this; That the <hi>Dutch</hi> lodged themselves upon the counter-guard,—and that the <hi>English</hi> made themselves masters of the covered way before <hi>St. Nicolas</hi>'s gate, notwith<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>standing the gallantry of the <hi>French</hi> offi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cers, who exposed themselves upon the glacis sword in hand.</p>
            <p>As this was the principal attack of which my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> was an eye-witness
<pb n="3" facs="4"/>
at <hi>Namur,</hi>—the army of the besiegers being cut off, by the confluence of the <hi>Maes</hi> and <hi>Sambre,</hi> from seeing much of each other's operations,—my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> was generally more eloquent and parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cular in his account of it; and the many perplexities he was in, arose out of the almost insurmountable difficulties he found in telling his story intelligibly, and giving such clear ideas of the differ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ences and distinctions between the scarp and counterscarp,—the glacis and co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vered way,—the half-moon and rave<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lin,—as to make his company fully comprehend where and what he was about.</p>
            <p>Writers themselves are too apt to con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>found these terms;—so that you will the less wonder, if in his endeavours to explain them, and in opposition to ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny
<pb n="4" facs="5"/>
misconceptions, that my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> did oft times puzzle his visiters, and sometimes himself too.</p>
            <p>To speak the truth, unless the compa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ny my father led up stairs were tolerably clear-headed, or my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> was in one of his best explanatory moods, 'twas a difficult thing, do what he could, to keep the discourse free from obscurity.</p>
            <p>What rendered the account of this affair the more intricate to my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> was this,—that in the attack of the counterscarp before the gate of <hi>St. Ni<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>colas,</hi> extending itself from the bank of the <hi>Maes,</hi> quite up to the great water<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stop;—the ground was cut and cross-cut with such a multitude of dykes, drains, rivulets, and sluices, on all sides,—and he would get so sadly bewilder'd and set
<pb n="5" facs="6"/>
fast amongst them, that frequently he could neither get backwards or for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards to save his life; and was oft times obliged to give up the attack upon that very account only.</p>
            <p>These perplexing rebuffs gave my uncle <hi>Toby Shandy</hi> more perturbations than you would imagine; and as my father's kindness to him was continually dragging up fresh friends and fresh in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quirers,—he had but a very uneasy task of it.</p>
            <p>No doubt my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> had great command of himself,—and could guard appearances, I believe, as well as most men;—yet any one may imagine, that when he could not retreat out of the ra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>velin without getting into the half-moon, or get out of the covered way without
<pb n="6" facs="7"/>
falling down the counterscarp, nor cross the dyke without danger of slipping into the ditch, but that he must have fretted and fumed inwardly:—He did so;—and these little and hourly vexations, which may seem trifling and of no account to the man who has not read <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> yet, whoever has read <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> or Dr. <hi>James Mackenzie,</hi> and has considered well the effects which the passions and affections of the mind have upon the di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gestion,—(Why not of a wound as well as of a dinner?)—may easily conceive what sharp paroxisms and exacerbations of his wound my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> must have undergone upon that score only.</p>
            <p>—My uncle <hi>Toby</hi> could not philoso<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phize upon it;—'twas enough he felt it was so,—and having sustained the pain and sorrows of it for three months toge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther,
<pb n="7" facs="8"/>
he was resolved some way or other to extricate himself.</p>
            <p>He was one morning lying upon his back in his bed, the anguish and nature of the wound upon his groin suffering him to lye in no other position, when a thought came into his head, that if he could purchase such a thing, and have it pasted down upon a board, as a large map of the fortifications of the town and citadel of <hi>Namur,</hi> with its environs, it might be a means of giving him ease.—I take notice of his desire to have the environs along with the town and cita<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>del, for this reason,—because my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s wound was got in one of the tra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verses, about thirty toises from the re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turning angle of the trench, opposite to the salient angle of the demi-bastion of <hi>St. Roch</hi>;—so that he was pretty con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fident
<pb n="8" facs="9"/>
he could stick a pin upon the iden<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tical spot of ground where he was stand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing in when the stone struck him.</p>
            <p>All this succeeded to his wishes, and not only freed him from a world of sad explanations, but, in the end, it prov'd the happy means, as you will read, of procuring my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> his HOBBY-HORSE.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. II.</head>
            <p>THERE is nothing so foolish, when you are at the expence of making an entertainment of this kind, as to or<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der things so badly, as to let your cri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticks and gentry of refined taste run it down: Nor is there any thing so likely
<pb n="9" facs="10"/>
to make them do it, as that of leaving them out of the party, or, what is full as offensive, of bestowing your attention upon the rest of your guests in so parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cular a way, as if there was no such thing as a critick (by occupation) at table.</p>
            <p>—I guard against both; for, in the first place, I have left half a dozen places purposely open for them;—and, in the next place, I pay them all court,—Gentlemen, I kiss your hands,—I pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>test no company could give me half the pleasure,—by my soul I am glad to see you,—I beg only you will make no strangers of yourselves, but sit down without any ceremony, and fall on hear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tily.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="11"/>
I said I had left six places, and I was upon the point of carrying my complai<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sance so far, as to have left a seventh open for them,—and in this very spot I stand on;—but being told by a critick, (tho' not by occupation,—but by nature) that I had acquitted myself well enough, I shall fill it up directly, hoping, in the mean time, that I shall be able to make a great deal of more room next year.</p>
            <p>—How, in the name of wonder! could your uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> who, it seems, was a military man, and whom you have represented as no fool,—be at the same time such a confused, pudding-headed, muddle-headed fellow, as—Go look.</p>
            <p>So, Sir Critick, I could have replied; but I scorn it.—'Tis language un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>urbane,—and only befitting the man
<pb n="11" facs="12"/>
who cannot give clear and satisfactory accounts of things, or dive deep enough into the first causes of human ignorance and confusion. It is moreover the re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ply valiant,—and therefore I reject it; for tho' it might have suited my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s character as a soldier excellently well,—and had he not accustomed him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self, in such attacks, to whistle the <hi>Lilla<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bullero,</hi>—as he wanted no courage, 'tis the very answer he would have given; yet it would by no means have done for me. You see as plain as can be, that I write as a man of erudition;—that even my similies, my allusions, my illustra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions, my metaphors, are erudite,—and that I must sustain my character properly, and contrast it properly too,—else what would become of me? Why, Sir, I should be undone;—at this very mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment that I am going here to fill up one
<pb n="12" facs="13"/>
place against a critick,—I should have made an opening for a couple.</p>
            <p>—Therefore I answer thus:</p>
            <p>Pray, Sir, in all the reading which you have ever read, did you ever read such a book as <hi>Locke</hi>'s Essay upon the Human Understanding?—Don't answer me rashly,—because many, I know, quote the book, who have not read it,—and many have read it who understand it not:—If either of these is your case, as I write to instruct, I will tell you in three words what the book is.—It is a history.—A history! of who? what? where? when? Don't hurry yourself.—It is a history-book, Sir, (which may possibly recom<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mend it to the world) of what passes in a man's own mind; and if you will say so much of the book, and no more, believe
<pb n="13" facs="14"/>
me, you will cut no contemptible figure in a metaphysic circle.</p>
            <p>But this by the way.</p>
            <p>Now if you will venture to go along with me, and look down into the bottom of this matter, it will be found that the cause of obscurity and confusion, in the mind of man, is threefold.</p>
            <p>Dull organs, dear Sir, in the first place. Secondly, slight and transient impressions made by objects when the said organs are not dull. And, thirdly, a memory like unto a sieve, not able to retain what it has received.—Call down <hi>Dolly</hi> your cham<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber-maid, and I will give you my cap and bell along with it, if I make not this matter so plain that <hi>Dolly</hi> herself shall understand it as well as <hi>Malbranch.</hi>—
<pb n="14" facs="15"/>
When <hi>Dolly</hi> has indited her epistle to <hi>Robin,</hi> and has thrust her arm into the bottom of her pocket hanging by her right-side;—take that opportunity to recollect that the organs and faculties of perception, can, by nothing in this world, be so aptly typified and explained as by that one thing which <hi>Dolly</hi>'s hand is in search of.—Your organs are not so dull that I should inform you,—'tis an inch, Sir, of red seal-wax.</p>
            <p>When this is melted and dropped upon the letter, if <hi>Dolly</hi> fumbles too long for her thimble, till the wax is over harden'd, it will not receive the mark of her thim<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble from the usual impulse which was wont to imprint it. Very well: If <hi>Dolly</hi>'s wax, for want of better, is bees-wax, or of a temper too soft,—tho' it may re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceive,—it will not hold the impression,
<pb n="15" facs="16"/>
how hard soever <hi>Dolly</hi> thrusts against it; and last of all, supposing the wax good, and eke the thimble, but applied there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>to in careless haste, as her Mistress rings the bell;—in any one of these three cases, the print, left by the thimble, will be as unlike the prototype as a brass<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jack.</p>
            <p>Now you must understand that not one of these was the true cause of the confusion in my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s discourse; and it is for that very reason I enlarge upon them so long, after the manner of great physiologists,—to shew the world what it did <hi>not</hi> arise from.</p>
            <p>What it did arise from, I have hinted above, and a fertile source of obscurity it is,—and ever will be,—and that is the unsteady uses of words which have per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plexed
<pb n="16" facs="17"/>
the clearest and most exalted un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derstandings.</p>
            <p>It is ten to one (at <hi>Arthur</hi>'s) whether you have ever read the literary histories of past ages;—if you have,—what ter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rible battles, 'yclept logomachies, have they occasioned and perpetuated with so much gall and ink-shed,—that a good natured man cannot read the accounts of them without tears in his eyes.</p>
            <p>Gentle critick! when thou hast weigh'd all this, and consider'd within thyself how much of thy own knowledge, discourse, and conversation has been pestered and disordered, at one time or other, by this, and this only:—What a pudder and racket in COUNCILS about <gap extent="1 word" rend="content:〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉">
                  <desc>foreign</desc>
               </gap> and <gap extent="1 word" rend="content:〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉">
                  <desc>foreign</desc>
               </gap>; and in the SCHOOLS of the learned about power and about spirit;—about
<pb n="17" facs="18"/>
essences, and about quintessences;—about substances, and about space.—What confusion in greater THEATRES from words of little meaning, and as in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>determinate a sense;—when thou consi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders this, thou wilt not wonder at my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s perplexities,—thou wilt drop a tear of pity upon his scarp and his coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>terscarp;—his glacis and his covered-way;—his ravelin and his half-moon: 'Twas not by ideas,—by heaven! his life was put in jeopardy by words.</p>

         <div n="3" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. III.</head>
            <p>WHEN my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> got his map of <hi>Namur</hi> to his mind, he began immediately to apply himself, and with the utmost diligence, to the study of it; for nothing being of more importance
<pb n="18" facs="19"/>
to him than his recovery, and his reco<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>very depending, as you have read, up<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>on the passions and affections of his mind, it behoved him to take the nicest care to make himself so far master of his subject, as to be able to talk upon it without emotion.</p>
            <p>In a fortnight's close and painful ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plication, which, by the bye, did my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s wound, upon his groin, no good,—he was enabled, by the help of some marginal documents at the feet of the elephant, together with <hi>Gobesius</hi>'s mi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>litary architecture and pyroballogy, tran<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>slated from the <hi>Flemish,</hi> to form his dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>course with passable perspicuity; and before he was two full months gone,—he was right eloquent upon it, and could make not only the attack of the advan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ced
<pb n="19" facs="20"/>
counterscarp with great order;—but having, by that time, gone much deeper into the art, than what his first motive made necessary,—my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> was able to cross the <hi>Maes</hi> and <hi>Sambre</hi>; make diversions as far as <hi>Vauban</hi>'s line, the abbey of <hi>Salsines, &amp;c.</hi> and give his visiters as distinct a history of each of their attacks, as of that of the gate of <hi>St. Nicolas,</hi> where he had the honour to receive his wound.</p>
            <p>But the desire of knowledge, like the thirst of riches, increases ever with the ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quisition of it. The more my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> pored over his map, the more he took a liking to it;—by the same process and electrical assimilation, as I told you, thro' which I ween the souls of connoisseurs themselves, by long friction and incum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bition, have the happiness, at length, to
<pb n="20" facs="21"/>
get all be-virtu'd,—be-pictur'd,—be-butterflied, and be-fiddled.</p>
            <p>The more my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> drank of this sweet fountain of science, the greater was the heat and impatience of his thirst, so that, before the first year of his con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>finement had well gone round, there was scarce a fortified town in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Flanders,</hi> of which, by one means or other, he had not procured a plan, reading over as he got them, and carefully collating there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>with the histories of their sieges, their de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>molitions, their improvements, and new works, all which he would read with that intense application and delight, that he would forget himself, his wound, his con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>finement, his dinner.</p>
            <p>In the second year my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chased <hi>Ramelli</hi> and <hi>Cataneo,</hi> translated
<pb n="21" facs="22"/>
from the <hi>Italian</hi>;—likewise <hi>Stevinus, Marolis,</hi> the Chevalier <hi>de Ville, Lorini, Cochorn, Sheeter,</hi> the Count <hi>de Pagan,</hi> the Marshal <hi>Vauban,</hi> Mons. <hi>Blondel,</hi> with almost as many more books of military architecture, as Don <hi>Quixote</hi> was found to have of chivalry, when the curate and barber invaded his library.</p>
            <p>Towards the beginning of the third year, which was in <hi>August,</hi> ninety-nine, my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> found it necessary to un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derstand a little of projectiles:—And ha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ving judged it best to draw his know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge from the fountain-head, he began with <hi>N.

—Endless is the Search of Truth!</p>
            <p>No sooner was my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> satisfied which road the cannon-ball did not go, but he was insensibly led on, and resolved in his mind to enquire and find out which road the ball did go: For which purpose he was obliged to set off afresh with old <hi>Maltus,</hi> and studied him devout<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly.—He proceeded next to <hi>Gallileo</hi> and <hi>Torricellius,</hi> wherein, by certain geome<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>trical rules, infallibly laid down, he found the precise path to be a PARABOLA,—or else an HYPERBOLA,—and that the pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rameter, or <hi>latus rectum,</hi> of the conic sec<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of the said path, was to the quantity and amplitude in a direct <hi>ratio,</hi> as the whole line to the sine of double the angle of incidence, form'd by the breech upon an horizontal plane;—and that the semi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parameter,

—stop! my dear uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—stop!—go not one foot further into this thorny and bewilder'd track,—intricate are the steps! intricate are the mases of this labyrinth! intricate are the troubles which the pursuit of this bewitch<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing phantom, KNOWLEDGE, will bring upon thee.—O my uncle! fly—fly—fly from it as from a serpent.—Is it fit, good-natur'd man! thou should'st fit up, with the wound upon thy groin, whole nights baking thy blood with hectic watchings?—Alas! 'twill exasperate thy symptoms,—check thy perspirations,—evaporate thy spirits,—waste thy animal strength,—dry up thy radical moisture,—bring thee into a costive habit of body, impair thy health,—and hasten all the infirmities of thy old age.—O my uncle! my uncle <hi>Toby!</hi>

            <p>I Would not give a groat for that man's knowledge in pen-craft, who does not understand this,—That the best plain narrative in the world, tack'd very close to the last spirited apostrophe to my un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cle <hi>Toby,</hi>—would have felt both cold and vapid upon the reader's palate;—there<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fore I forthwith put an end to the chap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter,—though I was in the middle of my story.</p>
            <p>—Writers of my stamp have one principle in common with painters.—Where an exact copying makes our pictures less striking, we choose the less evil; deeming it even more pardonable to trespass against truth, than beauty.—This is to be understood <hi>cum grano salis</hi>;
<pb n="25" facs="26"/>
but be it as it will,—as the parallel is made more for the sake of letting the apostrophe cool, than any thing else,—'tis not very material whether upon any other score the reader approves of it or not.</p>
            <p>In the latter end of the third year, my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> perceiving that the parameter and semi-parameter of the conic section, angered his wound, he left off the study of projectiles in a kind of a huff, and betook himself to the practical part of fortification only; the pleasure of which, like a spring held back, returned upon him with redoubled force.</p>
            <p>It was in this year that my uncle be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gan to break in upon the daily regularity of a clean shirt,—to dismiss his barber unshaven,—and to allow his surgeon
<pb n="26" facs="27"/>
scarce time sufficient to dress his wound, concerning himself so little about it, as not to ask him once in seven times dres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sing how it went on: When, lo!—all of a sudden, for the change was as quick as lightening, he began to sigh heavily for his recovery,—complain'd to my father, grew impatient with the surgeon;—and one morning as he heard his foot com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing up stairs, he shut up his books, and thrust aside his instruments, in order to expostulate with him upon the protrac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of his cure, which, he told him, might surely have been accomplished at least by that time:—He dwelt long upon the miseries he had undergone, and the sorrows of his four years melancholy imprisonment;—adding, that had it not been for the kind looks, and fraternal chearings of the best of brothers,—he had long since sunk under his misfor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tunes.
<pb n="27" facs="28"/>
—My father was by: My uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s eloquence brought tears into his eyes;—'twas unexpected.—My uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> by nature, was not eloquent;—it had the greater effect.—The surgeon was confounded;—not that there wanted grounds for such, or greater, marks of impatience,—but 'twas unexpected too; in the four years he had attended him, he had never seen any thing like it in my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s carriage;—he had never once dropp'd one fretful or discontented word;—he had been all patience,—all submission.</p>
            <p>—We ose the right of complaining sometimes by forbearing it;—but we oftner treble the force:—The surgeon was astonished;—but much more so, when he heard my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> go on, and peremptorily insist upon his healing up
<pb n="28" facs="29"/>
the wound directly,—or sending for Monsieur <hi>Ronjat,</hi> the King's Serjeant-Surgeon, to do it for him.</p>
            <p>The desire of life and health is im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>planted in man's nature;—the love of liberty and enlargement is a sister-passion to it: These my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> had in com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon with his species;—and either of them had been sufficient to account for his earnest desire to get well and out of doors;—but I have told you before that nothing wrought with our family after the common way;—and from the time and manner in which this eager desire shew'd itself in the present case, the pe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>netrating reader will suspect there was some other cause or crotchet for it in my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s head:—There was so, and 'tis the subject of the next chapter to set forth what that cause and crotchet was.
<pb n="29" facs="30"/>
I own, when that's done, 'twill be time to return back to the parlour fire-side, where we left my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> in the mid<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dle of his sentence.</p>

            <p>WHEN a man gives himself up to the government of a ruling pas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion,—or, in other words, when his HOBBY-HORSE grows head-strong,—farewell cool reason and fair discretion!</p>
            <p>My uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s wound was near well, and as soon as the surgeon recovered his surprize, and could get leave to say as much—he told him, 'twas just beginning to incarnate; and that if no fresh exfolia<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion happen'd, which there was no signs of,—it would be dried up in five or six
<pb n="30" facs="31"/>
weeks. The sound of as many olym<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piads twelve hours before, would have convey'd an idea of shorter duration to my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s mind.—The succession of his ideas was now rapid,—he broil'd with impatience to put his design in execution;—and so, without consulting further with any soul living,—which, by the bye, I think is right, when you are predetermined to take no one soul's advice,—he privately ordered <hi>Trim,</hi> his man, to pack up a bundle of lint and dressings, and hire a chariot and four to be at the door exactly by twelve o'clock that day, when he knew my father would be upon 'Change.—So leaving a bank-note upon the table for the surgeon's care of him, and a letter of tender thanks for his brother's,—he pack'd up his maps, his books of fortification, his in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>struments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—and, by the help of a
<pb n="31" facs="32"/>
crutch on one side, and <hi>Trim</hi> on the other,—my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> embark'd for <hi>Shandy-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reason, or rather the rise, of this sudden demigration, was as follows:</p>
            <p>The table in my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s room, and at which, the night before this change happened, he was sitting with his maps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> about him,—being somewhat of the smallest, for that infinity of great and small instruments of knowledge which usually lay crouded upon it;—he had the accident, in reaching over for his tobacco-box, to throw down his com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>passes, and in stooping to take the com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>passes up, with his sleeve he threw down his case of instruments and snuffers;—and as the dice took a run against him, in his endeavouring to catch the snuffers
<pb n="32" facs="33"/>
in falling,—he thrust Monsieur <hi>Blondel</hi> off the table and Count <hi>de Pagan</hi> o'top of him.</p>
            <p>'Twas to no purpose for a man, lame as my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> was, to think of redres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sing all these evils by himself,—he rung his bell for his man <hi>Trim</hi>;—<hi>Trim!</hi> quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> pri'thee see what confu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion I have here been making.—I must have some better contrivance, <hi>Trim.</hi>—Can'st not thou take my rule and mea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure the length and breadth of this table, and then go and bespeak me one as big again?—Yes, an' please your Honour, replied <hi>Trim,</hi> making a bow;—but I hope your Honour will be soon well enough to get down to your country seat, where,—as your Honour takes so much pleasure in fortification, we could ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nage this matter to a T.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="34"/>
I must here inform you, that this ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vant of my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s, who went by the name of <hi>Trim,</hi> had been a Corporal in my uncle's own company,—his real name was <hi>James Butler,</hi>—but having got the nick-name of <hi>Trim</hi> in the regi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment, my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> unless when he hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pened to be very angry with him, would never call him by any other name.</p>
            <p>The poor fellow had been disabled for the service, by a wound on his left knee by a musket-bullet, at the battle of <hi>Landen,</hi> which was two years before the affair of <hi>Namur</hi>;—and as the fellow was well beloved in the regiment, and a handy fellow into the bargain, my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> took him for his servant, and of ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cellent use was he, attending my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> in the camp and in his quarters as valet, groom, barber, cook, sempster,
<pb n="34" facs="35"/>
and nurse; and indeed, from first to last, waited upon him and served him with great fidelity and affection.</p>
            <p>My uncle <hi>Toby</hi> loved the man in re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>turn, and what attached him more to him still, was the similitude of their knowledge:—For Corporal <hi>Trim,</hi> (for so, for the future, I shall call him) by four years occasional attention to his Master's discourse upon fortified towns, and the advantage of prying and peeping continually into his Master's plans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> exclusive and besides what he gained HOBBY-HORSICALLY, as a body-servant, <hi>Non Hobby-Horsical per se</hi>;—had be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>come no mean proficient in the science; and was thought, by the cook and cham<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ber-maid, to know as much of the na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture of strong-holds as my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="36"/>
I have but one more stroke to give to finish Corporal <hi>Trim</hi>'s character,—and it is the only dark line in it.—The fellow lov'd to advise,—or rather to hear him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self talk; his carriage, however, was so perfectly respectful, 'twas easy to keep him silent when you had him so; but set his tongue a-going,—you had no hold of him;—he was voluble;—the eternal interlardings of <hi>your Honour,</hi> with the respectfulness of Corporal <hi>Trim</hi>'s manner, interceding so strong in behalf of his elocution,—that tho' you might have been incommoded,—you could not well be angry. My uncle <hi>Toby</hi> was seldom either the one or the other with him,—or, at least, this fault, in <hi>Trim,</hi> broke no squares with 'em. My uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> as I said, loved the man;—and besides, as he ever looked upon a faithful servant,—but as a humble friend,—he could not
<pb n="36" facs="37"/>
bear to stop his mouth.—Such was Cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>poral <hi>Trim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I durst presume, continued <hi>Trim,</hi> to give your Honour my advice, and speak my opinion in this matter.—Thou art welcome, <hi>Trim,</hi> quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—speak,—speak what thou thinkest upon the subject, man, without fear. Why then, replied <hi>Trim,</hi> (not hanging his ears and scratching his head like a country lout, but) stroking his hair back from his forehead, and standing erect as before his division.—I think, quoth <hi>Trim,</hi> advancing his left, which was his lame leg, a little forwards,—and point<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing with his right hand open towards a map of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> which was pinn'd against the hangings,—I think, quoth Corporal <hi>Trim,</hi> with humble submission to your Honour's better judgment,—that these
<pb n="37" facs="38"/>
ravelins, bastions, curtins, and horn-works make but a poor, contemptible, fiddle faddle piece of work of it here upon paper, compared to what your Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour and I could make of it, were we in the country by ourselves, and had but a rood, or a rood and a half of ground to do what we pleased with: As summer is coming on, continued <hi>Trim,</hi> your Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour might sit out of doors, and give me the nography—(call it ichnography, quoth my uncle)—of the town or cita<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>del, your Honour was pleased to sit down before,—and I will be shot by your Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour upon the glacis of it, if I did not fortify it to your Honour's mind.—I dare say thou would'st, <hi>Trim,</hi> quoth my uncle.—For if your Honour, continued the Corporal, could but mark me the poly<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gon, with its exact lines and angles.—That I could do very well, quoth my
<pb n="38" facs="39"/>
uncle.—I would begin with the fossé, and if your Honour could tell me the proper depth and breadth,—I can to a hair's breadth, <hi>Trim,</hi> replied my uncle,—I would throw out the earth upon this hand towards the town for the scarp,—and on that hand towards the campaign for the counterscarp.—Very right, <hi>Trim</hi>; quoth my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>—And when I had sloped them to your mind,—an' please your Honour, I would face the glacis, as the finest fortifications are done in <hi>Flan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ders,</hi> with sods,—and as your Honour knows they should be,—and I would make the walls and parapets with sods too;—The best engineers call them ga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>zons, <hi>Trim,</hi> said my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>;—Whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther they are gazons or sods, is not much matter, replied <hi>Trim,</hi> your Honour knows they are ten times beyond a facing either of brick or stone;—I know they are,
<pb n="39" facs="40"/>
               <hi>Trim,</hi> in some respects,—quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> nodding his head;—for a cannon-ball enters into the gazon right onwards, without bringing any rubbish down with it, which might fill the fossé, (as was the case at <hi>St. Nicolas</hi>'s <hi>Gate</hi>) and facilitate the passage over it.</p>
            <p>Your Honour understands these mat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ters, replied Corporal <hi>Trim,</hi> better than any officer in his Majesty's service;—but would your Honour please to let the bespeaking of the table alone, and let us but go into the country, I would work under your Honour's directions like a horse, and make fortifications for you something like a tansy, with all their batteries, saps, ditches, and palisadoes, that it should be worth all the world's riding twenty miles to go and see it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="41"/>
My uncle <hi>Toby</hi> blushed as red as scar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>let as <hi>Trim</hi> went on;—but it was not a blush of guilt,—of modesty,—or of an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ger;—it was a blush of joy;—he was fired with Corporal <hi>Trim</hi>'s project and description.—<hi>Trim!</hi> said my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> thou hast said enough.—We might be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gin the campaign, continued <hi>Trim,</hi> on the very day that his Majesty and the Allies take the field, and demolish them town by town as fast as—<hi>Trim,</hi> quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> say no more.—Your Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour, continued <hi>Trim,</hi> might sit in your arm-chair (pointing to it) this fine weather, giving me your orders, and I would—Say no more, <hi>Trim,</hi> quoth my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>—Besides, your Honour would get not only pleasure and good pastime,—but good air, and good exer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cise, and good health,—and your Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour's wound would be well in a month.
<pb n="41" facs="42"/>
Thou hast said enough, <hi>Trim,</hi>—quoth my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> (putting his hand into his breeches-pocket)—I like thy project mightily;—And if your Honour pleases, I'll, this moment, go and buy a pioneer's spade to take down with us, and I'll be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>speak a shovel and a pick-ax, and a couple of—Say no more, <hi>Trim,</hi> quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> leaping up upon one leg, quite overcome with rapture,—and thrusting a guinea into <hi>Trim</hi>'s hand,—<hi>Trim,</hi> said my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> say no more;—but go down, <hi>Trim,</hi> this moment, my lad, and bring up my supper this in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trim</hi> ran down and brought up his Master's supper,—to no purpose:—<hi>Trim</hi>'s plan of operation ran so in my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s head, he could not taste it.—<hi>Trim,</hi> quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> get me
<pb n="42" facs="43"/>
to-bed;—'twas all one.—Corporal <hi>Trim</hi>'s description had fired his imagination,—my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> could not shut his eyes.—The more he consider'd it, the more be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>witching the scene appeared to him;—so that, two full hours before day-light, he had come to a final determination, and had concerted the whole plan of his and Corporal <hi>Trim</hi>'s decampment.</p>
            <p>My uncle <hi>Toby</hi> had a little neat coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try-house of his own, in the village where my father's estate lay at <hi>Shandy,</hi> which had been left him by an old uncle, with a small estate of about one hundred pounds a year. Behind this house, and contiguous to it, was a kitchen-garden of about half an acre;—and at the bot<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tom of the garden, and cut off from it by a tall yew hedge, was a bowling-green, containing just about as much
<pb n="43" facs="44"/>
ground as Corporal <hi>Trim</hi> wished for;—so that as <hi>Trim</hi> uttered the words, "A rood and a half of ground to do what they would with:"—this identical bowling-green instantly presented itself, and became curiously painted, all at once, upon the retina of my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s fancy;—which was the physical cause of making him change colour, or at least, of heightening his blush to that immo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>derate degree I spoke of.</p>
            <p>Never did lover post down to a belov'd mistress with more heat and expectation, than my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> did, to enjoy this self-same thing in private;—I say in pri<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vate;—for it was sheltered from the house, as I told you, by a tall yew hedge, and was covered on the other three sides, from mortal sight, by rough holly and thickset flowering shrubs;—so that the
<pb n="44" facs="45"/>
idea of not being seen, did not a little contribute to the idea of pleasure pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>conceived in my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s mind.—Vain thought! however thick it was planted about,—or private soever it might seem,—to think, dear uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> of enjoying a thing which took up a whole rood and a half of ground,—and not have it known!</p>
            <p>How my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> and Corporal <hi>Trim</hi> managed this matter,—with the history of their campaigns, which were no way barren of events,—may make no unin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>teresting under-plot in the epitasis and working up of this drama.—At present the scene must drop,—and change for the parlour fire-side.</p>

            <p>—What can they be doing, brother? said my father.—I think, re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plied my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—taking, as I told you, his pipe from his mouth, and strik<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the ashes out of it as he began his sentence;—I think, replied he,—it would not be amiss, brother, if we rung the bell.</p>
            <p>Pray, what's all that racket over our heads, <hi>Obadiah?</hi>—quoth my father;—my brother and I can scarce hear our<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>selves speak.</p>
            <p>Sir, answer'd <hi>Obadiah,</hi> making a bow towards his left-shoulder,—my Mistress is taken very badly;—and where's <hi>Su<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sannah</hi> running down the garden there,
<pb n="46" facs="47"/>
as if they were going to ravish her?—Sir, she is running the shortest cut into the town, replied <hi>Obadiah,</hi> to fetch the old midwife.—Then saddle a horse, quoth my father, and do you go direct<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly for Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> the man-midwife, with all our services,—and let him know your Mistress is fallen into labour,—and that I desire he will return with you with all speed.</p>
            <p>It is very strange, says my father, ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dressing himself to my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> as <hi>Obadiah</hi> shut the door,—as there is so expert an operator as Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> so near—that my wife should persist to the very last in this obstinate humour of hers, in trusting the life of my child, who has had one misfortune already, to the ignorance of an old woman;—and not only the life of my child, brother,—but her own
<pb n="47" facs="48"/>
life, and with it the lives of all the chil<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dren I might, peradventure, have begot out of her hereafter.</p>
            <p>Mayhap, brother, replied my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> my sister does it to save the ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pence:—A pudding's end,—replied my father,—the doctor must be paid the same for inaction as action,—if not bet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter,—to keep him in temper.</p>
            <p>—Then it can be out of no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing in the whole world, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> in the simplicity of his heart,—but MODESTY:—My sister, I dare say, added he, does not care to let a man come so near her * * * *. I will not say whether my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> had com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pleted the sentence or not;—'tis for his advantage to suppose he had,—as, I think, he could have added no
<pb n="48" facs="49"/>
ONE WORD which would have im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proved it.</p>
            <p>If, on the contrary, my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> had not fully arrived at his period's end,—then the world stands indebted to the sudden snapping of my father's tobacco-pipe, for one of the neatest examples of that ornamental figure in oratory, which Rhetoricians stile the <hi>Aposiopesis.</hi>—Just heaven! how does the <hi>Poco piu</hi> and the <hi>Poco meno</hi> of the <hi>Italian</hi> artists;—the in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sensible MORE or LESS, determine the precise line of beauty in the sentence, as well as in the statue! How do the slight touches of the chifel, the pencil, the pen, the fiddle-stick, <hi>et caetera,</hi>—give the true swell, which give the true pleasure!—O my countrymen!—be nice;—be cau<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tious of your language;—and never, O! never let it be forgotten upon what
<pb n="49" facs="50"/>
small particles your eloquence and your fame depend.</p>
            <p>—"My sister, mayhap," quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> "does not choose to let a man come so near her * * * *" Make this dash,—'tis an Aposiopesis.—Take the dash away, and write <hi>Backside,</hi>—'tis Bawdy.—Scratch Backside out, and put <hi>Cover'd-way</hi> in,—'tis a Metaphor;—and, I dare say, as fortification ran so much in my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s head, that if he had been left to have added one word to the sentence,—that word was it.</p>

            <p>THO' my father was a good natural philosopher,—yet he was some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing of a moral philosopher too; for which reason, when his tobacco-pipe snapp'd short in the middle,—he had nothing to do,—as such,—but to have taken hold of the two pieces, and thrown them gently upon the back of the fire.—He did no such thing;—he threw them with all the violence in the world;—and, to give the action still more emphasis,—he started up upon both his legs to do it.</p>
            <p>This look'd something like heat;—and the manner of his reply to what my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> was saying, prov'd it was so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="52"/>
—"Not choose," quoth my father, repeating my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s words) "to let a man come so near her."—By hea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ven, brother <hi>Toby!</hi> you would try the patience of a <hi>Job</hi>;—and I think I have the plagues of one already, without it.—Why?—Where?—Wherein?—Wherefore?—Upon what account, re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plied my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> in the utmost asto<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nishment.—To think, said my father, of a man living to your age, brother, and knowing so little about women!—I know nothing at all about them,—re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>plied my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>; and I think, con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinued he, that the shock I received the year after the demolition of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> in my affair with widow <hi>Wadman</hi>;—which shock you know I should not have re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceived, but from my total ignorance of the sex,—has given me just cause to say, That I neither know, nor do pretend to
<pb n="52" facs="53"/>
know, any thing about 'em, or their concerns either.—Methinks, brother, replied my father, you might, at least, know so much as the right end of a woman from the wrong.</p>
            <p>It is said in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Master-Piece,</hi> "That when a man doth think of any thing which is past,—he looketh down upon the ground;—but that when he thinketh of something which is to come, he looketh up towards the heavens."</p>
            <p>My uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> I suppose, thought of neither,—for he look'd horizontally.—Right end,—quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> mut<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tering the two words low to himself, and fixing his two eyes insensibly as he mut<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tered them, upon a small crevice, form'd by a bad joint in the chimney-piece.—Right end of a woman!—I declare,
<pb n="53" facs="54"/>
quoth my uncle, I know no more which it is, than the man in the moon;—and if I was to think, continued my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> (keeping his eye still fix'd upon the bad joint) this month together, I am sure I should not be able to find it out.</p>
            <p>Then brother <hi>Toby,</hi> replied my father, I will tell you.</p>
            <p>Every thing in this world, continued my father (filling a fresh pipe)—every thing in this earthly world, my dear bro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther <hi>Toby,</hi> has two handles.—Not always, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>—At least, replied my father, every one has two hands,—which comes to the same thing.—Now, if a man was to sit down cooly, and con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sider within himself the make, the shape, the construction, com-at-ability, and con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>venience of all the parts which constitute
<pb n="54" facs="55"/>
the whole of that animal, call'd Woman, and compare them analogically.—I never understood rightly the meaning of that word,—quoth my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>—ANALOGY, replied my father, is the cer<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tain relation and agreement, which dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent—Here a devil of a rap at the door snapp'd my father's definition (like his tobacco pipe) in two,—and, at the same time, crushed the head of as notable and curious a dissertation as ever was engen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dered in the womb of speculation;—it was some months before my father could get an opportunity to be safely deliver'd of it:—And, at this hour, it is a thing full as problematical as the subject of the dissertation itself,—(considering the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fusion and distresses of our domestic mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>adventures, which are now coming thick one upon the back of another) whether
<pb n="55" facs="56"/>
I shall be able to find a place for it in the third volume or not.</p>

            <p>IT is about an hour and a half's tole<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rable good reading since my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> rung the bell, when <hi>Obadiah</hi> was order'd to saddle a horse, and go for Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> the man-midwife;—so that no one can say, with reason, that I have not allowed <hi>Obadiah</hi> time enough, poetically speaking, and considering the emergency too, both to go and come;—tho', morally and truly speaking, the man, perhaps, has scarce had time to get on his boots.</p>
            <p>If the hypercritic will go upon this; and is resolved after all to take a pen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dulum,
<pb n="56" facs="57"/>
and measure the true distance betwixt the ringing of the bell, and the rap at the door;—and, after finding it to be no more than two minutes, thirteen seconds, and three fifths,—should take upon him to insult over me for such a breach in the unity, or rather probability, of time;—I would remind him, that the idea of duration and of its simple modes, is got merely from the train and succes<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion of our ideas,—and is the true scho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lastic pendulum,—and by which, as a scholar, I will be tried in this matter,—abjuring and detesting the jurisdiction of all other pendulums whatever.</p>
            <p>I would, therefore, desire him to con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sider that it is but poor eight miles from <hi>Shandy-Hall</hi> to Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> the man mid<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wife's house;—and that whilst <hi>Obadiah</hi> has been going those said miles and back,
<pb n="57" facs="58"/>
I have brought my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> from <hi>Na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mur,</hi> quite across all <hi>Flanders,</hi> into <hi>Eng<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land:</hi>—That I have had him ill upon my hands near four years;—and have since travelled him and Corporal <hi>Trim,</hi> in a chariot and four, a journey of near two hundred miles down into <hi>Yorkshire</hi>;—all which put together, must have prepared the reader's imagination for the entrance of Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> upon the stage,—as much, at least (I hope) as a dance, a song, or a concerto between the acts.</p>
            <p>If my hypercritic is intractable,—al<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledging, that two minutes and thirteen seconds are no more than two minutes and thirteen seconds,—when I have said all I can about them;—and that this plea, tho' it might save me dramatically, will damn me biographically, rendering my book, from this very moment, a pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fess'd
<pb n="58" facs="59"/>
ROMANCE, which, before, was a book apocryphal:—If I am thus pres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sed.—I then put an end to the whole objection and controversy about it all at once,—by acquainting him, that <hi>Obadiah</hi> had not got above threescore yards from the stable-yard before he met with Dr. <hi>Slop</hi>;—and indeed he gave a dirty proof that he had met with him,—and was within an ace of giving a tragical one too.</p>
            <p>Imagine to yourself;—but this had better begin a new chapter.</p>

         <div n="9" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
            <p>IMagine to yourself a little, squat, un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>courtly figure of a Doctor <hi>Slop,</hi> of about four feet and a half perpendicular
<pb n="59" facs="60"/>
height, with a breadth of back, and a sesquipedality of belly, which might have done honour to a serjeant in the horse-guards.</p>
            <p>Such were the out-lines of Dr. <hi>Slop</hi>'s figure, which,—if you have read <hi>Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>garth</hi>'s analysis of beauty, and if you have not, I wish you would;—you must know, may as certainly be caracatur'd, and con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vey'd to the mind by three strokes as three hundred.</p>
            <p>Imagine such a one,—for such, I say, were the out-lines of Dr. <hi>Slop</hi>'s figure, coming slowly along, foot by foot, wad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dling thro' the dirt upon the vertebrae of a little diminutive pony,—of a pretty colour;—but of strength,—alack!—scarce able to have made an amble of it, under such a fardel, had the roads been
<pb n="60" facs="61"/>
in an ambling condition.—They were not.—Imagine to yourself, <hi>Obadiah</hi> mounted upon a strong monster of a coach-horse, prick'd into a full gallop, and making all practicable speed the ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verse way.</p>
            <p>Pray, Sir, let me interest you a mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment in this description.</p>
            <p>Had Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> beheld <hi>Obadiah</hi> a mile off, posting in a narrow lane directly to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards him, at that monstrous rate,—splashing and plunging like a devil thro' thick and thin, as he approach'd, would not such a phaenomenon, with such a vor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tex of mud and water moving along with it, round its axis,—have been a subject of juster apprehension to Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> in his situation, than the <hi>worst</hi> of <hi>Whiston</hi>'s co<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mets?—To say nothing of the NUCLEUS;
<pb n="61" facs="62"/>
that is, of <hi>Obadiah</hi> and the coach-horse.—In my idea, the vortex alone of 'em was enough to have involved and carried, if not the doctor, at least the doctor's pony quite away with it. What then do you think must the terror and hydrophobia of Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> have been, when you read (which you are just going to do) that he was advancing thus warily along towards <hi>Shandy-Hall,</hi> and had ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>proach'd to within sixty yards of it, and within five yards of a sudden turn, made by an acute angle of the garden wall,—and in the dirtiest part of a dirty lane,—when <hi>Obadiah</hi> and his coach-horse turn'd the corner, rapid, furious,—pop,—full upon him!—Nothing, I think, in nature, can be supposed more terrible, than such a Rencounter,—so imprompt! so ill prepared to stand the shock of it as Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> was!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="63"/>
What could Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> do?—He cross'd himself ✚ —Pugh!—but the doctor, Sir, was a Papist.—No matter; he had better have kept hold of the pummel. He had so;—nay, as it happened, he had better have done nothing at all;—for in crossing himself he let go his whip,—and in attempting to save his whip be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>twixt his knee and his saddle's skirt, as it slipp'd, he lost his stirrup,—in losing which, he lost his seat;—and in the multitude of all these losses (which, by the bye, shews what little advantage there is in crossing) the unfortunate doc<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tor lost his presence of mind. So that, without waiting for <hi>Obadiah</hi>'s onset, he left his pony to its destiny, tumbling off it diagonally, something in the stile and manner of a pack of wool, and without any other consequence from the fall, save that of being left (as it would have been)
<pb n="63" facs="64"/>
with the broadest part of him sunk about twelve inches deep in the mire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obadiah</hi> pull'd off his cap twice to Dr. <hi>Slop</hi>;—once as he was falling,—and then again when he saw him seated.—Ill<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timed complaisance!—had not the fel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>low better have stopp'd his horse, and got off and help'd him?—Sir, he did all that his situation would allow;—but the MOMENTUM of the coach-horse was so great, that <hi>Obadiah</hi> could not do it all at once;—he rode in a circle three times round Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> before he could fully ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>complish it any how;—and at the last, when he did stop his beast, 'twas done with such an explosion of mud, that <hi>Oba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diah</hi> had better have been a league off. In short, never was a Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> so beluted, and so transubstantiated, since that affair came into fashion.</p>

            <p>WHEN Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> entered the back-parlour, where my father and my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> were discoursing upon the na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture of women,—it was hard to deter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mine whether Dr. <hi>Slop</hi>'s figure, or Dr. <hi>Slop</hi>'s presence, occasioned more surprize to them; for as the accident happened so near the house, as not to make it worth while for <hi>Obadiah</hi> to remou<gap resp="#oxf" extent="2 letters" rend="content:••">
                  <desc>illegible</desc>
               </gap> him,—<hi>Obadiah</hi> had led him in as he was, <hi>un<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wiped, unappointed, unanealed,</hi> with all his stains and blotches on him.—He stood like <hi>Hamlet</hi>'s ghost, motionless and speechless, for a full minute and a half, at the parlour door (<hi>Obadiah</hi> still hold<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing his hand) with all the majesty of mud. His hinder parts, upon which he had re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ceived his fall, totally besmear'd,—and
<pb n="65" facs="66"/>
in every other part of him, blotched over in such a manner with <hi>Obadiah</hi>'s explo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sion, that you would have sworn (with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out mental reservation) that every grain of it had taken effect.</p>
            <p>Here was a fair opportunity for my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> to have triumph'd over my father in his turn;—for no mortal, who had beheld Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> in that pickle, could have dissented from so much, at least, of my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s opinion, "That may-hap his sister might not care to let such a Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> come so near her * * * *" But it was the <hi>Argu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mentum ad hominem</hi>; and if my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> was not very expert at it, you may think, he might not care to use it.—No; the reason was,—'twas not his na<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture to insult.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="67"/>
Dr. <hi>Slop</hi>'s presence, at that time, was no less problematical than the mode of it; tho', it is certain, one moment's re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>flection in my father might have solved it; for he had apprized Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> but the week before, that my mother was at her full reckoning; and as the doctor had heard nothing since, 'twas natural and very political too in him, to have taken a ride to <hi>Shandy-Hall,</hi> as he did, merely to see how matters went on.</p>
            <p>But my father's mind took unfortu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nately a wrong turn in the investigation; running, like the hypercritic's, altogether upon the ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door,—measuring their di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stance,—and keeping his mind so intent upon the operation, as to have power to think of nothing else,—common-place infirmity of the greatest mathematicians!
<pb n="67" facs="68"/>
working with might and main at the de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monstration, and so wasting all their strength upon it, that they have none left in them to draw the corollary, to do good with.</p>
            <p>The ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door, struck likewise strong upon the sensorium of my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—but it excited a very different train of thoughts;—the two irreconcileable pul<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sations instantly brought <hi>Stevinus,</hi> the great engineer, along with them, into my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s mind:—What business <hi>Stevinus</hi> had in this affair,—is the greatest problem of all;—it shall be solved,—but not in the next chapter.</p>

            <p>WRiting, when properly managed, (as you may be sure I think mine is) is but a different name for conversa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion: As no one, who knows what he is about in good company, would venture to talk all;—so no author, who under<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stands the just boundaries of decorum and good breeding, would presume to think all: The truest respect which you can pay to the reader's understanding, is to halve this matter amicably, and leave him something to imagine, in his turn, as well as yourself.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I am eternally pay<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing him compliments of this kind, and do all that lies in my power to keep his imagination as busy as my own.</p>
            <p>

'Tis his turn now;—I have given an ample description of Dr. <hi>Slop</hi>'s sad over<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>throw, and of his sad appearance in the back parlour;—his imagination must now go on with it for a while.</p>
            <p>Let the reader imagine then, that Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> has told his tale;—and in what words, and with what aggravations his fancy chooses:—Let him suppose, that <hi>Obadiah</hi> has told his tale also, and with such rueful looks of affected concern, as he thinks will best contrast the two figures as they stand by each other:—Let him imagine, that my father has stepp'd up stairs to see my mother:—And, to conclude this work of imagina<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion,—let him imagine the doctor wash'd,—rubb'd down,—condoled with,—felicitated,—got into a pair of <hi>Obadiah</hi>'s pumps, stepping forwards towards the

door, upon the very point of entring upon action.</p>
            <p>Truce!—truce, good Dr. <hi>Slop!</hi>—stay thy obstetric hand;—return it safe into thy bosom to keep it warm;—little dost thou know what obstacles;—little dost thou think what hidden causes retard its operation!—Hast thou, Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi>—hast thou been intrusted with the secret ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticles of this solemn treaty which has brought thee into this place?—Art thou aware that, at this instant, a daughter of <hi>Lucina</hi> is put obstetrically over thy head? Alas!

at this moment they are hanging up in a green bays bag, betwixt thy two pistols, at thy bed's head!—Ring;—call;—send <hi>Obadiah</hi> back upon the coach-horse to bring them with all speed.</p>
            <p>—Make great haste, <hi>Obadiah,</hi> quoth my father, and I'll give thee a crown;—and, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> I'll give him another.</p>

            <p>YOUR sudden and unexpected ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rival, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dressing himself to Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> (all three of them sitting down to the fire together, as my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> began to speak)—in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stantly brought the great <hi>Stevinus</hi> into my head, who, you must know, is a fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vourite

author with me.—Then, added my father, making use of the ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gument <hi>Ad Crumenam,</hi>—I will lay twenty guineas to a single crown piece, (which will serve to give away to <hi>Oba<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>diah</hi> when he gets back) that this same <hi>Stevinus</hi> was some engineer or other,—or has wrote something or other, either directly or indirectly, upon the science of fortification.</p>
            <p>He has so,—replied my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>—I knew it, said my father;—tho', for the soul of me, I cannot see what kind of connection there can be betwixt Dr. <hi>Slop</hi>'s sudden coming, and a discourse upon fortification;—yet I fear'd it.—Talk of what we will, brother,—or let the occasion be never so foreign or unfit for the subject,—you are sure to bring it in: I would not, brother <hi>Toby,</hi> con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tinued
<pb n="73" facs="74"/>
my father,—I declare I would not have my head so full of curtins and horn-works.—That, I dare say, you would not, quoth Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> interrupting him, and laughing most immoderately at his pun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dennis</hi> the critic could not detest and abhor a pun, or the insinuation of a pun, more cordially than my father;—he would grow testy upon it at any time;—but to be broke in upon by one, in a serious discourse, was as bad, he would say, as a fillip upon the nose;—he saw no difference.</p>
            <p>Sir, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> addressing himself to Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi>—the curtins my brother <hi>Shandy</hi> mentions here, have no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing to do with bed-steads;—tho', I know, <hi>Du Cange</hi> says, "That bed-cur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tains,
<pb n="74" facs="75"/>
in all probability, have taken their name from them;"—nor have the horn-works, he speaks of, any thing in the world to do with the horn-works of cuckoldom:—But the <hi>curtin,</hi> Sir, is the word we use in fortification, for that part of the wall or rampart which lies between the two bastions and joins them.—Be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>siegers seldom offer to carry on their at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tacks directly against the curtin, for this reason, because they are so well <hi>flanked.</hi> ('Tis the case of other curtins, quoth Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> laughing). However, continued my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> to make them sure, we ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nerally choose to place ravelins before them, taking care only to extend them beyond the fossé or ditch:—The com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon men, who know very little of for<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tification, confound the ravelin and the half-moon together,—tho' they are very different things;—not in their figure or
<pb n="75" facs="76"/>
construction, for we make them exactly aliks in all points;—for they always con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sist of two faces, making a salient angle, with the gorges, not straight, but in form of a crescent.—Where then lies the difference? (quoth my father, a little testily.)—In their situations, answered my uncle <hi>Toby:</hi>—For when a ravelin, bro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, stands before the curtin, it is a ra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>velin; and when a ravelin stands before a bastion, then the ravelin is not a rave<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lin;—it is a half-moon;—a half-moon likewise is a half-moon, and no more, so long as it stands before its bastion;—but was it to change place, and get before the curtin,—'twould be no longer a half-moon; a half-moon, in that case, is not a half-moon;—'tis no more than a rave<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lin.—I think, quoth my father, that the noble science of defence has its weak sides,—as well as others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="77"/>
—As for the horn-works (high! ho! sigh'd my father) which, continued my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> my brother was speaking of, they are a very considerable part of an outwork;—they are called by the <hi>French</hi> engineers, <hi>Ouvrage à corne,</hi> and we gene<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rally make them to cover such places as we suspect to be weaker than the rest;—'tis form'd by two epaulments or demi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>bastions,—they are very pretty, and if you will take a walk, I'll engage to shew you one well worth your trouble.—I own, continued my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> when we crown them,—they are much stronger, but then they are very expensive, and take up a great deal of ground; so that, in my opinion, they are most of use to cover or defend the head of a camp; otherwise the double tenaille—By the mother who bore us!—brother

               <hi>Toby,</hi> quoth my father, not able to hold out any longer,—you would provoke a saint;—here have you got us, I know not how, not only souse into the middle of the old subject again:—But so full is your head of these confounded works, that tho' my wife is this moment in the pains of labour,—and you hear her cry out,—yet nothing will serve you but to carry off the man-midwife.—<hi>Accoucheur,</hi>—if you please, quoth Dr. <hi>Slop.</hi>—With all my heart, replied my father, I don't care what they call you,—but I wish the whole science of fortification, with all its inventors, at the devil;—it has been the death of thousands,—and it will be mine, in the end.—I would not, I would not, brother <hi>Toby,</hi> have my brains so full of saps, mines, blinds, gabions, palisadoes, ravelins, half-moons, and such trum<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pery,

to be proprietor of <hi>Namur,</hi> and of all the towns in <hi>Flanders</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>My uncle <hi>Toby</hi> was a man patient of injuries;—not from want of courage,—I have told you in the fifth chapter of this second book, "That he was a man of courage:"—And will add here, that where just occasions presented, or called it forth,—I know no man under whose arm I would sooner have taken shelter; nor did this arise from any insensibility or obtuseness of his intellectual parts;—for he felt this insult of my father's as feelingly as a man could do;—but he was of a peaceful, placid nature,—no jarring element in it,—all was mix'd up so kindly within him; my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> had scarce a heart to retaliate upon a fly.</p>

—Go—says he, one day at dinner, to an over-grown one which had buzz'd about his nose, and tormented him cruel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly all dinner-time,—and which, after in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>finite attempts, he had caught at last, as it flew by him;—I'll not hurt thee, says my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> rising from his chair, and going a-cross the room, with the fly in his hand,—I'll not hurt a hair of thy head:—Go, says he, lifting up the sash, and opening his hand as he spoke, to let it escape;—go poor devil, get thee gone, why should I hurt thee?—This world surely is wide enough to hold both thee and me.</p>
            <p>I was but ten years old when this hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pened;—but whether it was, that the action itself was more in unison to my nerves at that age of pity, which instant<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly set my whole frame into one vibration

of most pleasurable sensation;—or how far the manner and expression of it might go towards it;—or in what degree, or by what secret magic,—a tone of voice and harmony of movement, attuned by mercy, might find a passage to my heart, I know not;—this I know, that the lesson of universal good-will then taught and imprinted by my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> has never since been worn out of my mind: And tho' I would not depreciate what the study of the <hi>Literae humaniores,</hi> at the university, have done for me in that respect, or dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>credit the other helps of an expensive edu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cation bestowed upon me, both at home and abroad since;—yet I often think that I owe one half of my philanthropy to that one accidental impression.</p>

I could not give the reader this stroke in my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s picture, by the instru<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment with which I drew the other parts of it,—that taking in no more than the mere HOBBY-HORSICAL likeness;—this is a part of his moral character. My father, in this patient endurance of wrongs, which I mention, was very dif<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ferent, as the reader must long ago have noted; he had a much more acute and quick sensibility of nature, attended with a little soreness of temper; tho' this never transported him to any thing which looked like malignancy;—yet, in the little rubs and vexations of life, 'twas apt to shew itself in a drollish and witty kind of peevishness:—He was, how<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever, frank and generous in his nature;—at all times open to conviction; and in the little ebullitions of this sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>acid humour towards others, but parti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cularly

towards my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> whom he truly loved;—he would feel more pain, ten times told (except in the af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fair of my aunt <hi>Dinah,</hi> or where an hy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pothesis was concerned) than what he ever gave.</p>
            <p>The characters of the two brothers, in this view of them, reflected light upon each other, and appear'd with great ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vantage in this affair which arose about <hi>Stevinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not tell the reader, if he keeps a HOBBY-HORSE,—that a man's HOBBY-HORSE is as tender a part as he has about him; and that these unprovoked strokes, at my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s could not be unfelt by him.—No;—as I said above, my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> did feel them, and very sensibly too.</p>

Pray, Sir, what said he?—How did he behave?—Oh, Sir!—it was great: For as soon as my father had done in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sulting his HOBBY-HORSE,—he turned his head, without the least emotion, from Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> to whom he was addres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sing his discourse, and look'd up into my father's face, with a countenance spread over with so much good nature;—so placid;—so fraternal;—so inexpressibly tender towards him;—it penetrated my father to his heart: He rose up hastily from his chair, and seizing hold of both my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s hands as he spoke.—Brother <hi>Toby,</hi> said he,—I beg thy par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>don;—forgive, I pray thee, this rash humour which my mother gave me.—My dear, dear brother, answer'd my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> rising up by my father's help, say no more about it;—you are heartily welcome, had it been ten times as much,

brother. But 'tis ungenerous, replied, my father, to hurt any man;—a brother worse;—but to hurt a brother of such gentle manners,—so unprovoking,—and so unresenting;—'tis base:—By heaven, 'tis cowardly.—You are heartily wel<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>come, brother, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi>—had it been fifty times as much.—Besides, what have I to do, my dear <hi>Toby,</hi> cried my father, either with your amuse<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ments or your pleasures, unless it was in my power (which it is not) to increase their measure?</p>
            <p>—Brother <hi>Shandy,</hi> answer'd my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> looking wistfully in his face,—you are much mistaken in this point;—for you do increase my pleasure very much, in begetting children for the <hi>Shandy</hi> fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mily at your time of life.—But, by that, Sir, quoth Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> Mr. <hi>Shandy</hi> in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>creases

            <head>CHAP. XIV.</head>
            <p>AT the end of the last chapter, my father and my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> were left both standing, like <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> at the close of the scene making up their accounts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="87"/>
As my father spoke the three last words,—he sat down;—my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> exactly followed his example, only, that before he took his chair, he rung the bell, to order Corporal <hi>Trim,</hi> who was in waiting, to step home for <hi>Stevinus</hi>;—my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s house being no further off than the opposite side of the way.</p>
            <p>Some men would have dropp'd the subject of <hi>Stevinus</hi>;—but my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> had no resentment in his heart, and he went on with the subject, to shew my father that he had none.</p>
            <p>Your sudden appearance, Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> quoth my uncle, resuming the discourse, instantly brought <hi>Stevinus</hi> into my head. (My father, you may be sure, did not offer to lay any more wagers upon <hi>Ste<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vinus</hi>'s head)—Because, continued my
<pb n="87" facs="88"/>
uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> the celebrated sailing chariot, which belonged to Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> and was of such wonderful contrivance and velocity, as to carry half a dozen peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple thirty <hi>German</hi> miles, in I don't know how few minutes,—was invented by <hi>Stevinus,</hi> that great mathematician and engineer.</p>
            <p>You might have spared your servant the trouble, quoth Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> (as the fellow is lame) of going for <hi>Stevinus</hi>'s account of it, because, in my return from <hi>Leyden</hi> thro' the <hi>Hague,</hi> I walked as far as <hi>Schev<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ling,</hi> which is two long miles, on purpose to take a view of it.</p>
            <p>—That's nothing, replied my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> to what the learned <hi>Peireskius</hi> did, who walked a matter of five hundred miles, reckoning from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Schevling,</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="89"/>
and from <hi>Schevling</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> back again, in order to see it,—and nothing else.</p>
            <p>Some men cannot bear to be out-gone.</p>
            <p>The more fool <hi>Peireskius,</hi> replied Dr. <hi>Slop.</hi> But mark, 'twas out of no con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tempt of <hi>Peireskius</hi> at all;—but that <hi>Peireskius</hi>'s indefatigable labour in trudg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing so far on foot out of love for the sciences, reduced the exploit of Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> in that affair, to nothing;—the more fool <hi>Peireskius,</hi> said he again:—Why so?—replied my father, taking his brother's part, not only to make reparation as fast as he could for the insult he had given him, which sat still upon my father's mind;—but partly, that my father began really to interest himself in the discourse.—Why so?—said he. Why is <hi>Peireskius,</hi> or any man else, to be abused for an ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>petite
<pb n="89" facs="90"/>
for that, or any other morsel of sound knowledge? For, notwithstand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing I know nothing of the chariot in question, continued he, the inventor of it must have had a very mechanical head; and tho' I cannot guess upon what prin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciples of philosophy he has atchiev'd it;—yet certainly his machine has been constructed upon solid ones, be they what they will, or it could not have answer'd at the rate my brother mentions.</p>
            <p>It answered, replied my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> as well, if not better; for, as <hi>Peireskius</hi> elegantly expresses it, speaking of the velocity of its motion, <hi>Tam citus erat, quam erat ventus</hi>; which, unless I have forgot my Latin, is, <hi>that it was as swift as the wind itself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="91"/>
But pray, Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> quoth my father, interrupting my uncle (tho' not with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out begging pardon for it, at the same time) upon what principles was this self<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>same chariot set a-going?—Upon very pretty principles to be sure, replied Dr. <hi>Slop</hi>;—and I have often wondered, continued he, evading the question, why none of our gentry, who live upon large plains like this of ours,—(especially they whose wives are not past child-bearing) attempt nothing of this kind; for it would not only be infinitely expeditious upon sudden calls, to which the sex is subject,—if the wind only served,—but would be excellent good husbandry to make use of the winds, which cost no<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing, and which eat nothing, rather than horses, which (the devil take 'em) both cost and eat a great deal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="92"/>
For that very reason, replied my fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, "Because they cost nothing, and because they eat nothing,"—the scheme is bad;—it is the consumption of our products, as well as the manufactures of them, which gives bread to the hungry, circulates trade,—brings in money, and supports the value of our lands;—and tho', I own, if I was a prince, I would generously recompense the scientific head which brought forth such contrivances;—yet I would as peremptorily suppress the use of them.</p>
            <p>My father here had got into his ele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment,—and was going on as pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sperously with his dissertation upon trade, as my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> had before, upon his of fortification;—but, to the loss of much sound knowledge, the destinies in the morning had decreed that no
<pb n="92" facs="93"/>
dissertation of any kind should be spun by my father that day;—for as he opened his mouth to begin the next sentence,</p>

            <p>—You may take the book home again, <hi>Trim,</hi> said my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> nodding to him.</p>
            <p>But pri'thee, Corporal, quoth my fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, drolling,—look first into it, and see if thou canst spy aught of a sailing chariot in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="94"/>
Corporal <hi>Trim,</hi> by being in the service, had learned to obey,—and not to re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>monstrate;—so taking the book to a side-table, and running over the leaves; an' please your Honour, said <hi>Trim,</hi> I can see no such thing;—however, continued the Corporal, drolling a little in his turn, I'll make sure work of it, an' please your Honour;—so taking hold of the two covers of the book, one in each hand, and letting the leaves fall down, as he bent the covers back, he gave the book a good sound shake.</p>
            <p>There is something fallen out, how<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever, said <hi>Trim,</hi> an' please your Honour; but it is not a chariot, or any thing like one:—Pri'thee Corporal, said my father, smiling, what is it then?—I think, an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swered <hi>Trim,</hi> stooping to take it up,—'tis more like a sermon,—for it begins,
<pb n="94" facs="95"/>
with a text of scripture, and the chapter and verse;—and then goes on, not as a chariot,—but like a sermon directly.</p>
            <p>The company smiled.</p>
            <p>I cannot conceive how it is possible, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> for such a thing as a sermon to have got into my <hi>Stevinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think 'tis a sermon, replied <hi>Trim</hi>;—but if it please your Honours, as it is a fair hand, I will read you a page;—for <hi>Trim,</hi> you must know, loved to hear himself read almost as well as talk.</p>
            <p>I have ever a strong propensity, said my father, to look into things which cross my way, by such strange fatalities as these;—and as we have nothing bet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter to do, at least till <hi>Obadiah</hi> gets back,
<pb n="95" facs="96"/>
I should be obliged to you, brother, if Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> has no objection to it, to order the Corporal to give us a page or two of it,—if he is as able to do it, as he seems willing. An' please your Honour, quoth <hi>Trim,</hi> I officiated two whole campaigns in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as clerk to the chaplain of the regiment.—He can read it, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> as well as I can.—<hi>Trim,</hi> I assure you, was the best scholar in my company, and should have had the next halberd, but for the poor fellow's mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fortune. Corporal <hi>Trim</hi> laid his hand upon his heart, and made an humble bow to his master;—then laying down his hat upon the floor, and taking up the sermon in his left-hand, in order to have his right at liberty,—he advanced, nothing doubting, into the middle of the room, where he could best see, and be best seen by, his audience.</p>

            <p>—If you have any objection,—said my father, addressing himself to Dr. <hi>Slop.</hi> Not in the least, replied Dr. <hi>Slop</hi>;—for it does not appear on which side of the question it is wrote;—it may be a composition of a divine of our church, as well as yours,—so that we run equal risks.—'Tis wrote upon neither side, quoth <hi>Trim,</hi> for 'tis only upon <hi>Conscience,</hi> an' please your Honours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trim</hi>'s reason put his audience into good humour,—all but Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> who, turning his head about towards <hi>Trim,</hi> look'd a little angry.</p>
            <p>Begin, <hi>Trim,</hi>—and read distinctly, quoth my father;—I will, an' please your

            <head>CHAP. XVII.</head>
            <p>—But before the Corporal begins, I must first give you a description of his attitude;—otherwise he will naturally stand represented, by your imagination, in an uneasy posture,—stiff,—perpendi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cular,—dividing the weight of his body equally upon both legs;—his eye fix'd, as if on duty;—his look determined,—clinching the sermon in his left-hand, like his firelock:—In a word, you would be apt to paint <hi>Trim,</hi> as if he was stand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing in his platoon ready for action:—His attitude was as unlike all this as you can conceive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="99"/>
He stood before them with his body swayed, and bent forwards just so far, as to make an angle of 85 degrees and a half upon the plain of the horizon;—which sound orators, to whom I address this, know very well, to be the true per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>suasive angle of incidence;—in any other angle you may talk and preach;—'tis certain,—and it is done every day;—but with what effect,—I leave the world to judge!</p>
            <p>The necessity of this precise angle of 85 degrees and a half to a mathematical exactness,—does it not shew us, by the way,—how the arts and sciences mutu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ally befriend each other?</p>
            <p>How the duce Corporal <hi>Trim,</hi> who knew not so much as an acute angle from an obtuse one, came to hit it so ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>actly;
<pb n="99" facs="100"/>
—or whether it was chance or nature, or good sense or imitation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall be commented upon in that part of this cyclopaedia of arts and sciences, where the instrumental parts of the elo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>quence of the senate, the pulpit, the bar, the coffee-house, the bed-chamber, and fire-side, fall under consideration.</p>
            <p>He stood,—for I repeat it, to take the picture of him in at one view, with his body sway'd, and somewhat bent forwards,—his right-leg firm under him, sustaining seven-eighths of his whole weight,—the foot of his left-leg, the de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fect of which was no disadvantage to his attitude, advanced a little,—not lateral<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly, nor forwards, but in a line betwixt them;—his knee bent, but that not vio<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lently,—but so as to fall within the li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mits of the line of beauty;—and I add,
<pb n="100" facs="101"/>
of the line of science too;—for consider, it had one eighth part of his body to bear up;—so that in this case the posi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of the leg is determined,—because the foot could be no further advanced, or the knee more bent, than what would allow him mechanically, to receive an eighth part of his whole weight under it,—and to carry it too.</p>
            <p>☞ This I recommend to painters?—need I add,—to orators?—I think not; for, unless they practise it,—they must fall upon their noses.</p>
            <p>So much for Corporal <hi>Trim</hi>'s body and legs.—He held the sermon loosely,—not carelessly, in his left-hand, raised some<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thing above his stomach, and detach'd a little from his breast;—his right-arm falling negligently by his side, as nature
<pb n="101" facs="102"/>
and the laws of gravity ordered it,—but with the palm of it open and turned to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards his audience, ready to aid the sen<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>timent, in case it stood in need.</p>
            <p>Corporal <hi>Trim</hi>'s eyes and the muscles of his face were in full harmony with the other parts of him;—he look'd frank,—unconstrained,—something assured,—but not bordering upon assurance.</p>
            <p>Let not the critic ask how Corporal <hi>Trim</hi> could come by all this; I've told him it shall be explained;—but so he stood before my father, my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi>—so swayed his body, so contrasted his limbs, and with such an oratorical sweep throughout the whole figure,—a statuary might have modell'd from it;—nay, I doubt whether the oldest Fellow of a College,—or the <hi>He<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>brew</hi>

But from whence, replied my father, have you concluded so soon, Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> that the writer is of our Church?—for aught I can see yet,—he may be of any Church:—Because, answered Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> if he was of ours.—he durst no more take such a licence,—than a bear by his beard:—If, in our communion, Sir, a man was to insult an Apostle,—a saint,—or even the paring of a saint's nail,—he would have his eyes scratched out.—What, by the saint, quoth my

God help him then, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi> Amen, added <hi>Trim</hi>; for, heaven above knows, I have a poor brother who has been fourteen years a captive in it.—I never heard one word of it before, said

my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> hastily:—How came he there, <hi>Trim?</hi>—O, Sir! the story will make your heart bleed,—as it has made mine a thousand times;—but it is too long to be told now;—your Honour shall hear it from first to last some day when I am working beside you in our fortifications;—but the short of the story is this:—That my brother <hi>Tom</hi> went over a servant to <hi>Lisbon,</hi>—and then married a <hi>Jew</hi>'s widow, who kept a small shop, and sold sausages, which, some how or other, was the cause of his being taken in the middle of the night out of his bed, where he was lying with his wife and two small children, and carried di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rectly to the Inquisition, where, God help him, continued <hi>Trim,</hi> fetching a sigh from the bottom of his heart,—the poor ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nest lad lies confined at this hour;—he was as honest a soul, added <hi>Trim,</hi>

            <p>I think, answer'd the Corporal, that the seven watch-men upon the tower, who, I suppose, are all centinels there,—are more, an' please your Honour, than were necessary;—and, to go on at that rate, would harrass a regiment all to pieces, which a commanding officer, who loves his men, will never do, if he can help it; because two centinels, added the Corporal, are as good as twenty.—I have been a commanding officer myself in the <hi>Corps de Garde</hi> a hundred times, continued <hi>Trim,</hi> rising an inch higher in his figure, as he spoke,—and all the time I had the ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nour to serve his Majesty King <hi>William,</hi> in relieving the most considerable posts, I never left more than two in my life.—

they lose in the field.—'Twere a pity, quoth my uncle, that this should be lost.

be?—How could it get into my <hi>Stevi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nus?</hi> A man must be as great a conjurer as <hi>Stevinus,</hi> said my father, to resolve the second question:—The first, I think, is not so difficult;—for unless my judg<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ment greatly deceives me,—I know the author, for 'tis wrote, certainly, by the parson of the parish.</p>
            <p>The similitude of the stile and man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ner of it, with those my father con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stantly had heard preach'd in his pa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rish-church, was the ground of his con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jecture,—proving it as strongly, as an argument <hi>à priori,</hi> could prove such a thing to a philosophic mind, That it was <hi>Yorick</hi>'s and no one's else:—It was proved to be so <hi>à posteriori,</hi> the day after, when <hi>Yorick</hi> sent a ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vant to my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s house to enquire after it.</p>

            <p>Can the reader believe, that this ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon of <hi>Yorick</hi>'s was preach'd at an assize, in the cathedral of <hi>York,</hi> before a thou<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sand witnesses, ready to give oath of it, by a certain prebendary of that church, and actually printed by him when he had done,—and within so short a space as two years and three months after <hi>Yorick</hi>'s death.—<hi>Yorick,</hi> indeed, was never better served in his life!—but it was a little hard to male-treat him after, and plun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>der him after he was laid in his grave.</p>
            <p>However, as the gentleman who did it, was in perfect charity with <hi>Yorick,</hi>—and, in conscious justice, printed but a
<pb n="155" facs="156"/>
few copies to give away;—and that, I am told, he could moreover have made as good a one himself, had he thought fit,—I declare I would not have published this anecdote to the world;—nor do I publish it with an intent to hurt his cha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>racter and advancement in the church;—I leave that to others;—but I find my<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self impelled by two reasons, which I cannot withstand.</p>
            <p>The first is, That, in doing justice, I may give rest to <hi>Yorick</hi>'s ghost;—which, as the country people,—and some others, believe,—<hi>still walks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second reason is, That, by laying open this story to the world, I gain an opportunity of informing it,—That in case the character of parson <hi>Yorick,</hi> and this sample of his sermons is liked,—that
<pb n="156" facs="157"/>
there are now in the possession of the <hi>Shandy</hi> family, as many as will make a handsome volume, at the world's ser<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vice,—and much good may they do it.</p>

            <p>OBADIAH gain'd the two crowns without dispute; for he came in jingling, with all the instruments in the green bays bag we spoke of, slung across his body, just as Corporal <hi>Trim</hi> went out of the room.</p>
            <p>It is now proper, I think, quoth Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> (clearing up his looks) as we are in a condition to be of some service to Mrs. <hi>Shandy,</hi> to send up stairs to know how she goes on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="158"/>
I have ordered, answered my father, the old midwife to come down to us upon the least difficulty;—for you must know, Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> continued my fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther, with a perplexed kind of a smile upon his countenance, that by express treaty, solemnly ratified between me and my wife, you are no more than an auxi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liary in this affair,—and not so much as that,—unless the lean old mother of a midwife above stairs cannot do without you.—Women have their particular fancies, and in points of this nature, continued my father, where they bear the whole burden, and suffer so much acute pain for the advantage of our families, and the good of the spe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cies,—they claim a right of deciding, <hi>en Soveraines,</hi> in whose hands, and in what fashion, they chuse to undergo it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="159"/>
They are in the right of it,—quoth my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi> But, Sir, replied Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> not taking notice of my uncle <hi>Toby</hi>'s opinion, but turning to my father,—they had better govern in other points;—and a father of a family, who wished its per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>petuity, in my opinion, had better ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>change this prerogative with them, and give up some other rights in lieu of it.—I know not, quoth my father, answering a little too testily, to be quite dispassion<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ate in what he said,—I know not, quoth he, what we have left to give up, in lieu of who shall bring our children into the world,—unless that,—of who shall beget them.—One would almost give up any thing, replied Dr. <hi>Slop.</hi>—I beg your pardon,—answered my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>—Sir, replied Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> it would asto<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nish you to know what Improvements we have made of late years in all branches
<pb n="159" facs="160"/>
of obstetrical knowledge, but particu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>larly in that one single point of the safe and expeditious extraction of the <hi>foetus,</hi>—which has received such lights, that, for my part (holding up his hands) I declare I wonder how the world has—I wish, quoth my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> you had seen what prodigious armies we had in <hi>Flanders.</hi>

            <p>I Have dropp'd the curtain over this scene for a minute,—to remind you of one thing,—and to inform you of an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>other.</p>
            <p>What I have to inform you, comes, I own, a little out of its due course;—for it should have been told a hundred and
<pb n="160" facs="161"/>
fifty pages ago, but that I foresaw then 'twould come in pat hereafter, and be of more advantage here than elsewhere.—Writers had need look before them to keep up the spirit and connection of what they have in hand.</p>
            <p>When these two things are done,—the curtain shall be drawn up again, and my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> my father, and Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> shall go on with their discourse, without any more interruption.</p>
            <p>First, then, the matter which I have to remind you of, is this;—that from the specimens of singularity in my father's notions in the point of Christian-names, and that other point previous thereto,—you was led, I think, into an opinion, (and I am sure I said as much) that my father was a gentleman altogether as odd
<pb n="161" facs="162"/>
and whimsical in fifty other opinions. In truth, there was not a stage in the life of man, from the very first act of his be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>getting,—down to the lean and slipper'd pantaloon in his second childishness, but he had some favourite notion to himself, springing out of it, as sceptical, and as far out of the high-way of thinking, as these two which have been explained.</p>
            <p>—Mr. <hi>Shandy,</hi> my father, Sir, would see nothing in the light in which others placed it;—he placed things in his own light;—he would weigh nothing in com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mon scales;—no,—he was too refined a researcher to lay open to so gross an im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>position.—To come at the exact weight of things in the scientific steel-yard, the fulcrum, he would say, should be almost invisible, to avoid all friction from po<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pular tenets;—without this the minutiae
<pb n="162" facs="163"/>
of philosophy, which should always turn the balance, will have no weight at all.—Knowledge, like matter, he would affirm, was divisible <hi>in infinitum</hi>;—that the grains and scruples were as much a part of it, as the gravitation of the whole world.—In a word, he would say, error was error,—no matter where it fell,—whether in a fraction,—or a pound,—'twas alike fatal to truth, and she was kept down at the bottom of her well as inevitably by a mistake in the dust of a butterfly's wing,—as in the disk of the sun, the moon, and all the stars of heaven put together.</p>
            <p>He would often lament that it was for want of considering this properly, and of applying it skilfully to civil matters, as well as to speculative truths, that so many things in this world were out of joint;—that the political arch was giving way;—
<pb n="163" facs="164"/>
and that the very foundations of our ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cellent constitution in church and state, were so sapp'd as estimators had reported.</p>
            <p>You cry out, he would say, we are a ruined, undone people.—Why? he would ask, making use of the sorites or fyllogism of <hi>Zeno</hi> and <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> without knowing it belonged to them.—Why? why are we a ruined people?—Because we are corrup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ted.—Whence is it, dear Sir, that we are corrupted?—Because we are needy;—our poverty, and not our wills, consent.—And wherefore, he would add,—are we needy?—From the neglect, he would an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>swer, of our pence and our halfpence:—Our bank-notes, Sir, our guineas,—nay our shillings, take care of themselves.</p>
            <p>'Tis the same, he would say, through<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>out the whole circle of the sciences;—
<pb n="164" facs="165"/>
the great, the established points of them, are not to be broke in upon.—The laws of nature will defend themselves;—but error—(he would add, looking earnestly at my mother)—error, Sir, creeps in thro' the minute holes, and small crevices, which human nature leaves unguarded.</p>
            <p>This turn of thinking in my father, is what I had to remind you of:—The point you are to be informed of, and which I have reserved for this place, is as follows:</p>
            <p>Amongst the many and excellent rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sons, with which my father had urged my mother to accept of Dr. <hi>Slop</hi>'s as<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sistance preferably to that of the old wo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man,—there was one of a very singular nature; which, when he had done ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guing the matter with her as a Christian, and came to argue it over again with her
<pb n="165" facs="166"/>
as a philosopher, he had put his whole strength to, depending indeed upon it as his sheet anchor.—It failed him; tho' from no defect in the argument itself; but that, do what he could, he was not able for his soul to make her comprehend the drift of it.—Cursed luck!—said he to himself, one afternoon, as he walk'd out of the room, after he had been sta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ting it for an hour and a half to her, to no manner of purpose;—cursed luck! said he, biting his lip as he shut the door,—for a man to be master of one of the finest chains of reasoning in nature,—and have a wife at the same time with such a head-piece, that he cannot hang up a single inference within side of it, to save his soul from destruction.</p>
            <p>This argument, tho' it was intirely lost upon my mother,—had more weight with
<pb n="166" facs="167"/>
him, than all his other arguments joined together:—I will therefore endeavour to do it justice,—and set it forth with all the perspicuity I am master of.</p>
            <p>My father set out upon the strength of these two following axioms:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That an ounce of a man's own wit, was worth a tun of other peoples; and,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> (Which, by the bye, was the ground-work of the first axiom,—tho' it comes last) That every man's wit must come from every man's own soul,—and no other body's.</p>
            <p>Now, as it was plain to my father, that all souls were by nature equal,—and that the great difference between the most acute and the most obtuse understanding,
<pb n="167" facs="168"/>
—was from no original sharpness or bluntness of one thinking substance above or below another,—but arose merely from the lucky or unlucky organization of the body, in that part where the soul princi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pally took up her residence,—he had made it the subject of his enquiry to find out the identical place.</p>
            <p>Now, from the best accounts he had been able to get of this matter, he was satisfied it could not be where <hi>Des Cartes</hi> had fixed it, upon the top of the <hi>pineal</hi> gland of the brain; which, as he philo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sophised, formed a cushion for her about the size of a marrow pea; tho' to speak the truth, as so many nerves did terminate all in that one place,—'twas no bad con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jecture;—and my father had certainly fallen with that great philosopher plumb into the center of the mistake, had it not
<pb n="168" facs="169"/>
been for my uncle <hi>Toby,</hi> who rescued him out of it, by a story he told him of a <hi>Walloon</hi> officer at the battle of <hi>Landen,</hi> who had one part of his brain shot away by a musket-ball,—and another part of it taken out after by a <hi>French</hi> surgeon; and, after all, recovered, and did his duty very well without it.</p>
            <p>If death, said my father, reasoning with himself, is nothing but the separation of the soul from the body;—and if it is true that people can walk about and do their business without brains,—then certes the soul does not inhabit there. Q. E. D.</p>
            <p>As for that certain, very thin, subtle, and very fragrant juice which <hi>Coglionissimo Borri,</hi> the great <hi>Milaneze</hi> physician, af<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>firms, in a letter to <hi>Bartholine,</hi> to have dis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>covered in the cellulae of the occipital parts
<pb n="169" facs="170"/>
of the cerebellum, and which he likewise affirms to be the principal seat of the rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sonable soul (for, you must know, in these latter and more enlightened ages, there are two souls in every man living,—the one, according to the great <hi>Metheglingius,</hi> being called the <hi>Animus,</hi> the other the <hi>Anima</hi>);—as for this opinion, I say, of <hi>Borri,</hi>—my father could never subscribe to it by any means; the very idea of so noble, so refined, so immaterial, and so ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>alted a being as the <hi>Anima,</hi> or even the <hi>Ani<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mus,</hi> taking up her residence, and sitting dabbling, like a tad-pole, all day long, both summer and winter, in a puddle,—or in a liquid of any kind, how thick or thin soever, he would say, shock'd his imagination; he would scarce give the doctrine a hearing.</p>
            <p>What, therefore, seem'd the least liable to objections of any, was, that the chief
<pb n="170" facs="171"/>
sensorium, or head-quarters of the soul, and to which place all intelligences were referred, and from whence all her man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dates were issued,—was in, or near, the cerebellum,—or rather some-where about the <hi>medulla oblongata,</hi> wherein it was ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nerally agreed by <hi>Dutch</hi> anatomists, that all the minute nerves from all the organs of the seven senses concentered, like streets and winding alleys, into a square.</p>
            <p>So far there was nothing singular in my father's opinion,—he had the best of philosophers, of all ages and climates, to go along with him.—But here he took a road of his own, setting up another <hi>Shan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dean</hi> hypothesis upon these corner-stones they had laid for him;—and which said hypothesis equally stood its ground; whe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther the subtilty and fineness of the soul depended upon the temperature and clear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
<pb n="171" facs="172"/>
of the said liquor, or of the finer net-work and texture in the cerebellum itself; which opinion he favoured.</p>
            <p>He maintained, that next to the due care to be taken in the act of propaga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion of each individual, which required all the thought in the world, as it laid the foundation of this incomprehensible contexture in which wit, memory, fancy, eloquence, and what is usually meant by the name of good natural parts, do con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sist;—that next to this and his Christian<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>name, which were the two original and most efficacious causes of all;—that the third cause, or rather what logicians call the <hi>Causa sine quâ non,</hi> and without which all that was done was of no manner of significance,—was the preservation of this delicate and fine-spun web, from the ha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vock which was generally made in it by
<pb n="172" facs="173"/>
the violent compression and crush which the head was made to undergo, by the nonsensical method of bringing us into the world by that part foremost.</p>
            <p>—This requires explanation.</p>
            <p>My father, who dipp'd into all kinds of books, upon looking into <hi>Lithopaedus Senonesis de Partu difficili</hi> 
               <note place="bottom" n="*">The author is here twice mistaken;—for <hi>Lithopaedus</hi> should be wrote thus, <hi>Lithopaedii Seno<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nensis Icon.</hi> The second mistake is, that this <hi>Li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thopaedus</hi> is not an author, but a drawing of a petrified child. The account of this, published by <hi>Albosius,</hi> 1580, may be seen at the end of <hi>Cordaeus</hi>'s works in <hi>Spachius.</hi> Mr. <hi>Tristram Shandy</hi> has been led into this error, either from seeing <hi>Lithopaedus</hi>'s name of late in a catalogue of lear<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ned writers in Dr. <gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 word" rend="content: _____ ">
                     <desc>blank</desc>
                  </gap>, or by mistaking <hi>Li<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thopaedus</hi> for <hi>Trinecavellius,</hi>—from the too great similitude of the names.</note>, published by
<pb n="173" facs="174"/>
               <hi>Adrianus Smelvgot,</hi> had found out, That the lax and pliable state of a child's head in parturition, the bones of the cranium having no futures at that time, was such,—that by force of the woman's efforts, which, in strong labour-pains, was equal, upon an average, to a weight of 470 pounds averdupoise acting per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pendicularly upon it;—it so happened that, in 49 instances out of 50, the said head was compressed and moulded into the shape of an oblong conical piece of dough, such as a pastry-cook generally rolls up in order to make a pye of.—Good God! cried my father, what ha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vock and destruction must this make in the infinitely fine and tender texture of the cerebellum!—Or if there is such a juice as <hi>Borri</hi> pretends,—is it not enough to make the clearest liquor in the world both feculent and mothery?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="175"/>
But how great was his apprehension, when he further understood, that this force, acting upon the very vertex of the head, not only injured the brain itself or cerebrum,—but that it necessarily squeez'd and propell'd the cerebrum to<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>wards the cerebellum, which was the im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mediate seat of the understanding.—Angels and Ministers of grace defend us! cried my father,—can any soul withstand this shock?—No wonder the intellectual web is so rent and tatter'd as we see it; and that so many of our best heads are no better than a puzzled skein of silk,—all perplexity,—all confusion within side.</p>
            <p>But when my father read on, and was let into the secret, that when a child was turn'd topsy-turvy, which was easy for an operator to do, and was extracted by the feet;—that instead of the cerebrum
<pb n="175" facs="176"/>
being propell'd towards the cerebellum, the cerebellum, on the contrary, was pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pell'd simply towards the cerebrum where it could do no manner of hurt:—By heavens! cried he, the world is in a con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spiracy to drive out what little wit God has given us,—and the professors of the obstetric art are listed into the same con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>spiracy.—What is it to me which end of my son comes foremost into the world, provided all goes right after, and his ce<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rebellum escapes uncrushed?</p>
            <p>It is the nature of an hypothesis, when once a man has conceived it, that it assi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>milates every thing to itself as proper nourishment; and, from the first moment of your begetting it, it generally grows the stronger by every thing you see, hear, read, or understand. This is of great use.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="177"/>
When my father was gone with this about a month, there was scarce a phae<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nomenon of stupidity or of genius, which he could not readily solve by it;—it ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>counted for the eldest son being the great<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>est blockhead in the family.—Poor devil, he would say,—he made way for the capa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>city of his younger brothers.—It unriddled the observation of drivellers and monstrous heads,—shewing, <hi>à priori,</hi> it could not be otherwise,—unless * * * * I don't know what. It wonderfully explain'd and ac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>counted for the acumen of the <hi>Asiatic</hi> ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nius, and that sprightlier turn, and a more penetrating intuition of minds, in warmer climates; not from the loose and common-place solution of a clearer sky, and a more perpetual sun-shine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—which, for aught he knew, might as well rarify and dilute the faculties of the soul into nothing, by one extreme,—as they
<pb n="177" facs="178"/>
are condensed in colder climates by the other;—but he traced the affair up to its spring-head;—shew'd that, in warmer climates, nature had laid a lighter tax upon the fairest parts of the creation;—their pleasures more;—the necessity of their pains less, insomuch that the pres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure and resistance upon the vertex was so slight, that the whole organization of the cerebellum was preserved;—nay, he did not believe, in natural births, that so much as a single thread of the net-work was broke or displaced,—so that the soul might just act as she liked.</p>
            <p>When my father had got so far,—what a blaze of light did the accounts of the <hi>Caesarian</hi> section, and of the towering geniuses who had come safe into the world by it, cast upon this hypothesis? Here you see, he would say, there was no injury done to the sensorium;—no pres<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sure
<pb n="178" facs="179"/>
of the head against the pelvis;—no propulsion of the cerebrum towards the cerebellum, either by the <hi>os pubis</hi> on this side, or the <hi>os coxcygis</hi> on that;—and, pray, what were the happy consequences? Why, Sir, your <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> who gave the operation a name;—and your <hi>Her<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mes Trismegistus,</hi> who was born so before ever the operation had a name;—your <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi>; your <hi>Manlius Torquatus</hi>; our <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth,—who, had he lived, would have done the same honour to the hypothesis:—These, and many more, who figur'd high in the annals of fame,—all came <hi>side-way,</hi> Sir, into the world.</p>
            <p>This incision of the <hi>abdomen</hi> and <hi>ute<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rus,</hi> ran for six weeks together in my fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther's head;—he had read, and was satis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fied, that wounds in the <hi>epigastrium,</hi> and those in the <hi>matrix,</hi> were not mortal;—so that the belly of the mother might be
<pb n="179" facs="180"/>
opened extremely well to give a passage to the child.—He mentioned the thing one afternoon to my mother,—merely as a matter of fact;—but seeing her turn as pale as ashes at the very mention of it, as much as the operation flattered his hopes,—he thought it as well to say no more of it,—contenting himself with ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>miring—what he thought was to no pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose to propose.</p>
            <p>This was my father Mr. <hi>Shandy</hi>'s hypo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>thesis; concerning which I have only to add, that my brother <hi>Bobby</hi> did as great honour to it (whatever he did to the fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mily) as any one of the great heroes we spoke of:—For happening not only to be christen'd, as I told you, but to be born too, when my father was at <hi>Epsom,</hi>—being moreover my mother's <hi>first</hi> child,—coming into the world with his head <hi>foremost,</hi>—and turning out afterwards a
<pb n="180" facs="181"/>
lad of wonderful slow parts,—my father spelt all these together into his opinion; and as he had failed at one end,—he was determined to try the other.</p>
            <p>This was not to be expected from one of the sisterhood, who are not easily to be put out of their way,—and was therefore one of my father's great reasons in favour of a man of science, whom he could bet<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter deal with.</p>
            <p>Of all men in the world, Dr. <hi>Slop</hi> was the fittest for my father's purpose;—for though his new-invented forceps was the armour he had proved, and what he maintained, to be the safest instrument of deliverance,—yet, it seems, he had scat<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tered a word or two in his book, in fa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vour of the very thing which ran in my father's fancy;—tho' not with a view to the soul's good in extracting by the feet,
<pb n="181" facs="182"/>
as was my father's system,—but for rea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sons merely obstetrical.</p>
            <p>This will account for the coalition be<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>twixt my father and Dr. <hi>Slop,</hi> in the en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>suing discourse, which went a little hard against my uncle <hi>Toby.</hi>—In what manner a plain man, with nothing but common sense, could bear up against two such allies in science,—is hard to conceive.—You may conjecture upon it, if you please,—and whilst your imagination is in mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion, you may encourage it to go on, and discover by what causes and effects in nature it could come to pass, that my uncle <hi>Toby</hi> got his modesty by the wound he received upon his groin.—You may raise a system to account for the loss of my nose by marriage articles,—and shew the world how it could happen, that I should have the misfortune to be called TRISTRAM, in opposition to my father's
