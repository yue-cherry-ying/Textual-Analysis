            <p>THOUGH the Study of His<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tory be instructive and use<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ful; yet, in one Respect, it becomes the Source of frequent Error, even when it is written with Impartiality and Truth. This ariseth from a <hi>mis<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>taken Application</hi> of <hi>historical Facts.</hi> This Error is apt to creep into all Reasonings, on every Subject, where <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> are concerned; but it is peculiarly apt to infect <hi>political</hi> Reasonings, above all others. As the political Interests of Men make
<pb n="vi" facs="4"/>
the principal Subject of History, so the political Reasoner hath Recourse to History, as the best Support of his Argument. But, though the Politi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cian is, of all others, the readiest to appeal to History, yet he seems, of all others, most liable to be mistaken in his Application of it to his own Purpose; because the political Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nexions and Interests of Men are, above all others, <hi>complicated</hi> and <hi>va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rious.</hi> Hence, as no two political Constitutions were ever <hi>the same</hi> in <hi>all</hi> their Circumstances, though <hi>simi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lar</hi> in <hi>many</hi>; so, all Arguments drawn from a <hi>partial Resemblance</hi> must be <hi>inadequate</hi> and <hi>inconclusive</hi>; unless when it appears, that no other Cir<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cumstances took Place, by which that <hi>partial Resemblance</hi> might be <hi>counteracted,</hi> and it's Effects <hi>destroy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed.</hi>
               <pb n="vii" facs="5"/>
Yet it hath been a Practice too common among political Reasoners, from a <hi>partial</hi> Resemblance between two States, to infer a <hi>total</hi> one; and, because they have been <hi>like</hi> in <hi>some</hi> Respects, to draw Conclusions, as if they had been <hi>like</hi> in <hi>all.</hi> Here, then, appears a Source of perpetual Error.</p>
            <p>Among all the political Questions that can be debated in a free Coun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>try, there is none of greater Import<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ance, than that which regards the <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Influence</hi> of the <hi>Body of a People.</hi> Nothing hath been more usual among political Reasoners, than to represent the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>every People,</hi> as the ready <hi>Tools</hi> of <hi>Demagogues</hi> and <hi>Faction:</hi> And since the endless Factions of the <hi>Athenian Republic</hi> have been so often alledged, as unanswerable Proofs
<pb n="viii" facs="6"/>
of this; the intelligent Reader will ea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sily discern, that the Tendency of the following Dialogue is, to fix this Ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gument to it's <hi>proper Limits,</hi> and prevent a too <hi>general Application</hi> of a <hi>particular Fact.</hi>

         <sp>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>I AM glad to have found you, PERICLES: Since your Conversation with COSMO, (which, you know, I overheard) I have been revolving the Subject of it in my Mind; and begin to think, you left the Matter short.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <pb n="10" facs="8"/>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>Your Sentiments on this Subject will give me Pleasure. Tell me, ARISTIDES; in what Respect do you esteem the con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clusion of our Argument to have been de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fective?</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>With Regard to yourself, I think your Conclusions were just: I grant you, <q>that by weakening the Power of the Court of the AREOPAGUS, you tore up that An<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>chor, which SOLON had fixed, to keep his Republic stedfast and firm, against the Storms of popular Faction.</q> On this Account, I farther must allow, that <q>not<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>withstanding the Integrity which you preserved in your public Conduct, and the great Virtues which you exerted, your Place in <hi>Elysium</hi> is justly below that of those, who have governed Repub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lics, or <hi>limited Monarchies,</hi> not merely with a Concern for their present Advan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tage; but with a prudent Regard to that <hi>Balance</hi> of <hi>Power,</hi> on which their <hi>per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>manent Happiness</hi> always depends.</q>
            </p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <pb n="11" facs="9"/>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>If you allow me this, it is all I contend for. What could remain farther to be ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>justed in the Debate?</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>I am of Opinion, that the Question was decided in too general a Manner: And that for Want of a little more Particularity of Argument and Proof, Conclusions might be <hi>plausibly</hi> drawn, which would be very distant from the Truth.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>Pray, explain yourself a little farther, ARISTIDES; for as yet I do not clearly comprehend you.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>What I mean is this: That Free States, or <hi>limited Monarchies,</hi> though they may greatly resemble each other in their <hi>external Construction,</hi> may yet be so very unlike in their <hi>internal Condition,</hi> that no just Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clusions
<pb n="12" facs="10"/>
could be drawn concerning their Prosperity and Welfare, merely from their <hi>external Resemblance.</hi> Thus we will sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose two States to be equally <hi>free,</hi> in their legal Constitution: But let us farther sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose, that the <hi>Manners</hi> or <hi>Principles,</hi> which prevail in these two States are widely differ<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ent; and, in that Case, I apprehend, that if you regard only the legal <hi>Form</hi> of the Constitution, without weighing the <hi>Man<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ners</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of the Members of the State, you will be in great Danger of im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posing <hi>false Conclusions</hi> on yourself and others.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>I did not force any of these Conclusions upon you. They are of your own making.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>It is true, you did not force them upon me: Yet they are not of my own making. For some of the <hi>Shades,</hi> who overheard your Conversation, have since told me, that the general Turn of your Discourse <hi>oblique<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ly led</hi> to these Conclusions; and therefore
<pb n="13" facs="11"/>
thought that it would become ARISTIDES to discuss this Point with a little more Precision.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>I am ready to hear any thing you have to say on this interesting Subject.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>You will give me leave then, to examine some things that passed in your Discourse with COSMO.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>Pray be as free with them as you please. I rely on the Candor as well as Justice of ARISTIDES.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>I will endeavour to deserve your favour<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>able Opinion. You may remember, you said <q>That by weakening the Power of the Court of AREOPAGUS, you tore up that Anchor, which SOLON had fixed, to keep his Republic stedfast and firm, against the
<pb n="14" facs="12"/>
Storms of popular Factions.</q> This, I think, was the first Foundation of your Ar<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>gument.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>It was.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>Is it a safe Practice, PERICLES, to build an Argument on a Metaphor?</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>I should think it is; provided the Meta<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>phor contain a just Image of the Fact in Question.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>That I allow: but still the Question re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mains, whether the Metaphor contain that just Image or not. So that we are not yet advanced a Step towards the Discovery of Truth.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <pb n="15" facs="13"/>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>At least it is an Illustration.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>Then, I think it had better have come after the Discovery. I believe I can give you another Metaphor which shall lead di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rectly to the contrary Conclusion. 'Tis a wise Practice, you say, to keep fixed the <hi>Anchor.</hi> In general, I grant you, it is so. Yet you know, that in Times of Tempest and Distress, the most experienced Admiral, when anchored near a rocky Shore, is forced to <hi>slip his Cables,</hi> and commit his Fleet to the <hi>wide Sea,</hi> till he can <hi>anchor</hi> on a <hi>safer Bottom.</hi>
            </p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>That is a dangerous Practice.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>True: and therefore never to be tryed, except in a Time of extreme Danger.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <pb n="16" facs="14"/>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>Well: I will grant you that a Metaphor proves nothing.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>That is the only Purpose for which I in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tended mine. We will proceed, therefore, with our Argument. And the sum of what I have to say, will only tend to the Proof of this single Point; <q>That a <hi>free State,</hi> or <hi>limited Monarchy,</hi> resembling that of <hi>Athens</hi> in it's external Form, may yet be so differently circumstanced in it's <hi>internal Condition,</hi> that a Conduct in many Respects similar to Yours, shall be the only means of <hi>saving</hi> that State from Ruin, though Your well meant Conduct led the State of <hi>Athens</hi> to it's <hi>Destruction.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>It seems to me, ARISTIDES, that you undertake a Task of no small Difficulty. Proceed: I am all Attention.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <pb n="17" facs="15"/>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>Pray tell me, PERICLES: Was the Court of the AREOPAGUS <hi>wise, courageous, uncorrupt,</hi> and bent upon the public Service in Opposi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion to all self-interested Views, when You set about to lessen it's Authority?</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>To my Confusion, I must confess it was. For in Fact; <q>The annual <hi>Magistrates,</hi> the <hi>Guardians</hi> of the <hi>Laws,</hi> the <hi>Governors</hi> of the sacred <hi>Rites,</hi> and <hi>Chieftains</hi> in <hi>War,</hi> were all <hi>chosen</hi> by <hi>Lot:</hi> and they who had acquitted themselves <hi>well</hi> in the Discharge of these <hi>Trusts,</hi> were advanced, and taken into the Court of the AREOPAGUS <note place="bottom" n="*">Plutarch, in his Life of Pericles.</note>.</q>
            </p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>You are right in your Idea of this <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>disinterested</hi> Court. Tell me farther now. Was the Body of the Athenian Peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple <hi>sensible, honest,</hi> and <hi>united,</hi> when you threw yourself into their Arms, and increas<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed their Power?</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <pb n="18" facs="16"/>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>I cannot say much, either for their <hi>Good Sense,</hi> their <hi>Uprightness,</hi> or their <hi>Union</hi>; on the Contrary, I fear they were <hi>ignorant, self-interested</hi> and <hi>disunited.</hi> Nay, I must farther confess, that I myself was the Cause and Promoter of their Vices and Factious Temper. For I not only gain<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed and ruled them by my <hi>Eloquence,</hi> as I confessed in my Conversation with COSMO; but <q>by giving them the Plunder and Possession of the Lands taken from the Enemy, and by squandering the public Monies (formerly reserved for the Uses of War) in Shows and Plays for their Entertainment, and by giving them <hi>Largesses</hi> or <hi>Pensions,</hi> I brought them from a sober, modest, and thrifty People, who main<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tained themselves by their own Labours, to become riotous and debauched through these mistaken Methods of Policy: Thus it was that I turned them against the Court of the AREOPAGUS <note place="bottom" n="‚Ä†">Plutarch, in his Life of Pericles.</note>.</q>
            </p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <pb n="19" facs="17"/>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>It gives me Pleasure to find you so much more full and explicit in this Affair, than you were in your Discourse with COSMO. ‚Äî So then, you took Power from a Body of Men, <hi>wise, disinterested,</hi> and <hi>uncorrupt,</hi> to put it into the hands of Men <hi>ignorant, self-interested,</hi> and <hi>factious.</hi>
            </p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>Too true: I did: <q>Because I knew that my Eloquence would (with these other Methods, still <hi>more powerful</hi>) sub<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ject the People to me, and make them the Instruments of all my Desires: where<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>as the AREOPAGUS had an Authority and a Dignity in it which I could not con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>troul.</q>
            </p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>So you said in your Discourse with COSMO. Let us now reverse these Facts, and sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose the Court of the AREOPAGUS had desert<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed the Principles of their first Institution: That either <hi>Luxury,</hi> the Love of <hi>Gain,</hi> or a
<pb n="20" facs="18"/>
Spirit of false <hi>Ambition,</hi> had crept in among them; and rendered them either <hi>incapable,</hi> and <hi>corrupt:</hi> And farther let us sup<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pose, that the Body of the People had been <hi>sensible, honest,</hi> and <hi>united:</hi> What had been the Consequence?</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>The Case indeed had been altogether <hi>different.</hi> I would give all the Wreaths I ever was honoured with, to have built my Conduct on so noble a Foundation.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>

            <p>Then you see, that upon Supposition that the Court of the AREOPAGUS had lost their <hi>Ability</hi> or <hi>public Virtue,</hi> 'tis they who first deprive the Laws of their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Efficacy,</hi> and consequently, 'tis they who make the <hi>Breach</hi> in the established Consti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tution.</p>

            <p>This seems to be true: But still, why should the People follow their Example, and, by insisting on <hi>extraordinary Powers</hi> and <hi>Privileges,</hi> make a <hi>second Breach</hi> in the Constitution?</p>

            <p>O PERICLES, you view the Question with a partial Eye: What you call a <hi>second Breach</hi> in the Constitution is indeed no more than the natural Effort of the <hi>sound Parts</hi> of the Body politic, to <hi>throw off</hi> the <hi>morbific Matter</hi> by which it is oppressed. Thus in the natural Body, all Diseases come to their Crisis, and a Cure is effected by the Vigour and Activity of the uninfected Parts. Where<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ever then the Disease lies, either in the Body politic, or the Body natural, the sound Parts must check and throw off that which is infected, or Death ensues. ‚Äî Thus, you see, supposing the <hi>People</hi> to be <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>honest,</hi> and the Court of AREOPAGUS <hi>cor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rupted</hi> or <hi>incapable,</hi> the only Means of sav<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing the State is the Power which the Peo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ple have to <hi>check</hi> and <hi>reform</hi> the Court of the AREOPAGUS.</p>
         </sp>
         <sp>
            <speaker>PERICLES.</speaker>
            <p>But is not this <hi>unhinging</hi> the Constitu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion?</p>

            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>So far from it, that it is the only Way of <hi>fixing</hi> it; by bringing it back to it's first Principles. ‚Äî How did this famed Consti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tution first arise? Was it not by the united Consent of the several Ranks of the Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>munity, each of which had their several Privileges and Powers appropriated, on Con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dition of applying them to the public Good? The Court of the AREOPAGUS violates it's Engagements: The Voice of an honest and abused People rouzes them from their fatal Dream: What is the natural Consequence? Why, surely, the Reformation of the Court of the AREOPAGUS. An <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>sensible</hi> People never desires more than <hi>Redress</hi> of Grievances; and, when that is obtained, return <hi>chearfully</hi> to <hi>Subordination,</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> their <hi>Rulers.</hi>

            <p>I perceive, the natural Consequence of this must be, that the higher Ranks would be first infected with it; and therefore must be exposed to Temptations, which the Body of the People would escape: <hi>One Temptation</hi> must naturally arise from that <hi>unmanly</hi> or <hi>effeminate</hi> Character, which a refined Luxu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ry tends to introduce: <hi>Another,</hi> from an in<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>temperate Desire of <hi>supplying Expences,</hi> now grown <hi>exorbitant.</hi>

            <p>You have convinced me, ARISTIDES: I see, that the <hi>higher</hi> Ranks in such a State, though equally possessed of <hi>private</hi> Virtues, must be much more exposed to the Temp<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tations of <hi>political Venality</hi> and <hi>Corruption,</hi> than the Body of the <hi>People.</hi>

            <p>This Objection, as I said before, may be of Weight in a <hi>small Republic,</hi> such as that of <hi>Athens</hi> was in Your Days or Mine.

            <p>I do: Because, in a City like that of <hi>Athens,</hi> the whole Multitude of the Com<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>munity is easily <hi>collected</hi> in <hi>one</hi> Body; and therefore may be suddenly seduced, by an Orator, into <hi>one</hi> ill Purpose: But, in a great and populous Kingdom, the whole Multi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tude of the Community cannot be collected into <hi>one</hi> Body; nay, nor into a <hi>hundred</hi> Bo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dies; and therefore cannot be suddenly se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>duced, by an Orator, into <hi>one</hi> ill Purpose.</p>

            <speaker>ARISTIDES.</speaker>
            <p>There is another Respect, in which the Difference is no less essential and important. You have confessed, PERICLES, that the People, or Multitude, which you seduced,

were <q>a Rabble of Labourers and Mecha<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nics, who had been accustomed to earn their Bread by the Sweat of their Brows.<note place="bottom" n="*">See above, and Plutarch, in his Life of Pericles.</note>
               </q> But, if <hi>Attica</hi> had been enlarged into so vast a Kingdom as I have here supposed, the Body of the People would have been of a Charac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter far <hi>superior.</hi> For, besides those of the highest Rank and Fortune, who would naturally form the two Courts of the AREO<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>PAGUS, and aspire to the leading Offices in the Commonwealth; besides these, I say, there would be an innumerable Number of <hi>landed Commoners,</hi> the general Body of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> the <hi>rich Merchants,</hi> and <hi>wealthy Plebeians</hi> of inferior Rank, all <hi>independent</hi> of the Governing Powers, many of them of excellent <hi>Ability,</hi> as well as <hi>Probity</hi>; most of them of Leisure and Education sufficient to enable them to judge of the <hi>leading Lines</hi> or <hi>Features</hi> of an upright Government; espe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cially in the great Article of <hi>Protection</hi> from foreign or domestic <hi>Injuries.</hi> And can you think it possible, that the <hi>good Sense</hi> and <hi>Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nesty</hi> of all these should be seduced into their own Destruction, by a designing or venal Orator?</p>

            <p>Still farther.
