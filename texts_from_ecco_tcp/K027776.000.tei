            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE history of the following production is briefly
this. A lady, fond of blank verse, demanded
a poem of that kind from the author, and gave him
the SOFA for a subject. He obeyed; and having
much leisure, connected another subject with it;
and pursuing the train of thought to which his situa<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tion
and turn of mind led him, brought forth at
length, instead of the trifle which he at first intend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed,
a serious affair—a Volume.</p>
            <p>In the poem, on the subject of education
he would be very sorry to stand suspected of having
aimed his censure at any particular school. His ob<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>jections
are such as naturally apply themselves to schools
in general. If there were not, as for the most part
there is, wilful neglect in those who manage them, and
<pb facs="4"/>
an omission even of such discipline as they are suscepti<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ble
of, the objects are yet too numerous for minute at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tention;
and the aching hearts of ten thousand parents
mourning under the bitterest of all disappointments, at<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>test
the truth of the allegation. His quarrel therefore is
with the mischief at large, and not with any particular
instance of it,</p>

            <lg>
               <l>I SING the SOFA. I who lately sang</l>
               <l>Truth, Hope and Charity, and touch'd with awe</l>
               <l>The solemn chords, and with a trembling hand,</l>
               <l>Escap'd with pain from that advent'rous flight,</l>
               <l>Now seek repose upon an humbler theme;</l>
               <l>The theme though humble, yet august and proud</l>
               <l>Th' occasion—for the Fair commands the song.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Time was, when cloathing sumptuous or for use,</l>
               <l>Save their own painted skins, our sires had none.</l>
               <l>As yet black breeches were not; sattin smooth,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="7"/>
Or velvet soft, or plush with shaggy pile:</l>
               <l>The hardy chief upon the rugged rock</l>
               <l>Wash'd by the sea, or on the grav'ly bank</l>
               <l>Thrown up by wintry torrents roaring loud,</l>
               <l>Fearless of wrong, repos'd his weary strength.</l>
               <l>Those barb'rous ages past, succeeded next</l>
               <l>The birth-day of invention, weak at first,</l>
               <l>Dull in design, and clumsy to perform.</l>
               <l>Joint-stools were then created; on three legs</l>
               <l>Upborne they stood. Three legs upholding firm</l>
               <l>A massy slab, in fashion square or round.</l>
               <l>On such a stool immortal Alfred sat,</l>
               <l>And sway'd the sceptre of his infant realms;</l>
               <l>And such in ancient halls and mansions drear</l>
               <l>May still be seen, but perforated sore</l>
               <l>And drill'd in holes the solid oak is found,</l>
               <l>By worms voracious eating through and through.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At length a generation more refined</l>
               <l>Improv'd the simple plan, made three legs four,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="3" facs="8"/>
Gave them a twisted form vermicular,</l>
               <l>And o'er the seat with plenteous wadding stuff'd</l>
               <l>Induced a splendid cover green and blue,</l>
               <l>Yellow and red, of tapestry richly wrought</l>
               <l>And woven close, or needle-work sublime.</l>
               <l>There might ye see the pioney spread wide,</l>
               <l>The full-blown rose, the shepherd and his lass,</l>
               <l>Lap-dog and lambkin with black staring eyes,</l>
               <l>And parrots with twin cherries in their beak.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now came the cane from India, smooth and bright</l>
               <l>With Nature's varnish; sever'd into stripes</l>
               <l>That interlaced each other, these supplied</l>
               <l>Of texture firm a lattice work, that braced</l>
               <l>The new machine, and it became a chair.</l>
               <l>But restless was the chair; the back erect</l>
               <l>Distress'd the weary loins that felt no ease;</l>
               <l>The slipp'ry seat betray'd the sliding part</l>
               <l>That press'd it, and the feet hung dangling down,</l>
               <l>Anxious in vain to find the distant floor.</l>

These for the rich: the rest, whom fate had placed</l>
               <l>In modest mediocrity, content</l>
               <l>With base materials, sat on well tann'd hides</l>
               <l>Obdurate and unyielding, glassy smooth,</l>
               <l>With here and there a tuft of crimson yarn,</l>
               <l>Or scarlet crewel in the cushion fixt:</l>
               <l>If cushion might be call'd, what harder seem'd</l>
               <l>Than the firm oak of which the frame was form'd.</l>
               <l>No want of timber then was felt or fear'd</l>
               <l>In Albion's happy isle. The umber stood</l>
               <l>Pond'rous, and fixt by its own massy weight.</l>
               <l>But elbows still were wanting; these, some say,</l>
               <l>An Alderman of Cripplegate contrived,</l>
               <l>And some ascribe the invention to a priest</l>
               <l>Burly and big and studious of his ease.</l>
               <l>But rude at first, and not with easy slope</l>
               <l>Receding wide, they press'd against the ribs,</l>
               <l>And bruised the side, and elevated high</l>
               <l>Taught the rais'd shoulders to invade the ears.</l>
               <l>Long time elapsed or e'er our rugged sires</l>

Complain'd, though incommodiously pent in,</l>
               <l>And ill at ease behind. The Ladies first</l>
               <l>'Gan murmur, as became the softer sex.</l>
               <l>Ingenious fancy, never better pleas'd</l>
               <l>Than when employ'd t' accommodate the fair,</l>
               <l>Heard the sweet moan with pity, and devised</l>
               <l>The soft settee; one elbow at each end,</l>
               <l>And in the midst an elbow, it receiv'd</l>
               <l>United yet divided, twain at once.</l>
               <l>So sit two Kings of Brentford on one throne;</l>
               <l>And so two citizens who take the air</l>
               <l>Close pack'd and smiling in a chaise and one.</l>
               <l>But relaxation of the languid frame</l>
               <l>By soft recumbency of outstretched limbs,</l>
               <l>Was bliss reserved for happier days. So slow</l>

               <l>Thus first necessity invented stools,</l>

               <l>The distant plough slow-moving, and beside</l>

That screen the herdsman's solitary hut;</l>
               <l>While far beyond and overthwart the stream</l>
               <l>That as with molten glass inlays the vale,</l>

And lull the spirit while they fill the mind,</l>

               <l>Nor less composure waits upon the roar</l>
               <l>Of distant floods, or on the softer voice</l>
               <l>Of neighb'ring fountain, or of rills that slip</l>

With foliage of such dark redundant growth,</l>

               <l>In village or in town, the bay of curs</l>

               <l>Our fathers knew the value of a screen</l>

In guilty splendor, shake the public ways;</l>

'This folio of four pages, happy work!</l>

               <l>Close at his heels a demagogue ascends,</l>
               <l>And with a dext'rous jerk soon twists him down</l>
               <l>And wins them, but to lose them in his turn.</l>
               <l>Here rills of oily eloquence in soft</l>
               <l>Maeanders lubricate the course they take;</l>

Sooth'd with a waking dream of houses, tow'rs,</l>
               <l>Trees, churches, and strange visages express'd</l>
               <l>In the red cinders, while with poring eye</l>

Her brittle toys, restores me to myself.</l>

               <l>That poets celebrate. Those golden times</l>
               <l>And those Arcadian scenes that Maro sings,</l>
               <l>And Sydney, warbler of poetic prose.</l>
               <l>Nymphs were Dianas then, and swains had hearts</l>
               <l>That felt their virtues. Innocence it seems,</l>
               <l>From courts dismiss'd, found shelter in the groves.</l>
               <l>The footsteps of simplicity impress'd</l>

Then were not all effaced. Then, speech profane</l>
               <l>And manners profligate were rarely found,</l>
               <l>Observed as prodigies, and soon reclaim'd.</l>
               <l>Vain wish! those days were never. Airy dreams</l>
               <l>Sat for the picture. And the poet's hand</l>
               <l>Imparting substance to an empty shade,</l>
               <l>Imposed a gay delirium for a truth.</l>
               <l>Grant it. I still must envy them an age</l>
               <l>That favor'd such a dream, in days like these</l>
               <l>Impossible, when virtue is so scarce</l>
               <l>That to suppose a scene where she presides,</l>
               <l>Is tramontane, and stumbles all belief.</l>
               <l>No. We are polish'd now. The rural lass</l>

               <l>And ribbands streaming gay, superbly raised</l>
               <l>

And magnified beyond all human size,</l>
               <l>Indebted to some smart wig-weavers hand</l>

               <l>Her elbows ruffled, and her tott'ring form</l>

               <l>The town has tinged the country. And the stain</l>
               <l>Appears a spot upon a vestal's robe,</l>
               <l>The worse for what it soils. The fashion runs</l>
               <l>Down into scenes still rural, but alas!</l>
               <l>Scenes rarely graced with rural manners now.</l>
               <l>Time was when in the pastoral retreat</l>

Then sleep was undisturb'd by fear, unscared</l>
               <l>By drunken howlings; and the chilling tale</l>
               <l>Of midnight murther was a wonder heard</l>
               <l>With doubtful credit, told to frighten babes.</l>
               <l>But farewell now to unsuspicious nights</l>

               <l>See that your polish'd arms be prim'd with care,</l>

               <l>To horrid sounds of hostile feet within.</l>
               <l>Ev'n day-light has its dangers. And the walk</l>

               <l>Of other tenants than melodious birds</l>

               <l>The course of human things from good to ill,</l>

Wealth luxury, and luxury excess;</l>
               <l>Excess, the scrophulous and itchy plague</l>

            <head>THE WINTER MORNING WALK.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>'TIS morning; and the sun with ruddy orb</l>
               <l>Ascending fires the horizon. While the clouds</l>
               <l>That crowd away before the driving wind,</l>
               <l>More ardent as the disk emerges more,</l>
               <l>Resemble most some city in a blaze,</l>
               <l>Seen through the leafless wood. His slanting ray</l>
               <l>Slides ineffectual down the snowy vale,</l>
               <l>And tinging all with his own rosy hue,</l>
               <l>From ev'ry herb and ev'ry spiry blade</l>
               <l>Stretches a length of shadow o'er the field.</l>
               <l>Mine, spindling into longitude immense,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="182" facs="182"/>
In spite of gravity and sage remark</l>
               <l>That I myself am but a fleeting shade,</l>
               <l>Provokes me to a smile. With eye askance</l>
               <l>I view the muscular proportioned limb</l>
               <l>Transformed to a lean shank. The shapeless pair</l>
               <l>As they designed to mock me, at my side</l>
               <l>Take step for step, and as I near approach</l>
               <l>The cottage, walk along the plaister'd wall</l>
               <l>Prepost'rous sight! the legs without the man.</l>
               <l>The verdure of the plain lies buried deep</l>
               <l>Beneath the dazzling deluge, and the bents</l>
               <l>And coarser grass upspearing o'er the rest,</l>
               <l>Of late unsightly and unseen, now shine</l>
               <l>Conspicuous, and in bright apparel clad</l>
               <l>And fledged with icy feathers, nod superb.</l>
               <l>The cattle mourn in corners where the fence</l>
               <l>Screens them, and seem half petrified to sleep</l>
               <l>In unrecumbent sadness. There they wait</l>
               <l>Their wonted fodder, not like hungr'ing man</l>
               <l>Fretfull if unsupplied, but silent, meek,</l>
               <l>

And patient of the slow-paced swain's delay.</l>
               <l>He from the stack carves out th' accustomed load,</l>
               <l>Deep-plunging and again deep plunging oft</l>
               <l>His broad keen knife into the solid mass.</l>
               <l>Smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands,</l>
               <l>With such undeviating and even force</l>
               <l>He severs it away. No needless care,</l>
               <l>Lest storms should overset the leaning pile</l>
               <l>Deciduous, or its own unbalanced weight.</l>
               <l>Forth goes the woodman leaving unconcerned</l>
               <l>The cheerfull haunts of man, to wield the axe</l>
               <l>And drive the wedge in yonder forest drear,</l>
               <l>From morn to eve his solitary task.</l>
               <l>Shaggy and lean and shrew'd, with pointed ears</l>
               <l>And tail cropp'd short, half lurcher and half cur</l>
               <l>His dog attends him. Close behind his heel</l>
               <l>Now creeps he slow, and now with many a frisk</l>
               <l>Wide-scampering snatches up the drifted snow</l>
               <l>With iv'ry teeth, or ploughs it with his snout;</l>
               <l>Then shakes his powder'd coat and barks for joy.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="184" facs="184"/>
Heedless of all his pranks the sturdy churl</l>
               <l>Moves right toward the mark. Nor stops for aught.</l>
               <l>But now and then with pressure of his thumb</l>
               <l>T' adjust the fragrant charge of a short tube</l>
               <l>That fumes beneath his nose. The trailing cloud</l>
               <l>Streams far behind him, scenting all the air.</l>
               <l>Now from the roost or from the neighb'ring pale,</l>
               <l>Where diligent to catch the first faint gleam</l>
               <l>Of smiling day, they gossipp'd side by side,</l>
               <l>Come trooping at the housewife's well-known call</l>
               <l>The feather'd tribes domestic. Half on wing</l>
               <l>And half on foot, they brush the fleecy flood</l>
               <l>Conscious, and fearful of too deep a plunge.</l>
               <l>The sparrows peep, and quit the shelt'ring eaves</l>
               <l>To seize the fair occasion. Well they eye</l>

               <l>Remains to each, the search of sunny nook,</l>

Or shed impervious to the blast. Resign'd</l>
               <l>To sad necessity the cock foregoes</l>
               <l>His wonted strut, and wading at their head</l>
               <l>With well-considered steps, seems to resent</l>
               <l>His alter'd gait and stateliness retrenched.</l>
               <l>How find the myriads that in summer cheer</l>
               <l>The hills and vallies with their ceaseless songs</l>
               <l>Due sustenance, or where subsist they now?</l>
               <l>Earth yields them nought: the imprison'd worm is safe</l>
               <l>Beneath the frozen clod; all seeds of herbs</l>
               <l>Lie covered close, and berry-bearing thorns</l>
               <l>That feed the thrush (whatever some suppose)</l>
               <l>Afford the smaller minstrels no supply.</l>
               <l>The long protracted rigor of the year</l>
               <l>Thins all their num'rous flocks. In chinks and holes</l>
               <l>Ten thousand seek an unmolested end</l>
               <l>As instinct prompts, self buried 'ere they die.</l>
               <l>The very rooks and daws forsake the fields,</l>
               <l>Where neither grub nor root nor earth-nut now</l>
               <l>Repays their labor more; and perch'd aloft</l>

By the way-side, or stalking in the path,</l>
               <l>Lean pensioners upon the trav'llers track,</l>
               <l>Pick up their nauscous dole, though sweet to them,</l>
               <l>Of voided pulse or half digested grain.</l>
               <l>The streams are lost amid the splendid blank</l>
               <l>O'erwhelming all distinction. On the flood</l>
               <l>Indurated and fixt the snowy weight</l>
               <l>Lies undissolved, while silently beneath</l>
               <l>And unperceived the current steals away.</l>
               <l>Not so, where scornful of a check it leaps</l>
               <l>The mill-dam, dashes on the wrestless wheel,</l>
               <l>And wantons in the pebbly gulph below.</l>
               <l>No frost can bind it there. Its utmost force</l>
               <l>Can but arrest the light and smokey mist</l>
               <l>That in its fall the liquid sheet throws wide.</l>
               <l>And see where it has hung th' embroidered banks</l>
               <l>With forms so various, that no pow'rs of art,</l>
               <l>The pencil or the pen, may trace the scene!</l>
               <l>Here glitt'ring turrets rise, upbearing high</l>

Large growth of what may seem the sparkling trees</l>
               <l>And shrubs of fairy land. The chrystal drops</l>
               <l>That trickle down the branches, fast congeal'd</l>
               <l>Shoot into pillars of pellucid length,</l>
               <l>And prop the pile they but adorned before.</l>
               <l>Here grotto within grotto safe defies</l>

When thou would'st build: no quarry sent its stores</l>

               <l>And snow that often blinds the trav'ller's course,</l>
               <l>And wraps him in an unexpected tomb.</l>
               <l>Silently as a dream the fabric rose.</l>
               <l>No sound of hammer or of saw was there.</l>
               <l>Ice upon ice, the well-adjusted parts</l>

               <l>Lamps gracefully disposed and of all hues</l>

Another moon new-risen, or meteor fall'n</l>

               <l>Firm as a rock. Nor wanted aught within</l>

               <l>Was split into diversity of tongues,</l>

               <l>Peace was awhile their care. They plough'd and sow'd</l>

               <l>Soon, by a righteous judgment, in the line</l>

               <l>The first artificer of death; the shrew'd</l>
               <l>Contriver who first sweated at the forge,</l>
               <l>And forced the blunt and yet unblooded steel</l>
               <l>To a keen edge, and made it bright for war.</l>
               <l>Him Tubal named, the Vulcan of old times,</l>

               <l>Which have their exigencies too, and call</l>
               <l>For skill in government, at length made king.</l>
               <l>King was a name too proud for man to wear</l>

            <head>THE WINTER WALK AT NOON.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>THERE is in souls a sympathy with sounds,</l>
               <l>And as the mind is pitch'd the ear is pleas'd</l>
               <l>With melting airs or martial, brisk or grave.</l>
               <l>Some chord in unison with what we hear</l>
               <l>Is touched within us, and the heart replies.</l>
               <l>How soft the music of those village bells</l>
               <l>Falling at intervals upon the ear</l>
               <l>In cadence sweet! now dying all away,</l>
               <l>Now pealing loud again and louder still,</l>
               <l>Clear and sonorous as the gale comes on.</l>
               <l>With easy force it opens all the cells</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="232" facs="230"/>
Where mem'ry slept. Wherever I have heard</l>
               <l>A kindred melody, the scene recurs,</l>
               <l>And with it all its pleasures and its pains.</l>
               <l>Such comprehensive views the spirit takes,</l>
               <l>That in a few short moments I retrace</l>
               <l>(As in a map the voyager his course)</l>
               <l>The windings of my way through many years.</l>
               <l>Short as in retrospect the journey seems,</l>
               <l>It seem'd not always short; the rugged path</l>
               <l>And prospect oft so dreary and forlorn</l>
               <l>Moved many a sigh at its disheart'ning length.</l>
               <l>Yet feeling present evils, while the past</l>
               <l>Faintly impress the mind, or not at all,</l>
               <l>How readily we wish time spent revoked,</l>
               <l>That we might try the ground again, where once</l>
               <l>(Through inexperience as we now perceive)</l>
               <l>We miss'd that happiness we might have found.</l>
               <l>Some friend is gone, perhaps his son's best friend</l>
               <l>A father, whose authority, in show</l>

When most severe, and must'ring all its force,</l>
               <l>Was but the graver countenance of love.</l>
               <l>Whose favour like the clouds of spring, might low'r</l>
               <l>And utter now and then an awful voice,</l>
               <l>But had a blessing in its darkest frown,</l>
               <l>Threat'ning at once and nourishing the plant.</l>
               <l>We loved, but not enough the gentle hand</l>
               <l>That reared us. At a thoughtless age allured</l>
               <l>By ev'ry gilded folly, we renounced</l>
               <l>His shelt'ring side, and wilfully forewent</l>
               <l>That converse which we now in vain regret.</l>
               <l>How gladly would the man recall to life</l>
               <l>The boy's neglected sire! a mother too,</l>
               <l>That softer friend, perhaps more gladly still</l>
               <l>Might he demand them at the gates of death.</l>
               <l>Sorrow has since they went subdued and tamed</l>
               <l>The playful humour, he could now endure,</l>
               <l>(Himself grown sober in the vale of tears)</l>
               <l>And feel a parent's presence no restraint.</l>
               <l>But not to understand a treasure's worth</l>

'Till time has stol'n away the slighted good,</l>
               <l>Is cause of half the poverty we feel,</l>
               <l>And makes the world the wilderness it is,</l>
               <l>The few that pray at all pray oft amiss,</l>
               <l>And seeking grace t' improve the prize they hold</l>

               <l>The night was winter in his roughest mood,</l>
               <l>The morning sharp and clear. But now at noon</l>
               <l>Upon the southern side of the slant hills,</l>
               <l>And where the woods fence off the northern blast,</l>
               <l>The season smiles resigning all its rage</l>
               <l>And has the warmth of May. The vault is blue</l>
               <l>Without a cloud, and white without a speck</l>
               <l>The dazzling splendour of the scene below.</l>
               <l>Again the harmony comes o'er the vale,</l>
               <l>And through the trees I view th' embattled tow'r</l>
               <l>Whence all the music. I again perceive</l>
               <l>The soothing influence of the wafted strains,</l>
               <l>And settle in soft musings as I tread</l>

The walk still verdant under oaks and elms,</l>
               <l>Whose outspread branches overarch the glade.</l>
               <l>The roof though moveable through all its length</l>
               <l>As the wind sways it, has yet well sufficed,</l>
               <l>And intercepting in their silent fall</l>
               <l>The frequent flakes, has kept a path for me.</l>
               <l>No noise is here, or none that hinders thought.</l>
               <l>The red-breast warbles still, but is content</l>
               <l>With slender notes and more than half suppress'd.</l>
               <l>Pleased with his solitude, and flitting light</l>
               <l>From spray to spray, where'er he rests he shakes</l>
               <l>From many a twig the pendent drops of ice,</l>
               <l>That tinkle in the wither'd leaves below.</l>
               <l>Stillness accompanied with sounds so soft</l>
               <l>Charms more than silence. Meditation here</l>
               <l>May think down hours to moments. Here the heart</l>
               <l>May give an useful lesson to the head,</l>

               <l>Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one,</l>
               <l>Have oft times no connexion. Knowledge dwells</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="236" facs="234"/>
In heads replete with thoughts of other men,</l>
               <l>Wisdom in minds attentive to their own.</l>
               <l>Knowledge, a rude unprofitable mass,</l>

               <l>Knowledge is proud that he has learn'd so much,</l>
               <l>Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.</l>
               <l>Books are not seldom talismans and spells</l>
               <l>By which the magic art of shrewder wits</l>

Would make his fate his choice. Whom peace, the fruit</l>
               <l>Of virtue, and whom virtue, fruit of faith,</l>
               <l>Prepare for happiness; bespeak him one</l>
               <l>Content indeed to sojourn while he must</l>
               <l>Below the skies, but having there his home.</l>
               <l>The world o'erlooks him in her busy search</l>
               <l>Of objects more illustrious in her view;</l>
               <l>And occupied as earnestly as she</l>
               <l>Though more sublimely, he o'erlooks the world.</l>
               <l>She scorns his pleasures, for she knows them not;</l>
               <l>He seeks not hers, for he has proved them vain.</l>
               <l>He cannot skim the ground like summer birds</l>
               <l>Pursuing gilded flies, and such he deems</l>
               <l>Her honors, her emoluments, her joys.</l>
               <l>Therefore in contemplation is his bliss,</l>
               <l>Whose pow'r is such, that whom she lifts from earth</l>
               <l>She makes familiar with a heav'n unseen,</l>
               <l>And shows him glories yet to be revealed.</l>
               <l>Not slothful he, though seeming unemployed,</l>
               <l>And censured oft as useless. Stillest streams</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="279" facs="277"/>
Oft water fairest meadows, and the bird</l>
               <l>That flutters least, is longest on the wing.</l>
               <l>Ask him indeed, what trophies he has raised,</l>
               <l>Or what atchievements of immortal fame</l>
               <l>He purposes, and he shall answer—none.</l>
               <l>His warfare is within. There unfatigued</l>
               <l>His fervent spirit labors. There he fights,</l>
               <l>And there obtains fresh triumphs o'er himself,</l>
               <l>And never-with'ring wreaths, compared with which</l>
               <l>The laurels that a Caesar reaps are weeds.</l>
               <l>Perhaps the self-approving haughty world</l>
               <l>That as she sweeps him with her whistling silks</l>
               <l>Scarce deigns to notice him, or if she see</l>
               <l>Deems him a cypher in the works of God,</l>
               <l>Receives advantage from his noiseless hours</l>
               <l>Of which she little dreams. Perhaps she owes</l>
               <l>Her sunshine and her rain, her blooming spring</l>
               <l>And plenteous harvest, to the pray'r he makes,</l>
               <l>When Isaac like, the solitary saint</l>
               <l>Walks forth to meditate at even-tide,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="280" facs="278"/>
And think on her, who thinks not for herself.</l>
               <l>Forgive him then, thou bustler in concerns</l>
               <l>Of little worth, and idler in the best,</l>
               <l>If author of no mischief and some good,</l>
               <l>He seek his proper happiness by means</l>
               <l>That may advance, but cannot hinder thine.</l>
               <l>Nor though he tread the secret path of life,</l>
               <l>Engage no notice, and enjoy much ease,</l>
               <l>Account him an incumbrance on the state,</l>
               <l>Receiving benefits, and rend'ring none.</l>
               <l>His sphere though humble, if that humble sphere</l>
               <l>Shine with his fair example, and though small</l>
               <l>His influence, if that influence all be spent</l>
               <l>In soothing sorrow and in quenching strife,</l>
               <l>In aiding helpless indigence, in works</l>
               <l>From which at least a grateful few derive</l>
               <l>Some taste of comfort in a world of woe,</l>
               <l>Then let the supercilious great confess</l>
               <l>He serves his country; recompenses well</l>
               <l>The state beneath the shadow of whose vine</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="281" facs="279"/>
He sits secure, and in the scale of life</l>
               <l>Holds no ignoble, though a slighted place.</l>
               <l>The man whose virtues are more felt than seen,</l>
               <l>Must drop indeed the hope of public praise,</l>
               <l>But he may boast what few that win it can,</l>
               <l>That if his country stand not by his skill,</l>
               <l>At least his follies have not wrought her fall.</l>
               <l>Polite refinement offers him in vain</l>
               <l>Her golden tube, through which a sensual world</l>
               <l>Draws gross impurity, and likes it well,</l>
               <l>The neat conveyance hiding all th' offence.</l>
               <l>Not that he peevishly rejects a mode</l>
               <l>Because that world adopts it. If it bear</l>
               <l>The stamp and clear impression of good sense,</l>
               <l>And be not costly more than of true worth,</l>
               <l>He puts it on, and for decorum sake</l>
               <l>Can wear it e'en as gracefully as she.</l>
               <l>She judges of refinement by the eye,</l>
               <l>He by the test of conscience, and a heart</l>
               <l>Not soon deceived; aware that what is base</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="282" facs="280"/>
No polish can make sterling, and that vice</l>
               <l>Though well perfumed and elegantly dress'd,</l>
               <l>Like an unburied carcase trick'd with flow'rs</l>
               <l>Is but a garnish'd nuisance, fitter far</l>
               <l>For cleanly riddance than for fair attire.</l>
               <l>So life glides smoothly and by stealth away,</l>
               <l>More golden than that age of fabled gold</l>
               <l>Renown'd in ancient song; not vex'd with care</l>
               <l>Or stained with guilt, beneficent, approved</l>
               <l>Of God and man, and peaceful in its end.</l>
               <l>So glide my life away! and so at last</l>
               <l>My share of duties decently fulfilled,</l>
               <l>May some disease, not tardy to perform</l>
               <l>Its destin'd office, yet with gentle stroke,</l>
               <l>Dismiss me weary to a safe retreat</l>
               <l>Beneath the turf that I have often trod.</l>
               <l>It shall not grieve me, then, that once when called</l>
               <l>To dress a Sofa with the flow'rs of verse,</l>
               <l>I play'd awhile, obedient to the fair</l>
               <l>With that light task, but soon to please her more</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="283" facs="281"/>
Whom flow'rs alone I knew would little please,</l>
               <l>Let fall th' unfinish'd wreath, and roved for fruit.</l>
               <l>Roved far and gather'd much. Some harsh, 'tis true,</l>
               <l>Pick'd from the thorns and briars of reproof,</l>
               <l>But wholesome, well-digested. Grateful some</l>
               <l>To palates that can taste immortal truth,</l>
               <l>Insipid else, and sure to be despised.</l>
               <l>But all is in his hand whose praise I seek.</l>
               <l>In vain the poet sings, and the world hears,</l>
               <l>If he regard not, though divine the theme.</l>
               <l>'Tis not in artful measures, in the chime</l>
               <l>And idle tinkling of a minstrel's lyre</l>
               <l>To charm his ear, whose eye is on the heart.</l>
               <l>Whose frown can disappoint the proudest strain,</l>
               <l>Whose approbation—prosper even mine.</l>

            <head>AN
EPISTLE
TO
JOSEPH HILL, ESQ.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>DEAR JOSEPH—five and twenty years ago—</l>
               <l>Alas! how time escapes—'tis even so—</l>
               <l>With frequent intercourse and always sweet</l>
               <l>And always friendly, we were won't to cheat</l>
               <l>A tedious hour—and now we never meet.</l>
               <l>As some grave gentleman in Terence says,</l>
               <l>('Twas therefore much the same in ancient days)</l>
               <l>Good lack, we know not what to-morrow brings—</l>
               <l>Strange fluctuation of all human things!</l>
               <l>True. Changes will befall, and friends may part,</l>
               <l>But distance only cannot change the heart:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="286" facs="283"/>
And were I call'd to prove th' assertion true,</l>
               <l>One proof should serve, a reference to you.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Whence comes it then, that in the wane of life,</l>
               <l>Though nothing have occurr'd to kindle strife,</l>
               <l>We find the friends we fancied we had won,</l>
               <l>Though num'rous once, reduced to few or none?</l>
               <l>Can gold grow worthless that has stood the touch?</l>
               <l>No: Gold they seemed, but they were never such</l>
               <l>Horatio's servant once, with bow and cringe</l>
               <l>Swinging the parlour door upon its hinge,</l>
               <l>Dreading a negative, and overawed</l>
               <l>Lest he should trespass, begg'd to go abroad.</l>
               <l>Go fellow!—whither?—turning short about—</l>
               <l>Nay. Stay at home;—you're always going out.</l>
               <l>'Tis but a step, sir, just at the street's end—</l>
               <l>For what?—An please you sir, to see a friend.</l>
               <l>A friend? Horatio cried, and seem'd to start—</l>
               <l>Yea marry shalt thou, and with all my heart—</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="287" facs="284"/>
And fetch my cloak, for though the night be raw</l>
               <l>I'll see him too—the first I ever saw.</l>
               <l>I knew the man, and knew his nature mild,</l>
               <l>And was his play-thing often when a child,</l>
               <l>But somewhat at that moment pinch'd him close,</l>
               <l>Else he was seldom bitter or morose.</l>
               <l>Perhaps his confidence just then betray'd,</l>
               <l>His grief might prompt him with the speech he made,</l>
               <l>Perhaps 'twas mere good-humour gave it birth,</l>
               <l>The harmless play of pleasantry and mirth.</l>
               <l>Howe'er it was, his language in my mind</l>
               <l>Bespoke at least a man that knew mankind:</l>
               <l>But not to moralize too much, and strain</l>
               <l>To prove an evil of which all complain,</l>
               <l>(I hate long arguments, verbosely spun)</l>
               <l>One story more, dear Hill, and I have done:</l>
               <l>Once on a time, an Emp'ror, a wise man,</l>
               <l>No matter where, in China or Japan,</l>
               <l>Decreed that whosoever should offend</l>
               <l>Against the well known duties of a friend,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="288" facs="285"/>
Convicted once, should ever after wear</l>
               <l>But half a coat, and show his bosom bare.</l>
               <l>The punishment importing this, no doubt,</l>
               <l>That all was naught within, and all found out.</l>
               <l>Oh happy Britain! we have not to fear</l>
               <l>Such hard and arbitrary measure here.</l>
               <l>Else could a law like that which I relate,</l>
               <l>Once have the sanction of our triple state,</l>
               <l>Some few that I have known in days of old</l>
               <l>Would run most dreadful risk of catching cold.</l>
               <l>While you, my friend, whatever wind should blow,</l>
               <l>Might traverse England safely to and fro,</l>
               <l>An honest man, close-buttoned to the chin,</l>
               <l>Broad-cloth without, and a warm heart within.</l>

                  <l>Would'st thou, possessor of a flock, employ</l>
                  <l>(Apprized that he is such) a careless boy,</l>
                  <l>And feed him well and give him handsome pay,</l>
                  <l>Merely to sleep, and let them run astray?</l>
                  <l>Survey our schools and colleges, and see</l>
                  <l>A sight not much unlike my simile.</l>
                  <l>From education, as the leading cause,</l>
                  <l>The public character its colour draws,</l>

Thence the prevailing manners take their cast,</l>
                  <l>Extravagant or sober, loose or chaste.</l>
                  <l>And though I would not advertize them yet,</l>
                  <l>Nor write on each—<hi>This Building to be Lett,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Unless the world were all prepared to embrace</l>
                  <l>A plan well-worthy to supply their place,</l>
                  <l>Yet backward as they are, and long have been,</l>
                  <l>To cultivate and keep the MORALS clean,</l>
                  <l>(Forgive the crime) I wish them, I confess,</l>

            <head>THE DIVERTING
HISTORY
OF
JOHN GILPIN,
SHEWING HOW HE WENT FARTHER THAN HE
INTENDED AND CAME SAFE HOME AGAIN.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>JOHN Gilpin was a citizen</l>
               <l>Of credit and renown,</l>
               <l>A train-band Captain eke was he</l>
               <l>Of famous London town.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,</l>
               <l>Though wedded we have been</l>
               <l>These twice ten tedious years, yet we</l>
               <l>No holiday have seen.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="344" facs="338"/>
               <l>To-morrow is our wedding-day,</l>
               <l>And we will then repair</l>
               <l>Unto the Bell at Edmonton</l>
               <l>All in a chaise and pair.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>My sister and my sister's child,</l>
               <l>My self and children three</l>
               <l>Will fill the chaise, so you must ride</l>
               <l>On horse-back after we.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He soon replied, I do admire</l>
               <l>Of womankind but one,</l>
               <l>And you are she, my dearest dear,</l>
               <l>Therefore it shall be done.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I am a linnen-draper bold,</l>
               <l>As all the world doth know,</l>
               <l>And my good friend the Callender</l>
               <l>Will lend his horse to go.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="345" facs="339"/>
               <l>Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, that's well said;</l>
               <l>And for that wine is dear,</l>
               <l>We will be furnish'd with our own,</l>
               <l>Which is both bright and clear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife,</l>
               <l>O'erjoy'd was he to find</l>
               <l>That though on pleasure she was bent,</l>
               <l>She had a frugal mind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The morning came, the chaise was brought,</l>
               <l>But yet was not allow'd</l>
               <l>To drive up to the door, lest all</l>
               <l>Should say that she was proud.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So three doors off the chaise was stay'd,</l>
               <l>Where they did all get in,</l>
               <l>Six precious souls, and all agog</l>
               <l>To dash through thick and thin.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="346" facs="340"/>
               <l>Smack went the whip, round went the <gap resp="#oxf" extent="1 word" rend="content:〈◊〉">

                  </gap>
               </l>
               <l>Were never folk so glad,</l>
               <l>The stones did rattle underneath</l>
               <l>As if Cheapside were mad.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>John Gilpin at his horse's side</l>
               <l>Seized fast the flowing main,</l>
               <l>And up he got in haste to ride,</l>
               <l>But soon came down again.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For saddle-tree scarce reach'd had he,</l>
               <l>His journey to begin,</l>
               <l>When turning round his head he saw</l>
               <l>Three customers come in.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So down he came, for loss of time</l>
               <l>Although it grieved him sore,</l>
               <l>Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,</l>
               <l>Would trouble him much more:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="347" facs="341"/>
               <l>'Twas long before the customers</l>
               <l>Were suited to their mind,</l>
               <l>When Betty screaming came down stairs,</l>
               <l>"The wine is left behind."</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Good lack! quoth he, yet bring it me,</l>
               <l>My leathern belt likewise</l>
               <l>In which I bear my trusty sword</l>
               <l>When I do exercise.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now Mistress Gilpin, careful soul,</l>
               <l>Had two stone bottles found,</l>
               <l>To hold the liquor that she loved,</l>
               <l>And keep it safe and sound.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Each bottle had a curling ear</l>
               <l>Through which the belt he drew,</l>
               <l>And hung a bottle on each side</l>
               <l>To make his balance true.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="348" facs="342"/>
               <l>Then over all, that he might be</l>
               <l>Equipp'd from top to toe,</l>
               <l>His long red cloak well brush'd and neat</l>
               <l>He manfully did throw.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now see him mounted once again</l>
               <l>Upon his nimble steed,</l>
               <l>Full slowly pacing o'er the stones</l>
               <l>With caution and good heed.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But finding soon a smoother road</l>
               <l>Beneath his well-shod feet,</l>
               <l>The snorting beast began to trot,</l>
               <l>Which gall'd him in his seat.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So fair and softly, John he cried,</l>
               <l>But John he cried in vain,</l>
               <l>That trot became a gallop soon</l>
               <l>In spite of curb and rein.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="349" facs="343"/>
               <l>So stooping down, as needs he must</l>
               <l>Who cannot sit upright,</l>
               <l>He grasp'd the mane with both his hands</l>
               <l>And eke with all his might.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His horse who never in that sort</l>
               <l>Had handled been before,</l>
               <l>What thing upon his back had got</l>
               <l>Did wonder more and more.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Away went Gilpin neck or nought,</l>
               <l>Away went hat and wig,</l>
               <l>He little dreamt when he set out</l>
               <l>Of running such a rig.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,</l>
               <l>Like streamer long and gay,</l>
               <l>'Till loop and button failing both</l>
               <l>At last it flew away.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="350" facs="344"/>
               <l>Then might all people well discern</l>
               <l>The bottles he had slung,</l>
               <l>A bottle swinging at each side</l>
               <l>As hath been said or sung.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The dogs did bark, the children scream'd;</l>
               <l>Up flew the windows all,</l>
               <l>And ev'ry soul cried out, well done,</l>
               <l>As loud as he could bawl.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Away went Gilpin—who but he;</l>
               <l>His fame soon spread around—</l>
               <l>He carries weight, he rides a race,</l>
               <l>'Tis for a thousand pound.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And still as fast as he drew near,</l>
               <l>'Twas wonderful to view</l>
               <l>How in a trice the turnpike-men</l>
               <l>Their gates wide open threw:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="351" facs="345"/>
               <l>And now as he went bowing down</l>
               <l>His reeking head full low,</l>
               <l>The bottles twain behind his back</l>
               <l>Were shatter'd at a blow.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Down ran the wine into the road</l>
               <l>Most piteous to be seen,</l>
               <l>Which made his horse's flanks to smoke</l>
               <l>As they had basted been.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But still he seem'd to carry weight,</l>
               <l>With leathern girdle braced,</l>
               <l>For all might see the bottle necks</l>
               <l>Still dangling at his waist.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus all through merry Islington</l>
               <l>These gambols he did play,</l>
               <l>And till he came unto the wash</l>
               <l>Of Edmonton so gay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="352" facs="346"/>
               <l>And there he threw the wash about</l>
               <l>On both sides of the way,</l>
               <l>Just like unto a trundling mop,</l>
               <l>Or a wild-goose at play.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At Edmonton his loving wife</l>
               <l>From the balcony spied</l>
               <l>Her tender husband, wond'ring much</l>
               <l>To see how he did ride.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Stop, stop John Gilpin!—Here's the house—</l>
               <l>They all at once did cry,</l>
               <l>The dinner waits and we are tir'd,</l>
               <l>Said Gilpin—so am I.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But yet his horse was not a whit</l>
               <l>Inclined to tarry there,</l>
               <l>For why? his owner had a house</l>
               <l>Full ten miles off at Ware.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="353" facs="347"/>
               <l>So like an arrow swift he flew</l>
               <l>Shot by an archer strong,</l>
               <l>So did he fly—which brings me to</l>
               <l>The middle of my song.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Away went Gilpin, out of breath,</l>
               <l>And sore against his will,</l>
               <l>Till at his friend's the Callender's</l>
               <l>His horse at last stood still.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Callender amazed to see</l>
               <l>His neighbour in such trim,</l>
               <l>Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,</l>
               <l>And thus accosted him.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>What news, what news, your tidings tell,</l>
               <l>Tell me you must and shall—</l>
               <l>Say why bare headed you are come,</l>
               <l>Or why you come at all.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="354" facs="348"/>
               <l>Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit</l>
               <l>And loved a timely joke,</l>
               <l>And thus unto the Callender</l>
               <l>In merry guise he spoke.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I came because your horse would come,</l>
               <l>And if I well forebode,</l>
               <l>My hat and wig will soon be here,</l>
               <l>They are upon the road.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Callender right glad to find</l>
               <l>His friend in merry pin,</l>
               <l>Return'd him not a single word,</l>
               <l>But to the house went in.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Whence strait he came with hat and wig,</l>
               <l>A wig that flow'd behind,</l>
               <l>A hat not much the worse for wear,</l>
               <l>Each comely in its kind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="355" facs="349"/>
               <l>He held them up, and in his turn</l>
               <l>Thus show'd his ready wit,</l>
               <l>My head is twice as big as yours,</l>
               <l>They therefore needs must fit.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But let me scrape the dirt away</l>
               <l>That hangs upon your face,</l>
               <l>And stop and eat, for well you may</l>
               <l>Be in a hungry case.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Said John, it is my wedding-day,</l>
               <l>And all the world would stare,</l>
               <l>If wife should dine at Edmonton</l>
               <l>And I should dine at Ware.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So turning to his horse, he said,</l>
               <l>I am in haste to dine,</l>
               <l>'Twas for your pleasure you came here▪</l>
               <l>You shall go back for mine.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>Ah luckless speech, and bootless boast!</l>
               <l>For which he paid full dear,</l>
               <l>For while he spake a braying ass</l>
               <l>Did sing most loud and clear.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Whereat his horse did snort as he</l>
               <l>Had heard a lion roar,</l>
               <l>And gallop'd off with all his might</l>
               <l>As he had done before.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Away went Gilpin and away</l>
               <l>Went Gilpin's hat and wig;</l>
               <l>He lost them sooner than at first,</l>
               <l>For why? they were too big.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now, Mistress Gilpin when she saw,</l>
               <l>Her husband posting down</l>
               <l>Into the country far away,</l>
               <l>She pull'd out half a crown.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="357" facs="351"/>
               <l>And thus unto the youth she said</l>
               <l>That drove them to the Bell,</l>
               <l>This shall be yours when you bring back</l>
               <l>My husband safe and well.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The youth did ride, and soon did meet</l>
               <l>John coming back amain,</l>
               <l>Whom in a trice he tried to stop</l>
               <l>By catching at his rein.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But not performing what he meant</l>
               <l>And gladly would have done,</l>
               <l>The frighted steed he frighted more,</l>
               <l>And made him faster run.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Away went Gilpin, and away</l>
               <l>Went post-boy at his heels,</l>
               <l>The post-boy's horse right glad to miss</l>
               <l>The lumb'ring of the wheels.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="358" facs="352"/>
               <l>Six gentlemen upon the road</l>
               <l>Thus seeing Gilpin fly,</l>
               <l>With post-boy scamp'ring in the rear,</l>
               <l>They rais'd the hue and cry.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Stop thief, stop thief—a highwayman!</l>
               <l>Not one of them was mute,</l>
               <l>And all and each that pass'd that way</l>
               <l>Did join in the pursuit.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And now the turnpike gates again</l>
               <l>Flew open in short space,</l>
               <l>The toll-men thinking as before</l>
               <l>That Gilpin rode a race.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And so he did and won it too,</l>
               <l>For he got first to town,</l>
               <l>Nor stopp'd 'till where he had got up</l>
               <l>He did again get down.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb n="359" facs="353"/>
               <l>Now let us sing, long live the king,</l>
               <l>And Gilpin long live he,</l>
               <l>And when he next doth ride abroad,</l>
               <l>May I be there to see!</l>
