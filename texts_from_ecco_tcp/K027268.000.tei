            <p>THE following ODES were written at very
distant intervals, and with a view to very
different manners of expression and versification.
The author pretends chiefly to the merit of en<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>deavouring
to be correct, and of carefully attend<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
to the best models. From what the ancients
have left of this kind, perhaps the ODE may be
allow'd the most amiable species of poetry; but
certainly there is none which in modern langua<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ges
has been generally attempted with so little
success. For the perfection of lyric poetry de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pends,
beyond that of any other, on the beauty
of words and the gracefulness of numbers; in both
which respects the ancients had infinite advan<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tages
above us. A consideration which will alle<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>viate
the author's disappointment, if he too should
be found to have miscarried.</p>
