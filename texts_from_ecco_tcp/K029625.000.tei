            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE monastery of CLUNI, from whence ABE<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>LARD is supposed to write the following Epistle, was founded in the year 611, near the village of Mascon, on the river Graone. The Head of this convent (in the time of ABELARD) was distin<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>guished for his learning and humanity. History ele<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vates him above the vulgar herd of monks by the ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pellation of the Venerable PETER! He extended his generous protection to the unfortunate ABELARD, when he was under the censure of the court of Rome.</p>
            <p>SAINT BERNARD also is connected with the story of Paraclete. This great man stands eminently forward in the picture of the twelfth century: Born with a mind too restless and enterprising to be confined within the circle of monastic occupations, he rushed into the tu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mult
<pb n="vi" facs="6"/>of active life, and took the lead in some of the most important transactions of that period. With an undisciplined ardour peculiar to his character, he pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cipitated his country into that ruinous measure, the se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cond crusade. Behold him at another time hastening to the contest that held all EUROPE in suspence, which exhibited two contending candidates for the popedom. The authority and vehemence of BERNARD overpow<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ered the pretensions of ANACLETUS, and INNOCENT was seated on the papal throne. The enemies of this celebrated Abbot never impeached his moral charac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ter; but it must be allowed that in his zeal against the innovation of new opinions, he has sometimes left unregarded the superior duty of charity. A letter of his to the Cardinal GUIDO, the pope's legate in France, contains the most intolerant and sanguinary counsel: His persecution however of ABELARD was prompted (according to the opinion of some authors) by an im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pulse of jealousy, alarmed at the splendid literary re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>putation of so young a person.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="7"/>
ABELARD in the following epistle lays a considerable stress upon his sentence of excommunication: In the dark ages, that spiritual humiliation was felt as the greatest calamity; the relation, the parent, the lover, the friend, suspended their endearing offices, and with<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>drew from the degraded offender.</p>

            <l>YON midnight bell, that frights the peaceful air!</l>
            <l>Commands the Fathers to their wonted pray'r:</l>
            <l>Now in long order flows the sable throng,</l>
            <l>Like a dark, sullen stream that creeps along:</l>
            <l>Why joins not ABELARD the sainted train?</l>
            <l>Does torpid sloth his ling'ring steps detain?</l>
            <l>These walls, that pillow steep'd in tears, attest</l>
            <l>That sleep is exil'd from this tortur'd breast:</l>
            <l>This lamp proclaims the same, whose trembling beam</l>
            <l>Guides while my hand pursues the glowing theme:</l>
            <l>While the dread secret from my soul I tear,</l>
            <l>And unreserv'd my bosom'd feelings bear.</l>
            <l>Ah me! the passion that my soul, misled</l>
            <l>Was check'd, not conquer'd; buried, but not dead:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="9"/>Now bursting from the grave, in evil hour,</l>
            <l>It hastens to its prey with fiercer pow'r,</l>
            <l>And, vulture-like, with appetite increas'd</l>
            <l>It riots on the undiminish'd feast.</l>
            <l>Daughter of Paraclete dost thou complain</l>
            <l>In iron silence that I lock'd my pain?</l>
            <l>That not to thee (soft solacer in woe)</l>
            <l>I bad the troubled waves of Anguish flow?</l>

            <l>Would scarce thy length'ning sacrifice complete:</l>
            <l>Methought I should profane the hallow'd rite,</l>
            <l>Did my laments thy pitying ear affright:</l>
            <l>Thus at the altar, wrapt in holy dread,</l>
            <l>The youth of Macedon in silence bled,</l>
            <l>Nor from his tortur'd and consuming hand</l>

            <l>And thou hast reach'd Religion's tranquil shore,</l>

            <l>Where shriek the spirits of the guilty dead!</l>
            <l>Yon moping forest, whose extensive sway</l>

            <l>Flies thro' the heavy gloom of lasting night:</l>
            <l>Ye hermitages, deep immers'd in wood,</l>

            <l>When late my steps drew near the peopled choir,</l>
            <l>What erring wishes did my heart inspire?</l>
            <l>To the deep mysteries as I advanced,</l>
            <l>Still in thy presence was my soul entranced:</l>
            <l>While, bending to the earth, the choral throng</l>
            <l>Pause, 'ere they usher the emphatic song;</l>
            <l>While kneeling seraphs, trembling as they glow,</l>
            <l>Veil with their radiant wings their bashful brow;</l>
            <l>While the deep organ (as by fear controul'd)</l>
            <l>Its solemn sound like distant thunder roll'd;</l>
            <l>While thick'ning odours dim'd the dread abode,</l>
            <l>And th' altar shudder'd at th' approaching God!‚Äî</l>
            <l>'Midst these august, terrific rites unmov'd,</l>
            <l>My guilty thoughts to other altars rov'd:</l>
            <l>In Love enchas'd, a dearer image blest</l>
            <l>That living chapel, my impassion'd breast!</l>

            <l>Shall from her lips its daily honour claim,</l>
            <l>No longer to the throne of GOD repair,</l>
            <l>Borne on the wings of her triumphant pray'r.</l>
            <l>Now frenzy urg'd my wild'ring steps to rove</l>
            <l>Beneath the night of yon extensive grove:</l>
            <l>Now urg'd along the moutain's top to range</l>
            <l>(Despair still haunting me thro' ev'ry change)</l>
            <l>To tread th' advent'rous path that coasts the brow</l>
            <l>Which scowls tremendous o'er the vale below:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="10" facs="17"/>Then to the summit of yon rock I toil'd,</l>
            <l>That shoots its crags fantastically wild!</l>
            <l>There rush'd upon my view the hallow'd cross,</l>
            <l>Cloath'd in the garb of venerable moss!</l>
            <l>This wonted pledge of mercy and delight</l>
            <l>Struck on my fading hope a dark'ning blight;</l>
            <l>No more the saving all-atoning rood,</l>
            <l>The grisly symbol of revenge it stood!</l>
            <l>Lost in the extacy of strong despair,</l>
            <l>With madd'ning hand I tore my rooted hair.‚Äî</l>
            <l>'Twas then the seer of warm compassion came</l>
            <l>To lull my tortures and dispel my shame:</l>
            <l>"Desist," the Priest of Charity began,</l>
            <l>"And own once more the dignity of man!</l>
            <l>"No longer Rome and ABELARD are foes,</l>
            <l>"The thunders of the Vatican repose;</l>
            <l>"The holy church, by my remonstrance won,</l>
            <l>"Takes to her bosom her still darling son."</l>
            <l>Hail to the tidings of that chearing voice</l>
            <l>That bids the humbled ABELARD rejoice!</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="11" facs="18"/>That bids his image to her thought rejoin'd,</l>

         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>Yet not thy person (that attractive sight)</l>
            <l>Diffusing round ineffable delight,</l>
            <l>Nor thy discourse, illum'd with Wisdom's ray,</l>
            <l>Which with soft rapine steals the sould away:</l>
            <l>That eye, where meek Dominion holds her throne;</l>
            <l>That voice, where Music smooths her softest tone;</l>
            <l>By liberal Nature prodigally giv'n,</l>
            <l>(What words can't paint) that smile of opening Heav'n:</l>
            <l>These various charms that pass all human praise,</l>
            <l>These charms that once adorn'd my happier days,</l>
            <l>No more shall I behold‚Äîtis folly to complain,</l>
            <l>Those days of splendor ne'er must rise again.</l>
            <l>Adieu thou mistress of enchanting pow'r!</l>
            <l>Thou blissful vision of a transient hour!</l>
            <l>For such appears (to Fancy still how dear)</l>
            <l>The sloping race of Rapture's swift career,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="12" facs="19"/>When Heav'n enforcing its benign decree,</l>
            <l>With lavish bounty gave thy form to me.</l>
         </lg>
         <lg>
            <l>Hope now is dead, and Pleasure's knell is rung;</l>
            <l>With sable thoughts my dreary mind is hung.</l>
            <l>'Twas at the hour when from the sorrowing view,</l>
            <l>The glowing God of day his beams withdrew,</l>
            <l>When Vesper all her pageantry display'd,</l>
            <l>Fretting the sky with many an awful shade:</l>
            <l>Here trees appear'd that struggled with the storm,</l>
            <l>There a wan cloud assum'd a spectre's form:</l>
            <l>A solitary hand here grasp'd a spear,</l>
            <l>There angry meteors combated in air:</l>
            <l>Now riding on the wind with threat'ning mien,</l>
            <l>The dark, terrific phantom Death was seen:</l>
            <l>From a thick vapour's dread unfolding womb</l>
            <l>Now bodied forth the likeness of a tomb:</l>
            <l>Thy form, oh ELOISE, I clearly traced,</l>
            <l>Thine airy arms the sepulchre embraced:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="13" facs="20"/>That mimic tomb my early fate foreshews,</l>
            <l>While my soul labours with prophetic throes:</l>
            <l>Now closes fast my short disastrous day,</l>
            <l>To life's dark boundary I haste away.</l>
            <l>The virtuous CLUNI still relieves my pains,</l>
            <l>To thee will he convey my cold remains:</l>
            <l>This kind assurance mitigates my doom,</l>
            <l>Thou'lt stand the guardian angel at my tomb:</l>
            <l>Clos'd be this form in ELOISA'S fane,</l>
            <l>She'll sight my requiem with a Lover's strain:</l>
            <l>Oft to my grave with sorrowful delight</l>
            <l>Will she repair, as glooms the thick'ningnight:</l>
            <l>Burst from thy cloud, oh Cynthia, burst away,</l>
            <l>The holy shadow of her frame display!</l>
            <l>Let the soft texture of her length'ning shade.</l>
            <l>Repose along the spot where mine is laid!</l>
            <l>Were thus her presence to my wishes giv'n,</l>
            <l>Death would rejoice, my grave would then be Heav'n!</l>
