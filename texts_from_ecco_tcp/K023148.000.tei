            <p>IN reading several passages of the prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> which
foretell the coming of Christ and the felicities attending it,
I could not but observe a remarkable parity between many of
the thoughts, and those in the Pollio of <hi>Virgil.</hi> This will
not seem surprising, when we reflect, that the Eclogue was
taken from a Sibylline prophecy on the same subject. One
may judge that <hi>Virgil</hi> did not copy it line by line, but se<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lected
such ideas as best agreed with the nature of pastoral
poetry, and disposed them in that manner which served most
to beautify his piece. I have endeavoured the same in this
imitation of him, though without admitting any thing of my
own; since it was written with this particular view, that
the reader, by comparing the several thoughts, might see how
for the images and descriptions of the Prophet are superior
to those of the Poet. But as I fear I have prejudiced
them by my management, I shall subjoin the passages of
<hi>Isaiah,</hi> and those of <hi>Virgil,</hi> under the same disadvantage
of a literal translation.</p>

The sense and language shew, that by <hi>visual ray,</hi> the poet
meant the <hi>sight,</hi> or, as <hi>Milton</hi> calls it, indeed, something less
boldly, <hi>visual nerve.</hi> And no critic would quarrel with the
figure which calls the <hi>instrument</hi> of vision by the name of the
<hi>cause.</hi> But though the term be just, nay noble, and even
sublime, yet the expression of <hi>thick films</hi> is faulty, and he fell
into it by a common neglect of the following rule of good
writing, <q>That when a figurative word is used, whatsoe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ver
is predicated of it ought not only to agree in terms to
the thing to which the figure is applied, but likewise to
that from which the figure is taken.</q> 
               <hi>Thick films</hi> agree
only with the thing to which it is applied, namely, to the
<hi>sight</hi> or eve; and not to that from which it is taken, namely,
a <hi>ray of light</hi> coming to the eye. He should have said <hi>thick
clouds,</hi> which would have agreed with both. But these inac<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>curacies
are not to be found in his later poems.</p>
