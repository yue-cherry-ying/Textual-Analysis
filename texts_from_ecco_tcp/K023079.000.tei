            <head>THE
DESIGN.</head>
            <p>HAVING proposed to write some Pieces on Hu<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>man
Life and Manners, such as (to use my Lord
<hi>Bacon</hi>'s expression) <hi>come home to Men's Busi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ness
and Bosoms,</hi> I thought it more satisfactory to begin
with considering <hi>Man</hi> in the Abstract, his <hi>Nature</hi> and
his <hi>State</hi>: since to prove any moral Duty, to inforce any
moral Precept, or to examine the Perfection or Imperfe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ction
of any Creature whatsoever, it is necessary first to
know what <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>Relation</hi> it is placed in, and
what is the proper <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Purpose</hi> of its <hi>Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Science of Human Nature is, like all other Scien<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ces,
reduced to a <hi>few, clear Points</hi>: There are not many
<hi>certain Truths</hi> in this World. It is therefore in the Ana<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tomy
of the Mind as in that of the Body; more Good will
accrue to mankind by attending to the large, open, and
perceptible parts, than by studying too much such finer
nerves and vessels as will for ever escape our observation.
The <hi>Disputes</hi> are all upon these last, and I will ven<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture
<pb facs="5"/>
to say, they have less sharpen'd the <hi>Wits</hi> than the
<hi>Hearts</hi> of Men against each other, and have diminished
the Practise, more than advanced the Theory, of Mora<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>lity.
If I could flatter my self that this Essay has any
Merit, it is in steering betwixt Doctrines seemingly op<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posite,
in passing over Terms utterly un-intelligible, and
in forming out of all a <hi>temperate</hi> yet not <hi>inconsistent,</hi>
and a <hi>short</hi> yet not <hi>imperfect</hi> System of Ethics.</p>
            <p>This I might have done in Prose; but I chose Verse,
and even Rhyme, for two reasons. The one will ap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pear
obvious; that Principles, Maxims, or Precepts
so written, both strike the reader more strongly at first,
and are more easily retained by him afterwards. The
other may seem odd but is true; I found I could ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>press
them more <hi>shortly</hi> this way than in Prose itself,
and nothing is more certain than that much of the <hi>Force</hi>
as well as <hi>Grace</hi> of Arguments or Instructions depends
on their Conciseness. I was unable to treat this part
of my subject more in <hi>detail,</hi> without becoming dry and
tedious; or more <hi>poetically,</hi> without sacrificing Perspi<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>cuity
to Ornament, without wandring from the Precision,
or breaking the Chain of Reasoning. If any man can unite
all these, without diminution of any of them, I freely con<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>fess
he will compass a thing above my capacity.</p>
            <p>What is now published, is only to be considered as a ge<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>neral
<hi>Map</hi> of <hi>MAN,</hi> marking out no more than the <hi>Greater</hi>
               <pb facs="6"/>
               <hi>Parts,</hi> their <hi>Extent,</hi> their <hi>Limits,</hi> and their <hi>Connection,</hi>
but leaving the Particular to be more fully delineated in
the Charts which are to follow. Consequently, these Epistles
in their progress will become less dry, and more susceptible
of Poetical Ornament. I am here only opening the <hi>Foun<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tains,</hi>
and clearing the passage; To deduce the <hi>Rivers,</hi> to
follow them in their Course, and to observe their Effects,
will be a task more agreeable.</p>

respect to the UNIVERSE.</label>
               <item>
                  <p>OF <hi>Man</hi> in the <hi>Abstract.</hi> We can judge only with regard
to our <hi>own System,</hi> being ignorant of the <hi>Relations</hi> of Sy<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stems
and Things, VER. 17, &amp;c. to 68. Man is not
therefore to be deem'd <hi>Imperfect,</hi> but a Being suited to his <hi>Place</hi>
and <hi>Rank</hi> in the Creation, agreeable to the <hi>General Order</hi> of
Things, and conformable to <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> to him unknown.
69, &amp;c. It is partly upon this <hi>Ignorance</hi> of future Events, and
partly upon the <hi>Hope</hi> of a Future State, that all his Happiness in
the present depends, 73, &amp;c. His <hi>Pride,</hi> in aiming at more <hi>Know<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ledge</hi>
and pretending to more <hi>Perfection,</hi> the cause of his Error
and Misery, 109. 119. The <hi>Impiety</hi> of putting himself in the
<pb facs="8"/>
place of <hi>God,</hi> and judging of the fitness or unfitness, perfection
or imperfection, justice or injustice of his dispensations, 109 <hi>to</hi>
120. The <hi>Absurdity</hi> of conceiting himself the <hi>final cause</hi> of the
creation, or expecting that Perfection in the <hi>moral</hi> world which
is not in the <hi>natural,</hi> 127 <hi>to</hi> 164. The <hi>Unreasonableness</hi> of his
complaints against Providence, while on the one hand he demands
the perfections of the Angels, on the other the bodily qualifica<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions
of the Brutes, 165. That the gift of <hi>Reason alone</hi> counter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vails
all the latter, and that to possess any of the <hi>sensitive faculties</hi> in
a higher degree, would render him miserable, 181 <hi>to</hi> 198. That
throughout the whole visible world, an universal <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>gra<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dation</hi>
in these is observ'd, which causes a <hi>subordination</hi> of crea<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ture
to creature, and of all creatures of man. The gradations of
<hi>sense, instinct, thought, reflection, reason,</hi> 199 <hi>to</hi> 224. How
much <hi>farther</hi> this order and subordination of living creatures may
extend, above and below us? 225. Were any <hi>part</hi> of this bro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ken,
not that part only, but the <hi>whole</hi> connected <hi>Creation</hi> must be
destroyed. The extravagance, madness, and pride of such a de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sire,
239, &amp;c. Consequently, the absolute submission due to Pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>vidence,
both as to our <hi>present</hi> and <hi>future</hi> state, 292, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>THE business of man not to pry into <hi>God,</hi> but to study <hi>him<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>self.</hi>
His <hi>Middle Nature</hi>; his <hi>powers</hi> and <hi>frailties,</hi> and the
Limits of his <hi>capacity,</hi> VER. 3 <hi>to</hi> 43. His two Principles, <hi>Self-love</hi>
                     <pb facs="9"/>
and <hi>Reason,</hi> 43. both necessary, 49. <hi>Self-love</hi> the <hi>stronger,</hi>
and why?, 57. their <hi>End</hi> the same, 71. The <hi>Passions,</hi> and their
<hi>Use,</hi> 83 <hi>to</hi> 120. The <hi>Predominant Passion,</hi> and its <hi>force,</hi> 122
<hi>to</hi> 150. its <hi>necessity,</hi> in directing men to different purposes, 153,
&amp;c. its <hi>providential use,</hi> in fixing our <hi>principle,</hi> and ascertaining
our <hi>virtue,</hi> 167. <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> join'd in our <hi>mixt nature</hi>;
the limits <hi>near,</hi> yet the things <hi>separate,</hi> and <hi>evident.</hi> What is the
office of <hi>Reason?</hi> 187, &amp;c. How odious <hi>Vice</hi> in itself, and how
we deceive our selves into it, 209. That however, the <hi>Ends</hi> of
<hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>general Good</hi> are answer'd in our <hi>Passions,</hi> and <hi>Im<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>perfections,</hi>
230, &amp;c. How usefully these are distributed to all
<hi>Orders of men,</hi> 233. how useful they are to <hi>Society,</hi> 241. and to
the <hi>Individuals,</hi> 253. In every <hi>State,</hi> and in every <hi>Age</hi> of life,
263 to the end.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>whole Universe</hi> one system of <hi>Society,</hi> VER. 7, &amp;c.
Nothing is made wholly for <hi>itself,</hi> nor yet wholly for <hi>an<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>other,</hi>
27. The happiness of animals mutual, 53. <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>In<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>stinct</hi>
operate alike to the good of each individual, 83. <hi>Reason
or instinct</hi> operate to <hi>society,</hi> in all animals, 109. How far <hi>Society</hi>
carry'd by Instinct, 119. How much farther by Reason, 132. Of
that which is call'd the <hi>State of Nature,</hi> 148. Reason instructed
by Instinct in the invention of <hi>Arts,</hi> 170. and in the <hi>Forms</hi> of so<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ciety,
180. Origin of <hi>political</hi> Societies, 199. Origin of <hi>Ma<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>narchy,</hi>
                     <pb facs="10"/>
211. <hi>Patriarchal</hi> government, 216. Origin of <hi>true
Religion</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> from the same principle, of <hi>Love,</hi> 235, &amp;c.
Origin of <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> from the same principle, of
<hi>Fear,</hi> 241, &amp;c. The influence of <hi>Self-love</hi> operating to the <hi>social</hi>

on their first principle, 285. <hi>Mixt Government,</hi> 289. Va<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rious

                  <p>
                     <hi>HAppiness</hi> ill defin'd by the Philosophers, VER. 19. That it
is the <hi>End</hi> of all men, and attainable by all, 28. God go<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>verns
by <hi>general,</hi> not <hi>particular</hi> laws: intends Happiness to be <hi>equal</hi>;
and to be so it must be <hi>social,</hi> since all particular happiness de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>pends
on general, 35. As it is necessary for <hi>Order,</hi> and the peace
and welfare of <hi>Society,</hi> that <hi>External goods</hi> should be <hi>unequal,</hi> hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piness
is not made to consist in these, 47. But, notwithstand<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ing
that inequality, the Balance of Happiness among mankind is
kept even by Providence, by the two Passions of <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> 66.
What the happiness of Individuals is? as far as is consistent with
the constitution of this world, 76. That the <hi>good man</hi> has here
the advantage, 80. The error of imputing to <hi>Virtue</hi> what are
only the calamities of <hi>Nature,</hi> or of <hi>Fortune,</hi> 92. The folly of
expecting that God should alter his General Laws in favour of par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ticulars,
118. That we are not judges <hi>who are good?</hi> but that
whoever they are, they must be <hi>happiest,</hi> 130, &amp;c. That <hi>ex<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ternal</hi>
                     <pb facs="11"/>
                     <hi>goods</hi> are not the proper rewards, often inconsistent with,
or destructive of <hi>Virtue,</hi> 166. But that even these can make no
man happy without Virtue. Instanced in Riches, 176. Ho<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nours,
184. Birth, 203. Greatness, 213. Fame, 233. Supe<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rior
talents, 257. with pictures of human Infelicity in men pos<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>sest
of them all, 275, &amp;c. That VIRTUE ONLY constitutes a Hap<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>piness,
whose Object is <hi>universal</hi> 311. and whose Prospect <hi>eter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>nal,</hi>
345. The perfection of which consists in a <hi>conformity</hi> to
the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> here, and in a <hi>resignation</hi> to it, here and
hereafter, 534. Or (in other words) in <hi>Love of God</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi>
to <hi>all men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the end.</hi>
