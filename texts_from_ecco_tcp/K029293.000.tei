               <stage>SPOKEN BY MR. BETTERTON.</stage>
               <l>A Well-known Muse, who labours once a-year,</l>
               <l>And oft has found a safe Asylum here,</l>
               <l>Though Critic storms a Mother's fears excite,</l>
               <l>With her new Offspring ventures forth to-night.</l>
               <l>Conscious the features must betray the Sire,</l>
               <l>She seeks for no disguise of vain attire;</l>
               <l>What honest Nature gave she brings to view,</l>
               <l>And for a kind adoption rests on you.</l>
               <l>Yet haply now with reason she appears</l>
               <l>Oppress'd with more than e'en maternal fears.</l>
               <l>For since she last enjoy'd your fost'ring smile,</l>
               <l>A German Rival's charms have caught our Isle.</l>
               <l>And though she knows that Rival's favor'd race,</l>
               <l>With daring force combine a soft'ning grace,</l>
               <l>She knows, besides, that one of native breed</l>
               <l>May always hope with Britons to succeed:</l>
               <l>And hence, though fashion call her bigot-sool,</l>
               <l>She takes no lessons from a foreign school—</l>
               <l>But with a patriot pride she lets you know,</l>
               <l>"'Tis English! English, Sirs! from top to toe!"</l>
               <l>While on your liberal candour we rely,</l>
               <l>And Fashion's rage with patriot zeal defy,</l>
               <l>Think not our Author sees with jealous pain</l>
               <l>Exotic merit British laurels gain—</l>
               <l>No—when to ALBION'S hospitable shore</l>
               <l>MISFORTUNE flies protection to implore;</l>
               <l>Or GENIUS darting from a distant sphere,</l>
               <l>That mental Comet spreads its radiance here;</l>
               <l>May Britons glow with philanthropic fire,</l>
               <l>Eager alike to cherish and admire!</l>

                  <speaker>Juliana.</speaker>
                  <p>Good morning, good old Geoffry.— I have once more eluded the vigilance of my per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>secutor—once more stolen forth from the castle, pur<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>posely to visit this spot; and if my father hears of it, I hope he won't be angry with me:—though he denies me his protection, surely he will not pre<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>clude me from contemplating scenes that remind me of him and my dear Mother!—why, what's the matter? you seem agitated.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Geoffry.</speaker>
                  <p>Well I may, Miss Juliana—your father
<pb n="2" facs="5"/>is arrived from Italy, and I expect him here this very day.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Juliana.</speaker>
                  <p>Expect my father!</p>

                  <speaker>Geoffry.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay; after an absence of thirteen years, I expect Sir Hervey once more at Sutherland-house: —look, here's his letter.</p>

                  <p>Oh, I'm so happy!—I shall at last behold, perhaps embrace him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Geoffry.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, I fear otherwise; Sir Hervey is of a most unforgiving disposition, and the wrongs your mother put upon him were of a nature not easily to be forgotten.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Juliana.</speaker>
                  <p>Wrongs!—what wrongs, Geoffry? is the dark tale for ever to be concealed from me?— I am deserted by my father, and not to know the cause!—Come, good old man! remember, you pro<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mised you would one day tell me, and since we are alone, and may not have another opportunity, come now—unveil the mystery—how, how did my mother wrong him?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Geoffry.</speaker>
                  <p>Well then, to keep my word—Sir Hervey ever was, and I fear ever will be, a dupe to fashion and its follies:—he gamed, he intrigued—and though in his heart devoted to Lady Sutherland, he forsook her and his home for scenes of riot and dissipation.</p>
               </sp>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Geoffry.</speaker>
                  <p>Lady Sutherland a long while bore this with fortitude and resignation; but young, beautiful, and accomplished, surrounded by admirers and neglected by her husband, she at last listened to the addresses of an artful and designing villain, who convinced her of Sir Hervey's infidelity, and, by means of forged letters and other artifices, persuaded her to elope with him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Juliana.</speaker>

                  <p>'Tis too true, madam;—but her guilt was of short duration:—in a few days she came back to that house, all penitence and shame.—I shall never forget the day.—I told Sir Hervey of her return, and he in a fit of rage and madness bid me shut the door against her; this she overheard: 'twas too much for a tender nature like hers:—she fled, and soon after died—died of a broken heart!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Juliana</speaker>

                  <speaker>Geoffry.</speaker>
                  <p>You were then but eight years old, and till that hour the idol of Sir Hervey:—but your likeness to your mother soon making him wish to avoid you, you were removed to the castle; where he invested Mrs. Dazzle with the unlimited power of a guardian over you, and which I fear she has exerted like a tyrant.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Juliana.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes.—Sir Hervey could not mean that I should be her prisoner!—But go on: he went abroad—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Geoffry.</speaker>
                  <p>He did — to Naples, where he has ever since resided: and now, what think you, madam? do you blame the living or the dead?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Juliana.</speaker>
                  <p>I have no right to condemn either—but in my mind the husband who neglects an amiable wife is responsible for all the evils that ensue.— Died of a broken heart!—oh, that he had but par<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>doned her!—then he had had a wife, and I a mo<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ther to console me!—but now—Do I indeed resemble her?</p>

                  <p>No—I'm married.—I've got a loving jealous wife!—and whilst Sir Hervey is continually miserable because Lady Sutherland ran away from him, here am I—I tell you what, Geoff—if Mrs. Worry were to run away from me, I'm sure I should be too much of a philosopher to repine on the occasion.</p>

                  <p>Worse and worse—only yesterday he employed Mr. Alltrade to raise five thousand pounds for him on his bond—offered a premium of fifty <hi>per cent.</hi> and the moment he receives the money, away it will go in galas or at the gaming table—No, I beg pardon—not at the gaming table—now a days no money ever goes there.</p>

                  <p>No—but they've left off paying;—and that's the reason the faro banks are knocked up— when people only play for love, friendship won't induce them to keep open house.—But Miss Suther<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>land—there's Sir Hervey's greatest plague. A meeting with her was his chief motive for leaving Italy, and now we understand she vindicates her mother, and takes part against him.</p>

                  <p>Nay; we have it from the best authority, —Mrs. Dazzle—the lady who brought her up, and for whom I have a message—but of this be
<pb n="6" facs="9"/>assured, Geoff; Sir Hervey's case isn't half so desperate as mine:—he's only tormented by a daughter who will try to break his heart, but I've got a jealous wife, who will actually break my head, heart, and purse strings.</p>

                  <p>With all my heart—but mind now—you'll one day find that Mrs. Dazzle has traduced Miss Sutherland, and only because she was a great favourite of her late husband's. He was a distant relation, you know, and I did hope would have re<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>membered her in his will—but no—he, like the rest of her family—he—has forgotten her!</p>

                  <speaker>Worry.</speaker>
                  <p>To be sure; who ever got any good by these distant relations? Mrs. Worry has a little thousand; and do you know my apartments are so constantly cram'd with cousins, neices, uncles, aunts, and grandmothers, that at dinner-time I never get a chair to sit upon—I eat flying!—And talk of the comforts of a fire-side, curse me if I've been within ten yards of mine since the day I was married:—not that I complain of cold though—my house is warm enough, I promise you:—but come along; and sorry am I to be convinced of Miss Sutherland's ingratitude.—Were she the girl you describe, I would not only be her friend and advocate, but if Sir Hervey refused to protect her, I would myself be a father to her.</p>

                  <p>Is he?—then you may aid my suit.—You must know, smitten with the love of same, eager to acquire the reputation of wit and genius, I have written a most magnificent play, which of course I am all anxiety to see acted; he has already promised to come and read it, and if it meets with his approbation, very likely he may advance the money necessary to pay Sir Hervey.</p>

                  <p>True—suppose I hasten his visit—I'll seek him instantly; and whilst you keep Juliana out of sight, I'll keep the will out of sight— <stage>(put<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ting will in his pocket).</stage>—And with regard to the play, if you get money by it, depend on't you'll get reputation also; one generally follows the other.</p>

                  <p>So it does—and how the case is alter'd?—formerly wits had no money, and now he that has no money has no wit; for whilst a bad joke will be applauded from the head of a great able, a good one will be lost if spoken by him who has nothing but wit to recommend him!—but away to the manager—let the war begin, and doubt not our victory!</p>

                  <p>No doubt she has fled to Captain Lavish; and these two impostors are his agents.—oh, I see it all! she has long intended it; and to avoid signing the bond, she has hastened her de<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>parture.</p>

                  <p>Elope with Lavish, why this out<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>does her mother:—but can I stand idly by?—no—I'll disappoint my enemy of this unmanly triumph, and save her; spite of herself I'll save her—Mr. Alltrade, wait upon him instantly, and bid him restore my daughter on pain of a second and more desperate meeting.—Come, madam, we'll see him on his way.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Hervey.</speaker>
                  <p>No: had she copied your bright and excellent example, this ne'er had happened—but though her errors even exceed her mother's, and a reconciliation is more than ever distant, yet she is still my child!—and in a moment dangerous as the present, for my own sake I'll prove a friend and father.</p>

                  <p>Ha! ha! so you've no sooner finish<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>ed that whimsical out-of-the-way job <stage>(pointing to the recess)</stage>—than he sends for you about another.</p>

                  <speaker>Workman.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, your master is an excellent cus<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tomer,—always up to his chin in brick and mor<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tar; and then for price—'gad! he never haggles about price.</p>

                  <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>No, and the best of the joke is, he calls himself an economist, and comes down here on a saving scheme.</p>

                  <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay! finding himself a little out of elbows in London, and the present state of the Continent not allowing him to travel, he came here to
<pb n="32" facs="35"/>live cheap, and retrench.—And there! <stage>(pointing to recess again)</stage>—there's one specimen of his economy.—On the journey he bought a statue of Venus.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Workman.</speaker>
                  <p>I know; and a great bargain it was: it only cost him five pounds.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>True; but not choosing to have his beauties gazed at, he employed you to build that strange sort of recess to put it in, which has cost him at least five times the sum.—This is always the way; if he bought a cheap boat, he'd cut a canal for it; and if a pulpit, he'd build a church for it:—in fact, he is a false economist—a self-deceiver; and here he comes to elucidate my description.</p>

                  <p>Oh! if I go on in this close saving way only six months longer, I shall be able to return to town and dash like the best of them:—never was such a hand at buying bargains.—Frank, come here you rogue:—just now, at Squire Brozier's sale, what do you think I gave for a curricle? — only forty pounds! — there, there's economy for you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>Economy!—begging your pardon, Sir,—I see no economy in buying what you don't want.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frank.</speaker>
                  <p>No—but you've no horses, Sir; and a curricle's useless—</p>

                  <speaker>Lavish.</speaker>
                  <p>That's what I said; says I, a curricle is useless without horses,—so I bought a pair di<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>rectly.</p>

                  <speaker>Lavish.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, gave a hundred and twenty pounds for them—to be sure it's money; but one's own carriage saves posting and drivers: in short, the worst come to the worst, 'tis but a hundred and fifty pounds, and I'll save it a thousand ways.—Who are you, Sir?</p>

                  <p>I have finish'd that job, all but fixing up the statue, Sir; and now I come about the billiard-room:—but, to speak honestly, it is not worth repairing.</p>

                  <speaker>Workman.</speaker>
                  <p>No, Sir; and a new room will not cost above three hundred pounds:—but then to be sure it will be elegant and lasting.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lavish.</speaker>

But a woman without a farthing; she manages the house, mends the linen, nurses the children, scolds the servants—Oh! that's the real rich wife—and the poor Ju<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>liana will be the best bargain I ever made.—So go, do as I tell you: and observe, I'll marry her if I sacrifice my whole fortune in the pursuit.</p>

He, like the rest of the world, won't visit virtue in a cottage, but place me in a magnificent house,—ay, there's the secret:—now-a-days people visit the building, not the owner of it; and on the size of the rooms, and the number of the enter<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tainments, we may not only calculate our friends and admirers, but also the good and bad opinion of the whole fashionable world!</p>

                  <p>No: dying is certainly a cheap mode of living, and to a man in desperate circumstances, a duel may be a good saving scheme: but having hoarded enough to make life comfortable, why I'm a curst fool if I don't save it a thousand ways.</p>

                  <speaker>Juliana.</speaker>
                  <p>No, Madam!—with my husband's per<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>mission the annuity shall be doubled.—The widow of my benefactor must be more amply provided for.</p>

                  <speaker>Lavish.</speaker>
                  <p>Certainly!—I can save it a thousand ways!—And now, Mr. Mist, as we shall certainly dispose of our theatrical property, you shall be the purchaser—Only mind, I make the bargain—never was such a fellow at making bargains!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mist.</speaker>
                  <p>Name your own terms—only let me be London Manager!—Oh, for the opening!—Oh, for the first night!—After Hamlet, what an ad<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>dress will I make to them?</p>
               </sp>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mist.</speaker>
                  <p>Tell you— <q>Ladies and Gentlemen—on the part of the company in general, and myself
<pb n="81" facs="84"/>as proprietor, author, actor, and manager in particular—confess faults—acknowledge obliga<lb rend="hidden" type="hyphenInWord"/>tions—and humbly entreat your usual candour and indulgence.</q>—Then getting nearer the lamps— <q>Ladies and Gentlemen, to-morrow and following evening, with your permission, this play will be repeated!</q>

            <sp>
               <stage>
                  <hi>Spoken by Mr.</hi> FAWCETT <hi>in the Character of</hi> MIST.</stage>
               <lg>
                  <l>A London Manager of high degree,</l>
                  <l>I, Peter Mist, now enter here O. P.;</l>
                  <l>My country playhouse, e'er I came to town</l>
                  <l>Almost knock'd up, has been in lots knock'd down.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>A sturdy farmer bought the walls:—why then,</l>
                  <l>What was a barn will be a barn again.</l>
                  <l>Corn on the stage, not mummers will be seen;</l>
                  <l>And oats be thresh'd where actors should have been;</l>
                  <l>Wheat strew the boards where erst did heroes tread,</l>
                  <l>To make—what heroes never made there—bread.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Stage-struck, but hen-peck'd, honest Justice Dunder</l>
                  <l>Has all my clouds,—his lady has my thunder.</l>
                  <l>Dick Drench, the snug apothecary, means</l>
                  <l>To give a private play, so buys my scenes:</l>
                  <l>Drench, "smelling of the shop," and <hi>idem semper,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Could not resist scenes painted in distemper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Member for the town bought all my coats;</l>
                  <l>There he was wise—for I command two votes;</l>
                  <l>And playhouse coats (again he shew'd discerning)</l>
                  <l>Will suit a Member, for they're us'd to turning.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>My wigs the women quarrell'd for, sweet souls!</l>
                  <l>My daggers stuck in selling; but my bowls</l>
                  <l>Mine host of the Red Lion clapp'd his eyes on,</l>
                  <l>And bought 'em, as I did, to serve up poison.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thus all my country stock, as Shakspeare says,</l>
                  <l>"My cloud-capt towers, my gorgeous palaces,</l>
                  <l>"Yea, my great globe," (the barn,) so much involv'd,</l>
                  <l>And "all it did inherit, have dissolv'd."</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <pb n="83" facs="86"/>
                  <l>But if some future Manager should take</l>
                  <l>My "solemn temple," which I now forsake;</l>
                  <l>My "fabric of a vision," he will find</l>
                  <l>That I have left a cursed "wreck behind."</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Here then I come, by rural schemes half undone,</l>
                  <l>But country stumps appear new brooms in London.</l>
                  <l>Egad I'll sweep all clean—look to't—ne'er doubt me—</l>
                  <l>A London Manager, I'll lay about me;</l>
                  <l>And, as a sample, you shall hear my hints,</l>
                  <l>To be inserted in to-morrow's prints:</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>"A five act play last night was represented,</l>
                  <l>"By an amazing <hi>Dramatist</hi> invented!</l>
                  <l>"Author's and Actors' merits were immense,</l>
                  <l>"And Fawcett e'en surpass'd his usual excellence!</l>
                  <l>"Great care 'tis plain was taken in rehearsal;</l>
                  <l>"And"—may I add with <hi>truth?</hi>—"applause was "universal."</l>
