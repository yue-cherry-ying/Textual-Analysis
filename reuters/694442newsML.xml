<p>A Chinese official said on Saturday that Wei Jingsheng was in normal health in prison and accused the man regarded as a father of China's pro-democracy movement of attacking a fellow inmate, the Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;Wei's health in prison is in normal condition,&quot; Xinhua quoted the official of the Ministry of Justice as saying.  </p>
<p>&quot;Reports that 'Wei was beaten up in prison' and 'Wei did not receive medical care for his illness' are sheer fabrications by certain individuals,&quot; Xinhua quoted the official as saying.</p>
<p>Wei, who is serving a 14-year jail term for subversion, had beaten up a fellow inmate but had admitted his mistake and would not be punished, the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Considering Wei Jingsheng's improved attitude toward his mistake, the prison authorities decided not to give him any penalty,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>A family member said prison authorities had punished Wei for the fight by shutting off electricity to his cell and banning him from shopping at the prison canteen.</p>
