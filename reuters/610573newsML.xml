<p>Singapore, the world's ninth richest nation in terms of per capita income, said on Friday it was still not a &quot;developed&quot; economy.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Trade and Industry said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had reviewed its country classifications and said Singapore was one of five economies which had more in common with industrialised countries than with developing ones.</p>
<p>The IMF had reclassified Hong Kong, Israel, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan together with the industrialised countries into a new enlarged grouping called &quot;advanced economies&quot;, it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The assessment was based on per capita income, the degree of economic diversification and the development of their financial sectors, the ministry said.</p>
<p>It said Singapore was glad the IMF had recognised the progress the country of three million people had made.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the three criteria do not add up to a full definition of a developed economy. Our economy does not have the depth and breadth of fully developed countries,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;We still lag behind many of the developed economies and even some of the NIEs (newly industrialised economies) in terms of the educational profile of our workforce, our indigenous technological base (and) corporate strength,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Only 31 percent of Singapore's labour force had at least post-secondary education compared with 89 percent in the United States, 78 percent in Japan and 60 percent in Korea.</p>
<p>Most of Singapore's technology was not home grown but brought in by multi-national corporations.</p>
<p>&quot;Our companies are not yet in the same league as companies in the U.S., Japan or Germany,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>And Singapore companies were still mostly small.</p>
<p>&quot;No Singapore company is in the Fortune 500 list of the world's largest corporations,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Singapore had a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in 1996 of Singapore $34,212 (US$23,924).</p>
<p>(US$1 = SS1.43)</p>
