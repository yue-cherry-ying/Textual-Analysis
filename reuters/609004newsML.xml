<p>The Peruvian government is cautiously planning an international bond issue on the back of its virtually complete refinancing of all foreign debt obligations, officials and analysts said.</p>
<p>But details of the issue -- which is widely expected to be in Eurobonds -- are vague, and the government is in no hurry to rush it through, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, we are going to have an issue, but not right now and we prefer not to create expectations at the moment,&quot; a senior cabinet member told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Analysts said Peru did not necessarily need the cash, but would benefit from a foreign bond issue that could become a benchmark for future corporate issues.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand that the government is exploring the subject, but that it is in no hurry because the economic team knows that Peru has a lot of debt and the last thing they want to do is increase it,&quot; Arturo Porzecanski, managing director and chief economist of ING Barings in New York, told Reuters on a recent visit to Lima.</p>
<p>&quot;In general, there is a lot of prudence (from the government) over this subject, since there is not a great need to do it.&quot;  </p>
<p>Porzecanski added, however, that a small largely symbolic Eurobond issue of, for example, $200 million at five or ten years' maturity, would be beneficial even if the government left the money untouched in the Central Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many companies that do need funds and would benefit from the fact that there is a similar instrument by the state that serves as a benchmark reference,&quot; he said. &quot;Some times the public sector has to do things first to open the way for the private sector.&quot;</p>
<p>Peru's second largest bank, Banco Wiese, has already approved in principle a future Eurobond issue.  </p>
<p>World financial markets are anticipating a dollar- denominated Eurobond from Peru, with some emerging markets dealers saying it could be for up to $500 million.</p>
<p>Last July the Peruvian government said it planned to issue $75 million in Euronotes before the end of the year. But it delayed those plans without explanation.</p>
<p>Peru's planned issue is dwarfed by recent billion-dollar issues in other Latin American countiries -- such as Argentina, Brazil and Mexico -- who are also turning more and more to foreign markets after restructuring debt obligations.  </p>
<p>But the significance of Peru's issue lies not in the amount, but in the fact that it would be the first time the government issues bonds on foreign markets since the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>Luis Hidalgo, president of government financing body Cofide, which is likely to handle an eventual issue, said the recent closure of Peru's Brady Plan to restructure foreign commercial debt had paved the way for the country to go to international markets.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a project to place financial instruments in the local and international markets,&quot; he confirmed. &quot;But for the moment the programs are on hold.&quot; He would not give more details.</p>
<p>The Andean Development Corporation (CAF), the financial arm of the Andean group customs union, is giving technical assistance to Cofide for the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;I know that within Cofide's plans is an issue on international markets,&quot; said CAF president Enrique Garcia on a recent visit to Lima. &quot;I do not know when nor how much, but I do know that one of the things we are going to analyze in the future is exactly connected with the placement of (Peruvian) instruments abroad.&quot;</p>
