<p>A popular combination of weight-loss medications may have caused heart problems in relatively young women, Mayo Clinic researchers said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The diet drugs fenfluramine and phentermine, prescribed to 18 million people last year in a combination commonly called &quot;fen-phen,&quot; may have been responsible for a thickening of the heart valves in 24 women.</p>
<p>A report on the finding will be published next month in the New England Journal of Medicine, which agreed to allow the information to be disseminated early, the Mayo Clinic said.</p>
<p>&quot;We began to notice that otherwise healthy young women, presenting with this unusual form of valve disease, were also on fen-phen,&quot; cardiologist Heidi Connolly said in a statement.</p>
<p>On routine doctor visits, the women were found to have cardiovascular symptoms or heart murmurs after having taken the weight-loss medications for an average of one year.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know how fen-phen may cause injury to the heart valves,&quot; Connolly said. &quot;We do know that fenfluramine and phentermine alter the way the brain chemical serotonin is metabolised, and serotonin that circulates in the blood can cause (heart) valve injury.&quot;</p>
<p>The valve damage caused blood to leak back into the heart, making it work harder, she said.</p>
<p>Previous research has indicated the weight-loss medications can raise blood pressure in arteries between the heart and the lungs in some patients.</p>
