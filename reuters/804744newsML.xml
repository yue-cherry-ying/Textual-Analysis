<headline>Staid Zurich loosens up for big techno music fest.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-08-17</dateline>

<p>Zurich, normally the staid centre of Swiss banking, traded suits and ties for wild and scanty costumes as up to half a million people descended on the city this weekend for its annual techno music &quot;Street Parade&quot;.</p>
<p>Organisers on Sunday said between 400,000 and 500,000 people took part on Saturday in the parade -- focal point of Europe's second-biggest techno music fest after the &quot;Love Parade&quot; in Berlin, which drew up to a million dancers and spectators in July.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw people who I thought would never go in costume to the street parade, people who normally wear suits and ties,&quot; organiser Christoph Soltmannowski told the weekly newspaper SonntagsBlick.</p>
<p>Techno fans, popularly known as ravers, poured in from around Europe to don their bizarre costumes, many of which were suitably scaled down for the summer heat.</p>
<p>Some participants wore only bright body paint and tangas while others danced to the booming sounds in leather harnesses, spiky collars and feather boas.</p>
<p>The five-hour parade along five km (three miles) of the city's lakefront featured 30 sound trucks with huge speakers and crowds of dancers.</p>
<p>Techno music is a mix of thundering beats and repetitive electronic bleeps supplied by disc jockeys equipped with massive sound systems.</p>
<p>&quot;It all went peacefully,&quot; said a police spokesman in Zurich, Switzerland's biggest city with about one million inhabitants in the wider metropolitan area.</p>
<p>After the parade, ravers could choose among 30 all-night techno parties in sites ranging from the main train station to a forest clearing above the city.</p>
<p>Zurich's Street Parade started in 1992, three years after Berlin's Love Parade, and has grown from around 2,000 dedicated ravers the first time to 300,000 last year.</p>
<p>The Zurich festival under the motto &quot;Love, peace and tolerance&quot; is also a financial wellspring, generating sales estimated at around 50 million francs ($33 million) for everything from music CDs to railroad tickets. ($ = 1.507 Swiss Francs)</p>
