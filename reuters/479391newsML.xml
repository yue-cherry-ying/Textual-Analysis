<p>France is offering 1,000 troops with armoured cars and armoured personnel carriers to join a multinational security force to protect humanitarian relief operations in Albania, the Defence Ministry said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>An aide to Defence Minister Charles Millon said Paris was to handle security in the port of Durres, and organise and escort supply convoys from there to the capital, Tirana.</p>
<p>Italy is putting together a 5,000-strong force for the chaotic Balkan nation following approval from the United Nations on Friday. The force is also expected to include contingents from Greece, Spain, Turkey, Romania and possibly Portugal.</p>
<p>The French troops, the second largest contingent after Italy, which is expected to provide between 2,000 and 2,500 men, could be operational in Albania within 10 days depending on planning now under way in Rome, the defence official said.</p>
<p>They would be equipped with AMX-10 RC armoured cars packing 105 mm. cannon and with VAB armoured personnel carriers, he said.</p>
<p>Paris assumed the force would operate under Chapter Seven of the United Nations charter allowing troops to use force if necessary to ensure the success of their mission, he added.</p>
<p>Violence has spread through Albania since January when a string of popular investment schemes collapsed, wiping out millions of dollars in savings.</p>
<p>The Albanian government wants troops from abroad to help secure ports, airports, roads and railways so that aid can be distributed.</p>
<p>Italy is expected to contribute 2,000 troops to the force.</p>
<p>Other French officials said the force would be organised under the triple auspices of the Conference for Cooperation and Security in Europe, the European Union and the United Nations.</p>
<p>There would be no input from the U.S.-led NATO alliance, of which the main contributor countries are members.</p>
