<headline>IPE natgas volumes and prices jump after slow start.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE natural gas futures activity picked up sharply on Thursday afternoon, with 230 lots done, all at higher prices, and spread across 10 of the 12 monthly contracts.</p>
<p>In four of the months, contract highs were reached: October at 12.95 pence a therm, December at 14.95 pence, January at 17.51 pence and March at 14.70 pence.</p>
<p>All the price rises were comparatively steep, from an increase of 0.145 pence a therm in February to a rise of 0.5 pence in March.</p>
<p>The volume of activity was the largest for several days, and follows some slow periods when little trade has been concluded. On Thursday morning no deals at all were struck during the two-hour session.</p>
<p>Only one trade was struck in each of the 10 contract months where a deal was done. All were for 25 lots with the exception of January, where a deal for five lots was struck seconds before the close of the afternoon session.</p>
