<title>RUSSIA: Situation on Mir under control after accident.</title>
<headline>Situation on Mir under control after accident.</headline>

<p>Mission control and the three-man crew are fully in control of the situation on the space station Mir three days after a collision in orbit, an official at mission control said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation on Mir is completely under the control of mission control and the crew,&quot; Vladimir Solovyov, who is responsible for flight coordination at Korolyov mission control near Moscow, told reporters.</p>
<p>Solovyov said 30 to 40 percent of Mir's electric power potential had been lost during Wednesday's accident, when a cargo craft collided with the space station during a docking manoeuvre and holed a scientific module attached to it.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very big figure,&quot; he said, but added that there was no need for the two Russians and one American on board Mir to conserve electricity.</p>
<p>Solovyov also said there was enough fuel on Mir for it to carry out manoeuvres as required.</p>
<p>He confirmed that a cargo craft would be launched on July 5 to take equipment to Mir to help restore the power supply. The repair work in the damaged Spektr scientific module will take place between July 10 and 14, he said.</p>
<p>Solovyov said the crew would spend Saturday checking how Mir's batteries were charging, trying to reduce humidity on the station and attempting to increase the oxygen supply.</p>
<p>They would switch on equipment which produces oxygen automatically on Sunday, he said.</p>
<p>He said the crew -- American Michael Foale and Russians Vasily Tsibliyev and Alexander Lazutkin -- would start training on Monday in preparation to carry out the repair work.</p>
