<p>Blackburn Rovers secured their place in next season's English premier league on Thursday with a goalless home draw against Middlesbrough.</p>
<p>One point was enough for Blackburn, champions two seasons ago, but struggling Middlesbrough really needed a win.</p>
<p>At the top of the table Manchester United, already confirmed as champions, drew 0-0 at home with Newcastle to dent the visitors' hopes of finishing as runners-up and claiming the second Champions' League spot.</p>
<p>With one game to go, United have 72 points with Liverpool second on 67. Newcastle and Arsenal both have 65 with Newcastle in third place on goals scored.</p>
<p>Middlesbrough, who face Chelsea in the F.A. Cup final on May 17, may now be relegated even if they win their last game at Leeds on Sunday.</p>
<p>Thursday's result also meant that West Ham and Everton cannot now go down.</p>
<p>With Nottingham Forest already doomed, the final two relegation places will be filled by either Middlesbrough, Coventry, Sunderland or Southampton.</p>
<p>Coventry and Middlesbrough have 38 points, Sunderland have 40 and Southampton 41. Saints, however, have a far superior goal difference and should be safe.</p>
<p>Coventry visit Tottenham on Sunday while Sunderland play at Wimbledon.</p>
<p>Thursday's relegation battle was the fixture that should have been played last December before Middlesbrough unilaterally called it off at 24 hours notice because of a shortage of personnel.</p>
<p>They were subsequently docked three points and that looks like making all the difference to their roller coaster season.</p>
<p>Boro can have no real complaints about the result after failing to get hold of a game they needed to win, although Juninho went close with a free kick in the dying minutes.</p>
<p>Newcastle, who beat United 5-0 at home in October, also needed three points to put them in the driving seat in the chase for second place.</p>
<p>But again a draw was a fair result in a game where both teams looked tired. Paul Scholes and Andy Cole both scraped the bar for United while Les Ferdinand scrambled a loose ball against a post in a rare Newcastle attack.</p>
<p>Liverpool will clinch second place if they win at Sheffield Wednesday on Sunday.</p>
<p>If they fail to win, however, Arsenal and Newcastle can both overhaul them with wins. Newcastle host Forest while Arsenal visit Derby.</p>
