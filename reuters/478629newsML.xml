<title>SLOVENIA: Slovenian shares inch higher, seen steady.</title>
<headline>Slovenian shares inch higher, seen steady.</headline>
<dateline>LJUBLJANA 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Slovenian shares firmed 0.57 percent on Tuesday and traders said prices and volumes would most likely stagnate over the short-term due to a lack of fresh trading incentives.</p>
<p>But some hold out hope for a recovery, fuelled by bottom-fishing with the market at current low levels.</p>
<p>&quot;A lack of demand this last month pushed prices to their current levels. This is a very good time for long-term investors to buy some shares,&quot; Robert Rudolf, a trader at brokerage Moja Delnica said.</p>
<p>The SBI index rose 7.24 points or 0.57 percent to 1,281.5.</p>
<p>Turnover slumped to 45.6 million tolars from 80.6 million.</p>
<p>Overall 10 shares rose, five fell and one was unchanged, while 10 were untraded.</p>
<p>Bank SKB was the most actively traded share, firming 4.01 percent to 49,250 tolars on volume of 375 shares for total turnover of 18.2 million tolars.</p>
<p>SKB was traded today for the first time after three days of suspension from trading due to a 30 percent fall of its share Since January 31.</p>
<p>Brokerage Primofin was the biggest gainer, jumping 9.80 percent to 14,000 tolars on volume of two shares.</p>
<p>Ordinary shares of trading company Kovinotehna led the day's decliners, tumbling 10.42 percent to 447 tolars on volume of 300 shares.</p>
