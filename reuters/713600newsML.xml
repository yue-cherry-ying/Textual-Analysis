<title>SPAIN: NATO endorses partial command reform in Europe.</title>
<headline>NATO endorses partial command reform in Europe.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-07-08</dateline>

<p>NATO leaders endorsed a partial shakeup of their alliance's military chain of command on Tuesday to give European allies a capacity to mount their own missions, using NATO assets but without American participation.</p>
<p>But they failed to agree on a complete overhaul of the command structure because of a long-running dispute between France and the United States over control of the Naples-based southern command, which controls the key Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>A NATO summit approved changes which will empower a European deputy Supreme Allied Commander European (SACEUR) to run operations using allied equipment, intelligence and bases in which the United States chose not to participate.</p>
<p>The operations, likely to involve peacekeeping, humanitarian and observer missions in low-level conflicts or disasters, would be under the political control of the 10-nation Western European Union defence grouping.</p>
<p>&quot;We...endorse the considerable progress made in implementing these decisions and in developing European security and defence identity within the Alliance,&quot; the summit statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;In this context we endorse the decisions taken with regard to European command arrangements within NATO to prepare, support, command and conduct WEU-led operations using NATO assets and capabilities.&quot;</p>
<p>The European deputy supreme commander would have a complete European chain of command at his disposal within the NATO structure to run such operations, right down to unit level.</p>
<p>However, it remains unclear exactly how such operations would work in practice, since the United States would have to agree to release its assets for WEU operations, but would not then want to lose all control of what happens next.</p>
<p>But diplomats say too close a U.S. supervision of WEU operations would defeat the very purpose of the exercise -- which is to encourage the Europeans to take on a greater share of their own defence burden.</p>
<p>On the other issues of command reform, while the leaders welcomed &quot;substantial progress made on the development of a new command structure&quot;, diplomats said there was no overall agreement on the command shakeup.</p>
<p>With the dispute over southern command still unsettled, other European allies such as Britain and the Netherlands were unwilling to give up existing NATO command positions, they said.</p>
<p>The United States is easily the most powerful member of the alliance with armed forces which dwarf those of all the other 15 members together in every department.</p>
