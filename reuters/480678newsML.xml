<title>FRANCE: Air France Europe staff extend Paris Orly strike.</title>
<headline>Air France Europe staff extend Paris Orly strike.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Ground staff at Air France Europe voted to continue their strike on Tuesday and the airline cancelled most of its morning flights from Orly airport outside Paris.</p>
<p>Union officials said strikers, who launched the stoppage during the busy Easter weekend, demanded talks on the unifying of their pay and employment terms with those of parent company Air France in a merger between the two airlines which became effective on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Air France Europe said the airline had cancelled almost all its flights untill 10 a.m. (0900 GMT) and was waiting to see whether any employees returned to work despite the vote for a 24-hour extension to the strike.</p>
<p>&quot;For the moment we have cancelled all flights until mid-morning save for a few shuttle services to Marseille, Nice and Toulouse. If nobody goes back to work, either we cancel all flights or we operate a few,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Both ground staff and some pilots are on strike.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately the strike is the only form of labour dialogue we can have with our management. For the past four months management has said 'no' to all our proposals,&quot; said Marcel Thibault, representing two ground staff unions.</p>
<p>Would-be travellers who came to Orly faced an uphill battle finding out whether their flights had been cancelled as a stoppage by staff of Aeroports de Paris blanked out information screens at both Orly and Roissy-Charles de Gaulle.</p>
<p>Air France said all airlines operating from the airports could suffer slight delays because of slower luggage handling. Airport staff are protesting against planned job cuts.</p>
<p>Junior Transport Minister Anne-Marie Idrac said on Monday she was appalled by the wave of strikes, saying they jeopardised the state airlines' future as French air space opens up to competition from Tuesday under European open skies rules.</p>
<p>Ground staff strikes forced Air France Europe to cancel many flights on Saturday and all flights on Sunday.</p>
