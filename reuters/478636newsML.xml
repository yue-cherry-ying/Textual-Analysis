<p>A bomb obliterated Moscow's only monument to Russia's last tsar, Nicholas II, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;A preliminary investigation has proved that the explosion was carried out in a very professional way. Practically nothing is left from the monument,&quot; said a spokesman for the Moscow office of the Federal Security Service (FSB).</p>
<p>Suburban neighbours said they heard a loud explosion at about 6.30 am that blew the 10-metre bronze statue to pieces.</p>
<p>Police were still gathering the pieces in late afternoon, though at first they treated the alert as an April Fool joke.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not believe it at first since it is April 1 today,&quot; said Mikhail Smorodsky, the district police chief.</p>
<p>&quot;But when they got to the site, officers discovered a four-metre fragment of the monument's pedestal.&quot;</p>
<p>The statue, showing Nicholas wearing a crown and regalia, was erected in a remote spot in northeast Moscow last year, reflecting continued official uncertainty toward the tsar.</p>
<p>Nicholas abdicated 80 years ago last month. The move paved the way for the Bolsheviks to take power.</p>
<p>Public interest in the monarchy has grown since the collapse of communism. Nicholas's fall and the his murder with his family by the Bolsheviks in 1918 is widely seen as a historical tragedy and the resurgent Orthodox Church is considering making him a saint.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the All-Russia Monarchist Centre said the act could be related to the current visit to the capital of one of the royal family's descendants.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure this has a political background, especially now when Grand Duchess Leonida Georgiyevna is paying a private visit in Moscow,&quot; the spokeswoman said.</p>
