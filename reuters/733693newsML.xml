<title>USA: FDA panel backs Bristol Myers' Excedrin drug.</title>
<headline>FDA panel backs Bristol Myers' Excedrin drug.</headline>
<dateline>BETHESDA, Md. 1997-07-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel Tuesday voted unanimously that Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s Excedrin Extra-Strength provides effective, temporary relief of migraine headache pain.</p>
<p>A majority of the panel, 14 of the 17, felt the over-the-counter drug was safe as well.</p>
<p>However, the committee wanted to enhance Excedrin E-S labeling to give consumers guidance on how to differentiate migraines from other headaches.</p>
<p>The FDA is not bound by its panels' advice but usually follows it.</p>
<p>Migraine headaches affect 20 million to 25 million Americans each year, three-quarters of them women. Excedrin E-S, sold since 1978, is the third-biggest pain reliever in the United States in total sales.</p>
<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb argued that since most migraine sufferers treat themselves, an over-the-counter drug is appropriate. In a survey of migraine sufferers, the company found that two-thirds of men and 57 percent of women use over-the-counter drugs only.</p>
<p>&quot;Self-treatment is the norm, not the exception,&quot; said Richard Lipton, a headache specialist with the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and a company representative.</p>
<p>Still, panellists worried that patients might not be able to differentiate a migraine from a simple headache and said there could be side effects with chronic use of Excedrin E-S.</p>
<p>The condition is a huge economic burden, resulting in lost wages of $1.3 billion a year, said Jerry Miller of the Wellness Council.</p>
<p>Two prescription drugs are often used for severe migraines. Bristol-Myers' butorphanol, or Stadol, has been popular since the nasal spray was launched in 1991, but recently was pegged as addictive.</p>
<p>Glaxo Wellcome's sumitriptan (Imitrex) was launched in 1991. A self-injector came out in April, but the drug is expensive -- $12 a dose -- and has not penetrated the market.</p>
<p>Drugs in the same class are being tested by Zeneca Pharmaceuticals (zolmitriptan), Merck &amp; Co. (rizatriptan), Glaxo Wellcome Plc (naratriptan), and Pfizer Inc. (eletriptan). In early June, Merck said it hoped to soon seek FDA approval for rizatriptan (Maxalt).</p>
