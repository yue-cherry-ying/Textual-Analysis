<title>UK: UK court orders Gokal to compensate BCCI creditors.</title>
<headline>UK court orders Gokal to compensate BCCI creditors.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>A British court ruled on Friday that former shipping magnate Abbas Gokal should pay 2.94 million pounds ($4.8 million) to the victims of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI).</p>
<p>BCCI's liquidator told Reuters the judge had ruled Gokal, who was last month sentenced to 14 years in jail for his part in the BCCI fraud, should compensate the victims. This amended an earlier confiscation order against the former head of the Gulf shipping group.  </p>
<p>A spokesman for the liquidator said the judge had appended the compensation order, meaning the money would be routed straight to the liquidator if Gokal paid up.</p>
<p>If Gokal, who was found guilty of conspiring to account falsely and conspiracy to defraud, failed to pay the money within two years, Justice Buxton had ordered that he would spend an extra three years in prison. A confiscation order would have gone into state coffers rather than to BCCI depositors.</p>
<p>Gokal, 61, was the fifth person to be convicted for his part in the biggest known banking fraud. BCCI collapsed in 1991 with debts of more than $12 billion after evidence emerged of widespread money laundering. Thousands of people lost their savings as a result of its demise.</p>
<p>In December last year the liquidators paid a 24.5 percent dividend, more than $2.0 billion in total, to the bank's creditors and said a further substantial dividend payment would be made towards the end of this year.</p>
