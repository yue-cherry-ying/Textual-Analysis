<text>
<p>LONDON, May 8 (reuter) - Copper failed to budge in the evening LME session on Thursday, staying away from the mid-afternoon peak of $2,400.</p>
<p>But by 1800 GMT the three-month metal still stood $18 higher than Wednesday's close at $2,388, unchanged from the kerb finish.</p>
<p>Copper was greeted with inevitable profit taking at $2,400 after it broke above the $2,380 chart ceiling, but analysts said the overall gains were still technically constructive.</p>
<p>Aluminium surrendered all of its $9 kerb advance and was indicated at $1,661 a tonne. Momentum was lost above $1,670 earlier.</p>
<p>Zinc, which burst to attention as it raced to the highest since October 1992 in a surging rally, stood $2 down from its kerb level at $1,328. The earlier close of $1,330 was $43 above Wednesday.</p>
<p>But dealers reckon the uptrend will continue with the influx of speculative buying, constructive fundamentals and charts.</p>
