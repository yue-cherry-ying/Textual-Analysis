<headline>NWE gasoline ends firm on raft of bullish factors.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>NWE gasoline was firmer on Friday as NYMEX unleaded futures maintained most of their recent gains, cargo-sized parcels remained scarce and run cuts supportive, traders said.</p>
<p>Eurograde barges traded earlier on at $212 fob Rotterdam and then at $212.25 fob Rotterdam later on.</p>
<p>Swaps were talked around $209/$211 for June paper and were done at $209.25, $209.50 and $209.75.</p>
<p>Cargoes remained relatively high with premium unleaded assessed in the $218/$222 range.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was well supported by a raft of bullish factors such as healthy U.S. demand, stockpiling of cargoes by British players ahead of the post-election mini budget, refinery run cuts and an IOC tender.</p>
<p>Traders said U.S. demand appeared to be taking material out of Europe at a steady pace. Gasoline players see 150-200,000 tonnes heading for the United States between May 15 and June 1.</p>
<p>The Memorial Day holiday on Monday in the United States traditionally marks tbe summer gasoline season's shift into top gear.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, expectations of tax hikes on auto fuel in the post-election mini budget were leading to stockpiling by some British players hoping to sell pre-budget taxed material at post-budget tax prices.</p>
<p>News that State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) was to tender for leaded and unleaded gasoline was also seen as supportive to the market.</p>
<p>The company has issued a first tender, which closes May 28, to buy 25,000 tonnes of 87 octane for June 10-14 delivery. A second tender is for 16 kilolitres of unleaded gasoline for delivery in July and 32 kilolitres for delivery each in August, September and October.</p>
