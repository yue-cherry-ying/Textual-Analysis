<title>USA: U.S. Treasuries a touch higher at open, eye NAPM.</title>
<headline>U.S. Treasuries a touch higher at open, eye NAPM.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. Treasuries opened marginally higher in coupons and a touch lower in bills as players geared up for the monthly report from the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM).</p>
<p>At 0800 EST/1300 GMT, the benchmark 30-year bond was up 1/32 at 94-5/32 to yield 7.1 percent. The two-year note was up 1/32 at 99-22/32, yielding 6.42 percent.</p>
<p>The NAPM index of manufacturing activity, set for release at 1000 EST/1500 GMT, was expected to set the tone for the rest of the week. Economists forecast the index would rise to 53.6 in March from 53.1 in February.  </p>
<p>&quot;Today NAPM ... is going to be the key situation,&quot; said Larry Dyer, government strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
<p>NAPM components such as delivery times and prices help measure demand and provide clues to future monetary policy, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;You look at what (Federal Reserve Chairman Alan) Greenspan has told us, and it's that real demand is running too high,&quot; Dyer said. &quot;Leading indicators coming out of NAPM are going to be key.&quot;  </p>
<p>Both the deliveries and prices measures rose between January and February, and many analysts forecast at least slight rises again in March.</p>
<p>Besides NAPM, the market will pore over weekly retail sales reports from BTM/Schroders and Redbook Research, as well as the monthly leading indicators and construction spending releases.</p>
<p>Economists forecast leaders rose 0.4 percent in February against 0.3 percent in January, and they projected construction spending climbed 0.9 percent last month against 0.4 percent the month before.  </p>
<p>In overseas trading, bills again caught a lift as money continued to flow from equities into front-end Treasuries.</p>
<p>A few analysts have said bills seem overpriced, but others said the selloff following last Tuesday's Fed interest rate hike was overdone and further improvement is likely.</p>
<p>&quot;We've done well since the Fed tightened because people got a little too scared in the front end,&quot; Credit Suisse's Dyer said.</p>
<p>Bills now appear priced for another rate hike in July rather than at the May 20 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, he said.  </p>
<p>At 0830 EST/1330 GMT, three-month bill rates were up one basis point at 5.19 percent. Six- and 12-month rates were unchanged at 5.32 percent and 5.67 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Five-year note prices were unchanged at 99-14/32 to yield 6.76 percent, and 10-year notes were unchanged at 95-11/32 to yield 6.91 percent.</p>
