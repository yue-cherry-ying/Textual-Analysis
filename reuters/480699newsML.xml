<title>HUNGARY: BUDAPEST BOURSE PLUNGES TOGETHER WITH OTHERS.</title>
<headline>BUDAPEST BOURSE PLUNGES TOGETHER WITH OTHERS.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Hungarian share market joined tumbling European markets with leading stocks opening sharply lower, weighed on by Wall Street's plunge, traders said.</p>
<p>They said that the buying side was very weak in early trading and investors were unloading their papers.</p>
<p>&quot;The heavy fall of the Dow Jones has had a substantial impact on the market,&quot; one trader said. &quot;The essence of investors's activity is nothing else than to sell,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's sentiment is rather negative at opening thus we'll have a very heavy fall...maybe 200 points.&quot;</p>
<p>Early losers included meat processor Pick which plunged seven and half percent or 860 forints and at 0941 GMT it traded at 10,700.</p>
<p>Chemicals Borsodchem fell five percent in early trade and at 0947 GMT it stood at 6,190.</p>
<p>At 0944 GMT hotelier Danubius traded at 5,100 forints, down 200, while at 0946 GMT OTP Bank stood at 3,715 forints, down 145.</p>
<p>On Friday the BUX index closed at 5,413.70 points, down 25.27.</p>
