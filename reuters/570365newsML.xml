<headline>Eurobonds settle down on European holidays.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>The primary market ground to a halt on Thursday, with many European countries out of action due to Ascension day holidays.</p>
<p>No new issues were launched on Thursday, and activity was likely to remain subdued until next week, dealers said.</p>
<p>Imperial Chemical Industries said it was watching international bond markets with a view to refinancing part of a $8.5 billion loan taken out to buy Unilever's specialty chemicals division.</p>
<p>&quot;We see it (loan) very much as a bridging facility,&quot; ICI finance director Alan Spall told Reuters. &quot;We will certainly look to the long-term debt markets. Work is being put in place.&quot;</p>
<p>ICI is a rare Euromarket borrower, with just a few deals outstanding. They are a brace of 100 million stg bonds due 2003 and 2005, the last of which was launched in 1987.</p>
<p>ICI also has a $250 million deal due 2001 in the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp cut ICI's long-term credit rating to A- from A+ after news of the acquisition. Moody's Investor Service cut ICI to A3 from A2.</p>
