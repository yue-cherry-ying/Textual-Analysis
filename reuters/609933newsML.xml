<p>NWE gasoline was broadly steady on Friday after yesterday's climb in a market that was seen to be drifting sideways.</p>
<p>&quot;We are really waiting for the U.S. to kick in,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>NYMEX June unleaded futures last traded on ACCESS  0.38 cent lower at 57.50 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>A couple of Eurograde barges were sold at $212 fob ARA, but levels eased back towards $209-211 by mid-morning. A June swap was concluded at $209.75.</p>
<p>State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) re-emerged in the spot market to buy leaded gasoline for June and to buy test cargoes of unleaded gasoline for July to October through two tenders.</p>
<p>The company has issued the first tender, which closes on May 28, to buy 25,000 tonnes of 87 octane for June 10-14 delivery. The second tender is for 16 kilolitres on unleaded gasoline for delivery in July and 32 kilolitres for delivery each in August, September and October.</p>
