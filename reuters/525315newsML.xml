<p>More than 280 Indians are still missing after a fire that killed over 300 Moslem haj pilgrims in Saudi Arabia, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It has now been established that 281 pilgrims are missing,&quot; the ministry said in a statement on last week's fire. &quot;There are a total of 202 injured persons in hospitals. In addition, a total of 252 persons have been treated for injuries.&quot;</p>
<p>Indian officials said there was still no exact figure for the number of Indians killed in the fire, which swept through a key pilgrimage site near the Moslem holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia last Tuesday.</p>
<p>Witnesses said many victims were burned, others suffocated from fumes while some were crushed by a stampede. Saudi Arabia has said 343 people died and more than 1,500 were injured.</p>
<p>About 80,000 Indians performed the haj this year.</p>
<p>The ministry's estimate of casualties was based on visits to more than 600 buildings housing the pilgrims in Mecca and to hospitals in Mecca and Jeddah.</p>
<p>&quot;Our teams in Mecca are doing a head count, room by room, building by building,&quot; India's ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mohammad Hamid Ansari earlier told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We know exactly where the people are staying in Mecca. We are also going around mortuaries and hospitals as well. In mortuaries the situation is more difficult because of charred bodies.&quot;</p>
<p>The Indian Foreign Ministry said Air-India would operate a special chartered flight to bring the injured pilgrims back on Thursday, originating in Jeddah and flying to Bombay via New Delhi.</p>
<p>&quot;Standby medical facilities are being arranged at the airports to render medical attention to the injured,&quot; it added.</p>
