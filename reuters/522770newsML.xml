<p>The planned early closing of a nuclear power plant in the far northern Illinois community of Zion would have a dramatic impact on the town and school district finances if its contribution to the local economy is not replaced, the mayor and school officials said Friday.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Edison Co, a unit of Unicom Corp, announced Thursday that it plans to retire the plant early rather than spend $400 million to replace its steam generators.</p>
<p>The plant began commercial operations in 1973 and is licensed to operate through 2013. ComEd will likely close it before 2005, however, as part of an ongoing assessment of the economic viability of its assets, a prepared statement issued by the utility said.</p>
<p>The closing would have a considerable impact on Zion if the facility closes in its entirety, Zion Mayor Chuck Paxton said. If ComEd does not want to operate the facility, however, maybe a competitor would, he added.</p>
<p>The plant contributes about 52 percent of the tax base for the city and about 15 percent of the city's $15 million total revenues, Paxton said.</p>
<p>&quot;I really don't think we are going to have a loss, but if we did happen to have a loss, we happen to be in a great area for recreation right on Lake Michigan,&quot; Paxton said.</p>
<p>About three miles south of the Illinois-Wisconsin border, Zion is about 40 miles north of Chicago and roughly the same distance south of Milwaukee, Paxton noted.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't want to spend $400 million for steam generators,&quot; Paxton said. &quot;They could at that time, but I think they are pretty serious about making a change down there and I'm not sure that will be bad for us.&quot;</p>
<p>Zion Elementary Schools Superintendent Barbara Christiansen noted that ComEd makes up about 63 percent of the districts equalized assessed value in her district, which would lose about $4 million annually.</p>
<p>While a significant part of the budget, there are many unanswered questions, Christiansen said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the key thing is that we know about this now and we have a period of time to plan, to work with legislators to resolve the school funding formula to soften the blow,&quot; Christiansen said.</p>
<p>The school has minimal outstanding bonds at this point, but also has a number of older school buildings, Christiansen said. The district would likely seek assistance from the state for replacing those structures, she said.</p>
<p>Rick Kasper, the assistant superintendent for business for the Zion-Benton Township High School district said that the plant makes up about 36.8 percent of the equalized assessed value of the district.</p>
<p>The plant provides about 26 percent of the high school district's total revenues, $4.6 million for this year's budget, Kasper said.</p>
