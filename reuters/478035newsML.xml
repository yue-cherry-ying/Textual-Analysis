<headline>NYMEX Hub natgas ends lower but still in range.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>NYMEX Hub gas futures ended mostly lower Tuesday in another sluggish trading session, as April cash and May futures tracked a similar pattern, market sources said.</p>
<p>May finished 4.4 cents lower at $1.882 per mmBtu, while June settled down 2.4 cents at $1.944. Other deferreds were also lower, except in the fall and winter months.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still holding onto that same range. Until cash makes a move, we probably won't see May break out of it,&quot; one source said, adding he expected to see some downward pressure on cash once milder weather arrives later this week.  </p>
<p>Technically, minor support in May was still pegged at $1.86. Further support was seen at $1.825, $1.78 and the contract low of $1.71. Traders said resistance was still at $1.95-1.97, and then at $2.04-2.05.</p>
<p>NYMEX's 12-month strip dropped 0.8 cent to $2.087 as an estimated 19,656 Hub contracts traded. Open interest for March 31 rose 1,189 to 165,036.</p>
<p>In the cash market, a rally was quelled early by forecasts calling for warmer weather across most of the U.S. this week. Gulf Coast prices were up an average of 10 cents to the mid-$1.90s. Midcontinent prices gained four cents to about $1.75-1.77, while New York city-gate values eased into the high-teens amid a rising thermometer reading.</p>
<p>In Weather Services Corp's six- to 10-day outlook, forecasts area calling for mostly normal temperatures throughout the U.S., with patches of colder weather expected to surface in the central and northern plains. Above-normal temperatures are forecast for most of the East Coast later this week and into next week.</p>
<p>No Permian or Alberta natgas futures traded.</p>
<p>On KCBT, May settled two cents lower at $1.74, while deferreds were flat to one cent lower. The East/West spread narrowed by 2.4 cents to 14.2 cents (NYMEX premium).</p>
<p>Physical prices in the Permian basin were up in the mid-to-high $1.70s, while Waha gas sold in the high-$1.70s to mid-$1.80s.</p>
