<headline>IPE Brent ends lower amid pre-holiday squaring.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Brent futures closed lower on on Friday as the bears and the bulls battled it out around the key $20 level on the front month July contract, traders said.</p>
<p>July Brent settled 18 cents lower, bang on $20 a barrel level deemed crucial support. June gas oil closed earlier $1.25 lower at $177.75 a tonne.</p>
<p>Traders attributed the losses to moderate profit-taking and position squaring ahead of the long weekend on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a bit of a tug of war going on,&quot; said one trader. &quot;First they pushed it down, but it got back up again. I think the whole thing has got a bit more of a bearish tone about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said Brent futures had also been tracking the erratic path of NYMEX futures which were being batted about by the expiry of product options on Friday.</p>
<p>NYMEX July crude was trading 30 cents lower at $21.56 a barrel at 1944 GMT, while gasoline was a 0.13 cent off at 66.80 cents.</p>
<p>Both the IPE and NYMEX are shut are Monday due to the Memorial Day holiday in the United States and the Spring Bank Holiday in Britain. -- Melanie Goodfellow, London Newsroom, +44 171 542 7714.</p>
