<headline>TRC chair, CEO Rocco, president Cowen quit.</headline>
<dateline>WINDSOR, Conn. 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>TRC Companies Inc on Tuesday said chairman and chief executive officer Vincent Rocco and president Bruce Cowen have resigned.</p>
<p>Richard Ellison has been named chairman, president, and chief executive. Ellison was president of TRC's subsidiary, TRC Environmental Solutions Inc and chief engineer of TRC.</p>
<p>TRC said that it is currently negotiating an agreement with Rocco and Cowen under which they will repay the company for the benefits they obtained in exercising TRC stock options that were not authorized by TRC's board of directors, and make certain other reimbursements to the company.</p>
<p>The firm's board had established a special committee last week, with Rocco's and Cowen's approval, to investigate that subject and other matters.</p>
<p>Based on the information reviewed by the special committee to date, TRC said it does not anticipate that the result of the committee's continuing inquiry will have any material adverse effect on its financial condition.</p>
<p>Rocco and Cowen have pledged to cooperate fully with the inquiry, TRC said.</p>
