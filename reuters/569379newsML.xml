<p>Hong Kong pro-democracy activists said on Thursday the British colony's imminent handover to China would not stop them commemorating Beijing's bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.</p>
<p>&quot;We will still hold the gathering even if they ban it,&quot; veteran campaigner Szeto Wah told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China plans to hold its traditional candlelit vigil on June 4 in memory of those who died when Chinese troops and tanks crushed the student-led pro-democracy movement around Tiananmen Square eight years ago.</p>
<p>They also plan to display an eight-metre (26-ft) tall sculpture called the Pillar of Shame by Danish artist Jen Galschiot, composed of 50 painfully twisted human bodies, in a Hong Kong park.</p>
<p>&quot;Some day when the circumstances make it possible, the sculpture might be moved to Beijing,&quot; the Alliance said in a statement.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether Hong Kong's post-colonial government that will be led by former shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa will seek to ban the annual pro-democracy protest.</p>
<p>But many believe this year's gathering will be the last major demonstration before the colony reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>Tung has sparked controversy with plans to force demonstrators to get police permits before staging protests and to prohibit foreign funding for local political parties.</p>
<p>Earlier this week he said demonstrations promoting independence for Taiwan or Tibet should not be allowed in Hong Kong after the handover to China.</p>
<p>Szeto urged Hong Kong people to turn out on June 4.</p>
<p>&quot;We always hope there will be many people participating in the candle light vigil... We hope there will be even more people at next year's gathering.&quot;</p>
<p>Szeto said the Alliance had written to Tung urging him to attend the June 4 protest.</p>
<p>About a million Hong Kong people braving a typhoon took to the streets of Hong Kong in 1989 to express their grief at the bloody crackdown by their future leaders.</p>
