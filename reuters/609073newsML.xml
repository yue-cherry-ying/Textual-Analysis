<p>Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, the world's largest phone company, reported healthy annual profit gains on Friday helped by Japan's continued love affair with cellular phones and the Internet.</p>
<p>NTT said its steep profit growth in the past years would slow down in the current business year, but analysts said the forecast was conservative, given the expected increase in Japan's communication traffic.</p>
<p>&quot;The business results indicate NTT's further shift into multimedia service provider from a traditional telephone operator,&quot; said Toshiaki Iba, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.</p>
<p>NTT, which owns a 99 percent monopoly of Japan's local-call network, benefits most from increased communications traffic resulting from soaring demand for portable phone services and increasing Web traffic.</p>
<p>NTT said its parent current profit gained 11 percent to 366 billion yen ($3.15 billion) in the year ended on March 31, after its profit more than doubled to 328.92 billion yen ($2.83 billion) in 1995/96.</p>
<p>It expects profit to show a moderate growth in 1997/98, predicting a 5.7 cent increase.</p>
<p>Current profit is pretax and includes gains or losses on non-operating activities such as investments in stocks.</p>
<p>The interconnection charges from cellular phone and long-distance operators provided a major boost to profit, with NTT collecting 64.5 billion yen ($556 million) more charges from other operators thanks to higher traffic.</p>
<p>The charges for connecting competitors' fragmented networks with NTT's local-call network totaled 450 billion yen ($3.87 billion) during the year, NTT said.</p>
<p>But revenues from traditional telephone business continued falling affected by rate cuts and intensified competition from rival phone operators, NTT said.</p>
<p>There were only 415,000 new subscribers to its fixed analogue lines, the lowest in decades, NTT said.</p>
<p>Instead, revenues from ISDN digital service, which allows sending and receiving data about three times as fast as over ordinary phone lines, jumped 39 percent in the 1996/97 business year, NTT said.</p>
<p>ISDN, provided almost solely by NTT in Japan, uses regular telephone lines but needs digital network terminals on both ends of the line.</p>
<p>NTT expects to gain one million new ISDN customers in the 1997/98 business year.</p>
<p>Despite NTT's cautious outlook, analysts in general expect NTT to manage to boost its parent current profit to around 450 billion to 490 billion yen ($4.22 billion) in the business year to next March 31.</p>
<p>On a group basis, net profit decreased 29.7 percent in 1996/97 because profit from NTT's own cellular phone unit, NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc (NTT Docomo), was wiped out by a huge loss at an NTT PHS unit.</p>
<p>The result for 1995/96 had been helped by capital gains from the sale of shares in a data communications unit which went public in April 1995.</p>
<p>Parliament is expected to pass a bill on restructuring of NTT next month, which will make the giant company into three units and a single holding firm in around 1999.</p>
<p>NTT president Junichiro Miyazu said NTT plans to study details of its restructuring plan for about a year after the bill is passed next month.</p>
