<p>The Singapore high sulphur fuel oil market was quiet on Friday with little trading interest ahead of the weekend, traders said.</p>
<p>The 180-cst grade was heard offered at $104.50 per tonne but there was no buyer.</p>
<p>The 180-cst grade has been capped at $103.50 per tonne this week, with a recent buyer unwilling to bid up prices.</p>
<p>The local buyer has bought at least five cargoes since last week but traders said his buying was so far routine and did not expect prices to go higher.  </p>
<p>Despite tighter supplies from the Middle East during the summer season, traders said the impact has been gradually discounted and saw small room for further price gains.</p>
<p>&quot;The price is now at the high end,&quot; said one trader. &quot;Demand is not significant except from the local buyer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And it seems he has no plans to bid up the market,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>The market was awaiting results of a Taiwan fuel oil export tender which closes on Monday, traders said.  </p>
<p>Taiwan's state Chinese Petroleum Corp (CPC) seeks to sell a third 30,000-tonne cargo of 3.0-percent sulphur fuel oil for June lifting. The tender would be valid for two days.</p>
<p>The swaps market is also discounting the buying support from the cargo market due to bearish fundamentals with little incremental demand seen from the local bunker market and China.</p>
<p>June swaps were unchanged at $101.00/$101.50 and July swaps were little changed at $98.50/$99.00.</p>
<p>On SIMEX fuel oil futures contract, no transaction was</p>
<p>reported on late Friday. June contract was bid/offered at</p>
<p>$101.50/$102.00 and July was at $99.00/$100.80.</p>
