<p>A third British teenager has died overnight from injuries suffered on Monday when a bus carrying children on a school trip in eastern France veered off a road, British and French officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The child, identified by the British Consulate as Keith Ridding, 14, died early on Tuesday in hospital in the Alpine city of Grenoble, the officials said.</p>
<p>His mother was at his side at the time of his death, a British Consulate official said.</p>
<p>The bus had driven off the road on Monday near the town of Moutiers, falling 20 metres (60 feet) into a ravine before eventually coming to rest on its side against a tree.</p>
<p>The victims were all from the northern British town of Bolton. Schoolgirl Nicola Moore, 16, had died almost immediately after the accident and Robert Boardman, 14, died in hospital later.</p>
<p>The bus was carrying 23 people from a holiday camp to a rock-climbing site. Those on board included the driver, 16 youths and six adults who were accompanying the young people.</p>
<p>The cause of the accident was unknown. Police said they have been unable to question the driver, also a Briton, who remained in a state of shock.</p>
