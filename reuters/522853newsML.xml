<p>A Sri Lankan man, who posed as a woman and won an award for being the best female entrepreneur, was sent to hospital by a magistrate on Friday for psychiatric checks, court officials said.</p>
<p>They said the magistrate had ordered the 36-year-old Sattambige Sriyaratne to be sent to a doctor for a full report on his mental state.</p>
<p>&quot;The magistrate has ordered that a report be obtained on the person's mental condition,&quot; a court official told Reuters.</p>
