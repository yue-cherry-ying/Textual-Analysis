<p>Just days before crucial trade talks with the European Union (EU) South Africa on Tuesday called for a special status bilateral agreement that would eventually benefit the whole African continent.</p>
<p>South Africa has been conducting protracted negotiations with the EU since 1994 on carving out a free trade deal, and Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said any agreement should be different to those Europe has with other regions.</p>
<p>&quot;This should be an agreement that is a little over and above the ordinary, because it is designed with its intent to help South Africa, Southern Africa and over a period of time Africa, to rebuild its economy,&quot; he told a media briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a chance for Europe to make an important contribution for the rebuilding of Africa,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The often heated talks have stumbled on several issues, notably Europe's desire to exclude about 40 percent of South Africa's agricultural products from the deal and the effects of a free trade area on South Africa's neighbours.</p>
<p>However, there have been some breakthroughs and earlier this year South South Africa was given qualified membership of the Lome Convention, a cooperation agreement between the EU and 70 African, Carribbean and Pacific countries.</p>
<p>Erwin, who is to hold talks in Brussels later this week on progress towards an agreement, declined to comment on his mood ahead of the imminent EU meeting, but said South Africa had been disappointed by Europe's seeming unwillingness to see the bilateral deal as different from other trade agreements.</p>
<p>&quot;We felt it had slipped back to a fairly standard free trade negotiation,&quot; he said, adding that South Africa would now further stress the developmental needs of the region.</p>
<p>Erwin also unveiled details of its offer that it wants to form a blueprint for a deal. South Africa is aiming to complete the talks by the end of the year.</p>
<p>South Africa wants a transitional period of twelve years to end in free trade on all products and all sectors, development protocols on certain products and subsectors, and special measures to compensate South Africa for cheap imports from Europe which are heavily subsidised.</p>
<p>Erwin said the planned deal was a mixture of encouraging trade while also promoting development.</p>
<p>Europe is South Africa's -- and her neighbours' -- biggest trading partner and Erwin said the deal would boost the country's economy and allow it to lead the Southern African region to sustainable development.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not looking for aid...the development must come from trade and investment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Trade relations have occasionally looked shaky between the EU and South Africa as a war of words has seen some South African officials accuse the EU of dumping cheap beef in the country, threatening its domestic industry.</p>
<p>But Erwin struck a conciliatory tone by saying that no matter the outcome of the talks the two regions would remain closely tied.</p>
<p>&quot;This is serious business...our relations with Europe will be critical to us despite any success or failure on this agreement,&quot; he said.</p>
