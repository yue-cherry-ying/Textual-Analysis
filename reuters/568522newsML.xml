<p>Goldman Sachs &amp; Co Inc expects the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy once again at the May 20 meeting of the central bank's policy-setting body, a top official at the Wall Street giant said.</p>
<p>&quot;We still think the Fed will tighten at the May 20 meeting given the strength of first quarter economic activity and the high level of resource utilization,&quot; said William Dudley, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Dudley said he expects the central bank to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.75 percent at the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on May 20.  </p>
<p>Dudley told Reuters that given the strength of the economy, the Fed's 25 basis point hike of the federal funds rate on March 25 to 5.50 percent &quot;isn't really enough to preempt anything.&quot;</p>
<p>Dudley said he expects second quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to grow by 2.7 percent after a sizzling 5.6 percent registered in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Dudley also said he does not expect the budget agreement reached by the Clinton Administration and Republican congressional leaders to have any impact on the Fed's monetary policy in the short and medium term.  </p>
<p>&quot;As far as the budget is concerned, we don't think it's going to have any meaningful impact on monetary policy over the medium run because all the fiscal restraint we expect to be backloaded into the years 2000, 2001 and 2002,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, depending on the specifics of the timing of the tax cuts versus the spending reductions, the program could actually be stimulative in the first year,&quot; Dudley added.</p>
<p>The balanced budget plan announced late last week includes an $85 billion net tax cut over five years, accommodating reductions in capital gains and estate taxes as well as a $500 per child tax credit.</p>
<p>The five-year budget pact also requires cuts in many government programs, including $115 billion in reductions in the popular Medicare health care program for the elderly.</p>
