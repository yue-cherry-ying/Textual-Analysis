<text>
<p>NWE naphtha was steady on Tuesday as perceptions of tight supply later this week held prices up, despite softer crude prices.</p>
<p>Traders noted, however, that the market was extremely quiet in the wake of the Easter holidays.</p>
<p>On swaps, April paper was quoted around $193.50/$194.50 in early trade, but was assessed back up around $197.50/$198 later.</p>
<p>Players said the contango was still in place with May paper judged to be $1.0 above April's.</p>
<p>&quot;You'd expect naphtha to have fallen in line with the crude,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>&quot;But with so much material having gone East I think a couple of players might be considering putting a squeeze on the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Players have estimated that anything from 300,000 to 700,000 tonnes of naphtha have left Europe for the East over the past month.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not seeing it full effects on the Eastern market just yet because it's a thirty day journey and none of the cargoes have got there yet,&quot; said the broker.</p>
<p>He noted that prices in Japan and Singapore had already weakened slightly on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Europe, one player was heard to be bidding for pipeline material at about $195 cif NWE, while full range material was pegged around $185/$192 cif NWE.</p>
<p>Naphtha barge were assessed around quotes fob cif hi =50 cents.</p>
