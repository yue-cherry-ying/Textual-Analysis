<p>A group of Cuban factory workers on a day trip evoke his memory by flopping, giggling, into the poolside chairs at the pretty villa outside Havana where Ernest Hemingway lived.</p>
<p>Back in the city, half a dozen American tourists, living dangerously just by visiting Cuba despite a U.S. economic embargo, raucously toast the Nobel Prize-winning writer with rum cocktails at the bar of the Ambos Mundos hotel.</p>
<p>Hemingway had a home in Cuba from 1939 to 1960 and stayed for long periods before that at the Ambos Mundos. Nearly four decades later, Cubans sell plastic Hemingway keyrings to tourists on organised daytrips around the the writer's haunts.</p>
<p>For the communist authorities, the &quot;Hemingway trail&quot; and other cultural attractions are just the thing they want to encourage. Hemingway's respected image on the island also sits comfortably with the government's stance that it has no quarrel with the American people or their culture, just with the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Washington, at odds with Havana since President Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, maintains a 35-year-old embargo including travel restrictions for most American citizens that Cuban officials blame for many of the island's economic woes.</p>
<p>That does not stop some Americans from visiting, travelling via third countries such as Mexico, although the noisy group from San Francisco in the bar of the Ambos Mundos did not want their full names used.</p>
<p>HARD-DRINKING TRIPS ON THE HEMINGWAY TRAIL</p>
<p>Marshall (first name only) was celebrating his stag party in Cuba along with about 10 friends who have made the Hemingway trail the focus for hard-drinking bachelor trips abroad as they reach 30-something and get married.</p>
<p>&quot;We're Hemingway freaks,&quot; said Marshall's friend Hauz, laying into a mojito cocktail of rum, lime, mint and soda. &quot;My whole life is a Hemingway tour,&quot; said another enthusiastic drinking mate, Biff.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been to Pamplona (Spain) to do the running of the bulls,&quot; Hauz explained. &quot;We've been to Idaho (where the writer committed suicide in 1961) and drunk a lot of whisky. We've been to Paris.&quot;</p>
<p>The group admitted they were more in search of Hemingway's way of life, which they saw as adventure, drink and off-beat travel, than the literary style that won him the Nobel Prize in 1954 for works such as &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; and &quot;Farewell to Arms.&quot;</p>
<p>They also wanted to see Cuba before communism collapses -- although Castro would doubtless tell them they have plenty of time since he is not about to let go -- and before they set up Hard Rock Cafes and the place fills up with U.S. tourists.</p>
<p>&quot;We go on surgical assaults to interesting places. We all work hard, we're quite successful, we want to do interesting things when we're not working,&quot; Hauz said.</p>
<p>In his small corner room on the fifth floor of the Ambos Mundos, with views over the roofs of Havana's historic quarter, Hemingway probably had similar thoughts. He stayed there for Cuba's game fishing seasons between 1932 and 1939 and also used it as a retreat for writing.</p>
<p>MINI-MUSEUM IN HEMINGWAY HOTEL</p>
<p>The hotel, which re-opened in February after a two-year face-lift, has kept his room as a mini-museum.</p>
<p>In 1939, Hemingway moved to a country villa, Finca Vigia, renting it for a year and then buying it. The house, half hidden by luxuriant vegetation and with views back into Havana, is on a hill at the village of San Francisco de Paula about 10 miles (16 km) from the city centre.</p>
<p>Visitors are not allowed inside but they can look through the windows into a home that has kept been as though the writer had gone fishing and was expected back at the end of the day. The walls are lined with bookshelves containing 9,000 volumes and adorned with bullfighting posters and the heads of impala and other animals shot on the writer's African safaris.</p>
<p>The Cuban workers who turned up in a battered old bus on an excursion organised by young communists loved the glimpse it afforded into the past and &quot;ooed&quot; at the capitalist decadence of Hemingway's large private pool. A guide cracked gentle jokes about Hemingway's reputation as a ladies' man and regaled the visitors with some anecdotes about his life.</p>
<p>She was careful not to present Hemingway as part of Cuba's revolution. Although he was a &quot;progressive,&quot; he wrote very little about what he thought of politics in his adopted home after 1959, she said, but he once wrote in a letter that he thought the Cuban revolution was &quot;a historical necessity.&quot;</p>
<p>PHOTO SHOWS HEMINGWAY/CASTRO ENCOUNTER</p>
<p>A black-and-white photograph on display shows a bearded 61-year-old Hemingway and a bearded 37-year-old Castro. The photo was taken in 1960 and records their only meeting, after the Cuban leader took part in an annual deep-sea fishing tournament named after Hemingway. The contest is still held every year at the Marina Hemingway in west Havana.</p>
<p>Now-exiled Cuban writer Norberto Fuentes, who published a study of Hemingway in Cuba in 1984, quoted Castro as saying he regretted the writer died before he had a chance to know him better. Castro also said the American was his favourite writer, adding that he admired his love of adventure and of the sea.</p>
<p>Hemingway's yacht the Pilar is preserved under a shed in the gardens at Finca Vigia. Tourists can also visit the fishing village of Cojimar where he kept the boat moored, which was the inspiration for &quot;The Old Man and the Sea.&quot;</p>
<p>A bust of Hemingway stands in Cojimar's small square and you can eat at a Hemingway haunt, Las Terrazas restaurant, with its views over the water and photos of the writer at sea.</p>
<p>Back in Havana, the drinking haunts el Bodeguito del Medio and Floridita are essential stops, although the American fans, two days into their stay, decided they lacked authenticity.</p>
<p>&quot;They are very commercialized, for tourists only,&quot; Hauz said. &quot;We are now trying to find places that, if Hemingway were with us today, he would appreciate.&quot;</p>
