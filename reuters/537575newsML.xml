<p>China said on Thursday it had voiced its strong dissatisfaction to the United States for allowing exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama to meet U.S. leaders in Washington this week.</p>
<p>&quot;We are strongly dissatisfied with the United States for allowing the Dalai Lama to carry out splittist activities in the United States, and with U.S. leaders for meeting him,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have already expressed our serious and principled stance to the U.S. side,&quot; Cui told a regular news briefing.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton ignored Chinese warnings to meet the Dalai Lama -- Beijing's arch-rival for Tibetan loyalties -- at the White House on Wednesday and told Tibet's top monk he would urge China to open a direct dialogue with him.</p>
<p>&quot;We express our adamant opposition to any actions that tolerate or support the Dalai Lama's activities to split the motherland,&quot; Cui said.</p>
<p>Beijing on Tuesday warned senior U.S. officials not to meet the Dalai Lama during his visit to the United States this week and called the Tibetan leader a puppet of Western forces aiming to split China.</p>
<p>Beijing regularly accuses the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed revolt against Chinese rule, of seeking to split the Himalayan region from China.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent campaign for more Tibetan autonomy, says he is only seeking genuine self-rule for his people under Chinese sovereignty.</p>
<p>The exiled spiritual leader has been the target of a string of virulent state media condemnations in recent days. His visits to other Western nations have often prompted angry responses from Beijing.</p>
<p>Cui did not say if the Dalai Lama's trip would affect a planned trip to Washington later this month by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who is to meet Clinton.</p>
