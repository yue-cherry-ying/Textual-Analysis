<p>New Zealand's Environment Minister Simon Upton on Wednesday called for developed countries to meet at ministerial level to adopt a common position ahead of December's climate change convention meeting in Kyoto.</p>
<p>&quot;With negotiations showing no signs of progress to date and considerable gaps remaining between the positions of key players, there is an urgent need for the developed nations to get down to some hard talking,&quot; Upton said in a statement.</p>
<p>He said he had asked Canada to chair a meeting and had approached the United States the European Union, Japan and Germany about it.</p>
<p>Upton said it was up to developed countries to reach a common position on how far they were prepared to go and on what terms.</p>
<p>&quot;This can only be reached directly between the parties (to the Framework Convention on Climate Change) and, given the current differences, at ministerial level,&quot; Upton said, adding that without an agreement in advance it was doubtful a deal could be struck at Kyoto.</p>
<p>&quot;At this stage the choice is between modest progress or no progress at all,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Developed countries have no chance of persuading developing countries to adopt commitments if they cannot agree on a common position themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the convention developed countries would take the first steps to reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels.</p>
<p>On Tuesday U.S. Republican Senator Larry Craig said the Senate was likely to pass a resolution before the August recess opposing a global climate change treaty that does not require developing, as well as developed, countries to limit industrial pollution.</p>
<p>Craig said he expected a vote would get very close to the two-thirds majority needed to override a White House veto.</p>
<p>While it would not carry legal force, Craig said it was &quot;an expression both to this administration and to the world that the very body that could make this law is highly sceptical at this moment of the strategy that this administration is incorporating.&quot;</p>
<p>Craig told reporters: &quot;I do not believe the Senate will pass a binding treaty and the rest of the world needs to know that.&quot;</p>
<p>Craig and others say rapidly developing economies, such as China, also should have to commit to limiting their pollution or else they will have an unfair advantage over industrialized countries.</p>
<p>But developing countries contend the United States and other big economies have caused the bulk of the problem, and should work first to clean it up.</p>
