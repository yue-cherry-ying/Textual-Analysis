<title>FRANCE: French anti-Front troublemakers sentenced.</title>
<headline>French anti-Front troublemakers sentenced.</headline>
<dateline>STRASBOURG, France 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>A French court on Tuesday sentenced 13 young people to terms ranging from a suspended month in jail to eight months in prison for rioting during weekend protests against the far-right National Front.</p>
<p>Fifteen young people appeared before the court in the eastern city of Strasbourg accused of stoning police or looting shops.</p>
<p>Two Germans among them were granted a request to be given time to prepare their defence. They will remain in detention and be tried on April 17. All those sentenced were French.</p>
<p>The state prosecutor told the court the main troublemakers had escaped arrest.</p>
<p>Trouble broke out after 40,000 demonstrators marched peacefully to protest against Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front holding a congress in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Rioters clashed with police as they tried to march towards the conference centre and later smashed some 20 shop windows. The three-day congress ended on Monday.</p>
<p>The court was later in the day to try four National Front militants who posed as policemen and &quot;arrested&quot; two anti-Front protesters.</p>
<p>The four, an elected regional councillor and three members of the Front's security services, stopped and searched two youths who were seeking accommodation in a hotel where Front delegates were staying.</p>
<p>The accused could face up to five years in prison if convicted for &quot;making illegal arrests and wrongfully assuming the functions of officers in the criminal police&quot;.</p>
