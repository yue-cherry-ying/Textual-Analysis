<p>Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino went to the rebel-held south on Tuesday for the first time since insurgents seized the region and told their leaders that the dreaded Shik secret police had been disbanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Since yesterday, there is no more Shik in Albania,&quot; he told rebels at a meeting in the town of Gjirokaster, 30 kms (20 miles) from the Greek border.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to build a new intelligence service, with a new face,&quot; Fino said. &quot;From now, anyone who identifies himself as a Shik officer is a liar.&quot;</p>
<p>Fino said he met President Sali Berisha on Monday and they accepted the resignations of Shik chief Bashkim Gazidede and his deputy Bujar Rama.</p>
<p>Shik, the National Information Service, was set up in 1991 after a Stalinist regime which ruled the Balkan country for 45 years collapsed.</p>
<p>Shik replaced the sinister Sigurimi secret police which had helped impose communist rule for 45 years but became feared in its own right. Gazidede's resignation has been a main demand of the rebels who seized southern Albania in early March.</p>
<p>Fino, a former Socialist mayor in Gjirokaster, was warmly greeted by rebels bristling with guns and toured the region as far north as Tepelene during the day.</p>
<p>He discussed Albania's three-month crisis with the rebels and with elected officials, who have almost no power since the army was driven out and weapons depots looted in early March.</p>
<p>&quot;I thank the (rebel) salvation committees for the role they played at a moment of paralysis of local power,&quot; he told an assembly which grouped elected officials and rebel committees.</p>
<p>&quot;But I would like to make clear that without restoration of legal institutions, calm and order cannot return and general elections held,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Berisha was forced to name Fino, an opposition Socialist, to head an all-party crisis government on March 11. Berisha also bowed to demands elections be held three years early. They are due in June.</p>
<p>Albania has been swept by violence since January when a string of popular investment schemes collapsed, wiping out millions of dollars in savings.</p>
<p>The anti-government riots and protests evolved into a full-scale uprising against Berisha, who is blamed for letting the unregulated and fraudulent &quot;pyramid&quot; schemes flourish.</p>
<p>Most of the south is now outside of government control and the rebels' main demand is that Berisha quit.</p>
<p>Fino will go by car from Gjirokaster to Greece on Wednesday to meet Prime Minister Costas Simitis. He will discuss Greece's role in a multinational force going to lawless Albania.</p>
<p>Italy will lead the force to protect humanitarian aid convoys. So far Italy is expected to provide 2,000 to 2,500 troops, France 1,000, Greece 700, Turkey 500, Spain 500 and Romania 400. The force could arrive as early April 10.</p>
<p>The force will be deployed at Tirana airport, the Adriatic ports of Durres and rebel-held Vlore. It will also protect relief convoys around the country.</p>
<p>A U.N. mission in Tirana said an estimated 400,000 people were threatened with hunger and it would distribute aid even before the security force is in place.</p>
<p>Italy said it would press ahead with organising the force despite mounting domestic pressure to rethink the plan after the fatal sinking of a crowded refugee boat last week.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Beniamino Andreatta said the navy would continue interdiction patrols in the Adriatic, where Albanian authorities say at least 83 refugees drowned last Friday when their boat sank after a collision with an Italian corvette.</p>
