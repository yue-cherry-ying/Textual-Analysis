<p>Rescue workers combed a mountainside near Vail, Colorado for the second day on Tuesday searching for bombs and clues to explain why an Air Force warplane crashed into a mountain in April, an official said.</p>
<p>Capt. Craig Button disappeared April 2 during a routine training mission from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. The wreckage of his plane was not discovered until April 20. Heavy snow in the area forced the delay of rescue work until summer.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to make the site safe for the public,&quot; said Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Robyn Chumley. Gold Dust Peak, where the wreckage was found, is in a very remote area 15 miles southwest of the ski resort of Vail. The U.S. Forest Service cordoned off the area.</p>
<p>The cause of the accident and why Button veered off course have still not been determined, Chumley said.</p>
<p>Human remains believed to be Button's were found Monday. Four 500-pound MC 82 bombs have not yet been located, she said.</p>
<p>The rescue work is expected to take around three weeks.</p>
<p>Besides the bombs, munitions workers also hope to bring back magnesium flares believed to have been on the A-10 warplane, she said.</p>
