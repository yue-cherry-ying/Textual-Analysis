<title>RUSSIA: Russia's Gazprom amends charter on share trade.</title>
<headline>Russia's Gazprom amends charter on share trade.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-06-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Russia's Gazprom natural gas monopoly said on Saturday it had changed some of its rules on trade in its shares, including a charter clause saying only nine percent of the company could be sold to foreigners.</p>
<p>But a presidential decree limiting foreign ownership in the world's largest gas company to nine percent remains in force.</p>
<p>A company news release, presented at a news conference after RAO Gazprom's annual shareholders' meeting, said the first deputy head of President Boris Yeltsin's administration, Alexander Kazakov, had been elected Gazprom's board chairman.</p>
<p>Gazprom also said its charter would now require groups holding more than three percent of the company's stock to seek board approval to sell their shares.</p>
<p>Gazprom board member Alexander Semenyaka told Reuters the Federal Commission for the Securities Market, Russia's securities watchdog, was responsible for decisions about how the nine percent stake, about two percent of which is already in foreign hands, would be offered abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;The board no longer regulates the process -- the commission and the presidential decree do,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said only a presidential decree and a decision by the commission could affect how Gazprom sells its shares on foreign markets, but he declined to give more details.</p>
<p>Gazprom also scrapped a charter clause saying owners of Gazprom shares totalling less than three percent of company equity had to seek company approval to sell the shares.</p>
<p>Gazprom Chief Executive Officer Rem Vyakhirev said in a written statement that the company, which has a market capitalisation of more than $16 billion, was in no rush to offer more shares abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;I underscore that we will not rush,&quot; he said. &quot;The seven percent which we can sell abroad will end up on the market over a significant period of time as a favourable market takes shape.&quot;</p>
<p>Gazprom, one of Russia's most powerful companies, accounts for about 60 percent of Europe's gas imports, 34 percent of world gas reserves and 27 percent of global gas production.</p>
<p>The company is 40 percent state owned and has maintained close ties to the government in spite of recent cabinet pressure to pay off its tax arrears, which it has done.</p>
<p>Its American Depositary Receipts are traded in London.</p>
