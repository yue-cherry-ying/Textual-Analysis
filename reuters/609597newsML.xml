<p>Tashi Tenzing reached the top of Mount Everest on Friday, just days before the 44th anniversary of the conquest of the world's highest peak by his grandfather Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Sir Edmund Hillary.</p>
<p>Nepal's Tourism Ministry said as many as 22 mountaineers scaled the 8,848-metre (29,028-foot) Everest on Friday, the most to make it to the peak on any single day since 40 climbers reached the summit on May 10, 1993.</p>
<p>Tenzing, 32, is a travel agent who lives in Sydney. His grandfather died in May 1986.</p>
<p>Hillary's son Peter was the first son of a summiteer to reach the top of the world on May 10, 1990.</p>
<p>The good news was tempered by the death of Salavat Khabiboulline, a 36-year-old construction worker from Ekaterinburg, Russia, who was found dead at a height of 8,250 metres (27,066 feet) on Mount Makalu on May 21.</p>
<p>The tourism ministry said five of Khabiboulline's teammates from a Russian expedition scaled Makalu, at 8,463 metres (27,766 feet) the fifth-highest mountain in the world, on the same day.</p>
<p>Two Malaysians' Mohandas Nagappan, 35, who works for a petroleum company in Kuala Lumpur, and Magendran Muniswamy, 33 a high school teacher from Selangor, reached the summit of Everest along with five Sherpas, the ministry said.</p>
<p>The Malaysians, who were in a race to be the first Southeast Asian men to conquer Everest this spring, were beaten to the summit by two Indonesians on April 26.</p>
<p>Guy Cotter, a 34-year-old leader of an international expedition, reached the top of Everest for the second time. The expedition's deputy, Ed Viesturs, a 37-year-old mountain guide from Seattle, Washington, scaled the mountain for the fifth time.</p>
<p>Finn Veikka Gustafsson, a 29-year-old mountaineer from Helsinki, reached the peak for the second time on Friday, this time without extra oxygen. He was among the 40 successful summiteers in May 1993.</p>
<p>Andres Delgado, a 27-year-old Mexican mountain guide, made it to the top exactly a month after his expedition leader, Briton Malcolm Duff, was found dead at base camp.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday three Icelanders reached Everest's summit to become the first from their country to conquer the world's tallest peak.</p>
<p>Bjorn Olafsson, a 30-year-old computer programmer, Einar Kristjan Stefansson, a 31-year-old engineer and Hallgrimur Magnusson, a rescue worker who celebrates his 34th birthday on Saturday, reached the summit on Wednesday afternoon. All three are from the Icelandic capital Reykjavik.</p>
<p>Another member of the British-Icelandic-Mexican expedition, Nikola Kekus, a 40-year-old engineer from Cumbria in Britain, also made it to the top with the Icelanders, along with two Nepali Sherpas, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Two climbers from a Canadian expedition reached the summit of Everest, called Sagarmatha by Nepalis, on Friday, the tourism ministry said.</p>
<p>Jamie Clarke, 29, and Alan Hobson, 39, both from Calgary, led four Sherpas in two successful assaults on the peak early on Friday, it said.</p>
<p>The latest summiteers takes the total of successful Everest climbers this spring from Nepal to 35.</p>
<p>Two people have died this spring on the Nepali side of Everest and five have died on the Tibetan side.</p>
