<title>USA: CSCE coffee ends mostly up, supply woes persist.</title>
<headline>CSCE coffee ends mostly up, supply woes persist.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE coffee futures ended mostly higher in moderate dealings on Thursday, bolstered by speculative buying amid news of a strike by portworkers at Brazil's key port of Santos, trading sources said.</p>
<p>Benchmark July jumped 5.50 cents per lb on the day, to 216.90 cents, after ranging between 219.20 and 209.50. The back months closed 0.50 to 3.15 higher.</p>
<p>Spot May was the only contract to suffer losses on Thursday, as operators liquidated positions or rolled them forward ahead of the spot month's expiry on May 19.</p>
<p>May dropped 5.65 cents, to 240.00 cents, shrinking the May/July switch to 23.10 cents from 34.25 cents at the close on Wednesday. The July/September switch, however, widened to 22.40 cents from 20.05 cents.</p>
<p>Dealers said news of the Santos portworkers strike, which only affected public terminals, sparked enough buying to trigger technical buy-stops above 213.50 cents basis July.</p>
<p>Santos is Brazil's key coffee loading port, accounting for just under one million bags of the 1.2 million bags covered so far by bills of lading for April shipment.</p>
<p>&quot;It's positive,&quot; said Smith Barney analyst Walt Spilka. &quot;Santos exports coffee, and anything that interferes with exports is going to be supportive.&quot;</p>
<p>The work stoppage, protesting delayed payment of portworkers' full April salary, will continue until the workers recieve written confirmation the port authority has paid the remaining salary, a union official said Thursday.</p>
<p>The remaining payment, about 35 percent of the total April salary, is expected to be deposited today or Friday.</p>
<p>Additionally, Spilka said the coffee market continued to garner support from dwindling stockpiles of exchange certified coffee.</p>
<p>The CSCE reported late Wednesday that U.S. certified coffee stocks fell by 3,000 60-kg bags, to 24,699 bags as of May 6. The stock decline came on the heels of a 13,999-bag drop the previous day.</p>
<p>After Thursday's close, however, the CSCE reported certified coffee stocks increased by 750 bags, to 25,419 bags as of May 7. There were 17,743 bags of coffee pending grading, the exchange said.</p>
<p>If more coffee shows up at the exchange for certification and the Brazilian strike is resolved quickly, some traders said July may try to test key technical support at 209.00 cents. After 209.00 cents, July's next downside target would be near 203.00 cents.</p>
<p>But despite the modest stock build, other traders noted inventories remain extremely low. They said continued supply worries, combined with the start of the Brazilian winter, should underpin prices.</p>
<p>Volume reached an estimated 7,623 lots on the day.</p>
