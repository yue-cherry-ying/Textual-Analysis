<p>Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Saturday that his party Our Home is Russia should field its own candidate in the next presidential election, due in 2000, but stopped short of proposing himself.</p>
<p>The centrist party backed President Boris Yeltsin in his reelection bid last year. The 66-year-old Kremlin leader cannot stand for a third term and the stolid Chernomyrdin is seen as one of Yeltsin's possible successors.</p>
<p>&quot;There is only one recipe (for electoral victory) -- evident changes for the better in the life of our people,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as telling his party's fourth congress in Moscow.</p>
<p>Critics say he lacks the charisma to be able to succeed Yeltsin as president, despite the backing of influential financial groups. Supporters say he would have a chance of winning an election if the state machinery united behind him.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin appealed on Saturday for greater cooperation between democratic and reformist forces ahead of the presidential elections, and parliamentary elections due in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;Coooperation offers a real chance to safeguard our young democracy from any totalitarian assaults,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Chernomyrdin faced some dissent from within his party over future strategy. Sergei Belyayev, who heads the faction in the State Duma lower house of parliament, said the party should be able to formulate policies independently of the government.</p>
<p>&quot;Our movement faces some very difficult times in the near future,&quot; Interfax quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin, 59, kept his job in a recent cabinet reshuffle despite Yeltsin's fierce criticism of his government's budget, its failure to pay wages and pensions and its record on crime and tax collection.</p>
<p>The decision was a reward for Chernomyrdin's loyalty through more than four years as prime minister in which he has almost constantly been under fire in Russia over economic reforms but has established a reputation abroad as a guarantor of stability.</p>
<p>Our Home is Russia won only just over 10 percent of the votes in the last parliamentary poll in 1995 but is the second-largest party in the Duma after the communists.</p>
