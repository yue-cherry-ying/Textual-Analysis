<title>BRAZIL: ADM, Glencore grains deal no shock to Brazil trade.</title>
<headline>ADM, Glencore grains deal no shock to Brazil trade.</headline>
<dateline>RIO DE JANEIRO 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brazil soybean traders said they were not surprised that Archer Daniels Midland Co agreed with Glencore Grain Holding to buy Glenclore's grain facilities in Brazil and Paraguay.</p>
<p>&quot;Talk about this had been going round in the market for sometime. The official version until now had been that Glencore and ADM were negotiating to increase co-operation so this comes as no surprise,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The deal, expected to close in August, includes two terminal elevators at Santos and Tubarao ports, nine owned interior elevators and 23 leased interior elevators in Brazil as well as 23 owned interior elevators in Paraguay.</p>
<p>Traders said Glencore was ADM's biggest supplier out of Brazil and had an agreement this year to ship 1.3 million tonnes of grains. This represented more than half of Glencore Brazil's total business, they said.</p>
<p>Glencore officials here in Brazil declined to comment on the deal, saying that any announcements should come from ADM.</p>
<p>Brazilian traders saw the agreement as a sign major companies were rapidly becoming concerned about securing their position in Brazil.</p>
<p>In April, Brazilian food processor Santista Alimentos, a subsidiary of Bunge y Born, bought Incobrasa's soybean processing and warehousing facilities in the key growing state of Rio Grande do Sul.</p>
<p>Today local business daily Gazeta Mercantil said Santista was to invest 100 million reais (US$93.45 million) in building a new one million tonne processing plant in centre of Sao Paulo state.</p>
<p>&quot;People in the past have been very free to buy product from South America,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;But there has been a gobbling-up of people around the country and if you don't have a good set-up, you could have problems in the future guaranteeing supply,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Brazilian soybean production as estimated by Brazilian Vegetable Oils Industries Association will reach 26.7 million tonnes in this year but could grow to 37.1 million tonnes by 2005.</p>
