<p>A transatlantic dispute over meat inspection procedures blew up Tuesday into a full-fledged trade fight as Washington took action to cut off imports of European Union meat.</p>
<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said three years of negotiations with the EU ended without agreement in time to meet the April 1 deadline, but that talks would continue over the coming months.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Washington slapped the EU with new inspection requirements that threaten to cut off some $300 million in annual meat imports from the EU.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unfortunate that, despite this intensive effort, we were unable to finalise an agreement,&quot; Glickman said. &quot;We intend to continue to work to reach an acceptable agreement in the coming months and to minimise trade disruptions to the extent possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Also affected are some $100 million worth of U.S. poultry, dairy and egg shipments normally sold to the EU. Paul Drazek, senior trade advisor at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said the United States will no longer provide export certificates for the shipments because of new inspection standards imposed by the EU.</p>
<p>Drazek said the action was taken because U.S. and EU negotiators have been unable to come to an agreement in the so-called veterinary equivalency talks.</p>
<p>Some 100 EU slaughter plants will now have to meet USDA meat inspection standards, known as the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points standards. These plants will not be able to ship products to the United States until they meet the U.S. guidelines, Drazek said.</p>
<p>Within a short time, the EU plants will be taken off the USDA's list of approved slaughter plants, he added.</p>
<p>EU meat imports consist mostly of pork from Denmark.</p>
<p>In Brussels, a European Commission spokesman said Washington's move against European Union meat exports is unjustified on health grounds and highly regrettable. &quot;There's no justification for any of this action on health grounds and this is a health matter,&quot; Commission agriculture spokesman Gerard Kiely said. &quot;It's a very regrettable move.&quot;</p>
<p>Both sides have been working to allay consumer concerns about food safety by tightening meat inspection rules.</p>
<p>The veterinary equivalency issue has been a bitter source of dispute between the two sides for years. An agreement would allow each side to accept meat and poultry products from the other even if the inspection methods differ.</p>
<p>Washington has maintained that the United States has recognised equivalent practices by European packing and processing plants and allows imports of EU meat. But it contends that Europe has insisted that U.S. plants follow exactly the same procedures as Europeans, and does not practice equivalency.</p>
