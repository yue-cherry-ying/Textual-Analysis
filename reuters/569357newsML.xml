<p>The Tokyo stock market's key index is likely to hover around 20,000 on Friday, as the buying of major export-oriented issues that led the recent rally will be cooled by the yen's advance against the dollar, brokers said.</p>
<p>But investors are expected to hunt for bargains in other blue-chip issues whose gains have lagged, and this is likely to keep the downside solid, they said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the 225-share Nikkei average rose 12.91 points or 0.06 percent to close at 20,061.81. June Nikkei futures were down 20 points at 20,060.  </p>
<p>&quot;Investors will hesitate to chase export-oriented issues due to the yen's surge,&quot; said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities Co Ltd.</p>
<p>The dollar fell sharply overnight. It traded at around 123.50 yen in early Asia trade on Friday, down over one yen from 124.85/95 in late Tokyo trade on Thursday.</p>
<p>The currency movements will somewhat offset a psychological support factor, which is the strength in U.S. stocks, brokers said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Dow industrials finished up 51 points at 7,137.  </p>
<p>But investor demand is expected to remain firm below the major 20,000 level on the Nikkei 225, with foreign investors especially interested in buying blue-chip laggard issues, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said the focus would be shares in Sony Corp, which announced late on Thursday that its parent current profit for 1996/97 had tripled from the previous year to 85.73 billion yen.</p>
