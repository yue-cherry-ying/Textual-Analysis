<p>The dominating feature of the conclusions of a number of EMU studies by experts on behalf of a group apppointed by Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen is that Finland would face even more risks outside the single currency than by joining, daily Aamulehti reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The expert group's interim report is scheduled for release today at 1030/0730 GMT. Aamulehti said it had had opportunity to review in advance the studies in the report.</p>
<p>&quot;Dominating in the conclusions of the studies is the listing of various risks which is being complicated further by the fact that remaining outside the single currency is regarded as possibly bringing with it bigger difficulties than joining,&quot; the paper said.  </p>
<p>The expert group led by economics professor Jukka Pekkarinen would release on Tuesday an interim report made up of 15 different EMU-related studies, none which directly recommended that Finland should join or remain outside, Aamulehti said.</p>
<p>The group's final report due on May 6 is also unlikely to voice a clear opinion in favour of or against EMU participation, it said.</p>
<p>The group's task is to examine pros and cons of Finnish membership of the third phase of European economic and monetary union, scheduled to start in January 1999. --Helsinki newsroom +358-9-680 50 245, e-mail news@reuters.fi</p>
