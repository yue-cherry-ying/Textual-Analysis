<headline>Zloty again forced below resistance by NBP buying.</headline>
<dateline>WARSAW 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>The Polish zloty again came under upward pressure by foreign investor payments for T-bonds, but its gradual rise met another currency-buying intervention.</p>
<p>Dealers said that the market remained in a currency-selling mood even after the $15 million intervention, but did not test higher levels, wary of sparking more central bank buying.</p>
<p>&quot;The zloty remained strong all day, but its gains were capped by the National Bank of Poland's intervention,&quot; said Zbigniew Choszcz, chief dealer at Bank Gdanski SA.</p>
<p>The zloty closed at 2.53/2.50 percent from the trading band centre, flat from Wednesday's 2.53/2.49 percent close.  </p>
<p>It closed at 3.1540/50 to the dollar, up from 3.1565/75 on Wednesday and at 1.8415/20 to the mark, down from 1.8350/60.</p>
<p>The NBP bought dollars at 3.1549 and 3.1555 zlotys.</p>
<p>Dealers said it was not clear whether the market's currency-selling sentiment would set off another round of interventions on Friday, as most of foreign investors aleady made forex deals ahead of the tender's May 12 value date.</p>
<p>On the money market rates held flat around 23 percent during the day. Overnight rates closed at 22.9/23.30 percent and tomorrow/next at 23.0/23.30.</p>
