<p>The recent fall in the dollar has not forced Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co to alter its plan to invest about 300 billion yen in foreign bonds in fiscal 1997/98.</p>
<p>Shingo Uchiyama, the manager of Dai-Ichi's international fixed income investment section, told Reuters in an interview that the insurer was looking for a good time to buy the bonds as the basic bullish trend of the dollar had not changed.</p>
<p>&quot;I think seven percent (for 30-year U.S. Treasury bond) is probably the right time to buy U.S. Treasuries,&quot; Uchiyama said. Uchiyama said that longer-end T-bond yields are not expected to rise above 7.0 percent as many market participants are showing buying interest in bonds at around that level.</p>
<p>Dai-Ichi Life bought 500 billion yen worth of foreign bonds in 1996/97, boosting the total value of its foreign bond portfolio to one trillion yen, Uchiyama said.</p>
<p>The interest rate differential between Japan and the United States of above four percent is high enough to make overseas investment an attractive option, Uchiyama said.</p>
<p>The gap between the yield of the key 10-year Japanese government bond, which currently stands at 2.580 percent, and the key 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which was at 6.75 percent in late Asian trade, is about 4.17 percent.</p>
<p>Uchiyama said that about 90 percent of Dai-Ichi Life's foreign bonds is held in U.S. dollars and German marks.</p>
<p>He said the company increased its investments in foreign bonds that are denominated in high-yielding currencies like the Canadian dollar and the British pound in 1996/97 in an attempt to acquire higher returns.</p>
<p>&quot;We have lowered our forecast for the dollar/yen to a range of 110-120 yen, but our basic foreign bond investment plan has not changed at this point,&quot; Uchiyama said.</p>
<p>&quot;After the dollar's recent plunge, the market now seems to have calmed down and steadied at around 115 yen,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to a five-month low of 111.98 yen on Tuesday, down some 12 percent from its recent peak of 127.47 yen set on May 1. It was at 115.70/80 yen late on Friday.</p>
<p>Currency and bond traders said Japanese life insurers have been generally quiet since the beginning of the new fiscal year and also limited their sales during the dollar's recent tumble.</p>
<p>Uchiyama, however, said that the company's investment stance is flexible and could change depending on the market trend.</p>
<p>He said that Dai-Ichi Life, which invested 500 billion yen in foreign bonds in the 1996/97 fiscal year, originally planned to cut its bond holdings by 50 billion yen at the beginning of the the fiscal year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company is planning to diversify its foreign bond investment from the current fiscal year by buying U.S. and Asian corporate bonds, Uchiyama said.</p>
<p>&quot;We aim to invest about 10 billion yen for each (U.S. and Asian corporate bonds) to start with,&quot; he said.</p>
