<p>A Hungarian woman, declared dead in 1992, has been held in ice for almost five years because her relatives insist she can be brought back into life.</p>
<p>The Hungarian daily Nepszabadsag said on Monday that the woman, Etelka, died of cancer at the age of 61, but her husband and daughter will not allow her to be buried as they say the body should be taken to the United States where specialists would be able to revive her.</p>
<p>Neither the clinic, where she is in storage in frequently changed plastic bags, nor the local municipality have the right to dispose of the body without the permission of Etelka's relatives.</p>
<p>Nepszabadsag added that the husband took up Etelka's monthly pension for several months after her wife was declared dead, and he is therefore being sued by the social security authorities.</p>
