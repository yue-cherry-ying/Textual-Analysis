<title>USA: COMEX copper ends lower on light volumes.</title>
<headline>COMEX copper ends lower on light volumes.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>COMEX copper futures ended slightly lower Tuesday, on light volume estimated at 7,500 lots, with little sense of direction evident this week, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Easter holiday is still affecting activity and the only sign of life is some small speculators rolling longs out of May into forward months, but I don't regard that as bearish,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>But U.S. February construction spending rose 2.3 percent, its biggest rise since March 1996, suggesting good ongoing demand for copper in that industry, analysts said.</p>
<p>COMEX May copper ended down 1.35 cent at 111.80 cents a pound, after recovering from session lows seen early at 110.20 cents.</p>
<p>Support is seen around last week's low at 109.80 cents, after the contract ran into resistance Monday around last week's high at 113.20 cents.</p>
<p>On the daily charts, momentum oscillators remained mixed, but May copper's five-day (weekly) moving average remains above its 21-day (monthly) average, and above its 55-day (quarterly) average, after a four-month long recovery from the sell off in the wake of last year's Sumitomo scandal.</p>
<p>The COMEX May/July backwardation eased to 3.10 cents from 3.5 cents Monday, with the LME cash-to-three month backwardation around $42.00 a tonne.</p>
<p>Copper stocks continue to fall with LME warehouse stocks down a further 6,226 tonnes Tuesday to 177,250 tonnes. Falls in LME stocks have been offsetting rises in COMEX stocks in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Better-than-expected activity in the U.S. housing and auto sectors in recent data suggests good gains in copper consumption in 1997, though supplies were seen rising this year also, analysts said.</p>
