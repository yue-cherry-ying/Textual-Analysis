<p>Burma's military government on Friday denied it had arrested dozens of members of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party, but a senior opposition source said at least 60 people had been detained.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been informed that none of the members of the NLD has been arrested so far, but requested by the local authorities to refrain from taking the course of action which is geared to create chaos in the country,&quot; a senior government official said in a statement in English faxed to Reuters.</p>
<p>NLD officials in Rangoon said on Friday that at least 60 senior party members from the provinces were arrested by military authorities as they headed to the Burmese capital to attend a party meeting planned for May 27-28.</p>
<p>Several dozen others were detained in their homes and told not go to Rangoon to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>The NLD official said the numbers were expected to rise as the meeting date neared. About 300 top NLD members and party organisers have been invited to attend.</p>
<p>The party gathering is planned to coincide with the seventh anniversary of the NLD's landslide 1990 electoral victory that was never recognised by the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC).</p>
<p>The Burmese government statement questioned the NLD accusations of arrests.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be interesting to know if they (the NLD) could provide us with more substantial facts as which member has been arrested in which police station,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course the NLD's intention is to try to get as much as their members arrested by trying to create a situation where the government has no choice but to take strong counter measures.&quot;</p>
<p>It was &quot;regretful&quot; that the government was being blamed for trying to maintain law and order, the statement said.</p>
<p>The SLORC has been globally condemned for the arrests.</p>
<p>The NLD official said some senior NLD members and party organisers had managed to arrive in Rangoon, and said the party had already begun holding meetings to plan and discuss policy.</p>
<p>The NLD has had few opportunities to gather in a large group since it won the 1990 poll. The SLORC has cracked down on the elected members of parliament and party members ever since.</p>
<p>&quot;We hurriedly decided to take advantage of the fact that some members had arrived, and yesterday we held a preliminary seminar to discuss political business,&quot; the NLD official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we will do our best to gather again...at Daw Suu's house,&quot; he said. &quot;But some people who have arrived in Rangoon have been followed by police and told if they do not return to their respective homes they are liable to be arrested.&quot;</p>
<p>He said many opted to stay in Rangoon at undisclosed places. Some are staying in Suu Kyi's compound. She could not be reached for comment as her telephone line appeared to have been cut.</p>
<p>The NLD official said those who had been arrested or detained in their homes were mainly from the provinces, and so far the senior NLD members in Rangoon had not been affected.</p>
<p>&quot;The members, MPs and organising committee members in Rangoon have not been touched by the SLORC for the time being,&quot; he said. &quot;But I don't know if they will let us go in to her house on the 27th.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year, 261 NLD members, mostly MPs, were arrested ahead of a similar party gathering. But the meeting took place anyway and Suu Kyi announced the NLD planned to revive and continue its efforts to bring democracy to Burma despite the crackdowns.</p>
