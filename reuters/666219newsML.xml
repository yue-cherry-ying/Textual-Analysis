<p>Music star Tabu Ley Rochereau, who fled dictator Mobutu Sese Seko's Zaire in the late 1980s, has returned home from exile and rallied to President Laurent Kabila and his newly named Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>State radio reported that hundreds of fans turned out at Kinshasa's Ndjili international airport on Monday to welcome home Tabu, 57, leader of the band Afrisa.</p>
<p>Tabu, who helped put Zairean music on the world map with the likes of the late Franco Lwambo, lashed out against the Mobutu regime in a song entitled &quot;Exilee&quot; on a 1993 album.</p>
<p>He spent his years of exile shuttling between France and the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;We fought (the former system) with our brothers. We had noble intentions. We want to experience here the best things that we saw abroad,&quot; he told the radio. &quot;The new authorities are young, according to our wishes,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The radio said Tabu was considering retiring in 1998 but had rallied to Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo.</p>
<p>Tabu himself told the radio that once a Kabila ban on political activity had been lifted he would consider participating in politics. &quot;Through my songs, I was on the same side as the current authorities during the struggle,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kabila's forces toppled Mobutu on May 17 after a seven-month civil war.</p>
