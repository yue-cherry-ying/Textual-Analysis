<p>Zaire's embattled President Mobutu Sese Seko has agreed to talks with rebels threatening to overrun the capital Kinshasa, the last stronghold of his collapsing army.</p>
<p>In doing so he may be hoping to find a dignified way out of power after ruling the giant Central African nation largely unchallenged for more than three decades. The rebels insist he must surrender power unconditionally.</p>
<p>Mobutu's security aide, Honore Ngbanda, said on Friday the planned meeting between the president and guerrilla leader Laurent Kabila would focus on transitional arrangements leading to elections.</p>
<p>Mobutu's camp maintains in public that if the president is to go, it is up to Zaireans to vote him out of power in what would be the country's first democratic elections since he took office in a coup d'etat in 1965.</p>
<p>The rebels had agreed on the need for &quot;a transition process leading to transparent and non-exclusive elections&quot;, Ngbanda told a news conference in Kinshasa.</p>
<p>He was referring to a joint communique he and other envoys from Kinshasa signed with a rebel delegation during exploratory talks this month in South Africa.</p>
<p>But the rebels have once again hardened their conditions, saying they will march on the capital if Mobutu refuses at the planned meeting to step aside.</p>
<p>Since taking up arms last October the rebels have swept through more than half the territory of the vast nation, seizing key cities and the richest mineral-producing provinces.</p>
<p>The rebels captured the copper centre of Lubumbashi last week, leaving Kinshasa as the only important city in the hands of Mobutu's ragged army.</p>
<p>Kabila has predicted his forces will be in Kinshasa in three weeks and has ruled out any negotiations or a ceasefire agreement at the planned meeting with Mobutu.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no protracted negotiations with Mobutu, never, never,&quot; Kabila said in a telephone interview from Lubumbashi.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe we have been misunderstood. The issue is about tranfer of power, otherwise we march on Kinshasa.&quot;</p>
<p>Ngbanda declined direct comment on Kabila's statement but said the planned meeting between the two leading protagonists in the Zairean conflict was on course.</p>
<p>South Africa was preparing to host the meeting in Cape Town, possibly on Wednesday, government sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>The emergency rule government in Kinshasa announced on Friday night that efforts to find a venue and time for the meeting were continuing.</p>
<p>&quot;The Foreign Minister, Kamanda wa Kamanda, has been conducting...an official visit to President Pascale Lissouba of Congo and Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo followed by the United Nations Security Council...to follow up negotiations between the government of Zaire and the AFDL (rebel alliance),&quot; Information Minister Kin-Kiey Mulumba said on state television.</p>
<p>Given the conflicting expectations about the planned meeting from the rival camps, the prospects for an early halt to the civil war before it reaches the teeming capital look far from sure.</p>
<p>Some diplomats even doubt if Kabila, who holds the battlefield advantage, is really serious about meeting Mobutu.</p>
<p>&quot;Kabila probably expects that he can reach Kinshasa and be handed the keys as was the case elsewhere,&quot; one diplomat said.</p>
<p>U.S., French, Belgian and British forces based in the nearby Congo capital Brazzaville have stepped up training manoeuvres in case their nationals need to be evacuated from Zaire. About 1,500 Western troops are in Brazzaville.</p>
<p>The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said it suspended relief work for thousands of Rwandan Hutus in eastern Zaire on Friday after Zaireans attacked its staff in a protest over the presence of the unwanted refugees.</p>
<p>Spokeswoman Pamela O'Toole said UNHCR wanted security guarantees from the rebels before resuming aid for more than 80,000 Rwandan Hutus after hundreds of protesters prevented an aid convoy from disembarking from a river ferry on the way to camps.</p>
