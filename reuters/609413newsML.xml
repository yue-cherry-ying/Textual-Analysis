<p>U.S. mortgage-backed securities inched higher in pre-holiday trade on Friday and higher-coupon spreads narrowed considerably to comparable Treasuries, market experts said.</p>
<p>But traders said pass-through spreads should widen out in the next few trading sessions.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not going to stay this tight,&quot; said one mortgage trader at an investment firm in New York, adding that spreads &quot;will widen a couple of ticks next week,&quot; due to their current &quot;over-tightness.&quot;  </p>
<p>Mortgage-backed market players were mostly quiet, anticipating an early departure for a long holiday weekend.</p>
<p>PSA The Bond Market Trade Association recommended an early close -- 1400 EDT/1800 GMT -- for U.S. credit markets on Friday and a full close on Monday for Memorial Day.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just been dead today,&quot; one head Ginnie trader said. &quot;We're only one basis point tighter today -- it's the worst day of the week,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In pass-throughs, Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5-percent coupons were up 3/32 at 99-12/32, yielding 95 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note.  </p>
<p>Comparable Fannie Mae paper was up 4/32 at 99-13/32, and Freddie Mac issues were 2/32 higher at 99-17/32.</p>
<p>In late trading, the five-year note was up 1/32 at 6.58 percent, while the 10-year note was up 3/32 to yield 6.74 percent.</p>
