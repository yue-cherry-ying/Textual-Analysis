<p>Juventus wing Attilio Lombardo, given a last minute Tournoi de France call by Italy, may get the job of countering Brazil dangerman Roberto Carlos when the two countries clash on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Lombardo could play on the right. (Juventus team mate Angelo) Di Livio is a bit tired and we were unable to bring (Eusebio) Di Francesco,&quot; coach Cesare Maldini said after Italy's training session at Lyon's Gerland stadium on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;He will be better countering (Roberto Carlos) attacking than marking,&quot; added Maldini as he hinted at his line-up for the game billed as a rematch of the 1994 World Cup final.</p>
<p>Real Madrid left back Carlos scored with a remarkable banana free kick in Brazil's 1-1 draw with France on Tuesday and is renowned for his long range shots. Maldini will be looking to keep him as busy as possible in defence.</p>
<p>The Italian coach looks set to make several changes from the side beaten 2-0 by England in their first game of France's World Cup warm-up tournament on Wednesday, with his son Paolo back as captain.</p>
<p>Lombardo, who only got his call when Di Francesco had to pull out through injury, could play on the right of a midfield that includes Roberto Di Matteo, who has recovered from a knock on the knee against England, Demetrio Albertini and Dino Baggio.</p>
<p>The winger would link up in attack with his Juventus colleagues Christian Vieri and Alessandro Del Piero &quot;which could be a solution&quot;, Maldini said.</p>
<p>Real Madrid right back Christian Panucci looks set to line up on the right flank behind Lombardo and in direct line with his club colleague Carlos, although entrusted with the task of helping Fabio Cannavaro handle Brazil's twin strike pair Ronaldo and Romario.</p>
<p>&quot;Panucci is in good form. He had two good last games for Real and is one of our freshest defenders,&quot; Maldini said.</p>
<p>Apart from Paolo Maldini, the other survivors of Italy's 1994 World Cup team beaten by Brazil on penalties in Los Angeles, would be Baggio, Albertini, who has recovered from a groin strain, and possibly goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca.</p>
<p>Pagliuca, recalled by Maldini after being discarded by former coach Arrigo Sacchi two years ago, may get his chance for revenge against the Brazilians as first choice Angelo Peruzzi of Juventus is suffering a bout of sinusitis.</p>
<p>&quot;Peruzzi was not feeling very well, this could mean the entry (in the team) of Pagliuca,&quot; the elder Maldini said after a practice which ended with an intense workout for the Internazionale goalkeeper.</p>
<p>Maldini said none of the changes were due to playing deficiencies after the defeat which put England at the top of the tournament table.</p>
<p>Defender Ciro Ferrara and midfielder Giampiero Maini did not practise and have been virtually discarded because of injury.</p>
<p>A salient aspect of the practice in which a possible first team played the rest, was that players shot from a distance whenever they could and the Italians may have seen a weakness in the Brazilians there.</p>
<p>Teams:</p>
<p>Brazil - 1-Taffarel; 2-Cafu, 15-Celio Silva, 3-Aldair, 6-Roberto Carlos; 7-Giovanni, 5-Mauro Silva, 8-Dunga, 10-Leonardo; 9-Ronaldo, 11-Romario.</p>
<p>Italy (probable) - 12-Gianluca Pagliuca; 13-Christian Panucci, 6-Alessandro Costacurta, 5-Fabio Cannavaro, 3-Paolo Maldini; 23-Attilio Lombardo, 10-Demetrio Albertini, 4-Dino Baggio, 8-Roberto Di Matteo; 19-Christian Vieri, 20-Alessandro Del Piero.</p>
