<headline>Gucci China stores beating expectations.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Only weeks after opening its first shops in China, Gucci Group NV said on Tuesday both its Beijing and Shanghai stores were producing better than expected results and it was looking to expand further in China.</p>
<p>&quot;Our results in China are very encouraging -- well, well beyond our expectations, particularly the performance of the Shanghai store,&quot; chief executive officer Domenico De Sole said.</p>
<p>&quot;The first 15 days of the month of March ... we did more than US$100,000 in Shanghai alone,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>De Sole was in Hong Kong after formally opening the two Chinese stores last week. The stores opened for business in February.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that clearly we view China as a very important market,&quot; said De Sole, adding that the Italian luxury goods company was looking to expand in China, possibly opening a store in Guangzhou or another store in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Asia is the fastest growing region for Gucci in terms of sales, with net revenue of US$374.0 million coming from the region in the year to January 31 compared with US$178.7 million the previous year. Gucci's total net sales rose to US$880.7 million in fiscal 1996 compared with US$500.1 million.</p>
<p>Gucci has 20 directly operated stores in Japan and five in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;We are considering a lot of things now in Asia,&quot; said De Sole. He said Gucci was looking to open another shop in Hong Kong and looking at opening two major freestanding shops in Japan.</p>
<p>Gucci is also planning to soon open two stores in Thailand including one in downtown Bangkok this Friday.</p>
<p>Gucci's profits more than doubled in fiscal 1996, with the company registering net income of US$168.4 million compared with US$82.9 million in the previous year.</p>
<p>De Sole said he was comfortable with Wall Street analysts' estimates of earnings per share of US$3.30 for fiscal 1997, up from US$2.76 in the 12 months to January 31.</p>
<p>He said he was also comfortable with forecasts of about 25 percent revenue growth.</p>
