<p>A world conference on endangered species postponed until Wednesday a decision on an application by three southern African states to reopen trade in ivory from their &quot;excess&quot; elephant herds.</p>
<p>But the 10-day Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) on Tuesday rejected an amendment proposed by South Africa that would have eased the ban to allow commercial trade to start only in 1999, with some fixed quotas.</p>
<p>After a heated four-hour debate, conference officials put off voting on the main proposal by Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe calling for immediate trade in ivory, saying the meeting had exceeded the closing time by over an hour.</p>
<p>The debate exposed deep divisions across the globe on how countries view the issue -- and the arguments advanced by Zimbabwe over the past week that most of the rich North was against ivory trade and a majority of the poor South for it.</p>
<p>Delegates from some 62 countries participated in the debate, from the United States to Nepal, Switzerland to war-torn Liberia.</p>
<p>Switzerland hit out at the CITES conference, accusing it of shifting goal posts to deny the southern Africans a legitimate right to sustainable utilisation of their natural resources.</p>
<p>&quot;CITES's credibility is at stake. This is a matter of honesty, consistency,&quot; charged Peter Dollinges, the Swiss team head.</p>
<p>Liberia on the other hand denounced Botswana, Zimbabwe and Namibia of cheating on figures to win votes, alleging that President Robert Mugabe's government had, by claiming their solid backing, misrepresented the views of many African states during and in the run-up to the CITES meeting which ends on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;These countries are not yet ready to deal with the issues of reopening ivory trade and we say they need time to come up with more clear-cut figures,&quot; the Liberian delegate said.</p>
<p>Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe and their supporters, notably Japan, argue that they be allowed some limited but strictly supervised trade because their elephant herd, now estimated at around 150,000, was rising steadily and was doing so even before the 1989 ban.</p>
<p>But the proposal is strongly opposed by some influential green movements and countries, including the United States and from the European Union. They argue lifting the ban will leave elephants at the mercy of poachers.</p>
<p>South Africa's proposed amendment was just three votes short of the 78 three-thirds majority it needed from the 123 countries that voted. Forty-one countries voted against the amendment, and seven abstained.</p>
