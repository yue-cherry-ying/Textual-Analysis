<p>Environmentally-friendly cosmetics retailer Body Shop International Plc said it was in talks with a number of major French retailers to take over the head franchise for its stores in France.</p>
<p>Managing director Stuart Rose said the business needed a French retailer to run it rather than the existing British franchisee.</p>
<p>He said sales in France had suffered from the bombing campaign in 1995 and had never recovered. Rose told Reuters in an interview Body Shop had looked at taking the French franchise over itself.</p>
<p>&quot;We looked at taking it over but decided against it because it really does need a major French retailer to run it.&quot;</p>
<p>Rose said they would make a decision in the next three months.</p>
<p>He said total retail sales in France in the past year were 8.9 million stg, down six percent on the previous year.</p>
<p>The company earlier announced it would make a provision of 6.5 million stg for the French business. Body Shop's overall profits last year fell three percent to 31.7 million, after accounting for the provision.</p>
