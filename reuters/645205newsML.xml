<p>Envoys from Sierra Leone coupmaker Johnny Paul Koromah held talks in Ivory Coast on Saturday in the hope of enlisting its support in heading off military action by Nigeria, Ivorian officials said.</p>
<p>The nine-member team, led by Sierra Leone's ambassador to Guinea, Colonel Mohamed Diaby, met Ivorian Foreign Minister Amara Essy. Essy told Reuters that they were expected to meet President Henri Konan Bedie on Sunday.</p>
<p>Bedie helped to broker a fragile peace in Sierra Leone last year between civilian president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and rebel leader Foday Sankoh, who took up arms in 1991.</p>
<p>Nigeria, which already had troops of the West African ECOMOG force in Freetown under a defence agreement, says Kabbah must be reinstated and has been steadily building up its force in the capital since the May 25 coup.</p>
<p>Fierce clashes broke out with rebels and dissident soldiers after Nigerian gunboats shelled the city on Monday.</p>
<p>Essy said that the delegation told him they were not against democracy but had accused Kabbah of creating instability by arming Kamajor traditional hunters.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the team said they wanted peace and democracy, but they wanted peace more than democracy.</p>
<p>Diaby was kidnapped by rebels in the east in March and was freed only after the coup.</p>
<p>Kabbah and Sankoh signed the peace deal in Ivory Coast in November but implementation dragged and it unravelled.</p>
<p>Sankoh's rebels have rallied to the coup, flooding into the capital Freetown. Sankoh himself is currently in Nigeria under virtual house arrest. Koromah has named him vice-chairman of his Armed Forces Revolutionary Council.</p>
