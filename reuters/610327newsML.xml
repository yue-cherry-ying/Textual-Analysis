<headline>INSTANT VIEW - German state CPI data for May.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Two of the four German states whose data is used to compute preliminary west German consumer prices reported on Friday their inflation data for May.</p>
<p>Bavaria said consumer prices rose 0.5 percent over April for a 1.1 percent year-on-year rate. Baden-Wuerttemberg also said consumer prices rose 0.3 percent for the month and 1.3 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Both states reported higher consumer price data than in April when both states reported month-on-month declines.</p>
<p>Following are comments from economists about the data:</p>
<p>MATTHIAS HAFFNER, ECONOMIST, BZW, FRANKFURT:</p>
<p>&quot;There's not much concern because many of the items that caused the rise were short-term factors, such as food products, heating oil and the notorious holiday expenditures.</p>
<p>&quot;It is something we can live with after the last two reports that were very positive. We would need much higher price increases to see any increase in German interest rates.&quot;  </p>
<p>STEFAN SCHNEIDER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, PARIBAS, FRANKFURT:</p>
<p>&quot;Two things here are a little bit unexpected. Heating oil was still going up in May. Given what happened to crude oil prices, one could have expected a small decline.</p>
<p>&quot;Package tours also contributed to the increase. Tours were higher than in the past because of some seasonal fluctuations. Food prices also inched up somewhat.</p>
<p>&quot;One could argue that a lot of the increase was due to volatile factors that might be reversed. If you take it together with producer price index figures, this means on average that, with the weaker mark and stronger economic activity, we have passed the trough in inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;From a market standpoint, the combination of stonger economic and inflation data is not such a good thing. But this doesn't mean very much for the Bundesbank. To some extent it is month-on-month volatility and the Bundesbank didn't believe inflation would fall that much further anyway.&quot;</p>
