<p>It is possible the yen could strengthen to 103 yen to the dollar, senior Japanese Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Sakakibara, director-general of the ministry's International Finance Bureau, said a strengthening of the yen is possible when looking at currency fluctuations over the past year.  </p>
<p>&quot;Looking at currency fluctuations in the past 10 years, (the dollar/yen rate) moved at an annual average of 23 yen per dollar. This year, the yen weakened up to 127.50 yen to the dollar. If you subtract 23 yen, it is theoretically possible for the yen to strengthen to about 103 yen,&quot; Sakakibara told a parliament committee meeting.</p>
<p>Asked whether there was a risk of Japanese individuals' financial assets, estimated to be around 1,200 trillion yen, flowing overseas with a change in foreign exchange laws, Sakakibara said he was worried that individual investors were putting a lot of funds into foreign bonds and foreign currency deposits without taking into account currency risks.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is important to hedge currency risks when holding dollar assets overseas,&quot; Sakakibara said.</p>
<p>&quot;When looking at individual's foreign bond investments and foreign currency deposits, I'm worried that people are investing without thorough consideration of currency risks, although it is up to them if they want to make the foreign bond investments,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The dollar dropped more than a yen after Sakakibara's comments, from around 124.70 yen before them.</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at around 123.50 at 0800 GMT.</p>
