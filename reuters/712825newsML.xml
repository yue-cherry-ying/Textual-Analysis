<p>The chief of Russia's border guards, General Andrei Nikolayev, is in Tajikistan to discuss a reduction of his forces in the former Soviet republic, a Russian military official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;General Nikolayev will be discussing a 10 percent reduction in Russian troops along the border with Afghanistan,&quot; a spokesman for Russia's Federal Border Service in the Tajik capital Dushanbe told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said Nikolayev, who arrived in Tajikistan on Tuesday for a two-day visit, would meet Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov, Russian and Tajik defence officials and visit the remote, mountainous border with Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In agreement with the Tajik government, Russia deploys some 20,000 soldiers in the Central Asian state. They guard the frontier with Afghanistan and China and perform peacekeeping duties, viewing themselves as a bulwark against militant Islam.</p>
<p>But after a peace agreement signed last month between the republic's secular government and armed Islamic rebels, ending a four-year civil war, Nikolayev is in Tajikistan to review Russian military commitments in the territory.</p>
<p>Russian soldiers have regularly skirmished with opposition guerrillas who operated out of bases across the border in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In June, Russian border guards said they killed about 30 opposition fighters when they tried to cross the border east of Dushanbe. The incident rocked a delicate ceasefire agreed last December.</p>
<p>Nikolayev is likely to discuss how guerrillas will return to Tajikistan from Afghanistan under the peace accord.</p>
<p>A planned troop reduction also sees Russian nerves ease over an advance north towards the former Soviet republics of Central Asia by Afghanistan's purist Islamic Taleban militia in May.</p>
<p>Russian border guards are now kept busy fighting drugs traffickers who cross the treacherous waters of the Pyandzh River in inflatable dinghies to smuggle in opium destined for markets in western Europe from Afghanistan.</p>
