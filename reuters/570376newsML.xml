<p>Growth in British retail sales volumes was the highest in April since November last year, the Confederation of British Industry said in its latest distributive trades survey published on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Retailers will be encouraged to see their expectations for sales growth last month were fulfilled,&quot; said Alastair Eperon, chairman of the CBI distributive trades survey panel.</p>
<p>&quot;The survey shows an encouraging growth in all sectors signalling that consumer confidence is now improving fortunes right across the retail trade.&quot;  </p>
<p>The CBI added that the three monthly average, at +33 percent in April, indicated that the pace of expansion in underlying sales had also picked up slightly, although remained below the rate reported between June 1996 and January 1997.</p>
<p>The CBI said that retailers also expected growth to continue in May at a similar rate to that in April.</p>
<p>Furniture and carpet retailers, booksellers and stationers, hardware, china and DIY stores, grocers and clothing shops reported the greatest growth in sales in April compared with a year ago.  </p>
<p>Stores selling durable household goods and off-licences experienced the lowest growth in volumes compared with a year earlier. Wholesale volumes picked up in April following a slowdown in March, with the rate of increase exceeding expectations.</p>
<p>Business is seen as being well above average for the time of year and to the greatest extent since December 1995.</p>
<p>Orders placed with suppliers rose in April above expectations and increased at the fastest rate since March 1996. Motor traders reported an increase in annual sales volumes in April despite expectations of a decline and after a downturn in March. Sales were considered average for the time of year and orders placed with suppliers were down, although less so than in March.</p>
<p>Volumes are expected to fall slightly in May which would leave business well below average, the CBI said. -- Cheryl Juckes +44 171 542 7715</p>
