<p>Russia's State Duma lower house of parliament will review the government's privatisation programme on May 23, Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Seleznyov told reporters the Duma's special commission to analyse the results of privatisation in 1992-1995 would report to the house on its year-long investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;An enormous amount of material has been collected, basically of a criminal character,&quot; Seleznyov said.</p>
<p>Privatisation Minister Alfred Kokh would attend the session, and Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov, the head of the Federal Security Service and the Prosecutor-General had also been invited to attend, he said.</p>
<p>The Duma set up the commission in January last year, shortly after a parliamentary election resulted in the Communist Party becoming the largest group in the house.</p>
<p>The communists and other opposition groups have strongly criticised privatisation, especially the controversial shares-for-loans programme in which government stakes in state-owned companies were transferred in trust to organisations making loans to the government.</p>
<p>The shares-for-loans scheme was far from transparent, and widely criticised as favouring banks and businesses close to the government.</p>
<p>The entire privatisation process, masterminded by Anatoly Chubais who is now First Deputy Prime Minister in charge of the economy, was the biggest peaceful transfer of property in history, moving thousands of companies into private hands within a few years.</p>
<p>But the sheer volume of the programme meant that it was inevitably somewhat rough and ready.</p>
