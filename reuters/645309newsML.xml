<p>President Clinton accepted the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown Saturday and thanked him for his &quot;unceasing commitment to the rights of veterans.&quot;</p>
<p>In a letter to Brown, a partially disabled Marine combat veteran, Clinton said he accepted &quot;with deep regret&quot; the decision to leave his post effective July 1.</p>
<p>&quot;Your many contributions will long stand as evidence of your unceasing commitment to the rights of veterans and the honour they deserve,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>White House officials said Clinton has not chosen a successor for Brown, one of highest ranking blacks in the administration. One official, however, pointed out that the department's deputy secretary, Hershel Gober, is a close friend of the president.</p>
<p>Brown, a former Marine who was wounded in Vietnam, said in his letter of resignation that he was leaving his post after more than four years because its &quot;responsibilities are too important to be treated or considered as career employment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To do so, would not be in the best interest of our veterans,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Saying he had &quot;great ambivalence&quot; about his decision, Brown told Clinton, &quot;It is now time for me to step aside and allow someone else to carry the cause to even greater heights.&quot;</p>
<p>White House officials said they were not surprised by Brown's resignation, noting that he had indicated last year that he did not intend to serve a second full term as head of the department.</p>
<p>Brown, who had worked for the Disabled American Veterans organisation before becoming a Cabinet officer in 1993, was ambushed in a Vietnamese rice paddy, leaving him with a paralysed right arm.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1965, in one short moment, my life was changed by a shot I never heard,&quot; Brown recalled in his letter of resignation.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the succeeding 32 years, I have been driven by an obsession to make sure that veterans, whose lives have also been changed, are not disadvantaged by having honourably served in the military,&quot; said Brown.</p>
<p>The Veterans Administration is one of the largest of the departments in the federal government, with a budget of $41 billion annually.</p>
