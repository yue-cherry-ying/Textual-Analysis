<p>&quot;Titanic,&quot; a musical about a great British sea disaster, and Janet McTeer, a rising young British actress, took Broadway's top honours at the 51st annual Tony awards on Sunday.</p>
<p>Alfred Uhry's &quot;The Last Night at Ballyhoo,&quot; a comic drama about southern Jews on the eve of the Second World War, was named the year's best play after being snubbed by the Pulitzer Prize committee, which this year gave no award for drama.</p>
<p>&quot;Titanic&quot; was the great triumph of the night, even though the revival of the musical &quot;Chicago&quot; won six awards, one more than it did. Critics predicted long before the show's opening that &quot;Titanic&quot; would drown in a sea of red ink. Instead it won Tonys for best book, score, orchestration, musical and scenic design.</p>
<p>McTeer was named Broadway's best actress for her role as a woman struggling for her rights in Ibsen's &quot;A Doll's House.&quot; Clearly delighted, McTeer said that until four months ago she had never seen a play on Broadway.</p>
<p>It was one of four awards for the play, which also included the award for the year's best revival. Anthony Page, who directed the London-born production, was named best director and Owen Teale was named best featured actor in a play.</p>
<p>Canadian actor Christopher Plummer won the best actor award for his one man show, &quot;Barrymore,&quot; in which he plays the legendary actor John Barrymore.</p>
<p>Plummer plays one of acting's most notorious drinkers and after winning his second Tony, he told reporters he doesn't drink on stage. &quot;You can't be a drunk and play a drunk. I wish you could,&quot; he said.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Titanic&quot; had stiff competition from the hit revival of &quot;Chicago,&quot; and the new musical about Times Square prostitutes, &quot;The Life,&quot; which took Tonys for best featured performers in a musical.</p>
<p>&quot;Chicago&quot; was named the year's best musical revival. Its female star Bebe Neuwirth won the best actress in a musical award, and its male lead, James Naughton, was named the best actor in a musical.</p>
<p>Peter Stone of &quot;Titanic&quot; won for best book and its Jonathan Tunick won for orchestration, the first time the Tonys -- Broadway's version of the Oscars -- gave such an award.</p>
<p>Maury Yeston, who did the music and lyrics for &quot;Titanic,&quot; won for best original score. Stewart Laing won for best scenic design for his work on &quot;Titanic.&quot;</p>
<p>Ann Reinking, the choreographer of &quot;Chicago,&quot; was named best choreographer and she tearfully accepted the award. She choked back tears and proclaimed, &quot;This one is for you Bobby.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a reference to her mentor, the late Bob Fosse, who created the original production of &quot;Chicago.&quot; When it first played Broadway more than two decades ago, it was nominated for 11 Tonys and failed to win a single one.</p>
