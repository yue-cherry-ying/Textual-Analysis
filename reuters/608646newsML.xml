<p>Australian paedophile suspect Phillip Bell is expected to be extradited from South Africa within days to stand trial back home, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>Bell, who faces 215 sex offences relating to boys aged 10 to 18 in Australia, is in South African police custody awaiting his deportation.</p>
<p>Two New South Wales policemen due to escort Bell to Australia arrived in South Africa this week and were meeting him at his cell in the small Eastern Cape town of Humansdorp on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;They have arrived earlier than actually necessary because they consider some preliminary work has to be completed before Bell's return,&quot; Australian High Commission spokesman Matt Anderson told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The extradition documents are with the (South African) Minister of Justice and it is our understanding that he will be reviewing them on Monday,&quot; Anderson said.</p>
<p>Eastern Cape Attorney General Les Roberts, who is handling Bell's case, also confirmed that the deportation would take place shortly, and added:</p>
<p>&quot;Once the extradition papers are signed (by Justice Minister Dullah Omar), Bell will be surrendered to the Australian police.&quot;</p>
<p>An official in Omar's office told Reuters they were expecting to receive the extradition papers on Friday afternoon and would expedite the matter.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to deal with this as soon as possible. So, yes, it could be that he is extradited to Austrilia on Monday, or possibly even this weekend,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>The reputed millionaire recently waived a legal battle to prevent his extradition in exchange for South African authorities declining to prosecute him on allegations he may have sexually molested a 13-year-old boy during his stay in the country.</p>
<p>Bell, 62, was arrested in the surfing mecca of Jeffrey's Bay in January, where he ran a surfing school for youngsters, after a 10-month worldwide police hunt.</p>
