<title>USA: INSIGHT - Dollar seen treading path lower near term.</title>
<headline>INSIGHT - Dollar seen treading path lower near term.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Chartists warned that the dollar may be headed for further downside tests that could soon push the U.S. currency below the 1.70 marks threshold.</p>
<p>The dollar was last below that level on April 22, when it traded at 1.6958 marks.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that we broke through that support (at 1.71 marks) is not a good sign,&quot; said Randolph Donney, director of capital markets research at Pegasus Econometric Group.</p>
<p>&quot;We may just trade down towards that 1.6960 area sooner rather than later,&quot; said Donney, adding that could happen in the next day or two.  </p>
<p>Donney noted that a major grouping of lows from April 21 and 22 are clustered near 1.6960 marks.</p>
<p>The dollar opened at 1.7120/30 marks on Thursday, but by midday, it had tumbled to 1.7070/80 marks.</p>
<p>Chartists also identified levels of support for the dollar prior to the 1.6960 marks level.</p>
<p>Donney cited Bollinger band support on the daily technical charts at 1.7045 marks.</p>
<p>Indeed the dollar had briefly dipped to 1.7045 marks during U.S. dealings on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Below 1.7045 marks, MCM CurrencyWatch senior technical analyst Scott Siller pegged dollar support at 1.70 marks.</p>
<p>The dollar looks like it will test 1.70 marks, a 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the move from 1.6615 on March 31 to 1.7395 on April 28, according to Siller.</p>
<p>&quot;Daily studies are bearish and the weekly studies are now starting to kick in. And a few more down days like this, and I could see a major, major correction in the dollar,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Against the yen, the dollar was barely changed in U.S. dealings, trading at 123.75/80 at 1300 EDT/1700 GMT versus 123.72/77 at the open.  </p>
<p>Siller noted that a rising support line dating back to February 28 comes in in the area of 123.25 to 123 yen.</p>
<p>He warned that a decisive loss of support at 123.25 to 123 yen could &quot;open a can of worms.&quot;</p>
<p>Specifically, he said that could open up a test of 122.40 yen and 120 yen.</p>
<p>The dollar last traded below 123 yen on April 4, when it hit an intraday low of 122.40 yen.</p>
