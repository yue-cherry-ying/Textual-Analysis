<headline>China slams UNESCO over prize for jailed reporter.</headline>

<p>China on Thursday lashed out at a U.N. group for awarding a press freedom prize to a jailed Chinese journalist, warning that the move would harm Beijing's cooperation with the organisation.</p>
<p>The U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) on Saturday gave its $25,000 World Press Freedom award to Chinese reporter Gao Yu, who is serving six years in jail for leaking state secrets.</p>
<p>&quot;Because (UNESCO) has interfered in China's internal affairs and interfered in our nation's judiciary...this will definitely affect the cooperative relations between us,&quot; Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to reveal now in what spheres our cooperation might be affected,&quot; Shen told a news briefing.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is paying a courtesy visit to China, tried to play down the issue and said it had not come up in his discussions with Chinese leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure there is an issue yet,&quot; Annan told reporters. &quot;I don't want to escalate it into an issue.&quot;</p>
<p>Gao had been punished according to Chinese laws and UNESCO's decision constituted a &quot;gross interference&quot; in China's internal affairs, Shen said.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem of Gao Yu is absolutely not a problem of press freedom,&quot; Shen said.</p>
<p>Arrested in 1989 after the military crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, Gao was released after 14 months in detention without trial.</p>
<p>She was re-arrested in 1994 on the eve of her planned departure to attend Columbia University in the United States, and jailed after a secret trial that November on charges of passing state secrets to foreigners.</p>
<p>In January, China released on parole Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang, who was sentenced in 1994 to 12 years in prison for stealing state secrets about internal policies on interest rates and gold.</p>
<p>His conviction had been seen as an attempt by Beijing to intimidate Hong Kong media in the run-up to the British colony's handover to Chinese rule and to stop the territory's reporters from uncovering news not published in the official media.</p>
