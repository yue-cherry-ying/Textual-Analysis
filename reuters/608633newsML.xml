<p>The World Bank on Friday welcomed Zimbabwe's pledge to halve its budget deficit by 2001 but warned that the government would have to hack back government spending considerably to achieve its target.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe said on Thursday it planned to cut its budget deficit to five percent of Gross Domestic Product by 2001 from 11.1 percent at present.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome the determination of the Zimbabwean authorities to move decisively on the issue of the budget deficit,&quot; Callisto Madavo, World Bank vice-president for Africa, told reporters during an investment conference.</p>
<p>&quot;If we were indeed to see it come down to five or four percent in that time frame this would be good news indeed and would send a very positive signal to the private sector and potential investors,&quot; Madavo said.</p>
<p>But he said the deficit would be brought down only if the government reformed radically its expenditure by cutting subsidies to state enterprises and reducing its wage bill by reforming the civil service.</p>
<p>It also had to reduce its interest bill by finding other ways of supporting development than continuously borrowing in the domestic market which crowded out the private sector.</p>
<p>The government of President Robert Mugabe has faced stern criticism for its high fiscal deficit. It failed in the last two years to meet its budget targets, with deficit predictions for both 1995/96 and 1996/97 of 6.7 and 8.5 percent respectively proving wide of the mark.</p>
<p>Madavo ackowledged there had been some exceptional circumstances with the settlement of a public sector strike last year costing an extra Z$2.0 billion ($177 million).</p>
<p>Alassane Outtara, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said on Thursday that Zimbabwe's commitment to reducing the deficit meant the Fund could now begin negotiations on resuming economic aid.</p>
<p>The second phase of Zimbabwe's Economic Structural Adjustment Programme has been put on hold pending progress on the budget issue.</p>
<p>Madavo said it was very important for the future of the country to get an early agreement with the Fund. This could unlock other donor support, as well as World Bank balance of payments assistance.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no more urgent business for this country than tackling the budget deficit,&quot; he said.</p>
