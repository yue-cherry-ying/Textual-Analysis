<p>A U.S. District Court judge Thursday rejected a move by Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc. to look at a large trove of privileged government documents, choosing instead to compromise.</p>
<p>Judge Thomas Hogan's ruling came in sparring between the Federal Trade Commission and the two chains in advance of a week-long trial that begins May 19.</p>
<p>The government is seeking a preliminary injunction to halt a proposed $4 billion merger of the office superstore chains, contending the new combined company would raise prices to consumers.</p>
<p>The chains and the FTC have been involved in a series of convoluted disputes over witnesses, experts and secret documents.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Hogan permitted Office Depot and Staples to switch economic experts -- although the government argued the late change would not permit its lawyers time to prepare to question him.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Hogan rejected an effort by the superstore chains to pry open documents that the government said were privileged attorney papers.</p>
<p>FTC attorney Mel Orlans said the chains wanted to look at his private papers, while the government was barred from looking at the equivalent working papers of lawyers for Staples and Office Depot.</p>
<p>In a compromise ruling, Hogan said he would look at 10 documents from each side and rule on whether they should be opened.</p>
<p>Hogan has said he will rule by mid-June on whether to grant the governnment request for a preliminary injunction to halt the merger.</p>
<p>If he rules for the government it will trigger a full-blown admnistrative law trial that will last months. But lawyers for Staples and Office Depot have said that if they lose in Hogan's court, the merger proposal will be dropped.</p>
