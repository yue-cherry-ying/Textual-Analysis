<headline>LPC-Revlon, banks ready $750M loan refinancing.</headline>
<text>
<p>NEW YORK, May 8 (LPC) - Chase Manhattan Corp, Lehman Brothers' commercial paper unit and Citibank are syndicating a $750 million loan that drops pricing significantly on an existing $600 million credit for Revlon Inc, market sources said.</p>
<p>The five-year loan is split between a $300 million multi-currency facility, a $200 million acquisition facility, a $50 million letter of credit facility and a $200 million term loan, according to bankers.</p>
<p>Of the term loan, $115 million will be drawn at close and used for working capital. The remaining $85 million must be drawn before September 15, 1997 and used for the redemption of Revlon's 10.875 percent sinking fund debentures due 2010, sources said.</p>
<p>The term loan has a minimum annual amortization of $1 million, sources said.</p>
<p>The existing $600 million deal was put in place by Chemical Bank and Citibank in January 1996.</p>
<p>It was split between a $220 million multi-currency RC, a $200 million acquisition RC, a $50 million standby LC and a $130 million term loan, according to bankers.</p>
<p>The loan being refinanced matures on March 31, 1999 and is currently priced at 250 basis points over the London inter-bank offered rate, with a 50 basis points commitment fee, sources said.</p>
