<p>The mayor of a northern Japanese city apologised after he made some 20 female bathers steaming mad when he peeked into the ladies' dressing room of a hot springs health spa during a tour of the city-run facility.</p>
<p>Yoichiro Iino, mayor of Kitakata in mountainous Fukushima prefecture, 240 km (140 miles) northeast on Tokyo, said he had &quot;no ulterior motives&quot; when he peeked into the ladies' dressing room of the newly-opened spa, run by his city.</p>
<p>&quot;I was worried about how turnout would be after the (April 15-17) free entry promotion ended,&quot; the 72-year-old mayor said, adding he was sorry for being careless.</p>
<p>Iino was berated by several naked middle-aged women when he examined their dressing room on April 18 during an official inspection of the spa, witnesses said.</p>
