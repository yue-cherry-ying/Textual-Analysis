<title>THAILAND: Thai PM says Burma leader mulling retirement - paper.</title>
<headline>Thai PM says Burma leader mulling retirement - paper.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-04-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Thai newspaper on Saturday quoted the country's Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh as saying his Burmese counterpart General Than Shwe is considering giving up his top position.</p>
<p>Chavalit said he believed Than Shwe did not want to stay on in the position and was thinking of retiring, according to the report in the English-language newspaper The Nation.</p>
<p>Than Shwe, who is also chairman of Burma's ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), is known to have close ties with SLORC leaders.</p>
<p>But Chavalit was quoted as saying that Than Shwe could not yet quit due to problems with a reshuffle in the lower-level Burmese military hierarchy.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Than Shwe) is thinking of retiring, but there are some hitches at the lower level which require the further rearrangement of officials,&quot; Chavalit said.</p>
<p>&quot;General Than Shwe does not want to stay on in his position, which is somewhat like the case of General Saw Maung. These people are not bad people,&quot; he said on Friday during a visit to Kanchanaburi near Thailand's western border with Burma.</p>
<p>General Saw Maung headed the SLORC when it took power after crushing pro-democracry street protests in 1988 in which thousands were killed or imprisoned. But he quit as SLORC's top general in 1992.</p>
<p>In late 1988, Chavalit visited Burma to meet the country's top generals despite an internationally-imposed isolation of the country when the military seized power.</p>
<p>The Thai premier plans to visit Burma in the near future, the newspaper said without giving further details.</p>
<p>Some diplomats and analysts have speculated that there might be a split within the secretive SLORC between hardliners and moderates and that could lead to a restructuring of Burma's leadership in the future.</p>
<p>Than Shwe is considered a moderate leader within the SLORC, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Burmese military sources have denied rumours of any split.</p>
<p>Burma has recently been hit by religious unrest and a bomb attack at the home of the SLORC's hardline Secretary Two, General Tin Oo, which killed his daughter.</p>
<p>The country has also been fraught with international image problems as it continues to curb the pro-democracy movement led by opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
