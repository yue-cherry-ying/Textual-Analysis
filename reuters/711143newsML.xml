<p>The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into the business of registering Internet addresses, a spokewoman for the agency said Monday.</p>
<p>Last week, the leading registration company, Network Solutions Inc., revealed it had received a request for documents from the Justice Department as part of the investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking at the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the Internet address registration industry,&quot; a spokeswoman for the agency said.</p>
<p>All Internet addresses end with a short designation, usually three letters, known as a top-level domain.</p>
<p>Under a contract with the National Science Foundation, Herndon, Va.-based Network Solutions has a monopoly to register Internet addresses in the most popular domains, including &quot;.com&quot; for commercial sites and &quot;.org&quot; for sites run by non-profit organisations.</p>
<p>The company has struggled to cope with surging demand for Internet addresses, dozens of lawsuits arising from alleged trademark infringements in address names and difficulty collecting fees from some Internet users.</p>
<p>In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in preparation for a public stock offering, Network Solutions said it received on June 27 a &quot;civil investigative demand&quot; from the Justice Department.</p>
<p>The demand requested documents and information from the company and its corporate parent, Science Applications International Corp. The government investigation followed a private lawsuit filed against the company in March alleging violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act.</p>
<p>Network Solutions officials were not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>In its filing, the company said it is not aware of the scope or nature of the investigation.</p>
<p>In its initial public offering, the company plans to raise $35 million, but has not revealed how many shares would be sold or at what price.</p>
<p>For the three months ending March 31, the company had income of $516,000 on revenues of $8.7 million, compared with a loss of $1.1 million on revenues of $2.3 million for the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>The filing comes amidst a period of upheaval and uncertainty for Internet address registrations.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation has said it will not renew its exclusive agreement with Network Solutions when the contract expires in March 1998.</p>
<p>A group of Internet organisations and companies has proposed a new plan for assigning addresses through at least 28 competing registrars, but the plan may not go into effect. The federal government has established an interagency task force to examine possible solutions. Last week, the Commerce Department asked for comments from the public on the issue.</p>
