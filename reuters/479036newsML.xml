<p>Turkish security forces killed 56 Kurdish guerrillas in the southeast of Turkey, the semi-official Anatolian news agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The agency said that 43 &quot;terrorists&quot;, a term normally used to refer to members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), were killed in the southeastern Tunceli province in operations backed by air power in the last three days.</p>
<p>A further 13 rebels were killed in Sirnak province, also in the southeast, the agency said. It did not say when these deaths occurred.</p>
<p>No details of security force casualties were given. Two rebels were captured wounded in the operations, the agency said.</p>
<p>More than 21,000 people have been killed in the 12-year conflict between the Turkish security forces and the PKK which is fighting for independence or autonomy in the mainly Kurdish southeast.</p>
