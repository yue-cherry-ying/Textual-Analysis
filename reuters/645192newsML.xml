<p>Burundi's ousted civilian president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya left the U.S. embassy in the capital Bujumbura on Saturday after taking refuge there almost a year ago, government officials and witnesses said.</p>
<p>In the presence of Roman Catholic bishops, Ntibantunganya held talks that centred on security with the man who replaced him, moderate ethnic Tutsi President Pierre Buyoya, before he emerged, Ntibantunganya aide Venerand Musaya told reporters.</p>
<p>He immediately called for a negotiated settlement involving all parties to the conflict in his tiny and volatile state.</p>
<p>&quot;I reaffirm that I shall not yield on the principle for a search for a negotiated solution for all problems that face our country. This approach must be guarded by tolerance, mutual respect and a strong resolve to save a nation more than ever confronted by numerous uncertainties,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Government officials in Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania were all happy with Ntibantunganya's freedom but added that the real test was whether all freedoms for the former president would continue to be respected in coming days even if he differed with Buyoya.</p>
<p>&quot;It depends on what will happen to him now. We don't know what the long-term (plans are). We have to be careful,&quot; said Tanzanian presidential spokesman Patrick Chokola.</p>
<p>Ntibantunganya's freedom immediately underlined Burundi's sharp ethnic divide, with majority ethnic Hutus celebrating but many among the minority Tutsis grumbling about the terms.</p>
<p>He spoke to reporters from the new residence the govbernment has provided for him in the wealthy Kiriri surburb of the capital Bujumbura, and which has a view of Lake Tanganyika.</p>
<p>The government has also given him two luxury Mercedes Benz limousines and several bodyguards, government officials said.</p>
<p>A journalist said Tutsi residents were complaining that former president Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, a Tutsi, lived under virtual house arrest and his bills were not met by government.</p>
<p>Hutus saw Ntibantunganya's freedom as a sign that Buyoya was serious about ending Burundi's ethnically-based crisis and could enlist Ntibantunganya's services in talks with Hutu rebels.</p>
<p>Buyoya announced this month his government had signed a pre-ceasefire agreement with the rebel Hutu National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), after direct talks in Rome.</p>
<p>Ntibantunganya said: &quot;I return with the same will and commitment that has always characterised my life in relation to the conflict that has torn my country for many decades. This conflict will be able to find a durable and solid solution through negotiations that include all parties, and without one thinking of dominance of the other.&quot;</p>
<p>African diplomats said Buyoya was keen to convince regional African leaders that he was doing all in his power to end ethnic tensions in his country and return a semblance of order.</p>
<p>Ntibantunganya's freedom followed Buyoya's talks with regional leaders at the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit in Zimbabwe last week at which it was suggested that Buyoya ought to do more to ensure lasting peace in his country.</p>
<p>Regional countries imposed sanctions on landlocked Burundi days after the 25 July 1996 coup and demanded that it be returned to constitutional rule and Buyoya open talks with Hutu rebels. In April, the countries agreed to ease the sanctions.</p>
<p>Ntibantunganya was Burundi's third civilian president at the time he was toppled. Burundi's first fairly elected head of state, Melchior Ndadaye, was killed in 1993 by hardliners in the army, which is 95 percent composed of the Tutsi minority.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 people have been killed in massacres and a civil war between the army and rebels since Ndadaye was killed.</p>
