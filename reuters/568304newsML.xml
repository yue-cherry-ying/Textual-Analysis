<p>Canadian T-bills opened little changed on Thursday, amid a lack of significant Canadian economic data, with the market remaining focused on the next likely move in U.S. interest rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is still looking forward to the FOMC at the latter part of May here. Until that time I see the market in a trading range,&quot; said Doug Sannuto, managing director of Canada cash markets with Bank of Montreal.</p>
<p>Canada's three-month when-issued T-bill softened to yield 3.10 percent from 3.09 percent at the close of trading on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Canadian T-bills this week have traded largely on varying speculation about whether the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting open market committee will hike rates when it meet on May 20. A Fed tightening is seen putting pressure on the Bank of Canada to follow suit in order to defend the strength of the Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>In other prices, the six-month when-issued T-bill traded with a yield of 3.50 percent, unchanged from the close of trading on Wednesday. The one-year T-bill softened to yield 4.10 percent from 4.09 percent.  </p>
<p>The call loan rate traded at 3.15 percent, in the upper half of Bank of Canada's 2.75-3.25 percent target range. Dealers said the rise in the call loan rate was due to normal settlement pressures from Tuesday's weekly T-bill auction.</p>
