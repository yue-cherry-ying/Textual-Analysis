<p>A senior United States official said on Tuesday Washington wanted a resolution criticising China to emerge from the United Nations Human Rights Commission currently in session in Geneva.</p>
<p>Bill Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in New York and a member of President Bill Clinton's cabinet, was speaking at a news conference after telling the Commission China &quot;continues to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our hope is to be part of a human rights resolution (on China) that emerges from our European colleagues,&quot; he declared, saying a prime purpose of his Geneva trip was to rally support against Chinese blocking tactics on the issue.</p>
<p>Washington was &quot;determined that there be a human rights resolution in some fashion,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He was speaking amid clear signs that the 15-nation European Union, which over the past few years has sponsored the annual bid to have China condemned by the 53-member Commission, would not unite this year behind a text.</p>
<p>France said last week it would not go along with a resolution again, arguing that &quot;constructive dialogue&quot; with Beijing was more productive than pushing without success for condemnation of China in the U.N. body.</p>
<p>Some other EU states, including Germany, are sympathetic to the French stance, according to diplomatic sources.</p>
<p>For the past six years, China has fought off even the tabling of a resolution on its rights record by winning majority support in the Commission for a &quot;no action&quot; motion, and diplomats say it is well positioned to succeed again.</p>
<p>Richardson said he would be engaged in &quot;quite active lobbying&quot; against the &quot;no action&quot; motion and would aim at what he called &quot;eight or nine swing votes that are moving rapidly&quot; in a bid to defeat it.</p>
<p>But he declined to say if the United States would produce a resolution of its own on China if the Europeans failed to agree on a text.</p>
<p>In his speech to the Commission, briefly interrupted by a Chinese delegate who accused him of abusing his status as a guest, Richardson hailed improvements in living standards and &quot;some positive reforms in the rule of law&quot; in China.</p>
<p>But Beijing continued &quot;to severely restrict fundamental freedoms of speech, the press, assembly, association and religion, in violation of internationally-accepted norms,&quot; he declared.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not seek confrontation over this issue, but we firmly believe that the PRC (People's Republic of China) should be held accountable, and certainly at the United Nations Human Rights Commission, to the international standards that China itself has endorsed,&quot; the U.S. envoy added.</p>
<p>He said he would also be looking for resolutions condemning Cuba, Burma and Sudan among others.</p>
<p>China accuses Western countries of using the Commission to target emerging economies, arguing that no country's record on human rights is perfect.</p>
