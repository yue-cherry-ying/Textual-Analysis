<p>Indonesian tyre-grade SIR20 rubber prices were stable in late trading on Tuesday, with demand remaining thin, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said a deal was done in the afternoon at 50.25 U.S. cents/lb fob Medan for June shipment. They said they did not hear of deals in other cities.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't believe that a deal has been done in this kind of (weak market) situation,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said offer prices were stable at 50.50 fob Surabaya and Medan, 50.00 fob Palembang and 49.75 fob Padang.  </p>
<p>Offer prices were unchanged fob Pontianak and Jambi at 49.50.</p>
<p>&quot;There were some enquiries in Medan at 50.00 U.S. cents/lb. But traders did not want to sell because such prices are just too low,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said supply was tight in Medan due to wintering but it had not prompted buying interest as the supply situation in other growing areas were not affected.</p>
<p>They also said demand was poor because tyre makers in the United States already had sufficient stocks while others were waiting for values to decline further.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is a buyers' market. Buyers are controlling the market while we have to sell as we need the money,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said the poor market sentiment was also sparked by the decline in Japanese prices.</p>
