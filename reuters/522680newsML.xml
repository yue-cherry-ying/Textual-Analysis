<p>A new controversy surrounded Peru's four-month-old hostage crisis on Saturday with the announcement that the government told a senior Red Cross official who had worked closely with the captives and their relatives to leave the country.</p>
<p>International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) officials said Juan Pedro Schaerer, the organisation's number two official in Lima, left Peru on Wednesday at the request of the government.</p>
<p>The decision to expel Schaerer, a 33-year-old Argentine- born Swiss who has worked with the ICRC wince 1991, took the organisation by surprise, &quot;but since they asked us, we had no choice,&quot; said Ruben Ortgea, an ICRC spokesman in Geneva.</p>
<p>There has been no official explanation for the expulsion.</p>
<p>&quot;We are sending a high-level representative to Lima next week to try to find out what it is all about,&quot; Ortgea said.</p>
<p>The Red Cross has provided food and humanitarian aid to hostages inside the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima since heavily armed Marxist rebels stormed a party on Dec. 17.</p>
<p>Relatives of the 72 VIPs being held by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) voiced their growing frustration on Saturday with the slow pace of moves to end the siege.</p>
<p>&quot;This situation which is so unfair for him and for us should not continue any longer,&quot; relatives of captive Supreme Court justice Hugo Sivina wrote in a letter to President Alberto Fujimori published in El Comercio daily newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;We appeal once again to you ... to listen to the clamour of the Peruvian people and find a way which allows a prompt and peaceful solution ... because we think that so much time has gone by that we have a right to be heard,&quot; said the letter, signed by 20 family members of Sivina.</p>
<p>Relatives of the 72 hostages have grown increasingly vocal in recent weeks as secret talks to end the 123-day-long siege have produced no concrete results. The sticking point in negotiations remains the MRTA's main demand for the release of about 450 jailed comrades in exchange for their captives.</p>
<p>In a new demand on Friday, the rebels called for urgent medical treatment for 30 seriously ill MRTA inmates in top security Peruvian jails.</p>
<p>The list, sent to Reuters in a statement, included MRTA leader Victor Polay Campos and New Yorker Lori Berenson, who was sentenced in 1995 to life imprisonment for alleged involvement in a plot to capture Congress.</p>
<p>Polay has a broken collarbone, failing eyesight and suffers from malnutrition, the MRTA said. Berenson, who is held in the Yanamayo jail in the Andes, has bronchitis and tendonitis.</p>
<p>The MRTA has repeatedly tried to use the hostage crisis to draw attention to what it calls inhumane conditions for Peruvian prisoners convicted under special anti-terrorism legislation, calling the cells where they are kept &quot;tombs&quot;.</p>
<p>The MRTA captured more than 500 people but freed most, holding the VIPs, including the ambassadors of Japan and Bolivia, two Peruvian government ministers, two dozen Japanese diplomats and businessmen and Fujimori's younger brother.</p>
