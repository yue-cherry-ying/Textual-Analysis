<p>Gunmen on motorcycles fired on a crowded market in the town of Warbartan in Pakistan's Punjab province on Saturday, killing eight people and wounding 10, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They said the attackers used Kalashnikov assault rifles to spray bullets in the bazaar about 11 a.m. (0700 GMT). Most of the victims were Shi'ite Moslems, they added.  </p>
<p>No other details were immediately available about the shooting in Warbartan, about 60 km (37 miles) northwest of the Punjab provincial capital Lahore.</p>
<p>The attack occurred only hours after gunmen killed six Shi'ites at 4 a.m. (2300 GMT Friday), while they slept on the street in the village of Mondka, in the Punjab district of Khangarh.</p>
<p>The dead in the earlier attack included the local head of the Shi'ite Tehrik-i-Jafria Pakistan (TJP) group, identified only as Mushtaq, and several of his relatives, hospital sources said.</p>
<p>Both attacks appeared to be part of a long-running feud between Sunni and Shi'ite militants in populous Punjab province which has cost more than 144 lives this year.</p>
