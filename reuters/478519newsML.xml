<p>South African Breweries Ltd (SAB), the world's fourth biggest brewer, said on Tuesday that it is not in talks on any deal with Austrian brewery holding firm BBAG.</p>
<p>SAB corporate finance and development director Malcolm Wyman told Reuters that the two firms had previously discusssed regional issues as both were big players in the Central and Eastern European markets, but no deals had been talked about.</p>
<p>&quot;We know the group because we are very much in the same area...but we have not had any discussions on buying anything from them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Austrian daily newspaper Kronenzeitung reported on Saturday that SAB had bid five billion schillings for majority control of BBAG unit Brau Union. BBG has denied any intention of selling Brau Union -- which controls some two thirds of the Austran beer market.</p>
<p>SAB has expanded rapidly in the Eastern and Central European markets by snapping up breweries in Poland, Hungary and Romania. Wyman said any move into Austria would not fit into SAB's planned strategy of moving into only emerging markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Austria is not really Central Europe. We are not talking to them and certainly have not entered into any negotiations,&quot; Wyman said.</p>
