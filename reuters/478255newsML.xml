<title>USA: Unocal completes asset sale to Tosco.</title>
<headline>Unocal completes asset sale to Tosco.</headline>
<dateline>EL SEGUNDO, Calif. 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>Unocal Corp Tuesday said it completed the sale of its West Coast refining, marketing and transportation assets to Connecticut-based Tosco Corp for about $2 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;The completion of this sale puts Unocal on the threshold of a new era,&quot; said Roger Beach, Unocal chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;We are no longer a mid-sized, integrated oil company.  We are now the world's largest independent exploration and production company -- first in reserves and production -- with a strong focus on integrated project development.&quot;  </p>
<p>Beach added that Unocal's activities will be concentrated in areas where the company is a proven high performer, primarily exploration and production operations in Asia and the U. S. Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;We can now redeploy resources from slow-growth, low-return downstream businesses, which averaged five percent a year return on assets, to high-return operations and growth opportunities that offer potential returns of 15 to 20 percent a year,&quot; he said. Beach noted that about two-thirds of Unocal's $1.34 billion capital spending plan in 1997 is targeted to high-return overseas projects.  </p>
<p>The assets sold to Tosco were operated by Unocal's 76 Products Co business unit. These assets include Unocal's San Francisco, Santa Maria and Los Angeles refineries in California, which have a combined capacity of 251,000-barrels per day; various terminals, bulk plants and pipelines; worldwide lubricants business; retail marketing business, including 1,100 controlled sites and 250 branded, non-controlled sites in six Western states; commercial and industrial petroleum products business; three oceangoing tankers; inventories of hydrocarbon products; credit card systems; and other various assets.</p>
<p>Unocal will receive approximately $1.4 billion in cash (including nearly $400 million for inventories of crude oil and petroleum products) and shares of Tosco common stock valued at approximately $400 million.  Unocal expects to sell the Tosco shares as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>The proceeds from the sale will be used to invest in new, high-growth projects, reduce debt by about $800 million and buy back up to $400 million of Unocal's common stock.</p>
