<p>Healthcare systems must adapt if they are to match far-reaching improvements in the way drugs work, Glaxo Wellcome Plc chairman and chief executive Sir Richard Sykes said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a lecture to the Centre for Medicines Research International (CMRI), Sykes said rapid progress in finding new drugs and the ability to understand the genetic make-up of every individual meant patients would be &quot;targeted with specific treatment and personalised dosing regimens&quot;.</p>
<p>It also meant doctors would be able to assess how likely patients were to suffer from a range of diseases, with genetics allowing screening for susceptibility genes long before symptoms of the disease appeared.</p>
<p>&quot;The past 50 years have seen the pharmaceutical industry move from the point where it was able to treat infectious diseases in a relatively indiscriminate way, to a point in the not too distant future where our products will prevent, modify and cure disease,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sykes said the change would have a profound effect on the role of doctors, who would need to be &quot;equipped with the ability to recognise disease before symptoms appear and to cure disease when it is already present&quot;.</p>
<p>He added that &quot;to achieve this change we will have to see changes in medical education and training, and ways of equipping physicians to handle data and information more effectively&quot;.</p>
<p>Sykes told the CMRI that healthcare providers would also have to move away from the notion that there was a &quot;right&quot; percentage of health budgets to spend on pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>However he said there were encouraging signs that this was starting to change as health purchasers tried to measure the benefits of different types of treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that as a result of this, expenditure on pharmaceuticals is likely to increase, based on the recognition that they are a cost-effective form of healthcare,&quot; he said. &quot;As new medicines begin to prevent and cure disease, they will reduce the need for secondary care, and this of course will bring about significant cost savings.&quot;</p>
<p>Sykes said, however, that the pace of change in the drugs industry and healthcare could create &quot;anguish and controversy&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The recent advances in human genetics are good examples. Concerns are rife surrounding the feasibility and application of eugenics and cloning, and whether genetic testing will lead to refusal of employment and insurance,&quot; he said. &quot;To remove this fear society must be adequately informed of progress and hurdles.&quot;</p>
<p>Sykes said that &quot;when innovation works and improves the quality of life, the public will accept it and will regard it not as a threat but, indeed, an opportunity.&quot;</p>
