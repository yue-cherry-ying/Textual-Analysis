<p>Pakistan is gearing up to raise money in the international bond market regularly and will offer investors a dollar Eurobond this month, a Pakistan ministry of finance official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The upcoming deal will be the first time investors are able to gain exposure to Pakistan following the change of the Benazir Bhutto government.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to access the international capital markets two to three times a year,&quot; Javed Ahmed Noel said, adding Pakistan would also like to extend the maturity of its debt.</p>
<p>The country is also considering the launch of a medium term note programme, he said.</p>
<p>Speaking in London ahead of the launch of Pakistan's three-year floating rate note, he said Pakistan was also planning bonds in other currencies -- including a Samurai of around 10 billion yen with a three- to five-year maturity and the possibility of a sterling bond.</p>
<p>Noel said the proceeds of the dollar-denominated bond would be used for oil imports. &quot;Our energy discoveries are improving but we still need to import a lot of oil.&quot;</p>
<p>ANZ Investment Bank was mandated to lead the well-flagged transaction, expected to pay between 375 and 425 basis points over LIBOR. Launch is expected May 20.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't see us going over 400, and if the strength of the order book is good, we could do it at 350,&quot; ANZ head of new issues and origination Barry Field said.</p>
<p>The deal is also expected to be increased from its mooted $100 million, Field said. He said a fixed rate bond would have had difficulty due to the rising interest rate scenario in the U.S.</p>
<p>&quot;The timing of this deal is excellent and we think this is a good story,&quot; Field said.</p>
<p>Pakistan is rated B plus by Standard &amp; Poor's and B2 by Moody's Investors Services.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are cautious, but we think Pakistan is a good story and the potential for a rating improvement is there,&quot; Field said.</p>
<p>He said key demand was expected to come from the Middle East, European and Asian banks.</p>
