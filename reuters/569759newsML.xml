<title>USA: Bill to ban reimports of U.S. military firearms.</title>
<headline>Bill to ban reimports of U.S. military firearms.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>A bill to ban imports of surplus military firearms back into the United States was introduced on Thursday in the House of Representatives and the Senate.</p>
<p>Guns such as the M-1 carbine were given or sold by the United States to some 20 nations over the last 50 years. Sponsors of the bill said many of the 2-1/2 million weapons were now being imported to the United States and used by criminals.</p>
<p>&quot;These wartime weapons are the kinds of guns that criminals can easily convert into illegal, fully automatic weapons,&quot; Sen. Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat, said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Lautenberg said many of the weapons were coming from Iran, once a U.S. ally but now estranged from Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ayatollah (Khomeini) must be laughing in his grave,&quot; Lautenberg said, referring to Iran's late revolutionary leader.</p>
<p>Lautenberg was joined in introducing the bill by Sen. Barbara Boxer of California and Reps. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island and Carolym Maloney of New York, all Democrats.</p>
<p>They said it would allow collectors to buy imports of rifles from the Second World War or earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;The Anti-Gun Invasion act will slam the door on weapons, once intended to help our allies, from coming back into our country and getting into the hands of criminals,&quot; Kennedy said.</p>
