<title>USA: Mortgage rates fall below 8 percent.</title>
<headline>Mortgage rates fall below 8 percent.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Mortgage rates this week fell below 8 percent for the first time since the end of March, as news of an agreement to balance the federal budget eased fears of rising interest rates, Freddie Mac said Thursday.</p>
<p>Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.94 percent, falling for the third week in a row, from 8.01 percent last week. The last time they dipped below 8 percent was in the week ended March 28 when they stood at 7.97 percent, it said.</p>
<p>Fifteen-year fixed rate mortgages also fell for the third week in a row to 7.47 percent from 7.53 percent the prior week. One-year adjustable mortgages inched down a fourth consecutive week to 5.82 percent from 5.84 percent.</p>
<p>A year ago, the 30-year rate averaged 8.24 percent, the 15-year 7.75 percent and the adjustable loan 5.80 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets reacted this week to the news of a balanced budget agreement between the White House and Congress,&quot; said Robert Van Order, Freddie Mac chief economist.</p>
<p>&quot;The prospect of less government borrowing in the future takes pressure off interest rates, which accounts for the decline we see in these figures this week,&quot; Van Order added.</p>
<p>But many analysts expect another hike in interest rates when Federal Reserve policy-makers meet May 20.</p>
<p>Lenders charged an average of 1.6 percent in fees and points on both 30- and 15-year loans, down from 1.7 percent last week. Adjustable loan charges were unchanged at 1.4 percent.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac is a corporation chartered by Congress that buys mortgages from lenders and packages them into securities for investors.</p>
<p>Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said the volume of U.S. mortgage applications rose 1.8 percent in the week ended May 2.</p>
<p>The volume of applications to refinance mortgages rose 6.1 percent in the latest survey week, while applications to purchase mortgages rose 0.9 percent.</p>
