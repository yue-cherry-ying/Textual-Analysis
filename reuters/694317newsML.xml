<p>New Zealand's All Blacks overpowered Argentina 62-10 in the second rugby union test on Saturday to underline their superiority in the short series.</p>
<p>The All Blacks ran in nine tries to one, five during the second half, as they wrapped up the two-test rubber 2-0 after winning the first match 93-8.</p>
<p>The touring side tackled tenaciously, showing more fire than in the opening test, but were pinned inside their own half for long periods and the waves of All Blacks attacks eventually opened up the defence.</p>
<p>The Pumas' best passage of play came from the second-half kickoff.</p>
<p>They regained possession and drove deep into the All Blacks' half for only the second time in the game, with loose forwards Pablo Camerlinckz and Rolando Martin setting up rucks.</p>
<p>However, over-eagerness spoiled their momentum and All Blacks flanker Josh Kronfeld often dug in and turned the ball back to his team.</p>
<p>Kronfeld, number eight Zinzan Brooke, Olo Brown and lock Robin Brooke were frequently in the thick of the action, turning defence into attack.</p>
<p>The Pumas' lone try came from prop Roberto Grau when the touring side drove for eight metres and forced Grau over, giving them a brief moment to celebrate.</p>
<p>In all, Argentina won just one of their five tour games. As well as losing both tests, they were beaten 39-17 by New Zealand Maori and 26-10 by Taranaki. Their only win, 42-10, came against the second and third division combined Nelson Bays/Marlborough side.</p>
<p>Teams:</p>
<p>All Blacks - Christian Cullen, Jeff Wilson, Frank Bunce, Tana Umaga, Lee Stensness, Carlos Spencer, Justin Marshall, Zinzan Brooke, Josh Kronfeld, Ian Jones, Robin Brooke, Taine Randell, Craig Dowd, Sean Fitzpatrick (captain), Olo Brown.</p>
<p>Argentina - Ezequiel Jurado, Facundo Soler, Eduardo Simone, Diego Albanese, Lisandro Arbizu (captain), Gonzalo Quesada, Fernandez Miranda, Pablo Camerlinckz, Rolando Martin, German Llanes, Pedro Sporleder, Roberto Travaglini, Mauricio Reggiardo, Mario Ledesma, Roberto Grau.</p>
