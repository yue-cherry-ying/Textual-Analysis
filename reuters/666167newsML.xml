<p>Ivory Coast, which has lost about two-thirds of its forest over the past 40 years, is stepping up a reforestation effort and has around 700,000 hectares (1.73 million acres) ready for lumber firms to replant, officials said.</p>
<p>Private sector firms say they are doing their bit, and organised an exhibition at the weekend to publicise their replanting programmes.</p>
<p>Victor Tie Bi Tra, Ivory Coast's Director of Forests, said on the sidelines of the exhibition that wood companies would have a major role in promoting sustainable forest management under recent government reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the new forestry reforms, forestry managers and wood industrialists are the main actors of reforestation policy in Ivory Coast,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are difficulties, like the non-availability of land for reforestation. But in this case, companies should contact the state forest agency (SODEFOR) manager, who will look at the possibility of replanting protected forests which have been destroyed,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>These forests are protected but have been damaged by illegal logging and failure to replace trees in the past.</p>
<p>SODEFOR managing director Jean-Claude Anoh confirmed that around 700,000 hectares (1.73 million acres) of protected forest land now lying fallow were available for reforestation by wood cooperatives and companies.</p>
<p>Government regulations require wood companies to replant one hectare (2.5 acres) of land for every 250 cubic metres (8,800 cubic feet) of wood logged in a forest area, and for every 150 cubic metres (5,300 cubic feet) of wood logged in savannah area.</p>
<p>Total forest area in Ivory Coast has decreased to around 3.9 million hectares (9.6 million acres) today from 12 million hectares (29.7 million acres) in 1957.</p>
<p>The weekend exhibition was organised by Italian lumber companies long active in Ivory Coast.</p>
<p>One of the aims was to show the public that they were serious about the replanting effort and sustainable forest management in general.</p>
<p>The exhibition provided an opportunity for Italian as well as non-Italian operators to publicise their replanting achievements in 1996, and outline new targets.</p>
<p>One Italian-owned company, Compagnie Ivoirienne de Bois (CIB), aims to reforest 350 hectares (865 acres) of land this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The company has at the moment 216,000 young plants, which can be used for the reforestation of 450 hectares (1,112 acres),&quot; Jean-Jacquelin Dogoua Nangui, the engineer in charge of replanting projects in the company, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;However, our reforestation objective this year is 350 hectares (865 acres) of land, against 169.4 hectares (419 acres) in 1996,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>According to Gabriele Bruno of Fabrique Ivoirienne de Parquets, over 800 hectares (1,977 acres) of land are expected to be replanted in 1997 by his company, against only 126 hectares (311 acres) last year.</p>
<p>&quot;We have increased our reforestation objective more than sixfold in 1997 from the 1996 level,&quot; Bruno said. &quot;The company has already replanted 146 hectares (361 acres) during the first five months and it intends to cover 668 hectares (1,650 acres) of land during May-December,&quot; he added.</p>
