<p>India's rice stocks are under pressure, with high domestic wheat prices and low inventories lifting rice consumption in some areas, but supplies in July should ease the strain, officials and analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some pressure on rice stocks and prices because of less than adequate wheat stocks and high prices,&quot; said M.S. Bhatia, an adviser from the Agriculture Ministry.</p>
<p>The U.S. agricultural attache in New Delhi said in a report released in Washington on Monday that if India's rice consumption continued at the current pace, rice stocks could drop to near the prescribed minimum of 6.0 million tonnes for the first time since 1992.</p>
<p>But analysts and traders said early rice varieties would start arriving in the market from July and the normal harvest would begin in October, easing the pressure on wheat prices and rice stocks.</p>
<p>Bhatia said, as of April 1, 1997, India's rice stocks were at 13.1 million tonnes compared with 13.9 million on the same date in 1996 and against 9.0 million in 1993.</p>
<p>He said wheat stocks on April 1 this year fell to 3.24 million tonnes, compared with 7.7 million in April 1996 and against 2.7 million in April 1993.</p>
<p>Anil Adlakha, executive director of the All India Rice Exporters Association, said rice prices did not appear to be pressured and the production outlook for the grain was healthy.</p>
<p>&quot;As of now there does not seem to be pressure of any nature (on rice prices), rice prices are reasonable in the domestic market, exports are under control and Indian Basmati is fetching a good price,&quot; said Adlakha.</p>
<p>He told Reuters rice production prospects during the coming season were good.</p>
<p>Bhatia said no decline in rice output was expected and wheat and rice purchases were likely to be adequate this year.</p>
<p>India allowed wheat imports in December 1996 to boost stocks and stabilise domestic prices. The State Trading Corporation has so far contracted imports of 2.75 million tonnes of wheat, mainly from Australia, Canada and Argentina.</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram told parliament on Wednesday that open market prices of wheat had come down to 510-525 rupees in May. Traders said wheat prices were at an all-time high of 730 rupees per quintal or 100 kg in February</p>
<p>He said government wheat purchases for 1997/98 (April-March) were expected to exceed last year's level of eight million tonnes. There are no set targets for the purchases but the government's working estimates are to buy over 10 million tonnes in 1997/98.</p>
<p>The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent think-tank, said on Tuesday it estimated India's total foodgrain production in 1996/97 (April-March) at 194.80 million tonnes, up from the previous year's 185 million.</p>
<p>Bhatia said the government was anticipating a rice crop of 80.5 million tonnes in 1996/97 (November-October), compared with 79 million in the previous year.</p>
<p>Adlakha said India's aromatic Basmati exports were growing but annual exports of other varieties were hovering around 2.0-2.2 million tonnes due to a dip in world demand and lower prices offered by Vietnam, Thailand and Pakistan.</p>
<p>India exported over five million tonnes of rice in 1995/96, a number Adlakha said was unusual.</p>
<p>&quot;India's five million tonnes exports was a freak, we should stay at 2.0-2.2 million tonnes,&quot; Adlakha said.</p>
<p>Prem Garg, managing director of Shivnath Rai Har Narain (India) Ltd, said while export prices of the higher grades were rising, prices of lower grades were stable.</p>
<p>Traders said the five percent broken variety was quoted at $315 per tonne FOB, 10 percent at $290, 15 percent at $270 and 25 percent at $245.</p>
