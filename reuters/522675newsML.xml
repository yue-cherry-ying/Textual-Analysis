<text>
<p>Bulgarians are voting on Saturday in parliamentary elections brought forward after mass street protests in January and February forced the former Socialist government to stand down two years early.</p>
<p>Following are key facts about Bulgaria:</p>
<p>POPULATION: 8.38 million (1995), of which 7.2 million are Bulgarians, 800,000 ethnic Turks, 300,000 Gypsies and 100,000 others (Armenians, Jews, etc).</p>
<p>AREA: 110,994 sq km (42,855 sq miles). Bulgaria is bordered by Romania to the north, the Black Sea to the east, Greece and Turkey to the south, and former Yugoslavia to the west.</p>
<p>CAPITAL: Sofia. Population 1.1 million.</p>
<p>LANGUAGE: The official language is Bulgarian.</p>
<p>RELIGION: Eastern Orthodoxy is practised by 86.6 percent of Bulgarians. Some 13.1 percent of the population are Moslems, and the remainder practise other faiths.</p>
<p>ECONOMY: Bulgaria concluded a new agreement with the International Monetary Fund in March, and is expected to implement a strict fixed exchange rate regime known as a currency board in June.</p>
<p>Previous governments have been slow to implement politically unpopular reforms and Bulgaria has the lowest level of foreign investment in the region.</p>
<p>The lev fell sharply during the political and economic crisis at the beginning of the year, hitting lows of 3,000 to the dollar in February before recovering to around 1,500 now.</p>
<p>In 1996, Bulgaria's GDP totalled 1,700 billion levs, a fall of 10 percent in real terms over 1995. The IMF forecasts a 4.8 percent fall this year and growth of 5.7 percent in 1998.</p>
<p>In March 1997 14.5 percent of the workforce were unemployed and year-on-year inflation was 2,040.5 percent. Foreign exchange reserves recovered to $554.3 million at end-March from $445.5 million in February, and $643.5 million in March 1996.</p>
<p>HISTORY: For 500 years until the late 19th century, Bulgaria was part of the Ottoman Empire. After the war between Russia and Turkey in 1878, the northern part of the country gained its independence, while the south remained an autonomous Turkish province. The two were united peacefully in 1885.</p>
<p>The country became a constitutional monarchy in 1879 with the adoption of its first constitution. By 1945 Bulgaria had taken part in three wars (the Balkan wars of 1912-13, World War One and World War Two) and had lost all of them.</p>
<p>In 1944, with the help of the Soviet army, the Bulgarian Communist Party took power and monopolised power until 1989. The monarchy was abolished through a referendum in 1946, although exiled King Simeon, who lives in Madrid, visited in May 1996 and again this week.</p>
<p>On November 10, 1989, communist dictator Todor Zhivkov was ousted by other top party officials led by Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov, who later became president.</p>
<p>The former Communists reformed themselves as the Socialist Party and won a sweeping victory in the first democratic parliamentary election in June 1990. Mladenov resigned as president in July 1990 amid anti-government protests and parliament elected opposition leader Zhelyu Zhelev president the following month.</p>
<p>Zhelev, a prominent former dissident, was one of the founders of the Union of Democratic Forces, an anti-communist coalition. Zhelev won the first presidential election in January 1992.</p>
<p>In 1990, Mladenov appointed Andrei Lukanov prime minister but he was forced out of office by strikes and student protests. In December 1990 the socialist-dominated parliament formed a coalition government headed by non-party lawyer Dimitar Popov and including UDF members.</p>
<p>The government endorsed a programme of tough economic reforms and prepared an early election in autumn 1991. The UDF won a modest majority in parliament but its government was ousted in a no-confidence vote after only 11 months in power.</p>
<p>It was replaced by a non-party government backed by the Bulgarian Socialist Party and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, representing most ethnic Turks. This government, led by Luyben Berov, resigned in September 1994 amid accusations that it was delaying reforms.</p>
<p>Elections in December 1994 gave the Socialists a parliamentary majority but they lost support as the economy worsened. The Socialist candidate was defeated in November 1996 presidential elections won by Petar Stoyanov, and Zhan Videnov resigned as prime minister and party leader in December 1996.</p>
