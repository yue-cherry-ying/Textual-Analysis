<title>UK: LME ZINC BUOYED BY COVERING, FALL IN STOCKS.</title>
<headline>LME ZINC BUOYED BY COVERING, FALL IN STOCKS.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>LME zinc regained the $1,500 mark in early pre-market activity on Thursday morning, giving encouragement to some of the other metals to try the upside, traders said.</p>
<p>Three months zinc touched a high of $1,519 per tonne after trade buying underpinned the market on Wednesday and inventories fell by 2,400 tonnes on Thursday. Prices were last indicated at $1,510/14.</p>
<p>&quot;The fresh trade buying was encouraging and when it got above $1,500 this morning covering came in from brokers who were still short,&quot; a trader said.  </p>
<p>Zinc finished Wednesday's afternoon kerb at $1,485.</p>
<p>The cash/threes backwardation was about $7 wider on Thursday morning at $112/$122.</p>
<p>The break through the 30-day moving average at $1,510 was a good sign and some players were talking of further gains in the rings.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people were thinking of $1,570, but I think that's a bit optimistic. Maybe $15 or $20 more,&quot; the trader added.</p>
<p>The main draw in stocks was a net 2,725 tonnes from Rotterdam, with 1,100 tonnes coming out of Bilbao. Balancing the withdrawals was a net increase of 1,525 tonnes in Singapore, which may have reassured those hearing rumours that 20,000 tonnes was due to be delivered in the Far East warehouse.</p>
<p>Aluminium edged above $1,700, hitting $1,708 but lost impetus and sank below the big figure.</p>
<p>It was last indicated at $1,695/98, little different from Wednesday's close of $1,696.</p>
<p>The third stock increase in as many days at 1,725 tonnes after weeks of consistent draws was making people wonder whether a new trend was underway, traders said.</p>
<p>Any further upmove would likely be capped at $1,720/30 with support at $1,680, they added.</p>
<p>The cash/threes backwardation was steady at $4/$7.</p>
<p>Copper was stuck in a range with buying on dips and scale-up selling keeping prices fenced in.</p>
<p>The market crept up to $2,297, a $7 gain from Wednesday, but fell back to be quoted at $2,288/92. Stocks rose by 1,950 tonnes.</p>
<p>Nickel corrected higher, helped by strength in zinc, gaining $120 to $6,630.</p>
<p>Players were sceptical, however, over how long the bounce might last.</p>
<p>&quot;With another poor close, look for further pressure to emerge, with $6,365, the December 1996 low, initially targeted,&quot; analyst Martin Squires of broker Rudolf Wolff said.</p>
<p>Little movement was seen in tin at $5,420, up $10, but prices might seek to fill a chart gap between $5,480 and $5,510, brokers Brandeis said in a commentary.</p>
<p>Lead was indicated at $605/608 versus $607. The market needs to close above recent highs at $620 to defend against further downside pressure, analysts said.</p>
<p>Alloy was also barely different at $1,500/10.</p>
