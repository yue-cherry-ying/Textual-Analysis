<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Wednesday were seen steady to $0.50 per cwt lower, pressured by Tuesday's large interior Iowa/southern Minnesota hog receipts on Tuesday, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>Outlooks for active marketings again Wednesday also generated projections for weak cash hog prices, they said.</p>
<p>Tuesday's estimated interior Iowa/southern Minnesota hog run was estimated at 110,000 head. On Monday marketings totaled 79,000 which was below 100,000 estimate, USDA said.</p>
<p>Some producers waited until Tuesday to sell hogs on news that some packers were to be closed Monday.</p>
<p>Those closures were in observance of the Easter holiday, sources said.  </p>
<p>Top hog prices at interior Iowa/southern Minnesota plants on Wednesday were seen ranging from $51.00 to $51.50, sources there said. Illinois top prices at the plant were expected at $50.50 to $51.00.</p>
<p>Indiana/Ohio top prices at plants were expected to range from $50.50 to $51.00. Most hogs Tuesday at Indiana and Ohio plants sold at a top of $51.50, although there were a few at $52.50 as one packer paid a premium for top quality animals.</p>
<p>Pork prices at midday were not well established, USDA said. Hams weighing 20-26 lbs were quoted $1.00-$2.00 per cwt lower and pork bellies $2.00 higher, USDA reported.</p>
