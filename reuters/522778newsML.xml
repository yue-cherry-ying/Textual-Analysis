<p>For the second straight day, North Korea on Saturday failed to resume scheduled formal talks with the United States and South Korea on a Korean peninsula peace proposal.</p>
<p>After some uncertainty, however, the Americans and South Koreans persuaded the North Koreans to hold lower-level contacts aimed at getting the crucial senior-level dialogue back on track.</p>
<p>A U.S. spokesman who asked not to be identified said he did not know what the problems was. But the discussion that finally got underway in New York &quot;is not a resumption of the meeting we had Wednesday,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;We will see what comes out of this meeting. I don't know what will come out of this meeting,&quot; he said. He said he did not know how long the Americans, who checked out of their hotel in anticipation of returning to Washington on Saturday, or the South Koreans, would stay in New York.</p>
<p>The three delegations, headed by senior negotiators, first met on Wednesday to hear the North's formal response to a year-old U.S.-South Korean proposal for four-party peace talks that would finally close the books on the 1950-53 Korean War by replacing the fraying armistice with a peace treaty.</p>
<p>Those discussions were inconclusive and negotiators agreed to resume again on Friday. But the North Koreans, saying they were awaiting instructions from Pyongyang, never showed for the meeting and it was re-scheduled for Saturday at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Within an hour of the Saturday starting time, word began circulating that North Korea would again fail to appear.</p>
<p>The U.S. spokesman said the working level contacts that opened around 11 a.m. would not be the venue for the North Koreans responding to the peace proposal. That would only come when, and if, the senior negotiators met, he said.</p>
<p>A South Korean reporter said North Korea's representative at the working level talks, Li Gun, acting director of the foreign ministry's American affairs division, told him his team was still waiting to hear from Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Washington was represented by Mark Minton, head of the State Department's Korea desk; Seoul by Yu Myung-hwan, head of the foreign ministry's North American affairs bureau.</p>
<p>On Friday night, U.S. and South Korean officials remained hopeful the North would respond positively.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said privately that Pyongyang essentially accepted the peace talks proposal Wednesday but then tied its acceptance to demands for additional food assistance.</p>
<p>On Thursday, however, U.S. officials ruled out the possibility Washington or Seoul would announce new food aid before Pyongyang conclusively answered the peace proposal.</p>
<p>Every negotiation between the United States and North Korea since the two sides began intensive contacts in 1993 have been difficult, with delays and progress forward and backward.</p>
<p>Pyongyang's Stalinist regime has been preoccupied with increasingly severe food shortages. Two years of floods have worsened what experts say are systemic economic problems and the North has insisted on more and more internatonal help.</p>
<p>After some skepticism in Washington and elsewhere, it has been widely accepted that impoverished Stalinist North Korea is facing a serious problem that could reach famine stage by June.</p>
<p>Experts say the country may need 2.3 million tons of food this year. The U.N. World Food Program appealed for 200,000 metric tons of food, with Washington offering one-quarter of that amount, including $15 million pledged last Monday.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials have said Pyongyang cannot expect massive assistance until it enters peace talks and begins to defuse tensions on the volatile Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>Peace talks, if accepted by Pyongyang, may not begin until June or July. China would be the fourth participant along with the United States, South Korea and its arch-rival, the North.</p>
