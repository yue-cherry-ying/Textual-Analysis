<p>Israeli state prosecutors will meet on Saturday night to determine whether to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a government corruption scandal, a Justice Ministry spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Israel's attorney general is expected to announce on Sunday whether Netanyahu and three other top officials will be indicted as recommended by police earlier in the week.</p>
<p>&quot;On Saturday night the state prosecutors will continue their work to try to conclude the issue by Sunday,&quot; said Orit Shemesh, a spokeswoman for the Justice Ministry.</p>
<p>Earlier, opposition Labour party leader Shimon Peres, ousted by Netanyahu in elections 11 months ago, ruled out a national unity government in light of the scandal.</p>
<p>&quot;As the situation stands today, there is no basis for a national unity government,&quot; Peres told Israel Army radio.</p>
<p>An indictment against Netanyahu, the first for an Israeli prime minister, could topple his Likud-led government.</p>
<p>Prosecutors could ignore the police recommendations made after a probe over the short-lived appointment in January of Likud activist Roni Bar-On as attorney-general.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, 47, has described the influence-peddling scandal as &quot;nonsense&quot; and rejected calls to resign.</p>
<p>Peres, who helped engineer peace deals with the PLO, has said in the past he would consider joining a national unity government which he believes is the only way to save faltering peace moves with the Palestinians and other Arab partners.</p>
<p>&quot;If the conclusions are that this government stays put then in my opinion the peace process will have almost lost its chance,&quot; Peres said.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton said in Washington that the crisis was an internal Israeli matter and must not be allowed to derail stalled Middle East peace efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;They are a great and vibrant democracy and they'll deal with that in their way,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;We just can't allow anything, anything to derail the peace process and I don't believe we will.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross managed to reach agreement to resume Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation severed last month but was returning to Washington leaving major gaps between the two sides.</p>
<p>&quot;President (Yasser) Arafat agreed to renew security coordination with Israel,&quot; said a PLO official, who did not want to be identified. He added that the decision was taken during Ross's visit to the region.</p>
<p>The police probe was sparked by a Channel One television report in January which alleged that a Netanyahu ally on trial for corruption, politician Aryeh Deri, pushed Bar-On for the job in the hope of winning a plea bargain.</p>
<p>Even if the prime minister is not indicted, a scathing report on the scandal by the state attorney could crumble his ruling coalition of mainly right-wing and religious parties.</p>
<p>Netanyahu is under no legal obligation to quit if indicted, but High Court judges have ruled in the past that ministers under indictment must step down. Opposition legislators have already said they would petition the court for a similar ruling.</p>
