<p>Indonesia's Moslem-based minority party drew supporters from a rival party split by internal divisions to campaign rallies on Thursday, suggesting an alliance was taking shape ahead of general elections this month.</p>
<p>Scores of supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of late founding president Sukarno and Indonesia's best-known opposition politician, were at campaign rallies of the United Development Party (PPP) in Jakarta, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Megawati was ousted from the leadership of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) by a government-backed faction last year.</p>
<p>Her faction has not been allowed to contest parliamentary elections which take place on May 29 and she has asked her supporters to boycott the campaign. Electioneering by the government-backed PDI faction has been marked by small turnouts.</p>
<p>The PDI and the PPP are the only two minority parties permitted to contest polls against the ruling Golkar party.</p>
<p>Witnesses said hundreds of people wearing green and red clothes, some with the words &quot;Mega-Bintang&quot; printed on their T-shirts, were at the PPP rallies.</p>
<p>Green is the PPP colour and red is the PDI's colour, while Bintang, or star, is the PPP party symbol.</p>
<p>&quot;The PPP becomes Mega-Bintang in Jakarta,&quot; said a slogan pasted on several cars and motorcycles participating in illegal processions through the capital's streets.</p>
<p>Despite repeated threats from the military and police that such illegal parades would not be tolerated, security forces kept a low profile, directing traffic and appearing to ignore the violations of election and traffic regulations.</p>
<p>The PPP and the PDI are battling the much-larger Golkar for 425 elected seats in the 500-member parliament. The rest of the seats are filled by the military, which does not vote.</p>
<p>Golkar, in power for the last 30 years under President Suharto, is seeking to push its share of the vote to more than 70 percent from the 68 percent it won at the last polls in 1992. The PPP won 17 percent and the PDI 15 percent.</p>
<p>The appearance of Megawati's supporters at the PPP rallies appears to have come about after a meeting between Megawati and a senior PPP official on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The PPP sent Mudrick Sangidoe, chief of the party branch in Solo, Central Java, to meet Megawati at her residence, PDI legislator and Megawati aide Soetardjo Soerjogoeritno said.</p>
<p>Sangidoe asked Megawati to allow her many loyalists in Solo to join the PPP, he said on Wednesday. Megawati, who was not available for comment, gave no commitment but appeared to approve the move, Soerjogoeritno said.</p>
<p>Earlier the official Antara news agency quoted PPP chief Ismail Hasan Metareum as saying a large number of supporters of Megawati would vote for the PPP during the poll.</p>
<p>&quot;Our vote-getting target could well be surpassed,&quot; Metareum said without elaborating.</p>
<p>Antara also said tens of thousands of PPP supporters in a &quot;sea of green&quot; listened to Metareum in the West Java capital of Bandung, causing major traffic jams in the hill town.</p>
