<headline>Japan investors' hedge dollar sales seen emerging.</headline>

<p>Dollar selling by Japan's cash-rich institutional investors to hedge foreign assets has started to emerge in the currency markets and could, if it escalates, put increasing pressure on the dollar, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They added, however, that the volume of such selling was likely to be limited for now.</p>
<p>The moves came on a day when the dollar skidded more than one yen to an intraday low of 123.42 yen in Tokyo, when comments from senior finance ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara that the yen could strengthen to as much as 103 yen to the dollar set off a wave of selling.</p>
<p>Sakakibara later said his comments contained no specific intent regarding the dollar/yen rate.</p>
<p>Before that, institutional investors such as trust banks were detected placing offers to sell dollars in Thursday's early morning trade, in an attempt to hedge foreign currency assets against the risk of further dollar declines, dealers said.</p>
<p>They added that other investors such as life insurers and, to a limited extent, investment trust management firms may have joined in the hedge selling during afternoon trade.</p>
<p>Japanese investor returns on foreign assets increase as the yen weakens but decrease when the yen gains strength. Signs of a sharp dollar slide may lead to preemptive dollar sales as investors attempt to hang onto at least part of their gains rather than lose everything to a sudden dollar freefall.</p>
<p>The potential for downward pressure from this sort of selling is considerable, market sources said.</p>
<p>Japan's insurers boosted their foreign bond holdings by 4.52 trillion yen to around 17.10 trillion yen in the two years to February.</p>
<p>Most of those fresh holdings were not hedged against a potential slide of the dollar, traders said.</p>
<p>If holders of those foreign assets decided to hedge 20 percent of their positions, a massive 904 billion yen ($7.3 billion) worth of dollar selling interest would emerge.</p>
<p>If the dollar's fall steepens, they may decide to hedge as much as 50 percent or more of their holdings, traders said.</p>
<p>A senior dealer with a long-term Japanese bank said the bank received a large volume of dollar sales orders overnight from institutional investors at around 125.50 yen. He added that, while most of these had remained untraded, they nonetheless put downward pressure on the dollar.</p>
<p>Aside from trust banks, few other institutional investors appeared to have done much dollar selling today, despite some market talk to the contrary in the late afternoon, dealers and investors said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no particular need to hurry and sell the dollar at this level, given the still-large differential in short-term interest rates between Japan and the U.S.,&quot; said Michihisa Tanimoto, a manager in the foreign bond and foreign exchange section at Sumitomo Life Insurance Co.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't seen any real hedging moves recently, because right now the chances of a quick dollar fall don't seem too great,&quot; a manager at one of Japan's major investment trust firms said.</p>
<p>He said, however, that the pace of hedging could well increase should the dollar go down by several more yen.</p>
