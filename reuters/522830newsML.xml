<p>The Ivory Coast plans to clamp down on what it calls illegal cocoa and coffee plantations, cutting the country's potential output in the coming years, its Minister for Commodities said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some 70,000 small farms located in protected areas, we will close them down,&quot; Guy-Alain Gauze said in an interview during an EU conference on the Lome Convention.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an environmental programme primarily and not only on the initiative of the Ivory Coast,&quot; he said, adding that it was partly financed by funds from the World Bank.</p>
<p>He said the plans to curb the plantations -- mostly growing cocoa -- would have an impact on the size of the country's upcoming cocoa crop, known as the mid-crop, as well as next season's main harvest.</p>
<p>Gauze estimated the size of the upcoming mid-crop at some 100,000 tonnes, well down on last year's bumper 200,000 tonnes and at the low end of market forecasts, which have ranged between 100,000 and 160,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>He stressed this was an initial estimate but added that market estimates had not taken sufficient account of the impact of the programme and that the weather had not been favourable.</p>
<p>The drop in production potential would mean a main crop next season somewhere near 850,000 tonnes, well below last year's huge harvest well in excess of one million tonnes and the one million tonnes expected this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Cocoa production is dropping in the Ivory Coast,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The size of the Ivorian mid-crop is a key market factor at the moment as there are fears of a supply shortage in the summer months, fuelled by the belief that major U.S. trade house Phibro is holding a huge physical position and may have the opportunity to squeeze the market.</p>
<p>Traders have said these fears could push cocoa futures as high as 1,150 stg a tonne in the coming weeks from a value now of near 1,030 stg, basis the benchmark July position.</p>
<p>In a separate matter, Gauze said the Ivory Coast was continuing its campaign to get the European Union to ban cocoa butter substitutes such as vegetable fat being used in chocolate manufacture but he admitted it was making little progress.</p>
<p>&quot;Some EU member country's are taking a tough stance on this and there is little change in the situation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The European position, strongly favoured by Britain but objected to by others including The Netherlands and France, is to allow member states to use up to five percent vegetable fat in chocolate should they wish to do so.</p>
<p>Cocoa-dependent countries such as the Ivory Coast want a harmonised rate of zero percent throughout the community.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the problems is that we have no specific way of measuring the five percent inclusion. This status quo should be avoided,&quot; he said.</p>
