<p>Poland's Roman Catholic Primate unleashed a strong attack on leftists on Thursday over a wide range of issues that have strained Church-state relations.</p>
<p>&quot;Marxism as a system of government has passed, but people reared on Marxism remain and in high places,&quot; Cardinal Jozef Glemp told some 20,000 worshippers at an outdoor Corpus Christi procession.</p>
<p>&quot;They find spiritual values which contradict their materialist vision of society repugnant...the spirit of Marxism is rising over different fields of endeavour,&quot; the cardinal said in the televised sermon.</p>
<p>As examples, he pointed a finger at the education ministry for publishing &quot;sex education education textbooks with pornographic accents&quot; and attempting to remove religious instruction from kindergartens.</p>
<p>&quot;Who can be opposed to little children's natural inclination towards God? Is it not then that they first learn the difference between good and evil,&quot; the primate said in the televised sermon.</p>
<p>Cardinal Glemp triggered spontaneous applause when he said: &quot;It is impossible to conclude concordats with totalitarian Marxist states. Is it not strange, therefore, that also in our country a concordat cannot come into being?&quot;</p>
<p>He was referring to Poland's 1993 treaty with the Vatican, whose ratification has since been blocked by the left-led parliament.</p>
<p>The cardinal was also critical of leftists and liberals for disparaging Wednesday's decision by the Constitutional Tribunal which ruled that a liberal 1996 abortion law was in conflict with the constitution.</p>
