<p>U.S. Treasuries in London mirrored weak overnight levels on Friday as traders squared positions ahead of the long weekend in London and New York.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall you're totally at the mercy of position squaring,&quot; said one trader at a European bank in London.</p>
<p>Prices were broadly unchanged from Tokyo and New York levels by 1044 GMT, with the 30-year T-bond at 95-15 yielding 6.99 percent and the 10-year T-note at 99-05 yielding 6.74.</p>
<p>But the yield curve continued to steepen, as the short end remained relatively unscathed from the hedge fund selling that hammered the long end in recent days.</p>
<p>The spread between the 2-year T-note and the 30-year T-bond widened to 76 basis points from 73 on Thursday.</p>
<p>While the long end looked prone to further unwinding of fund positions, traders said a sharp fall was unlikely with a dearth of key U.S. economic figures next week.</p>
<p>But the May payrolls data due on June 6 should provide a new focus, analysts said.</p>
<p>Ian Morris, international economist at HSBC James Capel, said if economic data came in as strong as expected the T-bond yield could push up to around 7.25 percent.</p>
<p>He said minutes of the March 25 meeting of the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) when interest rates were hiked by 25 percent did little to clear the uncertainty over U.S. rate policy after the Fed's decision to hold fire on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;They changed their tightening bias to neutral which suggests that the Fed are really banking on a second half slowdown,&quot; Morris said.</p>
<p>&quot;If they don't get it then we could really be in trouble on the long end,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Fed's inaction this week has shifted the momentum to the next FOMC meeting in July, when traders expect a hike.</p>
<p>Morris said the hedge fund selling that pushed T-bonds lower this week stemmed mainly from an unwinding of yen carry positions following the yen's firmer tone.</p>
<p>But the dollar's weakness should still provide a good buying opportunity of U.S. assets for Japanese investors.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if they don't make much out of the currency conversion they'll still make it out of the yield,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>By 1046 GMT, the June T-bond future was up 5/32 at 109-07 in automated trade.</p>
