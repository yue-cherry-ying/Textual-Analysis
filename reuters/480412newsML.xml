<p>China is preparing for expert level talks with Vietnam and expects the negotiations to resolve a row with Hanoi over drilling by a Chinese oil rig, Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;China is currently preparing for expert level talks with Vietnam,&quot; Shen told a regular news briefing.  </p>
<p>Talks on the basis of &quot;equality and friendship&quot; could resolve such problems in Sino-Vietnamese relations as disputes in the South China Sea and the Kan Tan drilling rig, Shen said.</p>
<p>Vietnam has said it hoped to hold talks with China as early as this week on competing claims to an offshore area where China's Kan Tan III oil rig has been drilling.</p>
<p>Last week, Vietnam restated its claim to the area of the South China Sea, which is some 64.5 nautical miles off its central coast and 71.5 nautical miles from China's Hainan island.</p>
<p>It repeated its call for the rig to be withdrawn immediately and said it wanted negotiations as soon as possible. Beijing says the area is its own territory and that its actions are beyond reproach.</p>
