<p>(1) Results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 1996 reflected in the table above are pro forma combined results and do not reflect actual results for this period, as the company completed its acquisitions of its initial group of operating companies (the &quot;Founding Companies&quot;) on September 27, 1996, the date of the closing of the company's initial public offering.</p>
<p>Pro forma combined results above include the results of the Founding Companies and the eight companies acquired in the first quarter of 1997 and accounted for as pooling-of-interests transactions, combined as of January 1, 1996 and adjusted for compensation, rent and non-recurring charges for distributions.</p>
<p>The pro forma results for the three months ended March 31, 1996 exclude the pro forma effect of the 15 acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 1996 and the first quarter of 1997 which were accounted for as purchase transactions. Actual results of the company (without giving effect to any of the purchase acquisitions) for the three months ended March 31, 1996 reflect revenues of $13.6 million, net income from continuing operations of $0.4 million and earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.19.</p>
