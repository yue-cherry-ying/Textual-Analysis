<p>Union Bank of the Philippines said on Friday that net income in the first four months of the year reached 411.4 million pesos from 341.4 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Bank president Armand Braun told shareholders that assets in the same period were up at 39.95 billion pesos from 31.9 billion.</p>
<p>Chairman Justo Ortiz told the meeting that the bank was raising four billion pesos over the next two years through a share rights issue.  </p>
<p>The rights issue still needs the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Central Bank of the Philippines.</p>
<p>The issue will be in two tranches, with the first likely to be in September or October, Ortiz said.</p>
<p>The second tranche is to be offered within one year of the first offering.</p>
<p>The offer price will be based on the weighted average price of Union Bank shares five days before the launch, while the rights ratio will be set based on the offer price.</p>
<p>The proceeds will be used to expand its branch network especially in the booming regional centres in southern Philippines.</p>
<p>Ortiz said the new capital will help boost the bank's standing from being number 10 in terms of size and revenues to number five at the turn of the century.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1993 and 1994, we proved that we could survive. In 1995, 1996 and 1997, we proved that we can compete. In 1998 and beyond, we must prove that we can lead,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, the bank has been posting a compounded average growth rate of 40 percent in assets and revenues and a compounded average growth rate of 44 percent in terms of net income.</p>
<p>&quot;We must accelerate our pace of growth. We must increase our network. We must increase the number and depth of our customer relationships,&quot; Ortiz said told stockholders.</p>
<p>&quot;While we have outpaced most of our peers, we have not caught up with the larger competitors who have successfully preserved their market shares even with the entry of numerous other domestic and internaitonal banks,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Union Bank is a subsidiary of Aboitiz Equity Ventures Inc.</p>
