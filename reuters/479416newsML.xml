<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing debt market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch bonds closed lower for the third successive day as the strength of the U.S. economy remained the focus of market attention.</p>
<p>The Dutch yield curve also continued the steepening trend of recent weeks as longer paper bore the brunt of selling.</p>
<p>Most of the losses were registered on the opening, bringing guilder bonds into line with U.S. Treasuries, which had traded lower while the Dutch market was closed for Easter holidays.</p>
<p>But the market ended off the day's lows after a bigger than expected rise in the National Association of Purchasing Management's index sparked a short squeeze.  </p>
<p>&quot;We had seen such a big down-move in recent days that it triggered a bit of short covering,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Earlier, dealers said they detected some buying interest for mid-curve to longer Dutch paper.</p>
<p>One dealer said Dutch institutional clients were interested in switching into German Bunds when the 10-year yield spread reached 15 basis points, compared with 13 at the close.</p>
<p>&quot;If we do go up from here, people will sell it. The bias is on the downside,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>Another dealer said guilder paper maturing between 2000 and 2002 had attracted bids as they appeared cheap.  </p>
<p>&quot;If the stock market continues to fall, there will be good demand for short term paper,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>The Dutch sharemarket closed sharply down in response to two successive sharp falls on Wall Street.</p>
<p>But a trader said German Bund futures, which generally determine the direction of Dutch state loans, bounced well off support around 99.20 today.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a better opportunity to go up,&quot; he said.</p>
