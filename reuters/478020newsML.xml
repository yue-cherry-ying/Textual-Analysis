<p>U.S. June Standard and Poor's 500 futures ended higher in what traders called a bounce from recent steep losses.</p>
<p>June had crumbled more than 44 points from Thursday's high to this week's low, leaving the market extremely oversold, many traders said. They said June was ripe for a corrective bounce.</p>
<p>Robust data earlier in the session had only a limited negative impact on Treasury bonds and stocks. An afternoon pullback into negative territory was quickly quashed by local buying once support at 756.50 held, traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Twice we went down to the lows and there wasn't any followthrough,&quot; one S&amp;P trader said. &quot;It looked a little shaky and instead they bought the dips.&quot;</p>
<p>She said locals dominated trade in the last hour, with dealers largely on the sidelines.</p>
<p>A recovery in Nasdaq futures lent some support to S&amp;P 500 futures as well, she said. Longer-term, however, she and several other traders said serious technical damage had been done to the market.</p>
<p>&quot;We're still pretty close to (more three-month) lows,&quot; the trader said.  </p>
<p>&quot;They could take them out in the blink of an eye if we get any more bad news,&quot; she said. Traders said noncommittal action could set in until Friday, when March non-farm payrolls data is released.</p>
<p>Strong March National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) data and robust February construction spending briefly weighed on June S&amp;Ps early. But bond futures held up well, and traders instead focused on a drop in the NAPM prices index.</p>
<p>The March NAPM index of manufacturing activity rose to 55.0 from 53.1 in February, versus a forecast for 53.6. The prices index edged down to 50.9 in March from 55.1 in February.  </p>
<p>February construction spending surged 2.3 percent against a forecast of up 0.9 percent. January spending was revised to up 0.3 percent from up 0.4 percent.</p>
<p>February leading indicators rose 0.5 percent from a 0.3 percent gain in the previous report.</p>
<p>At the close, June S&amp;P 500s were up 7.00 points at 765.00, Midcap 400s were up 0.05 pts at 252.15, Nikkei 225 index futures rose 50.0 to 17,840.0, Nasdaq 100s rose 2.35 pts to 806.35 and KCBT Value Line futures rose 10.70 to 688.00.
