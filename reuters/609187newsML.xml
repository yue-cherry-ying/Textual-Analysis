<headline>Cambodian PM warns parliament may be dissolved.</headline>
<dateline>ROKAR KAONG, Cambodia 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Cambodian co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh warned on Friday that parliament might have to be dissolved if the two ruling parties failed to agree on the expulsion of dissident royalist MPs.</p>
<p>Ranariddh said earlier this week that failure to resolve the issue of the eight legislators he wants ousted from his royalist FUNCINPEC party would hold up passage of legislation needed to enter the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
<p>ASEAN leaders are due to meet on May 31 in Malaysia to discuss whether to admit Burma, Cambodia and Laos as members this year. ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Cambodia People's Party (CPP) of co-Premier Hun Sen have been at loggerheads over the dissidents since they mounted a challenge to the prince's leadership of the party with CPP support in mid-April.</p>
<p>&quot;If the parliament doesn't work everything is stuck ... because of the eight people so we can't enter ASEAN as we haven't passed the law and the government doesn't work either,&quot; the prince told reporters after a school opening in this village northeast of Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>&quot;So we (will) have no choice. Both prime ministers must meet together to ask His Majesty the King (Norodom Sihanouk) to dissolve parliament before its mandate is over in order to vote for a new government and parliament. For us, the sooner the better,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Ranariddh and Hun Sen have had numerous bitter public feuds since they formed an uneasy coalition government following U.N.-run elections in 1993. Their recent verbal spats have been seen by political analysts as jockeying ahead of national elections scheduled for next year.</p>
<p>The parliament has effectively been paralysed since the row erupted over the dissidents.</p>
<p>Support from the dissidents would give the CPP's 51 MPs and six allies from smaller parties a majority in the 120-member parliament, allowing it to pass laws. A two-thirds majority is needed to amend the constitution and change ministers.</p>
<p>FUNCINPEC won 58 seats at 1993 and the defections would leave it with 50 plus five allies from one wing of another party in the house.</p>
