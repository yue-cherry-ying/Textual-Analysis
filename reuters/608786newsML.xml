<p>Yugoslavia's main agricultural machinery manufacturer Zmaj said on Friday it had received an injection of government capital to produce equipment needed by farmers in time to harvest 1997 crops.</p>
<p>Zmaj general manager Vidoje Djukanovic said the company was promised 48 million dinars to delivery machinery including 150 small and medium combine harvesters and 220 maize croppers by the end of June.</p>
<p>The government programme to revive the agricultural sector, which has shared in the rundown of the Yugoslav economy since U.N. sanctions, will also allow farmers to barter their crops in payment for new equipment.</p>
<p>&quot;The programme is crucial for us. It will keep us mobile until we find a foreign partner who would be willing to cooperate with us,&quot; Djukanovic told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We will meet the targeted production and we hope the government will continue with the programme in the second half of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>Annual production of combines stood at 2,000 units before 3-1/2 years of sanctions were imposed in 1992.</p>
<p>Under sanctions, output fell to 20-30 percent with 40-50 percent use of workforce.</p>
<p>The company, like the entire economy, is struggling to overcome chronic lack of cash needed to restart production.</p>
<p>&quot;Shortage of cash forces us to urgently privatise&quot;, said Djukanovic and added: &quot;But it will not happen before the elections.&quot;</p>
<p>Parliamentary and presidential elections are due by the end of the year. -- Gordana Kukic, Belgrade Newsroom +381 11 222 4254</p>
