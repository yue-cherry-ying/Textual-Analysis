<title>AUSTRALIA: Australia sugarcane still seen badly hit by Justin.</title>
<headline>Australia sugarcane still seen badly hit by Justin.</headline>
<text>
<p>Analysts at CANEGROWERS Brisbane head office told Reuters that overall commercial cane sugar (CCS) content was expected to be reduced by one unit, from the 13.51 percent of 1996. This would represent a sugar content loss of about 7.5 percent.</p>
<p>Cyclone Justin's effects ranged from the industry's northern region, north of Cairns, to its central region, around Mackay.  </p>
<p>The situation facing farmers was &quot;a mixed bag&quot;, with some expected to lose 30 percent of their cane and others only 10 percent, he said. Overall in the Cairns area, total losses would be about 25 percent of cane plus about A$4.00 a tonne in lost sugar content.</p>
<p>Cane also would be &quot;tossed around&quot; during harvest because of the bulk of cane had lodged, he said. This would cause loss of the cane's ratoon and the pulling out of much stool, causing subsequent crop losses which would not be known until the end of the current season and in 1998, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The biggest concern is that because the cane is lodged our feed material will not be good,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the next district south, Herbert-Burdekin centring on the city of Townsville, which produced 12.80 million tonnes of cane and 1.84 million tonnes of sugar in 1996, Justin-inflicted losses will be more from reduced sugar content than broken cane.</p>
<p>Canegrower officials in this region said that further inspection had shown the cane crop unlikely to be reduced by cyclone damage, but sugar content might suffer.  </p>
<p>The Canegrowers organisation at Proserpine, in the central region which crushed 11.15 million tonnes of cane and produced 1.57 million tonnes of 94 NT raw sugar in 1996, said the cane was in good shape after having received more rain than wind. -- Michael Byrnes, Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800</p>
