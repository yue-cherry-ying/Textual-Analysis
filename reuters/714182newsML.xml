<p>Turkey's Islamist former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan on Tuesday criticised the new secularist government for not fixing a date for early elections in its programme of action read out in parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;There was nothing about an election of course because it is a Cankaya government that is trying to avoid the polls,&quot; Erbakan told a meetimg of his Welfare Party MPs.</p>
<p>Erbakan lost power last month in a bungled power transfer that followed months of army pressure on his Islamist-led coalition. He says President Suleyman Demirel helped oust him after talks with the opposition in the Cankaya presidential palace.</p>
<p>New Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz outlined anti-Islamist measures in a keynote speech to MPs on Monday but he did not mention a previous promise to hold early elections next year. Commentators say the Islamists would benefit from snap polls.</p>
<p>Erbakan, Turkey's first Islamist leader, predicted Yilmaz would lose a parliamentary confidence vote at the weekend. &quot;This government will never get a vote of confidence from this parliament. The parliament will not play the game,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government is widely expected to win the vote. Yilmaz and his allies have around a dozen more deputies on paper than the opposition, a rough alliance between Erbakan, his conservative former coalition partners and a far-right group.</p>
