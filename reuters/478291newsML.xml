<p>Ukraine will take over the lead in World Cup qualifying group nine if they beat Northern Ireland on Wednesday -- while victory will bring the Irish level on points with Ukraine and Portugal.</p>
<p>But all three nations in the tightly-contested group know that the matches they still have to play against European champions Germany in the second half of the qualifying campaign will have a huge impact on their chances of reaching the finals in France next year.</p>
<p>Portugal, who drew 0-0 with Northern Ireland in Belfast on Saturday, currently lead the group with nine points, although they have played two matches more than Ukraine, who beat Albania 1-0 in neutral Spain on Saturday. They trail the Portuguese because of a slightly inferior goal difference.</p>
<p>Ukraine defeated the Irish 1-0 in Belfast in August and another victory for the home side would just about put the Irish out of the picture.</p>
<p>But a victory over Ukraine would keep Northern Ireland very much involved in the hunt.</p>
<p>Ukraine are expecting to field the side that beat Albania and are hoping for a big crowd, boosted by low ticket prices of about $3. The president of Ukraine's soccer federation, Valery Pustovoitenko, has urged Ukrainians to come to the 100,000-seat stadium and back the national team.</p>
<p>Although Northern Ireland's home form has been disappointing with only one win in their four games in Belfast, they did hold Germany to a 1-1 draw on their travels in November, and could easily emerge unscathed from their visit to Kiev.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland boss Bryan Hamilton will be able to call up both Michael Hughes and Kevin Horlock for the match.</p>
<p>They were both suspended for the game against Portugal and he is pleased that none of the five players on yellow cards -- Colin Hill, skipper Iain Dowie, Tommy Wright, Steve Lomas or Keith Gillespie -- picked up another booking.</p>
<p>Lineups:</p>
<p>Ukraine: Oleg Suslov; Mikhail Starostyak, Serguei Bejenar, Alexandr Golovko, Vladislav Vachtchuk, Dmitro Myhaiylenko, Gennadiy Orbu, Youri Kalitvintsev, Vitali Kossovskii, Andriy Shevchenko, Serguei Rebrov.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland (probable): Tommy Wright; Colin Hill, Stephen Morrow, Gerry Taggart, Ian Nolan; Stephen Lomas, Neil Lennon, Jim Magilton; Iain Dowie, Keith Gillespie, Michael Hughes.</p>
