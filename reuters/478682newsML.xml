<headline>Belarus union pact's fate, text still unclear.</headline>

<p>Russian newspapers on Tuesday questioned the logic of a proposed union between Russia and Belarus and some said the document on the deal had been hurriedly prepared without adequate consulations.</p>
<p>&quot;They are deciding the fate of Russia behind the backs of the people,&quot; the liberal daily newspaper Izvestia said in its lead article. &quot;Was it agreement or conspiracy prepared in the corridors of power?&quot;</p>
<p>Other newspapers said Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is due to sign a document on the Union with his Belarussian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko on Wednesday, was still working out what to do.</p>
<p>&quot;Hours before the meeting with Alexander Lukashenko, Russian President Boris Yeltsin has not made a final decision because the consequences mean both clear benefits for Russia and undisputable losses,&quot; Komsomolskaya Pravda said.</p>
<p>The draft document, to be signed exactly a year after an outline agreement between the two leaders, says the two former Soviet republics would remain independent but would coordinate their foreign, economic and military policies closely.</p>
<p>&quot;On April 3 Russians will wake up in the same country where they went to bed,&quot; said a headline in the Sevodnya newspaper. The next line read: &quot;if only because not a single serious treaty has been fulfilled in the Commonweath of Independent States.&quot;</p>
<p>The newspaper recalled last year's signing of a deal on a Russia-Belarus commonwealth.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody has ever referred to this treaty since then... It also was about synchronising reforms in two countries, creating conditions to introduce a single currency and foreign policy coordination.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia, a nuclear state of nearly 150 million people, has been working a &quot;community&quot; with its less wealthy western neighbour of 10 million under a deal signed by the two leaders on April 2 last year.</p>
<p>But few details have been worked out and many questions remain unanswered.</p>
<p>&quot;The draft treaty looks more like a declaration of intentions rather than a treaty to create a new state,&quot; said Nezavisimaya Gazeta, noting that it was not clear how powers would be divided between the two states.</p>
<p>Communist-oriented Sovietskaya Rossiya quoted Aman Tuleyev, Russia's Minister for Co-operation with the Commonwealth of Independent States, in an article headlined &quot;Who is attacking Our Union&quot;.</p>
<p>Tuleyev, himself a communist, said Russia would benefit economically and politically from union with Belarus.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like (the opponents) are putting pressure on the president (Boris Yeltsin), who decided to take this step against the wishes of the United States,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Russia's embrace of Belarus comes at a time of increasing international isolation for Minsk, which has cracked down on political dissent, and where the authorities last week expelled a U.S. diplomat.</p>
