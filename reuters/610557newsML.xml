<headline>Dollar weaker and out of steam by late Tokyo.</headline>

<p>0629 GMT	    TRADED HIGH/LOW AS OF 0600 GMT</p>
<p> USD/JPY     115.76/86		116.23/115.13</p>
<p> USD/DEM     1.6916/19		1.6955/1.6879</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The dollar slipped compared with its New York close and came off earlier Tokyo highs by late Friday, with trade running out of steam ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p>Although morning trade saw the greenback pushed around by comments from Japanese officials and movements in cross-trading, afternoon activity was confined mainly to short-covering, with the topside capped around 116 yen.  </p>
<p>&quot;Failure to break below 115 yen in morning trade gave the market enough confidence to push the dollar higher this afternoon, but things are pretty well capped by exporter sales,&quot; one city bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Although the heaviest offers appeared to be lined up around 116.30 yen, light sales were detected from the upper 115-116 yen level and up, preventing the greenback from attaining 116 yen in afternoon trade. It had finished Thursday New York trade at 116.10/15 yen.</p>
<p>The approach of an extended weekend in London and New York was keeping operators wary of aggressive moves, dealers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Dealers here in Tokyo have basically run out of motivation, especially as there's currently no clear sense of the dollar's direction from here on,&quot; a trust bank dealer said.</p>
<p>The greenback slipped in morning trade after comments from EPA Minister Taro Aso, which gave dealers an excuse to square positions and triggered stop-loss sales at 115.50 yen. Asked at a news conference how the current exchange rate of about 115 yen affects the economy, Aso said there were some firms which could probably cope with a dollar rate of 105 yen but other companies would not be able to cope with 105 yen.</p>
<p>But the impact of this had worn off by afternoon.  </p>
<p>The Australian dollar fell against the yen in early trade after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut its official cash interest rate by 0.5 percentage point to 5.5 percent, also pressuring the dollar lower on the Japanese currency. But the impact of this was brief.</p>
<p>Dealers said the main focus now is where the dollar will trade next week, although this is quite hard to call. But many said some hedge selling is likely to emerge and limit gains.</p>
<p>&quot;We could well see the dollar rise to 117 yen, but after consolidation at that level it is likely to gradually start edging lower,&quot; one said.  </p>
<p>A trust bank dealer said trade next week is likely to be guided by the yen crosses unless strong fresh factors emerge. No significant U.S. indicators are due for release next week.</p>
<p>A European bank dealer in Singapore said he felt the dollar could edge lower during European trading time on the Aussie's weakness against the yen.</p>
