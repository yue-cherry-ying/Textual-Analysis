<p>President Boris Yeltsin said on Thursday a treaty on Russia's relations with NATO was &quot;98 percent&quot; ready and he might join talks in Moscow next week to try to finalise the deal.</p>
<p>&quot;About 98 percent of the document is ready,&quot; Yeltsin told reporters after laying a wreath at Moscow's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on the eve of the anniversary marking the end of World War Two.</p>
<p>But Yeltsin, fiercely opposed to NATO's plans to admit new members from the Soviet Union's Warsaw Pact allies, admitted talks with the alliance were tough.</p>
<p>&quot;There has probably not been such an acute issue between Russia and the USA and NATO since the Cuban crisis,&quot; he said, referring to the 1962 standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union over Soviet missile bases on the Caribbean island.</p>
<p>Yeltsin later met Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov,  who has played a key role in negotiating a deal between Russia and NATO.</p>
<p>Presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky, quoted by Interfax news agency, said Yeltsin backed Primakov fully.</p>
<p>&quot;There has never been a case where the minister and the ministry acted beyond the foreign policy lines drawn up by the president,&quot; Yastrzhembsky said.</p>
<p>The Kremlin, painfully aware that NATO will not drop expansion plans because of Russian objections, has concentrated on seeking a deal to limit changes in troop deployments in Europe and win a say in NATO planning.</p>
<p>&quot;The main thing now is to ensure Russia's part in NATO's decision-making process,&quot; Yeltsin said.</p>
<p>&quot;We also want them not to move their forces into the new territories, including nuclear weapons.&quot;</p>
<p>Leading NATO members, including the United States, insist that compromise with Moscow does not leave the new members with fewer security guarantees than existing pact members.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said he wanted Primakov and NATO Secretary General Javier Solana to sort out the remaining differences at their next meeting in Moscow to enable the document to be signed before the alliance holds a summit in Madrid in July.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has said he hopes to be able to sign the pact on May 27 in Paris. &quot;They must discuss the outstanding problems at their meeting on May 13, maybe with my participation, so as to have the document finally ready,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This would reduce the threat to our national security though would not remove it fully,&quot; Yeltsin said. &quot;We still remain opposed to the expansion.&quot;</p>
