<p>Camilla Parker Bowles, mistress of Britain's Prince Charles, suffered slight injuries in a head-on car collision near her home in western England, the Press Association news agency reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The agency quoted police as saying the accident occurred towards dusk on Wednesday between the villages of Norton and Easton Grey in the county of Wiltshire. The driver of the other vehicle was also treated for minor injuries, police said.</p>
<p>A police spokesman was quoted as saying Parker Bowles, 49, who lives in the nearby village of Lacock, called police and an ambulance on her mobile phone.</p>
<p>The agency quoted the Sun tabloid newspaper as saying that Parker Bowles had telephoned the police post at Highgrove, heir-to-the-throne Charles's country home about 15 miles (25 km) from Lacock.</p>
<p>The paper said that, after giving a statement to police about the accident, Parker Bowles was taken to Highgrove, where she was said to be recovering.</p>
<p>A royal source was quoted as telling the paper: &quot;Camilla is very badly shaken up. She gave her head a very severe whack during the impact and twisted her wrist, possibly as she wrestled with the (steering) wheel.&quot;</p>
<p>Parker Bowles is divorced from her cavalry officer husband, Andrew Parker Bowles. Charles, 48, was divorced from Princess Diana, 36, in February 1996 and has ruled out remarrying.</p>
