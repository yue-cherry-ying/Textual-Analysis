<p>Laurent Kabila's troops fired into the air to break up a protest against the new government in Kinshasa on Friday and the international community kept up pressure on him to clarify the fate of missing Rwandan refugees.</p>
<p>Morocco took in ailing former Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko, who arrived from Togo on the second leg of his flight into exile. French Prime Minister Alain Juppe said France would consider an asylum request from him if it received one.</p>
<p>The borders of the new Democratic Republic of Congo remained closed, and European humanitarian aid commissioner Emma Bonino demanded that Kabila give relief workers access to determine the fate of 280,000 mostly Rwandan refugees believed to be stranded in the east of the country.</p>
<p>Hundreds of supporters of veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi took to the streets to protest at his exclusion from the new Congo government, but troops firing in the air blocked them before they reached the People's Palace, the seat of parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;This government doesn't exist for me. I ask all the people to resist with their last energy all attempts to impose a government without popular legitimacy,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>The firebrand politician called for the withdrawal of foreign troops who helped Kabila's guerrilla alliance drive veteran dictator Mobutu from power.</p>
<p>Mobutu, who went into exile on Sunday, arrived in Morocco on the official plane of Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema. Sources close to Eyadema said Mobutu would go on to France, where he has a Riviera villa and a Paris apartment, after elections there which end on June 1.</p>
<p>Weakened by cancer, Mobutu left with his wife and children, including his son Captain Mobutu Kongolo, and an entourage of about 50 people on Eyadema's presidential Boeing. A DC-8 was expected in Lome later to collect his extensive luggage.</p>
<p>Officials in Lome confirmed a report on Togo television which said Mobutu had fled his jungle palace at Gbadolite on Sunday as the rebels advanced and the plane had come under fire.</p>
<p>They said the Russian-made cargo plane had carried Mobutu sitting in one of his cars. Eyadema's presidential Boeing offered a more comfortable trip to the former dictator, who was supported by aides as he walked from the plane to a waiting car.</p>
<p>Aid agencies have accused Kabila's forces of systematically blocking access to refugees and hindering their repatriation.</p>
<p>The international medical charity Doctors without Borders accused the new administration on Tuesday of planning to exterminate all Rwandan Hutu refugees in the country.</p>
<p>Kabila's rebel alliance has denied the allegations and accuses the United Nations and other agencies of deliberately failing to repatriate the refugees.</p>
<p>In neighbouring Angola, the national army moved into the main diamond producing area on the border with Zaire. UNITA former rebels said the government was using reports of an influx of refugees from Congo as cover for its offensive.</p>
<p>Commenting on the news from Kinshasa, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who helped mediate to ensure a peaceful transition, warned against pressure for quick elections, saying there were serious obstacles to achieving a fair poll so soon after taking power.</p>
<p>He said South Africa would complete plans next week to send a team of experts to help reconstruct the economy of the mineral-rich but bankrupt state.</p>
<p>Former colonial power Belgium said it would start bringing home troops sent to neighbouring Brazzaville ready to protect and evacuate Belgian nationals if necessary.</p>
<p>Asked whether Friday's protest march had in any way changed their departure plans, a spokesman said: &quot;The decision to pull out was a political one and we haven't received any instructions to the contrary.&quot;</p>
