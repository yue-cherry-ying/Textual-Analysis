<p>Japanese telecoms giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) on Friday announced a healthy profit increase last business year, aided by strong revenues from Internet and cellular phone users.</p>
<p>NTT's parent current profit grew 11.3 percent to 366 billion yen ($3.15 billion) in the year which ended in March, and the firm saw it growing to 387 billion yen ($3.33 billion) this year. Current profit is pretax and includes gains or losses on non-operating activities such as investments in stocks.  </p>
<p>Soaring demand for portable phone services and increasing Web traffic were behind the rosy earnings of NTT, which enjoys a virtual monopoly of Japan's local-call network.</p>
<p>On a group basis, however, NTT posted a nearly 30 percent drop in profit as profits from its cell phone unit were wiped out by a loss at a personal handyphone system unit. The personal handyphone is a Japan-developed mobile phone.</p>
<p>NTT said its group net profit fell 29.7 percent to 149.84 billion yen ($1.29 billion) in 1996/97, but it predicted the profit would recover to 220 billion yen ($1.89 billion) in the current business year.</p>
<p>NTT, still 65 percent owned by the government, moved a step towards realising its dream of entering the international call market on Thursday, when the Lower House of parliament passed a bill to approve the entry and its restructuring plans, under which NTT will be broken up into separate firms under a single holding company.
