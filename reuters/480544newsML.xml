<p>Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said in a statement on Tuesday that his ministry applauds the use of new methods to tackle banking woes such as the planned merger announced by Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd and Hokkaido Bank Ltd.  </p>
<p>The two banks announced earlier on Tuesday that they plan to merge in April 1998.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry will study the merger plan in line with Japan's banking law, he said, adding that the ministry had a high regard for the course of action chosen by the banks.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand that the plan was born out of positive efforts by the two banks to create a new business opportunity, rather than thinking of their future in line with what they have traditionally been doing,&quot; Mitsuzuka said.</p>
<p>&quot;We evaluate highly such new methods of tackling problems by Japanese banks,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Mitsuzuka said he hoped other other banks would follow suit and take similar steps to ride out their difficulties as Japan undertakes reforms of its financial system.</p>
