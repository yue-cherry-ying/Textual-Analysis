<p>Bahamian Olympian Sevatheda Fynes breezed to the fastest women's 200 meters of the year on Friday with a time of 22.60 seconds in a semifinal run at the U.S. collegiate championships.</p>
<p>The Michigan State University student, running in cool, damp conditions, also clocked 11.24 seconds into a headwind in the women's 100-meter semifinals and said she had big plans for both events in Saturday's finals.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm hoping to break 11 (seconds) in the 100 and I'd like to get down to 22.2 (in the 200),&quot; Fynes said. &quot;But I don't know if the weather is that good.&quot;</p>
<p>Rain and temperatures in the 60s (about 17 C) plagued the championships at Indiana University, but Fynes said living in Michigan helped condition her.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old, who ran third on the Bahamas' silver medal-winning women's 400-meter relay at the Atlanta Olympics, said she was hoping to represent her country again this summer in the world championships.</p>
<p>American newcomer Joey Woody was equally impressive. The University of Northern Iowa student clocked a personal best of 48.59 seconds to defeat fellow-American Angelo Taylor of Georgia Tech in the men's 400-meter hurdles.</p>
<p>The women 400-meter hurdles also was quick. American Ryan Tolbert of Vanderbilt University won in 54.54 seconds with Andrea Blackett of Rice University and Barbados finishing second in 54.78.</p>
<p>Barbadian Olympian Obadele Thompson battled a big head wind of 3.5 meters per second to win his 100-meter semifinal and become Saturday's favourite.</p>
<p>Another islander, Astia Walker of Jamaica and Louisiana State University, dominated the women's 100-meter hurdles in 12.94 seconds.</p>
