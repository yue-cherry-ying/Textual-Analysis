<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin on Friday confirmed Igor Sergeyev as Russian defence minister, a Kremlin spokesman said.</p>
<p>Sergeyev was named acting defence minister on Thursday after Yeltsin sacked Igor Rodionov from the post, accusing him of dragging his feet over plans to reform Russia's cash-strapped armed forces.  </p>
<p>The Kremlin spokesman said Yeltsin had also appointed General Anatoly Kvashnin as acting chief of the general staff, replacing Viktor Samsonov who was also sacked on Thursday.</p>
<p>Sergeyev, 59, has headed the Strategic Rocket Forces since 1992, responsible for 756 inter-continental missiles with 3,535 nuclear warheads which make up Russia's strategic arsenal.</p>
<p>The bespectacled, silver-haired Sergeyev has said he views Russia's nuclear forces as the backbone of its defence, and describes it as one that is especially economical during a time of spending cutbacks.</p>
