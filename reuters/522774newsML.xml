<p>A U.S. tour of priceless gowns, icons, portraits and jewels from Russia's imperial era was grounded in Washington on Saturday by a demand to return the treasures to Moscow.</p>
<p>Some 80,000 people viewed the exhibit during its display at the Corcoran Gallery of Art here. It was scheduled to go next to Houston. Instead, cars from the Russian embassy have blockaded a moving van loaded with the historic artifacts for four days to prevent it from leaving Washington.</p>
<p>The museum kept Russian state jewels in a vault while waiting for resolution of the dispute. It involves the Russian Ministry of Culture, a government-appointed Organising Committee and the Washington-based foundation operating the tour.</p>
<p>The ministry has said it wants the treasures for a celebration of the founding of Moscow 850 years ago.</p>
<p>Less noble motives were at play, according to a Houston museum director.</p>
<p>&quot;It's clear this whole thing is about money,&quot; Peter Marzio, director of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, said in Saturday's editions of the Houston Chronicle.</p>
<p>Marzio told the newspaper that the Organising Committee had contacted him to see if it could take over the exhibition, &quot;Jewels of the Romanovs: Treasures of the Russian Imperial Court,&quot; which would mean breaking an agreement with the American-Russian Cultural Cooperation Foundation.</p>
<p>The foundation has operated the seven-museum tour. It was scheduled for Houston, San Diego and Memphis before closing in early 1998.</p>
<p>James Symington, chairman of the foundation, told the Washington Post that the foundation would &quot;continue to appeal to the highest levels of Russian government to allow the Russian state jewels to stay in the United States and continue its tour and to promote goodwill between the two nations.&quot;</p>
<p>Russian embassy officials said the foundation had failed to live up to agreements for operation of the display.</p>
<p>The exhibition was timed to commemorate the U.S. visit 125 years ago of Grand Duke Alexis.</p>
<p>The Romanovs ruled Russia for 300 years, ending in the 1917 Communist revolution.</p>
<p>Included in the exhibit were 115 jewels and uncut gems, among them the egg-sized Caesar's Ruby and a 260-carat sapphire. There also were ecclesiastical materials, gowns, portraits and archival items relating to the grand duke's visit.</p>
<p>It was widely reported the exhibition was worth $100 million but one museum official said the unique and historical nature of the items made them priceless.</p>
<p>&quot;Our position is we're not releasing it to anybody until we either get a court order or both sides settle their dispute,&quot; said a spokeswoman for the Corcoran Gallery.</p>
