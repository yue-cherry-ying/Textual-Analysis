<p>Yen-based Tokyo gold futures ended narrowly mixed on Tuesday in directionless trade, while other precious metal futures were mostly lower reflecting losses in New York overnight, traders said.</p>
<p>Gold futures ranged from four yen per gram lower to three yen firmer. Benchmark February was flat at 1,382 yen.</p>
<p>Platinum futures ranged from eight yen to 20 yen per gram lower, with benchmark February down 14 yen at 1,455 yen.</p>
<p>Gold prices slipped from their early highs as private investors sold gold and took fresh long positions in platinum due to the narrowing gold/platinum spread, traders said.  </p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold was quoted at $350.30/351.00 per ounce at 0730 GMT, down from $350.70/351.20 in New York on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Japanese trade houses bought relatively cheaper Tokyo gold futures and sold spot gold in arbitrage dealings, which dented spot prices,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Activity in gold futures was thin as the yen's rebound against the dollar late in the day made private investors cautious about taking large fresh positions, traders said.</p>
<p>Platinum futures opened lower, but fresh buying partly cut the early losses, traders said.  </p>
<p>Activity in palladium futures was sluggish amid a dearth of fresh incentives.</p>
<p>Private investors still held massive short positions in TOCOM palladium futures, while foreign funds held large long positions overseas, traders said. &quot;Although market players are waiting for fresh news from Russia, the palladium price outlook partly hinges on which side (TOCOM or the overseas funds) will win,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Benchmark February palladium ended down five yen per gram at 565 yen. Benchmark February silver finished down 2.2 yen per 10 grams at 202.0 yen.</p>
