<p>French people pondered their vote in Sunday's first round of a snap parliamentary poll that will renew President Jacques Chirac's centre-right backing to the end of his term in 2002 or force him to share power with a left-wing government.</p>
<p>Politicians were silent on Saturday after last-minute bids to sway record numbers of undecided among some 39 million voters as the curtain fell on a short, lacklustre election campaign in which Chirac urged &quot;a new elan&quot; and the Socialists offered to &quot;Change the Future&quot;.</p>
<p>Both Gaullist Prime Minister Alain Juppe and Socialist Party leader Lionel Jospin returned to the main themes of the single European currency, unemployment and power-sharing before an eve-of-poll ban on campaigning came into effect.</p>
<p>Juppe said Chirac's &quot;cohabitation&quot; with a leftist prime minister would weaken France's position on the European and international stage and paralyse major economic decisions.</p>
<p>He repeated that differences with their Communist and ecologist allies could prevent the Socialists from bringing France into the single European currency.</p>
<p>&quot;Their platform would be a jump into adventure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Juppe again rejected a televised duel with Jospin, insisting on a four-sided debate pitting him and his centrist coalition partner ex-defence minister Francois Leotard against Jospin and Communist leader Robert Hue.</p>
<p>In a veiled intervention into the campaign from a European summit in the Dutch town of Noordwijk, Chirac supported a &quot;social model&quot; to protect European citizens from unemployment and poverty rather than U.S.-style free-market policies.</p>
<p>Jospin, in his last campaign rally, warned voters to expect hardline liberalism, more austerity and a flare-up of social unrest if they re-elected a conservative government.</p>
<p>&quot;The right has been wearing a mask in this campaign. It has kept a fog curtain around its intentions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He urged voters to punish the conservatives at the polls for letting unemployment reach a record 12.8 percent and stop it &quot;monopolising power&quot; for another five years.</p>
<p>&quot;They are scared of losing, we have hopes of winning,&quot; he said, buoyed by support from Britain's new ruling Labour Party.</p>
<p>The last opinion polls allowed to be published last weekend saw the right's lead shrinking. The stock market has been jittery, with dealers citing rumours of secret polls showing the government's lead narrowing.</p>
<p>The polls have said that Jean-Marie Le Pen's anti-immigrant, far-right National Front may squeeze between the mainstream parties to break into parliament, but was unlikely to win more than a couple of seats.</p>
<p>Front supporters scuffled with anti-racist militants in the southern town of Vitrolles on Friday in one of the few violent incidents in the campaign. The Front said one of its militants was injured.</p>
<p>Analysts have said unusually large numbers of undecided voters could produce a high abstention rate and a scattering of first-round protest votes among a record 6,243 candidates for the National Assembly's 577 seats.</p>
<p>As both sides appealed to voters to cast ballots, Juppe predicted a confused first round in which no clear trend may emerge.</p>
<p>The top two candidates in each single-member constituency, plus anyone who polls at least 12.5 percent of the number of registered voters, qualify for a June 1 runoff.</p>
<p>In the cyberage, the campaign called into question French law banning publishing opinion polls in the last week prior to the vote.</p>
<p>The Poll Commission watchdog urged legal action against four newspapers and a radio station for flouting the ban by carrying voter surveys published on the Internet.</p>
