<p>A forest fire raged unchecked for a second day on Monday near the northern Greek city of Salonika, destroying buildings and forcing the evacuation of two hotels and an old people's home, officials said.</p>
<p>The region was declared a disaster area and 400 soldiers were brought in to help firemen and local residents fight the wind-whipped flames, which raced through thousands of hectares (acres) of pine forest.</p>
<p>Firefighting planes, fire engines and scores of firefighters have battled with the blaze since it broke out midday on Sunday. It appeared to come under control late on Sunday but winds fanned the flames again on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Three farm houses were destroyed and the fire was getting dangerously close to Salonika's exclusive Panorama suburb.</p>
<p>Firefighters were battling 13 other forest fires throughout Greece but they appeared to be under control, officials said.</p>
