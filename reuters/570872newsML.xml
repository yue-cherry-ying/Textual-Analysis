<p>Reserve Bank of Australia governor Ian MacFarlane said on Thursday the bank was not worried about home borrowers loading up with too much debt as happened in Britain in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>&quot;We have an example of where that's gone too far, but we don't think it's happening here,&quot; Macfarlane told a federal parliamentary committee during a question-and-answer session.</p>
<p>Macfarlane said Australian borrowers were not as highly geared as those in the United States, Britain or Canada, but were more highly-geared than in some European countries.  </p>
<p>&quot;At the moment we're in the middle of the field and we don't see a problem, although we know it's a potential problem.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the first signs that it could be a problem would be a widespread asset price boom. House prices in inner-city Melbourne and Sydney had risen sharply, but the phenomenon was not widespread and therefore not seen as a problem, he said.</p>
