<title>AUSTRALIA: FORECAST-NatMut interim profit seen rising.</title>

<p>Australian insurer National Mutual Holdings Ltd is tipped to report a small rise in half-year net profit on Tuesday, reflecting better investment returns and lower costs.</p>
<p>Insurance analysts on Friday forecast National Mutual, controlled by French insurer Axa-UAP, to report a net profit of between A$116 million and A$153 million for the six months ended March 31.</p>
<p>The average of the five forecasts obtained by Reuters was about A$134 million, slightly higher than the A$131.5 million earned in the same period a year ago.  </p>
<p>The group's equity investments, especially its stake in Hong-Kong-based subsidiary, National Mutual Asia, will contribute strongly to the bottom line, the analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Equity markets were reasonably strong but bond markets were weak for the six months, and you have the positive effect of the National Mutual Asia share price,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>National Mutual has seen the share price of its 69 percent Asian subsidiary surge 19 percent in six months to March.</p>
<p>A rise in the Hong Kong-listed share price flows to the parent's bottom line via National Mutual Life, a subsidiary which has a 13 percent stake in the Asian life office.  </p>
<p>National Mutual Life books unrealised gains in the share price towards its own earnings.</p>
<p>The other 56 percent of National Mutual Asia is directly held by the parent, which shares in the subsidiary's profits.</p>
<p>National Mutual Asia on Thursday reported an 11 percent rise in net profit to HK$589 million for the six months to March 31. It declared a higher interim dividend of 7.8 Hong Kong cents.</p>
<p>National Mutual's Australian equity investments have also helped steady the group's bottom line, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Australian share market's All Ordinaries leading indicator rose by almost six percent in the half-year to March.  </p>
<p>But a weaker Australian bond market over the six months offset some of the equity gains, the analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;They would have to have written down the value of their fixed interest holdings,&quot; a Sydney-based analyst said.</p>
<p>But the major focus on Tuesday will be National Mutual's success in further slashing costs at National Mutual Life, the group's major profit contributer, analysts said.</p>
<p>National Mutual Life, which contributed over half of the group's A$210.9 million net profit for the year to September 30, 1996, is on a major cost-cutting drive.  </p>
<p>Growth in premium revenue in Australia is flat, due to the maturity of the market and competition from mutual rivals which can price their products competitively because they do not have shareholders to repay, some analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, Australia is going to be still an expenses play, so you want to see signs that expenses are coming down,&quot; a Melbourne-based analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Australian results are looking pretty good.&quot;</p>
<p>Another analyst who did not want to be identified forecast National Mutual Life to account for about A$80 million to A$85 million of the group's interim net profit.  </p>
<p>The group's costs will also be helped by the repayment of debt to Axa-UAP in the half-year, analysts said. In 1995/96, National Mutual paid A$19.3 million in interest to its parent.</p>
<p>Full-year forecasts for National Mutual range from A$246 million to a little over A$300 million, with an average around A$260 million.</p>
