<p>Lithuania's Birzai Dairy said on Tuesday that it would not pay dividends and that it would use its 1996 profits to upgrade its production lines.</p>
<p>The company earlier reported that its 1996 audited net profit had fallen to 2.2 million litas from 2.36 million litas the previous year.</p>
<p>&quot;We decided not to pay any dividends at the general shareholders' meeting on Saturday, and to use the money to develop our production and upgrade lines,&quot; the dairy's general director, Vladas Songalia, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;If we suceed to expand our market, and to provide a new range of products, we shall think about increasing our share capital by $6.0 million,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The company's share capital is currently 43 million litas.</p>
<p>It boosted its share capital by 24 million litas last year with the issue of a 24 million litas gross depository receipt (GDR) issue, the first by a Lithuanian company outside the banking sector.</p>
<p>Songaila would not say if the company would use another GDR in 1997 to raise its share capital but said that any increase would be done by issueing shares abroad.</p>
<p>The company exports 50 percent of its product and wants to grab a 25 percent share of the Lithuanian market this year. It currently has a 15 percent share of the market, Songaila said.</p>
