<headline>Gays should have own &quot;love motels&quot; - Argentine mayor.</headline>

<p>Buenos Aires' mayor suggested on Friday that gays who want to use pay-by-the-hour &quot;love&quot; lodges scattered throughout the Argentine capital should have their own special hotels and rejected a proposal that would permit gay people to use the popular facilities.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be exclusive hotels for these situations,&quot; Mayor Fernando de la Rua told reporters, rejecting a move by the centre-left Frepaso party to allow homosexuals to use the love motels. &quot;It's a crazy idea,&quot; he said. &quot;It's the world gone topsy-turvy.&quot;</p>
<p>Love motels, a tradition in Argentina, are popular with young couples who still live at home, men with prostitutes and people cheating on their partners.</p>
<p>&quot;I respect everyone, their equality, rights and freedom, but there are certain rules of living which exist for a reason,&quot; the Radical Party mayor said. &quot;Allowing gays into love motels may create big dangers ... how can you tell they're not just two assailants?&quot;</p>
<p>Under a 1980 city ordinance a pay-by-the-hour hotel is defined as &quot;an establishment where such services are provided for periods shorter than 24 hours, without including food, to couples of different sex who are given furniture, bed sheets and toiletries.&quot;</p>
