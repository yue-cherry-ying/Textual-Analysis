<p>Foreign Trade Minister Augusto Fantozzi said the mix of savings and fresh revenue to be contained in Italy's 25 trillion lire deficit-cutting budget for 1998 had not yet been defined.</p>
<p>&quot;The 25 trillion lire figure is confirmed but there are no details yet about the contents,&quot; Fantozzi told reporters while attending a CISL trades union congress.</p>
<p>Italian newspapers have reported the budget will contain some 17 trillion lire of state spending cuts, including eight trillion in social welfare cuts, with some eight trillion coming from increased revenue.</p>
<p>The 1998 budget will be outlined in the government's annual document of three-year rolling economic targets (DPEF) which is set for cabinet approval late next week.</p>
<p>Asked to confirm the figure of eight trillion lire of planned spending cuts on welfare and pensions, Fantozzi said &quot;this figure has been mentioned in the press but there's nothing definite yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Fantozzi said he agreed with a call on Thursday by employers' body Confindustria chairman Giorgio Fossa for the government to speed up work on the DPEF and 1998 budget so as not to miss Italy's appointment with EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;I think he's right, there's no time. But no one's sleeping,&quot; he said.</p>
