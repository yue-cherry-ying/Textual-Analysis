<p>Israeli police shot dead a Palestinian youth at a roadblock near a Jewish settlement on Tuesday, Palestinians said.</p>
<p>Palestinians identified the dead youth as Kemal al-Zaro, killed in a Palestinian area near Kiryat Arba settlement. They said he was 16 or 17 years old.</p>
<p>An Israeli police spokeswoman said police opened fire after the car struck one of the officers at the roadblock. She said the car then passed an Israeli army checkpoint and entered territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>Clashes then erupted between Palestinians and Israeli forces, in the 13th day of West Bank unrest sparked by Israel's breaking ground on a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, a step which has plunged Israeli-Palestinian relations into near-collapse.</p>
<p>Palestinian sources had earlier reported Zaro was killed during clashes with soldiers.</p>
<p>&quot;The car hit one of the officers at the roadblock, then police opened fire, hitting one of the people in the car,&quot; the Israeli police spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The killing of a Palestinian by Israeli troops on Saturday -- which a Palestinian cabinet minister called an act of war -- fueled tensions in the area.</p>
<p>The West Bank incident coincided with two apparent suicide bombings near Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, Israeli security sources said.</p>
<p>They said in both cases guerrillas apparently blew themselves up at an hour when buses of schoolchildren leave the heavily guarded settlements of Kfar Darom and Netzarim.</p>
<p>Witnesses said five Palestinian were wounded in the Kfar Darom blast.</p>
