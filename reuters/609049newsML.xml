<p>Korean Air Lines Co (KAL) is studying new destinations to Miami and Houston to strengthen its number one cargo market in America, KAL's cargo vice president and general manager, Ji Young Lee, told Reuters.</p>
<p>KAL also starts a new passenger service to Denver on May 23 and has already announced increased trans-Pacific cargo frequencies to Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta and Toronto.</p>
<p>After years of double-digit growth in cargo traffic, Lee forecast next year's growth would mirror last year's single-digit growth level.  </p>
<p>Overall KAL made losses of 210 billion won last year but Lee said its air cargo division will make a profit this year as total demand for air cargo increases.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been enjoying the cargo market but the future will be very difficult,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>Increasing capacity will decrease rates and KAL will be concentrating on cutting costs for instance by increased outsourcing, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The name of the game will be how to save costs for the airline industry and for their customers,&quot; Lee added.  </p>
<p>The world's third-largest cargo carrier, basis IATA statistics, is preparing to take delivery of two more freighters to increase its cargo fleet to 18 aircraft this year and 21 by 1999. That is part of an overall expansion programme to add 41 new aircraft by 2000 and a $10 billion fleet revamp by 2005.</p>
<p>The flag carrier's second Boeing 747-400 Freighter is due to be delivered in July ready for service between Seoul and New York.  </p>
<p>A third converted McDonnell Douglas MD-11 passenger aircraft is due to begin freighter service to Los Angeles later this year and be joined by two more MD-11s by 2000. Lee said KAL's older, &quot;lower productivity&quot; Boeing 747-200 freighters would be retired.</p>
<p>The U.S. market overtook the domestic market in 1995 as KAL's leading cargo destination and now accounted for 24 percent of total cargo revenue. Korea was now second followed by Southeast Asia, Europe and Japan.</p>
<p>Because KAL had done so &quot;dramatically&quot; well in cargo it was now a victim of its own success and faced increasingly tough competition from regional carriers such as Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airline System, Lee said. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+5017</p>
