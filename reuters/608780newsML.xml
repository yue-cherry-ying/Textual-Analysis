<p>Polish shares on Friday extended Thursday's fall and analysts saw more losses on Monday before the start of Bank Handlowy's large public offering and possible nervousness over the Czech currency crisis.</p>
<p>The pricing of Handlowy's public offering, seen worth a total of $1 billion, is due later on Friday, while the zloty fell almost two percent on Thursday before easing on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think some domestic players sold shares thinking foreign investors would and that maybe the Czech situation where a falling (currency) leads to falling stocks could happen here,&quot; said Pawel Tarnowski of Raiffeisen Capital and Investment.</p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index fell 1.6 percent to 16,179.0 points and turnover fell 11.5 percent to 140.3 million zlotys ($43.8 million) on all three markets. Losers led gainers by 88 to five with eight stocks flat.</p>
<p>Analysts put support at 15,500 points.</p>
<p>They said the session's biggest loser, builder Espebepe, fell 9.8 percent in profit taking on the back of this week's surge after creditors last Friday accepted the company's version of a debt-relief deal.</p>
<p>Selling of the stock after price fixing was strong enough for players to have their sell offers reduced.</p>
