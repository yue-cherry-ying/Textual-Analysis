<headline>Alliance may make Bre-X film.</headline>

<p>Alliance Communications Corp confirmed a report on Monday that it had bought the film rights to one of the books being written about the dramatic story of troubled Bre-X Minerals Ltd.</p>
<p>Alliance said it signed an option with journalist Brian Hutchinson to turn his book on Bre-X into a movie.</p>
<p>&quot;We're just fascinated with the story,&quot; said a spokeswoman for Alliance.</p>
<p>Hutchinson spent a month researching in Indonesia, wrote a cover story about Bre-X for Canadian Business Magazine and is working on the book.</p>
<p>Calgary-based Bre-X has become the most talked about Canadian business story after doubts about whether the tiny exploration company had discovered the world's biggest gold reserves in the jungles of Borneo emerged last month.</p>
<p>Shares of Bre-X plunged on the Toronto and Nasdaq stock exchanges, cutting billions of dollars out of investor portfolios, after Bre-X's New Orleans-based partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc reported that it had found &quot;insignificant&quot; amounts of gold at Bre-X's Busang site in Borneo.</p>
<p>Bre-X has also been rocked by the apparent suicide of its chief geologist at Busang and was earlier troubled by months of wrangling with the Indonesian government.</p>
<p>The cast of characters includes Barrick Gold Corp Chief Executive Officer Peter Munk, former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, former U.S. President George Bush and Indonesian President Suharto and members of his powerful family.</p>
