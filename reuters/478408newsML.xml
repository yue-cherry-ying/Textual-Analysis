<p>Stock markets skidded lower across Europe on Tuesday as investors wiped billions of dollars off share values following two days of heavy losses on Wall Street and fears that the long bull run had run its course.</p>
<p>The London, Paris and Frankfurt bourses all tumbled, but managed to recoup some of their losses after key U.S. data soothed the markets.</p>
<p>Despite that, German stocks suffered one of their biggest one-day falls during bourse floor trade. More than 19 billion pounds ($31 billion) were also wiped off London's blue-chip FTSE 100 index at one point, but it ended with a loss of 11 billion.</p>
<p>Some of Europe's second rank equity markets suffered even more than the big bourses, with Amsterdam and Stockholm sliding more than four percent and the Swiss bourse over three. In Asia, Tokyo fell only 0.74 percent but Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 3.67 percent.</p>
<p>The U.S. data helped the dollar pick itself up in late European trade, but it remained soft. Bond markets closed bearish in Europe although U.S. Treasuries rebounded from early losses.</p>
<p>Wall Street was to blame for the bloodletting, having lost 157 points on Monday, when many other markets were closed for Easter, on top of its 140-point tumble on Thursday.</p>
<p>After losing ground once more at the start of U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved back into the black after the release of the March National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) index.</p>
<p>While the overall NAPM rose to 55.0 in March from 53.1 in February, its key price component dropped to 50.9 from a reading of 55.1 the previous month.</p>
<p>&quot;Does the data validate what the Fed did? Absolutely,&quot; said Michael Strauss, chief economist at New York's Sanwa Securities Co, referring to last Tuesday's quarter point interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. &quot;It suggests risks are there that there will be more than one tightening.&quot;</p>
<p>Other New York analysts questioned the sustainability of any attempt by the stock market to rally ahead of the all-important March employment report due out on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is entitled to a bounce, and I expect one today lasting into tomorrow. But there is no sign that we have made a durable bottom,&quot; said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>
<p>In Europe, jittery investors asked whether the long-expected big correction for markets on both sides of the Atlantic had arrived at last.</p>
<p>The answer, according to some analysts, depended on how far Europe could distance itself from events in the United States.</p>
<p>Some analysts were confident that, after an initial tumble, Europe could pick itself up and push higher.</p>
<p>Traders in Germany were not so sanguine after seeing the DAX index lose 3.88 percent of its value in floor trade and close at 3,295.93. In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX ended down 3.71 percent at 3,281.46.</p>
<p>&quot;This has certainly been a very dramatic correction,&quot; said Bank Julius Baer chief economist Gerhard Grebe. &quot;Fundamentals apart, it shows the German market cannot decouple from the U.S. when things happen at this kind of speed.&quot;</p>
<p>Losses were spread across the board, with few blue chip stocks escaping the bloodshed. Deutsche Bank AG, a solid performer in recent weeks, fell 4.45 marks ($2.66) to 89.45 marks.</p>
<p>London's blue chip FTSE 100 index recouped much its losses to close down 1.5 percent, or nearly 65 points, at 4,248.1.</p>
<p>&quot;We're in for some volatile times, and it's an easy call to make to do nothing in market conditions like this,&quot; said PanmureGordon UK equity strategist Ian Williams.</p>
<p>Dealers and strategists said the market was in for a rough ride this quarter, with Wall Street ill at ease and the British election due on May 1.</p>
<p>Paris closed down 2.82 percent, but like markets elswhere, the French bourse crawled off its lows.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 index ended 74.86 points lower at 2,581.82 after hitting a low of 2,556.15. April futures were 87 points lower at 2,571.</p>
<p>The biggest loser was CLF-Dexia France, which fell 7.58 percent at 561 francs, after announcing a 13.1 percent rise in 1996 net income.</p>
<p>Tyremaker Michelin was the sole gainer among blue chip shares, rising 0.45 percent at 336 francs after a late recovery.</p>
<p>The dollar ticked gently higher in late European business after the U.S. data pointed to strong growth with subdued inflation, but the currency remained down on the day as nerves persisted over U.S. stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;The data basically confirm the economy's growing above trend and the manufacturing sector seems to be gathering momentum, but there are few signs of inflation pressures,&quot; said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International here. &quot;So all in all I think it's good news for the dollar.&quot;</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1705 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.6699 marks and 122.60 yen, compared with 1.6763 and 123.48 in late European trade before the holiday on Thursday.</p>
