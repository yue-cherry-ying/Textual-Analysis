<p>Polish copper giant KGHM Polska Miedz SA, to be floated in Warsaw and London in July, will cut production costs to between $1,500-$1,800 per tonne once it sheds non-core jobs, its deputy president said.</p>
<p>Stanislaw Krajewski told a seminar for technical college graduates on Friday KGHM was among the world's more expensive copper producers, with costs above $1,800 per tonne of copper.</p>
<p>However, after KGHM restructures it would be in what he called the middle range of $1,500 to $1,800 per tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;Our costs can be reduced to the middle range after we restructure our production cycle,&quot; Krajewski said. @</p>
<p>About 22,000 out of 43,000 employed by KGHM and its subsidiaries are now directly involved in production, but after restructuring the number of core jobs would drop below 19,000, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of restructuring, the optimal number of workers in mines and smelters would be about 18,000 to 19,000,&quot; Krajewski said.</p>
<p>KGHM plans to guarantee service and employment levels in the auxiliary firms, not involved in production, for three years after they are hived off from the main company in a process now underway. @</p>
<p>Krajewski said KGHM would not step in to save the carved-off firms if they were not profitable after that time.</p>
<p>Asked whether KGHM would rescue non-core firms shed through restructuring, Krajewski told the seminar: &quot;If their boat continues to take in water, it will sink.&quot;</p>
<p>He said, however, that minority and majority stakes in some of the firms which were not managed by one of two investment funds set up by KGHM, would be offered to domestic and international investors. @</p>
<p>About 15 percent of KGHM will be floated on the Warsaw bourse in the first week of July and between 21 and 26 percent in London in the form of global depositary receipts (gdrs).</p>
<p>Krajewski said that to hedge against copper value fluctuations on world markets KGHM planned to further diversify its investments.</p>
<p>&quot;About eight percent of our turnover is not related to copper. We want to raise this to about 25 percent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>KGHM has invested in the Polish digital phone operator GSM Plus and in a water bottling and supply company and is building a copper and cobalt quarry in central Africa. @</p>
<p>KGHM, worth an estimated $2-3 billion, produced 425,000 tonnes of copper last year and plans to increase production to 470,000 tonnes per year in 2000.</p>
