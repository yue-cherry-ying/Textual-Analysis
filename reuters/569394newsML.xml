<p>Freight forwarding company Chu Kwong Shipping Development Ltd is expected to raise HK$200 million after expenses in an initial public offering (IPO) of shares in Hong Kong, market sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They said the company is expected to issue 187.5 million new shares, or 25 percent of its enlarged issued share capital, at HK$1.20 per share.</p>
<p>The issue price will give a price-earnings multiple of 9.8 times on a fully diluted basis and 8.1 times on weighted average basis, they said.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-based shipping group, which is under the supervision of Guangdong provincial government, provides cargo handling services between Hong Kong and southern coastal cities in China.</p>
<p>&quot;Among the net proceeds of about HK$200 million after expenses, the majority portion of it will be for working capital,&quot; said one analyst after attending a company presentation on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The remaining balance is expected to be used to buy new vessels, to invest in an expressway linking Guangzhou and Foshan, to upgrade computer system and to cut debt,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The IPO is expected to run from May 13 to 16 and dealing in the company shares is expected to begin on May 23, sources said.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO is expected to be the sponsor of the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;The company forecasts its earnings to be not less than HK$83 million for the year ending in June 1997,&quot; said another analyst.</p>
<p>Chu Kong reported a profit of HK$83 million for the year ended in June 1996, up from HK$60 million in 1995 and HK$58 million in 1994. Turnover was HK$486 million in 1996, compared with HK$482 million in 1995 and HK$401 million in 1994.</p>
