<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - UK shares closed within striking distance of their all-time highs, cheered by a firm start on Wall Street, but further gains next week are seen limited as some participants fear markets on both sides of the Atlantic may be on the verge of a downward correction. The FTSE 100 index ended 10.0 higher at 4,661.8, falling 32.1 from last Friday.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German shares ended bourse trade higher and near the session's high as the DAX index pushed through the key 3,600 point level. Initial German state CPI for May prompted little concern about inflation danger, with the dollar above 1.69 marks helping to underpin the DAX. The 30-share DAX index ended bourse trade up 22.77 points to 3,602.19, a fall of 2.36 from seven days ago. In post-bourse trade the DAX index stood at 3,621.72.</p>
<p>PARIS - French stocks firmed on the last trading day before the first round of the legislative elections, as investors bet on the conservatives winning. Most traders expect the bourse to rise to new highs if the centre-right wins or to slide as much as 10 percent if the Socialists and their allies get control of parliament. The blue-chip CAC-40 index finished up 21.25 points or 0.78 percent to 2,762.90, a fall of 21.38 from May 16.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares ended only marginally higher after moving in a narrow band, but still managed another record close. Financials outperformed industrials, banks and insurers were supported by the prospect of low interest rates in important markets, and dollar-sensitive shares were depressed by the recent slide of the U.S. currency. The All-share Swiss Performance Index was up 6.13 points to 3,272.93, up 17.07 from seven days ago.</p>
<p>TOKYO - The Tokyo stock market's benchmark index climbed above the 20,000 level, as steadiness in currencies encouraged investors to resume buying of blue chips which had been sold off recently, The Nikkei average rose 131.61 points or 0.66 percent to end at 20,009.00, down 315.73 from last week.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index scored a record closing high as a surge of liquidity into blue chips during afternoon trade and a buoyant tone in the red chip sector propelled prices higher. The Hang Seng Index closed 119.68 points or 0.84 percent higher at 14,331.68, rising 269.31 on the week.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Australian stocks raced to their third successive record close as interest rate-sensitive sectors like banking, insurance and retail celebrated a surprise cut in official interest rates from 6.0 to 5.5 percent. The All Ordinaries index closed up 16 points at 2,563.9, up 25.8 from last Friday.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African shares ended the week down, suffering a case of the blues inspired by a month of weaker than expected corporate earnings. The market launched a late mini-rally as Wall Street kicked off to a strong start, but the main indices still ended firmly in negative territory. The All-share index dropped 24.4 points to 7,071.7, falling 71.1 on the week, as the Industrials index shed 39.9 points to 8,312.1, down 109.1 from May 16 and the Golds index had its third losing day in a row dropping 3.4 points to 1,192.1, dropping 36.2 from last Friday.</p>
