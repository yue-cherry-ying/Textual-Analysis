<p>Wimbledon's miserable first week continued on Saturday with yet more rain holding up the start of play.</p>
<p>Organisers of the Grand Slam event had hoped to start promptly at 1000 GMT in a bid to eat into the huge backlog of matches after Thursday and Friday were washed out completely.</p>
<p>Only two matches were completed on Wednesday and many players have yet to get through the first round. The championships are now some 260 matches behind schedule.</p>
<p>But Saturday morning saw more rain and organisers announced the start would be delayed.</p>
<p>Saturday's weather forecast said there could be bright spells in the afternoon but warned that there was also the risk of thunder and more showers.</p>
<p>Officials at the championships have said they will decide by 1500 GMT on Saturday whether to play on Sunday, traditionally a rest day.</p>
<p>In 1991, after rain had disrupted the first four days of play, the All England Club decided to hold matches on the middle Sunday for the first time.</p>
<p>The move was a huge success with tennis fans who queued all night for the cheap tickets and created a carnival atmosphere on Centre Court.</p>
<p>But this year the weather forecast for Sunday is for more rain and the organisers may decide instead to look at other options such as extending the championships into a third week or cutting some rounds of the men's singles to the best of three sets.</p>
<p>If the weather brightens up on Saturday, Natasha Zvereva of Belarus and Elena Likhovtseva of Russia are due out first on Centre Court to finish a first-round match that began on Wednesday.</p>
<p>American teenager Venus Williams, who has been waiting to play since Monday, is scheduled first on the new Court One, against Poland's Magdalena Grzybowska.</p>
