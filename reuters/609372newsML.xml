<p>Senior CIA officials mulled plots to assassinate scores of Guatemalan leaders as part of a 1954 coup against the elected government in the Central American country but no killings were ever approved or carried out, the spy agency disclosed on Friday.</p>
<p>In a memo accompanying the first major release of records on one of its Cold War covert actions, the Central Intelligence Agency said State Department officials also played a role in weighing possible assassinations to help turn back a feared Soviet beachhead in Guatemala.</p>
<p>&quot;Discussions of assassination took place at the working level but also involved senior Agency officials and, on several occasions, State Department officials as well,&quot; the CIA said in a three-page background paper. &quot;These plans for assassinations were neither approved nor implemented.&quot;</p>
<p>A senior CIA official who briefed reporters on the documents, the first of a planned series of voluntary releases on 11 covert actions, acknowledged that &quot;some actual preparations were made,&quot; including the training of some exiled Guatemalan hit-men.</p>
<p>One newly declassified document mentioned 58 Guatemalans as possible assassination targets because of their association with President Jacobo Arbenz Guzman, a social reformer ousted in the putsch carried out under President Dwight Eisenhower.</p>
<p>The CIA, then acting to check expansion of communism around the world, moved against Arbenz after he legalised the Communist Party, invited it to join his government and expropriated nearly 400,000 acres of banana plantations owned by the United Fruit Company of the United States.</p>
<p>In late June 1954, under the pressure of a CIA-backed paramilitary action, the Arbenz government collapsed. Arbenz went into exile in Cuba and died in Mexico in 1971.</p>
<p>Names of those mentioned as possible assassination targets were blacked out in the declassified files of CIA operations codenamed Fortune, Success and History. Also redacted were the names of CIA officers and others involved. Some operational details also were censored to protect sources and methods, privacy and ongoing U.S. foreign policy concerns.</p>
<p>In releasing a first batch of records on the coup on Friday, the CIA began making good on a 5-year-old promise to take the wraps off some of its most historically significant Cold War covert actions in the name of greater agency &quot;openness.&quot;</p>
<p>A total of about 1,400 pages of operational files were made public at the National Archives in College Park, Maryland, along with 324 audio tapes of clandestine Spanish-language radio broadcasts of anti-Arbenz propaganda. More of the estimated 180,000 pages on the Guatemala coup are to be released in batches later this year.</p>
<p>&quot;This release I think demonstrates that we're going to release in the spirit of openness, warts and all,&quot; a senior CIA official said, using a catch phrase coined by then-CIA Director R. James Woolsey in 1993.</p>
<p>Woolsey, building on a promise by his predecessor Robert Gates, vowed to lift the veil on a total of 11 &quot;significant&quot; covert actions, including the botched 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and the 1953 coup that installed the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in Iran.</p>
<p>The disclosure of unimplemented contingency planning to assassinate Guatemalan leaders adds to what was reported in 1975 by the newly created Senate Intelligence Committee about such CIA plots.</p>
<p>The panel found that U.S. officials had ordered the assassination of two foreign leaders, Cuba's Fidel Castro and the Congo's Patrice Lumumba, and had been involved in assassination plots against the Dominican Republic's Rafael Trujillo, Chile's Gen. Rene Schneider and South Vietnam's Ngo Dinh Diem. Though four of the five were assassinated, none died as a direct result of plots initiated by U.S. officials, the 1975 report concluded.</p>
