<p>The No. 2 bidder at the government's high-flying wireless phone auction last year has filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors, underscoring the problems besetting the auction's winners.</p>
<p>Pocket Communications Inc. -- which bid $1.4 billion for 43 licenses to offer a new generation of cellular service -- said Tuesday it took the step voluntarily to protect its assets from a group of creditors after defaulting on $80 million in loans.</p>
<p>Pocket is one of several top bidders in the government's $10.2 billion auction that have come under pressure from the hefty interest payments required to pay for the &quot;personal communication services&quot; (PCS) licenses.</p>
<p>The companies also have come under strain because of a reluctance on Wall Street to finance PCS ventures. Pocket is the first from the high-priced 1996 auction known to have filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p>The sale was reserved for small companies.</p>
<p>Privately-held Pocket's big creditors include a group of Asian entrepreneurs and communications-equipment makers Siemens AG of Germany and L.M. Ericsson of Sweden.</p>
<p>&quot;It enables the company to develop a plan to improve our financial health&quot; while continuing to build a wireless phone system, Pocket Chairman Daniel Riker said of the company's filing Monday under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.</p>
<p>Pocket, based in Washington, said it would take &quot;several months&quot; to restructure its finances and business affairs before the company would emerge from the Chapter 11 process on firm financial footing.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission on Monday gave PCS companies from last year's auction some breathing space when it suspended indefinitely a March 31 deadline for them to make payments to the agency for their licenses.</p>
<p>The FCC took the step while mulling a request from No. 1 bidder NextWave Telecom Inc., Pocket and seven other winners for permission to make the payments annually instead of quarterly.</p>
<p>The bids have become loans from the government, with the winners paying interest on the money owed for the licenses.</p>
<p>&quot;When you're out trying to raise capital, investors don't like to see their money go toward interest,&quot; said Kevin Inda, a Pocket vice president.</p>
<p>The company's bankruptcy filing is expected to send a shudder through the ranks of the other auction winners who are trying to drum up money from wary investors.</p>
<p>&quot;Pocket was a respected company that was considered to have put together a sensible plan,&quot; said Edward Warner, Washington bureau chief of Wireless Week magazine. &quot;It won't make financing more available.&quot;</p>
