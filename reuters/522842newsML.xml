<p>India's United Front coalition said on Saturday that it was on the verge of naming a new leader to head a centre-left government and end a three-week political crisis.</p>
<p>Spokesman Jaipal Reddy told reporters the alliance's top leaders would meet before announcing the name of its new head at 8:30 p.m. (1500 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;We are sure to reach a settlement and announce the new leader at 8:30 p.m. so that you can relax for the night,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>United Front officials said strong support for caretaker Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral as a consensus candidate had built up during the day as alliance leaders held hectic talks to find a replacement for Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>But caretaker Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh remained a possible choice, they said.</p>
<p>The chances of southern regional leader G.K. Moopanar being chosen appeared to have faded, they said.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda resigned on April 11 after losing a vote of confidence in the lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>The Congress party, which provoked his downfall by withdrawing support, said on Friday that it would back a new United Front leader at the head of a centre-left government.</p>
<p>The choice of a new United Front chief would put an end to three weeks of political uncertainty which have rocked financial markets and raised the prospect of the second general elections in a year.</p>
<p>But neither the 15-party United Front nor Congress want mid-term polls which opinion surveys show could put the rightwing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) within striking distance of power.</p>
<p>Their common opposition to the BJP, more than shared principles, has kept the United Front and Congress from rupturing ties despite mounting acrimony which resulted in Deve Gowda's downfall.</p>
<p>A senior United Front official who asked not to be identified said strong support had built up for Gujral, a veteran government minister who is widely respected but has only a small political base.</p>
<p>But other officials said Yadav, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister, could win.</p>
<p>Moopanar had been a front-runner in the race to succeed Deve Gowda. But his chances appeared to have dimmed after left-wing parties, suspicious of his close ties to Congress, raised objections, officials said.</p>
<p>On Friday, after the Congress party formally threw its support behind the coalition, United Front officials had said they were confident the alliance would select a new leader on Saturday and that a new government would be formed by Sunday.</p>
<p>President Shankar Dayal Sharma has indicated he would like a new government formed by Monday, when parliament reconvenes.</p>
<p>But splits quickly emerged between supporters of Moopanar, Yadav and other contenders within the United Front, comprising regional, communist and centrist parties.</p>
<p>The efforts to choose a new leader have had to balance the interests of north against south, but also to take into account the sometimes divergent views of the communists, Deve Gowda's socialist Janata Dal and regional parties.</p>
