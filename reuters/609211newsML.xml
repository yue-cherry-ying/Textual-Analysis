<headline>British woman with AIDS says ignorant of disease.</headline>

<p>A British housewife who accuses her former Cypriot lover of giving her AIDS told a Cyprus court on Friday she had not related the disease to heterosexuals.</p>
<p>Janette Pink, 45, from Basildon, Essex, has accused fisherman Pavlos Georgiou of transmitting the deadly disease to her during a three year relationship on the Mediterranean island which ended last year.</p>
<p>&quot;Like most people I thought it was really related to homosexuals or drug users,&quot; said Pink, her thin body ravaged by the disease.</p>
<p>Pink, under cross examination at a court in the southern port town of Larnaca, said they never used a condom during intercourse.</p>
<p>&quot;Pavlos never used a condom. I never used a condom ... I wasn't into casual affairs and I never had a condom at home. It wasn't something I was familiar with,&quot; said the woman, who was previously married for 20 years and has two grown children.</p>
<p>Pink is claiming Georgiou repeatedly lied about his condition during their relationship, and lied about the death of his wife in 1994, saying she died of leukaemia when in fact she had AIDS.</p>
<p>Pink tested positive to the HIV virus which causes AIDS in October 1994, nine months after her affair with Georgiou started, but continued the relationship.</p>
<p>In an earlier court appearance Pink said she went for tests after Georgiou's mother-in-law said her daughter died of AIDS.</p>
<p>Pink, a petite woman with short grey hair, appeared flustered at times by questions directed by defence lawyer Tassos Economou.</p>
<p>She hotly denied submissions by defence that before her affair with Georgiou she was dating another Cypriot.</p>
<p>Economou himself appeared at times apologetic for his line of questioning. &quot;I have seen a tape where you described your life all these months and it shattered me,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Georgiou, 40 sat grim faced in the dock, listening intently to Pink sitting at the witness stand 10 feet away. The two never made eye contact, but stole glances at one another.</p>
<p>Pink, who has developed full-blown AIDS, flew to Cyprus to testify at the case.</p>
<p>Georgiou has been charged that through negligence he committed an act that could possibly transmit a life-threatening disease.</p>
<p>He has denied the charge, which carries a prison sentence of up to two years, a 1,500 pound ($3,000) fine, or both.</p>
