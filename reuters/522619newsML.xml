<headline>Novelist admits taking heroin on Major's plane.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>British author and journalist Will Self has admitted snorting heroin on Prime Minister John Major's election campaign jet.</p>
<p>&quot;So I was smacked out on the Prime Minister's jet, big deal,&quot; one of Britain's most fashionable and shocking writers told The Independent on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Observer newspaper, which employed Self as a restaurant and television critic and occasional columnist, sacked him after being told of the incident by another journalist.</p>
<p>Self, a self-confessed former heroin addict, whose novels include &quot;My Idea of Fun,&quot; &quot;The Sweet Smell of Psychosis&quot; and &quot;Scale&quot;, had originally denied the allegations.</p>
<p>But in an interview with the Independent on Sunday, he said: &quot;I confessed to (Observer Editor) Will Hutton...that I'd had a bad patch with smack and as it happened I did take a little.&quot;</p>
<p>In his article about his day with Major's press party, published in last Sunday's Observer, Self was scathing.</p>
<p>&quot;So sparse is the content of the campaign, we were reduced to manufacturing news among ourselves,&quot; Self wrote, presumably unaware that he would become the news event from that day.</p>
