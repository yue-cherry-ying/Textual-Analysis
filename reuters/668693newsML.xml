<title>GERMANY: German police detain man in church arson case.</title>
<headline>German police detain man in church arson case.</headline>
<dateline>HAMBURG, Germany 1997-06-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Police on Tuesday said they had detained a 44-year-old man in connection with an arson attack on a church at the weekend, the third blaze in a German church in as many weeks.</p>
<p>Police had said they were not ruling out that right-wing extremists could be behind the fire, which completely destroyed the wooden altar of the church in the northern town of Husum early on Sunday, after they found a note on the church door which they said was both anti-Semitic and anti-Christian.</p>
<p>They said the man was detained north of Hamburg after witnesses noted down the registration number of his car, which had been parked outside the church at the weekend.</p>
<p>A 19-year old man was detained at the weekend after confessing to another arson attack which destroyed a Roman Catholic church in the northern German town of Luebeck three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Firefighters found five swastikas sprayed in white paint on the building alongside the name of a local priest who was campaigning to stop Algerian asylum-seekers from being deported.</p>
<p>On June 4, a protestant church in Hamburg was set on fire after being daubed with right-wing and Satanic symbols but the building was only slightly damaged.</p>
