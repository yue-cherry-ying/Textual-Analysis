<p>Feeding anti-cancer drugs directly into the liver after surgery for bowel cancer could save up to 10,000 lives a year worldwide, British scientists said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Scientists at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund checked the cases of 4,000 bowel cancer patients in 10 different studies looking at portal vein infusion (PVI) -- when cytotoxic cancer drugs are infused directly into the liver.</p>
<p>Cancers often spread through the body, even after surgery, and the liver is a prime site for the start of the spread.</p>
<p>&quot;None of these studies could do so on their own, but when we put all the results together it looked as if PVI could improve survival by about five percent,&quot; said Richard Gray, one of the group's organisers.</p>
<p>He said bowel cancer is so common, and so deadly, that even five percent could translate into a lot of lives. Bowel cancer is the second-biggest cause of cancer deaths in Britain and is widespread in Western industrialised countries.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if this treatment were only moderately effective, its widespread use could prevent about a thousand deaths a year in the UK alone, and over 10,000 deaths worldwide,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The charity said it was undertaking a study of 10,000 bowel cancer patients in China to check its theory.</p>
