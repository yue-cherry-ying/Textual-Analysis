<p>Enova Corp and Pacific Enterprises still hope to gain regulatory approval for their planned $5.2 billion merger before the end of the year, Stephen Baum, Enova's chief executive officer said Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview with Reuters, he noted the companies hope for an expedited review by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), but &quot;if a significant hearing schedule&quot; is called for, the merger date could be delayed.</p>
<p>When the merger plan was announced last October, the companies said they aimed to complete the deal in time for the January 1, 1998, opening of California's electricity market to full retail competition.</p>
<p>Late last month, FERC turned down the companies' request to disclaim jurisdiction over the merger, deciding instead that it has authority, under the Federal Power Act, to review such &quot;convergence&quot; mergers of gas and electric utilities.</p>
<p>Enova is the parent of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co and Pacific Enterprises is the parent of Southern California Gas Co. Their service territories share a nearly contiguous border.</p>
<p>The companies went ahead and filed a merger application at FERC in January, before the federal agency formally decided to invoke jurisdiction.</p>
<p>If FERC does not set an extensive hearing schedule, the merger is on track to conclude at the first of the year or the first quarter, Baum said.</p>
<p>The merger filing has drawn protests from other utilities, such as Edison International's Southern California Edison Co, which neighbors SDG&amp;E and shares much of SoCal Gas' customer base.</p>
<p>Enova and PET have requested FERC's expedited 150-day merger review, but the federal agency could take as long as 15 months to examine the deal, Baum added.</p>
<p>The merger must also be approved by the California Public Utilities Commission, which is expected to finish its review by year-end.</p>
<p>FERC is expected to open its review of the merger in June.</p>
