<p>Jewish settlers demanded Israeli troops invade PLO-ruled areas to uproot &quot;terror&quot; after two Palestinians in the Gaza Strip blew themselves up on Tuesday in what the Israeli army described as suicide bombings.</p>
<p>&quot;The first thing we have to do is re-enter to uproot the terror bases,&quot; said Yechiel Leiter, spokesman for the YESHA umbrella council representing more than 130,000 Jews settled amidst some two million Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;If that's enough of a message to (Palestinian President Yasser) Arafat to live up to his agreement, then we don't have to stay there but if he continues to take the relations back to a mode of terror and violence then we'll have no choice but to stay there,&quot; Leiter told Reuters.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded Arafat crack down on Moslem militants, in particular after a March 21 suicide bombing that killed three Israeli women in a Tel Aviv cafe.</p>
<p>But the right-wing leader has stopped short of threatening Israeli reoccupation of areas in Gaza and the West Bank now under self-rule.</p>
<p>Leiter said it was probable once Israeli troops went into autonomous areas, they would have to stay.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd like to see Arafat and the PLO stop violence and start negotiations. I don't think they will,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jewish settlers and their allies in government said earlier this month their threat to oust Netanyahu from office forced him to break ground for a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, freezing a peace process they say is seriously flawed.</p>
<p>They are campaigning now for a complete halt to the 1993 Israel-PLO accord hammered out in Oslo.</p>
<p>&quot;We warned from the outset that Oslo would lead to terror, and it has,&quot; Leiter said.</p>
<p>Israeli security sources said two apparent suicide bombings took place about 15 minutes apart near the Jewish settlements of Netzarim and Kfar Darom in the Gaza Strip. Only some 4,000 Jewish settlers live in the strip.</p>
<p>Palestinian police could not confirm whether the two men had blown themselves up deliberately. Five Palestinians in a taxi were injured in one of the blasts. There were no other reports of casualties.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas denied it was behind the explosions and accused Israel of ordering the blasts to sour relations between Hamas and Arafat's Authority.</p>
<p>The settlers placed ultimate blame on the Authority, which Netanyahu has said has given a green light to guerrillas. They said there was a possibility that Palestinian police had cooperated with one of the bombers.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a report, by the way, at least at Kfar Darom, the Palestinian outpost wasn't manned this morning as it usually is which raises some questions to the degree of cooperation there might have been between the Palestinian police and the terrorist,&quot; Leiter said.</p>
<p>The leader of settlers in the Gaza Strip said Israel had to react as if Tuesday's attack -- which he said was timed to hit school buses carrying settler children -- had succeeded.</p>
<p>&quot;The potential of attacks on the two buses could have been 100 casualties,&quot; Gush Katif settlement bloc head Arele Tsur said. &quot;The message must come from the top we control the field.&quot;</p>
<p>Leiter said: &quot;Today we are living with miracles...the fact that dozens of children weren't killed today is a miracle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Israel is going to have to do what it takes to defend its civilians and that would obviously entail entry into Area A,&quot; he said referring to areas under Palestinian rule.</p>
