<p>Brown &amp; Williamson documents considered critical in a major tobacco industry defeat last year were at issue Friday as attorneys prepared for a landmark class-action lawsuit filed by flight attendants who claim they were sickened by secondhand smoke.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp went before Dade County Judge Robert Kaye to argue that the papers were protected by attorney-client privilege and should not be admitted as evidence in the Florida case, which is scheduled for trial June 2.  </p>
<p>The case, known as Broin v. Philip Morris Cos Inc et al., was filed by a group of flight attendants who claim they contracted various illnesses because of breathing secondhand smoke while at work on U.S. passenger jets.</p>
<p>Michael Russ, an attorney for Brown &amp; Williamson, a unit of B.A.T Industries Plc, said the documents were stolen papers protected from exposure in court by laws governing communications between attorneys and their clients.  </p>
<p>&quot;Brown &amp; Williamson has been in a suit of one kind or another, or threatened with a suit of one kind or another, since the 1950s,&quot; he said during the special pretrial hearing on whether the papers should be admitted as evidence.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' attorneys Susan and Stanley Rosenblatt say they want to introduce 28 Brown &amp; Williamson documents, which include memorandums on tobacco research and a reference to potential antitrust action. The papers are from more than 4,000 confidential documents that a paralegal took from a law firm working for Brown &amp; Williamson between 1988 and 1992.  </p>
<p>Brown &amp; Williamson told Kaye it believed 25 of the documents chosen by the Rosenblatts are privileged.</p>
<p>Susan Rosenblatt argued that the papers were not privileged and said they had been introduced in evidence in at least two prior tobacco lawsuits. They were considered crucial in a Florida jury's decision in August to award a 65-year-old man $750,000 for his lung cancer after smoking for 43 years, only the second time that a U.S. jury had awarded damages against a tobacco company.</p>
<p>The papers also were the basis for a published book and are available on the Internet.  </p>
<p>Rosenblatt said Brown &amp; Williamson attorneys were invoking attorney-client privilege specifically to keep the documents out of court. &quot;They want to somehow hide what they don't want to produce,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Kaye said he expected to rule Tuesday on which, if any, of the documents, should be banned from the trial because of attorney-client privilege. After making that determination, he said he would decide whether the documents should be kept out of evidence for any other reason, such as the defense's contention that they were stolen.  </p>
<p>As the hearing continued, the judge closely questioned the contention of the Brown &amp; Williamson lawyers that the documents contained special legal, and not merely business-related, information. &quot;This doesn't jump out at me as being legal,&quot; he said after reading from one of the documents.</p>
<p>The Rosenblatts had asked Kaye not to hold the special hearing, saying he should rule on the admissability of the papers, as with other evidence, during the trial.</p>
<p>The couple, who have in the past accused the tobacco companies of trying to delay the trial, also said arguments over the documents were consuming time they could otherwise use to prepare for the trial, now just 10 days away.</p>
<p>&quot;While we're being sand-bagged by a bunch of late-filed motions, we are not preparing for trial,&quot; Stanley Rosenblatt said.</p>
<p>The Rosenblatts said they intended to go ahead with the case no matter how the judge ruled on the papers.</p>
