<p>A 13-year-old Italian girl suffering from the eating disorder anorexia jumped off a balcony and killed herself because she thought she was too fat, media reports said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The girl, who was not named, jumped from the balcony of her family's seventh floor flat in the northern city of Milan and landed in front of her father and brother. She died instantly.</p>
<p>The media reports said the girl, who weighed only 46 kg (101 lb), was obsessed with her figure and wanted to lose even more weight. They quoted recent diary extracts which said: &quot;I should lose a little more weight. I'm fat.&quot;</p>
<p>The girl had been undergoing psychological treatment at a Milan hospital for the condition, the reports said.</p>
