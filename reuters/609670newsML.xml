<p>* Indian government security prices were steady in light trade Friday, dealers said.</p>
<p>* They said there were more sellers than buyers in the market but few deals were struck as traders remained cautious ahead of next Wednesday's bond auction.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India auctions 30 billion rupees of three-year central government bonds on May 28.</p>
<p>* &quot;Some players seem keen to sell as they plan to switch over to the new stock but there are few buyers at the moment,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;Most market players seem to be waiting for the auction to be over before taking a view on liquidity and taking fresh positions.&quot;</p>
<p>* In latest deals, the 12.69 percent 2002 stock traded at 100.35 rupees against its last traded 100.30 and the 13.50 percent 1998 traded at 102.90.</p>
<p>* Treasury bills maturing on April 24 1998 traded at a yield of 9.35 percent against last yield of 9.40 percent.</p>
