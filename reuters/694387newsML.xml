<p>Bulgaria's parliament on Saturday passed an austere budget for calendar 1997, clearing the last hurdle before introducing an IMF-prescribed currency board system on July 1.</p>
<p>&quot;Bulgaria now has an approved 1997 budget, the country's financial constitution,&quot; Finance Minister Muravei Radev told the assembly.</p>
<p>&quot;The budget is tailored to the operation of the currency board. We have to learn to spend no more than we earn,&quot; the head of parliament's budget and finance committee, Yordan Tsonev, told reporters.</p>
<p>The basis of the currency board, which Bulgaria is due to launch next week under an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, is that the central bank guarantees to back the amount of currency in circulation with foreign exchange reserves at a given exchange rate.</p>
<p>The central bank has pledged it will hold one mark for every one thousand levs in circulation and freeze the exchange rate at that level.</p>
<p>Radev said that maintaining the restrictions of the 1997 Budget is a priority for the government.</p>
<p>A budget deficit of 6.2 percent of (GDP) is envisaged.</p>
<p>Gross domestic product is to fall by a real 7.4 percent from 1996 after a real 10.9 percent fall previously.</p>
<p>Spending is assumed at 33.5 percent of GDP and revenue at 27.3 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Annual inflation is seen 566 percent. The high annual inflation is attributed mainly to 243 percent monthly inflation in February, triggered by political unrest earlier this year.</p>
<p>Since then, inflation since then has come down to 5.6 percent in May and minus 0.7 percent in April. Monthly inflation is seen at two percent at the end of the year.</p>
<p>On Friday central bank governor Svetoslav Gavriiski said that interest rates will remain stable over the next few months at current levels of around one percent.</p>
<p>Foreign debt interest payments due this year will account for 2.9 percent of GDP and domestic debt interest due is assumed at 6.9 percent of GDP. -- Elisaveta Konstantinova, Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-981-4145</p>
