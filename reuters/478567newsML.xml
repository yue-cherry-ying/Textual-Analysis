<p>Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's first official visit to Prague, due this month, has been thrown into doubt by Czech criticism of Bratislava, his spokeswoman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The prime minister considers the postponement of his visit as correct in view of the given political and media campaign in the Czech Republic,&quot; spokeswoman Magda Pospisilova told a news conference during a regular government session.</p>
<p>She declined to say whether the visit had been definitively scrapped but the comment, following a sharply critical Slovak foreign ministry statement last week, highlighted the chill between the former partners in the Czechoslovak federation.</p>
<p>Pospisilova said Meciar was reacting to recent statements by Czech President Vaclav Havel and Premier Vaclav Klaus on Meciar's planned trip to Prague, which would have been his first since the federation split in 1993.</p>
<p>The Czech CTK news agency last week quoted Havel as saying Meciar was welcome but that he would also be told things he might not want to hear.</p>
<p>It also quoted Klaus as saying his government had more important things to do than to prepare for a Meciar visit.</p>
<p>The two countries became independent after 75 years as Czechoslovakia in which the larger Czech part dominated.</p>
<p>But the Czechs and Slovaks have yet to settle numerous divorce issues such as the divsion of federal gold reserves and cultural artifacts, and cross ownership of some banks.</p>
<p>&quot;The premier considers it improper for the Czech Republic, which is striving for NATO membership, to illegally withhold and probably also use Slovak property and its gold reserves,&quot; Pospisilova said.</p>
<p>The Czech National Bank has said the federation's gold reserves were split two-to-one in Prague's favour, roughly the same ratio as the two populations as a whole.</p>
<p>But the political fortunes of the two countries have also diverged since the split.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic is a leading candidate to join both the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the European Union. But Slovakia's chances of being admitted to either body in the first wave have diminished after repeated U.S. and EU criticism of the pace of democratic reform.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the visit was to sign final agreements on the division of property of the former federation.</p>
<p>A statement by the Slovak Foreign Ministry issued on Friday already signalled that Bratislava was upset with Prague.</p>
<p>&quot;Some Czech politicians, even after four years of the existence of an independent Slovak Republic, have been unable to rid themselves of the feeling of superiority and tutelage on the basis of which they comment on internal political events in their neighbouring country in a manner which is impermissible in the relations of two sovereign states,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Some Czech politicians have criticised Meciar's government for its handling of recent strikes by actors and students, in which police were used to end a sit-in at the culture ministry.</p>
<p>&quot;The Slovak side remains interested in settling remaining open questions in mutual relations, the Slovak statement said.</p>
