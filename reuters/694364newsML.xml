<p>The father of Sierra Leone's ousted vice-president has been shot dead by soldiers looking for Kamajor traditional hunters who oppose the May 25 coup in the West African country, members of his family said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Paramount chief Albert Sandi Demby, whose son Albert Joe Demby was ousted as president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's deputy, was shot dead summarily on Thursday at his compound in Gerihun near the southern region capital of Bo, family members told Reuters.</p>
<p>The chief's wives, children and grandchildren fled into the bush and returned to find him dead, they said.</p>
<p>Military officials in Bo declined comment on the incident.</p>
<p>The Kamajors, granted the status of a civil militia by Kabbah to fight alongside the army against the rebel Revolutionary United Front, have rejected an invitation from the coupmakers to join a government of national unity.</p>
<p>They say they want Kabbah, a civilian whose 1996 election ended four years of army rule, restored to power.</p>
<p>Residents of nearby Tellu Bongor and Sembehun said that soldiers hunting Kamajors had killed 25 people there and another traditional chief.</p>
<p>They said soldiers burned down part of Tellu Bongor, where Kabbah's deputy defence minister Hinga Norman, exiled architect of the Kamajor mobilisation, was chief.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the soldiers were scouring the area for Kamajors having heard that they planned to gather there to attack military bases in Bo.</p>
<p>Having helped push back the rebels, the Kamajors clashed with the army before the coup. Since the coup, they have become the main source of internal opposition to the coup leaders -- clashing around Bo and the eastern region capital Kenema.</p>
<p>The coup leaders accused Tejan Kabbah of humiliating the army and promoting ethnic hatred by mobilising the Kamajors. They also accused him of blocking a November peace deal he signed in Ivory Coast with rebel leader Foday Sankoh.</p>
<p>The rebels, who took up arms in 1991, rallied to the coup and have flooded into the former British colony's capital, Freetown.</p>
<p>State radio reported on Saturday that the ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) welcomed the prospect of dialogue with Sierra Leone's West African neighbours on solving the crisis but decried the proposed use of economic sanctions to persuade them to reinstate Kabbah.</p>
<p>The two measures, with the threat of military action if they fail, were the core of a strategy mapped out at a meeting of foreign ministers from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in neighbouring Guinea on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;With regard to the intended isolation of Sierra Leone and the economic embargo on this country the AFRC regards such measures as counterproductive,&quot; the radio said quoting an AFRC statement.</p>
<p>AFRC spokesman Colonel Abdul Sesay told British Broadcasting Corporation radio: &quot;We can assure them of total cooperation when the ECOWAS delegation arrives here.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Kabbah was welcome to return and an important player but sidestepped questions on whether he could return as president.</p>
<p>Regional giant Nigeria has reinforced troops who were in Sierra Leone under a defence pact. It has gunboats offshore.</p>
<p>The civil war killed as many as 20,000 people.</p>
