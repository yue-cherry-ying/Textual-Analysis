<title>USA: Promoter Don King sues ABC over comment.</title>
<headline>Promoter Don King sues ABC over comment.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Boxing promoter Don King Tuesday sued ABC Inc. for defamation after its KABC-TV station broadcast a report that falsely quoted King as saying suspended heavyweight Mike Tyson doesn't belong in the sport.</p>
<p>While the Los Angeles station later broadcast a retraction, the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleged that the report injured King's reputation as a professional boxing promoter.</p>
<p>Officials of ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co., had no comment.</p>
<p>In the June 30 broadcast, sportscaster Rick Lozano quoted King as saying that Tyson doesn't belong in boxing. Lozano also quoted King as saying, &quot;Shame on me if I ever again contribute to one of his paydays.&quot;</p>
<p>On a broadcast later that evening, Lozano retracted the statement, saying the quotes attributed to King were erroneous.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, King's lawyers said the retraction failed to minimise the damage to King's professional reputation and was &quot;merely a defensive and prophylactic device...in anticipation of litigation.&quot;</p>
<p>King's lawyers said the retraction should have been broadcast on a &quot;national level.&quot;</p>
<p>King is seeking $1 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages.</p>
<p>The World Boxing Association stripped heavyweight Mike Tyson of his ranking after Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ears during their bout on June 28. King promoted the fight.</p>
<p>The Nevada State Boxing Commission has suspended Tyson and withheld his $30 million purse, pending a final ruling on the case.</p>
