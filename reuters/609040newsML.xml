<p>Singapore police said on Friday they had arrested a Filipina maid on suspicion of murdering her sister-in-law.</p>
<p>A police spokesman told Reuters the woman had been remanded in custody for psychiatric examination and would appear in court again on June 13.</p>
<p>He said investigators were accompanied by a Philippine diplomat to the scene of the crime and the two sides were cooperating closely. He declined to comment on why the psychiatric examination was ordered.</p>
<p>Philippine Consul General Victoriano Lecaros named the suspect as Edna Sumawang from Gattaran in the northern Philippine province of Cagayan.</p>
<p>&quot;This is another instance of an improperly documented (illegal) worker who got into trouble,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He quoted police reports as saying the murder had occurred on Thursday morning and the weapons were a pair of scissors and knife.</p>
<p>Sumawang would face a mandatory death sentence if charged and convicted of first degree murder.</p>
<p>Sources close to the case said both sides were treating it with the utmost caution because it raised memories of the furore caused by the execution in Singapore in 1995 of Filipina maid Flor Contemplacion.</p>
<p>That execution, for the murder of a young Singaporean boy in her care and a fellow maid, brought the two countries close to a break in relations. Many Filipinos remain adamant Contemplacion was innocent.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Flor, part two,&quot; said one source close to the case who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>The Philippines and Singapore withdrew their envoys after Contemplacion's execution and relations were only restored last year.</p>
<p>Sumawang came to Singapore last month to work as a maid and did not have a work permit to do so, the sources said.</p>
<p>They said police found Anita Fuggan, who had worked legally as a maid in Singapore for three years, lying on the floor with wounds to her head and abdomen.</p>
<p>The case comes as the two countries are preparing for a visit to Manila by Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong within the next two months.</p>
<p>Goh was originally scheduled to visit the Philippines in 1995 but the trip was cancelled after Contemplacion's hanging.</p>
<p>The execution so enraged Filipinos they burned thousands of Singaporean flags and marched on Singapore's embassy in Manila.</p>
<p>Philippine President Fidel Ramos and Goh patched up the row on the sidelines of a regional summit in December 1995.</p>
<p>One source familiar with the new case said the Philippines might ask Singapore's permission to bring in its own pathologist to help out in the investigation.</p>
<p>But Lecaros said that would not happen because the post-mortem examination was conducted on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>In the Contemplacion case, Singapore and Filipino pathgologists reached sharply different conclusions about how the maid and the boy were killed.</p>
<p>The Filipinos said the maid whom Contemplacion was accused of killing could only have been strangled by a man. Singapore disagreed. U.S. pathologists called in to conduct independent tests sided with the Singaporean conclusions.</p>
