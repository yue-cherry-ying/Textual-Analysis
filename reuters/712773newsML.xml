<p>Russia successfully carried out its fourth test firing of a &quot;Topol-M&quot; (Poplar) intercontinental ballistic missile on Tuesday, Colonel Ilshat Baichurin of the Strategic Missile Forces told Itar-Tass news agency.</p>
<p>He said the test, conducted at the Plesetsk test site in the far north, was the last before the start of serial production of this kind of nuclear missile.</p>
<p>&quot;The test showed that, despite insufficient financing, the priority programme of developing our missile forces is being carried out successfully,&quot; Tass quoted General Vladimir Yakovlev, head of the Strategic Missile Forces, as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Today it is possible to say that in the 21st century Russia will remain in the ranks of the leading nuclear states, thereby helping to guarantee strategic stability in the whole world,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Russia tests its missiles regularly. Some officials have voiced concerns about the effectiveness and safety of Russia's nuclear arsenal in the midst of a severe funding crisis.</p>
<p>Washington has not complained about Russia's previous testing of its intercontinental ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>Despite strong pressure from President Boris Yeltsin Russia's State Duma (lower house of parliament), dominated by communists and ultra-nationalists, has yet to ratify the START-2 strategic arms reduction treaty with Washington.</p>
<p>The treaty would slash U.S. and Russian warheads to about 3,000 on each side by 2003. But it allows for continued testing of missiles falling outside the limits.</p>
<p>Despite the end of the Cold War, Russia is keen to show that it remains a major military force.</p>
<p>It has fiercely opposed NATO's plans to admit former Warsaw Pact countries in eastern and central Europe but on Tuesday the Western alliance was expected to formally invite three nations -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- to join.</p>
