<p>Since emerging as a strongman in this poor Balkan country's March uprising, Agron Qurku has met international political leaders, procured several cars and started building his own sea-view hotel.</p>
<p>Dressed as a commando, two guns strapped to his hips, Qurku, 25, struts through this southern Albanian rebel town, inspiring fear as the only authority left after months of anarchy and violence.</p>
<p>He says his role is to keep order in the absence of any state authority by patrolling the streets and controlling access to Sarande with roadblocks. He claims to command about 150 men but is usually seen with a group of five.</p>
<p>&quot;We check who comes in and if we don't like their face we arrest them until we find out who they are,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;Me and my friends don't take orders from anyone, we do whatever we like.&quot;</p>
<p>Armed youths like Qurku have ruled the south since March, when the collapse of fraudulent investment schemes prompted a popular uprising and forced snap elections due on Sunday.</p>
<p>The men in this nearly-deserted coastal town stand idly in the main square, whispering about his highly profitable dealings. No one dares discuss them openly.</p>
<p>Qurku could be driving any of his luxury cars but prefers to use a white van that carries the green licence plates reserved for the most senior of Albanian officials -- everyone in Sarande knows it was stolen from the Red Cross.</p>
<p>Or he speeds through town in a confiscated police jeep that he has spray-painted to match his military outfit, his friends pointing Kalashnikov rifles through the windows.</p>
<p>&quot;In March we raided the police station and the jail. We burned all the papers and took all the weapons,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Qurku claims he has no political party affiliations but seeks only to overthrow President Sali Berisha, blamed by many Albanians for the crash of the pyramid schemes that left them destitute.</p>
<p>&quot;Berisha put me in jail and took my money. That's why I went crazy,&quot; he said. &quot;We'll make sure he falls.&quot;</p>
<p>He would not clarify why he had been in prison but insisted the reasons were political.</p>
<p>Asked what he would do if Berisha's ruling Democratic party wins Sunday's election, Qurku said his group would block the roads to northern Albania and wage war.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had talks about this with other groups in the south and we all agreed to fight,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said plans to bring three tanks from a nearby abandoned military camp to Sarande for election day were thwarted when their batteries were discovered missing.</p>
<p>&quot;Albanians will steal anything. This country will never get on,&quot; he said contemptuously, puffing on a Dunhill cigarette.</p>
<p>Like most people his age, Qurku, who was a restaurant worker in Greece for two years, has dreams for the future.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to be a public servant, it's stupid,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to own a business.&quot;</p>
