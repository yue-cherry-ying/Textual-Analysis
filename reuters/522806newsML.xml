<p>To trumpet fanfares and the applause of thousands, the emperor Marcus Aurelius and his horse returned in replica form to Rome's Capitol Hill on Saturday.</p>
<p>An exact copy of the only bronze equestrian statue to survive from imperial Rome was formally unveiled in the central Rome square designed by Michelangelo as the city began celebrations to mark its 2,750th birthday.</p>
<p>The Mayor of Rome, Francesco Rutelli, Deputy premier Walter Veltroni and scores of artists and scientists who helped create the replica of the second-century statue attended the unveiling around a pedestal that had stood bare for 16 years.</p>
<p>The original second-century statue of the emperor-philosopher, which is gilt bronze, was removed from its pedestal in 1981 after urban pollution had severely damaged it.</p>
<p>To minimise further atmospheric damage, it is now restored and displayed in a glass case in the Capitoline Museum.</p>
<p>As the Roman choir of Santa Cecilia played the last triumphant bars of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, a white veil was slipped off the bronzed curly hair and armored back of the great Roman emperor to revealing the gleaming figure.</p>
<p>The copy lacks the gold plating and the greening effect -- due to centuries exposed to the elements -- of the original.</p>
<p>&quot;Romans rejoice. This is an extraordinary event,&quot; Rutelli said, quoting from a speech of the ancient Roman emperor, as around 6,000 spectators crowded before the city hall.</p>
<p>As the veil fell to the ground, a police marching band played the Italian national anthem.</p>
<p>During his speech, Veltroni referred to the fire which last week seriously damaged Turin's 15th-century cathedral.</p>
<p>&quot;Events like this, one week from the Turin tragedy, look to the future: museums and monuments that we are able to give back to the world,&quot; said Veltroni, who is also Italy's minister for cultural affairs.</p>
<p>Financed by the city of Rome and by Italian insurance company RAS, the copy was created from a computer-measured geometrical base that was covered over and sculpted in bronze.</p>
<p>&quot;He is the epicentre, the lighthouse of this city,&quot; gushed Sandro Bianchi, 60, a Roman citizen who attended the ceremonies.</p>
<p>But not all Romans were pleased that the original Marcus Aurelius no longer presides over the Capitoline -- the most important of Rome's seven hills.</p>
<p>&quot;In a place like this where everything is original, ancient, a copy just doesn't seem to fit,&quot; said 56-year-old Roman Fiorella Paci after the celebration.</p>
