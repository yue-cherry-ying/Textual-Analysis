<title>UK: Aluminium stays firm on LME, copper buckles at end.</title>
<headline>Aluminium stays firm on LME, copper buckles at end.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Aluminium prices retreated from session highs during Thursday afternoon LME trading, albeit staying firm, but copper slumped in late kerb business.</p>
<p>Most other metals ended the session higher, with tightness also a factor in a strong zinc performance, traders said.</p>
<p>Aluminium backwardations flared considerably ahead of next Monday, when the August &quot;third Wednesday&quot; date will be traded. Tightness has built up on this date, and today saw both borrowing of metal and buying outright of cash as shorts scrambled to cover.</p>
<p>August/one day was at a $11 backwardation, August/week at $17, while the cash/threes spread moved out to near $20 at one stage, having been level earlier this week.</p>
<p>This underpinned the forward market, which shrugged off another stock increase which probably reflected metal attracted by the August backwardation. Three months traded as high as $1,720 before closing at $1,701, up, $5.50 from Wednesday's kerb.</p>
<p>Copper's spread, meanwhile, cracked and cash/threes traded in from $17 to near a $7 backwardation by the close. At the start of the week there was a $20 backwardation.</p>
<p>&quot;That probably gave a green light to the bears,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Prices sagged on commission house selling on the kerb, but managed to stay within the market's current technical range. However, it appears that the downside is now being targeted, traders said.</p>
<p>Last trade was at $2,271, down $16 from Thursday. Under $2,260 the market is vulnerable to sell-stops.</p>
<p>Zinc prices were firmer, boosted by September date tightness, with the market comfortably above the $1,500 level for most of the session.</p>
<p>The 2,400-tonne fall in stocks bolstered the market, especially after talk earlier this week of 20,000 tonnes heading to Singapore. Instead, stocks are so far dribbling into Singapore, with a net rise of only 1,525 tonnes on Thursday.</p>
<p>Nickel trading was volatile throughout, but prices were always ensconced in the plus column as the market staged a technical rally to three days of losses.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, prices hit $6,520 a tonne, the lowest since the start of the year. But the sell-off left the market short, inducing a strong bounce today, with last business at $6,710, up $190.</p>
<p>Once the correction has passed, further declines are likely, with stocks rising remorselessly. On Thursday, inventories were up by 1,260 tonnes. Also, full talks are expected to start next week at Falconbridge's strike-bound Sudbury facilities.</p>
<p>Lead prices tended to edge up, although the pace of trading was slow and the market remains vulnerable to a test of the $600 level again. Last trade was at $610, up $5.</p>
<p>Tin trading was equally slow, but prices were steadier throughout. The market ended at $$5,420, up $10. Alloy was quietly stable, closing at a little changed $1,507/12 a tonne.</p>
