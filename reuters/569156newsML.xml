<p>Colombian chief prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso, a highly popular drug and corruption fighter, announced his candidacy for the presidency on Thursday and said he was offering the country a new sense of &quot;moral leadership.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As president I can do more to change Colombia,&quot; Valdivieso told a packed news conference, saying he had resigned as prosecutor-general and was setting out on &quot;the most important mission of my life.&quot;</p>
<p>As chief prosecutor since 1994, Valdivieso saw all of Colombia's billionaire cocaine kings either jailed or killed. He also spearheaded an independent probe in President Ernesto Samper's election campaign that nearly led to Samper's ouster on drug-corruption charges last year. Polls consistently show him to be Colombia's most popular and respected public figure.</p>
<p>&quot;I offer moral leadership, I offer my decision to fight against systematic coruption,&quot; Valdivieso said in a speech announcing his campaign.</p>
<p>Vowing to turn around a country torn by endemic violence and corruption, he said he also hoped to end Colombia's long-running guerrilla war and would work to improve the living standards of the country's vast majority of poor.</p>
<p>&quot;Insecurity is everywhere,&quot; he said, referring to soaring crime and political bloodshed. &quot;But the saddest thing is that the Colombian people have suffered the insecurity of not having trustworthy leaders.&quot;</p>
<p>Valdivieso, who stands barely five feet (1.5 meters) tall, made his mark by heading the so-called 8,000 Process -- a probe into the campaign finance scandal that nearly led to Samper's impeachment last year.</p>
<p>Although he is a member of Samper's ruling Liberal Party, Valdivieso, 46, said he would run as an independent, a move that could dismantle Colombia's longstanding tradition of rule by the Liberal and Conservative parties.</p>
<p>&quot;The time has come to opt for a fundamental change,&quot; he said, promising to bring &quot;new leadership, new ideas, independence, honesty  and values&quot; to the government and help Colombians defeat their state of &quot;national pessimism.&quot;</p>
<p>Valdivieso is a cousin of Luis Carlos Galan, a charismatic and still revered political leader who was cut down by an assassin's bullets while campaigning for the presidency in 1989. In addition to chief prosecutor he has served as ambassador to Israel, Education minister and senator.</p>
<p>His campaign is sure to focus on his image as a strongarm crusader against crime, but he could find himself open to attack on many fronts, including allegations already voiced by some critics that he used the prosecutor's office as a springboard for the presidency.</p>
<p>He has been given high marks by the United States for his efforts to shore up Colombia's judicial system and crack down on corruption. But authorities say about 90 percent of all crimes still go unpunished in Colombia, which has the highest murder and kidnapping rates in Latin America.</p>
<p>But despite what Valdivieso described as an overwhelming body of evidence that Samper used cocaine cash to fund his campaign, he failed, as prosecutor and Samper's chief nemesis, to build a strong enough case against to impeach him.</p>
<p>Valdivieso's leading opponent for the presidency, according to a flurry of recent polls, is Interior Minister Horacio Serpa, a staunch supporter of Samper and frequent critic of the United States. A firebrand populist, Serpa is expected to step down in accordance with Colombian law to launch his own bid to succeed Samper within a matter of days.</p>
