<p>A Pakistan Air Force jet jettisoned its fuel tanks over a residential area of Karachi on Thursday, setting off a fire that killed at least seven people and injured six, police said.</p>
<p>The pilot of the Mirage fighter, which landed safely at an air force base, dumped the tanks after the plane developed engine trouble on a routine training flight, a military spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was an engine fault in the plane and the pilot was forced to eject the fuel tanks to make a safe landing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Witnesses said fire broke out when one of the fuel tanks fell on Gharibabad, a heavily populated residential area in Karachi's District Central.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a loud explosion... I thought a bomb had exploded,&quot; said teenager Rashid, who lives nearby. &quot;When I came out I saw neighbouring houses in a blaze.&quot;</p>
<p>An air force statement said the pilot had to jettison tanks to save the plane from crashing on a populated area that would have caused a major catastrophe. It said an inquiry had been ordered.</p>
<p>Police said seven people, including a child, died in the blaze. A police official earlier said four children had died, while a spokesman for the Sattar Edhi Ambulance Services said he believed at least 10 people were killed.</p>
<p>Doctors said most of the injured were in a critical condition with 50 to 60 percent burns.</p>
<p>Deputy Superintendent of Police Khawja Nisar said only one of the tanks had exploded. The second tank caused only minor injuries.</p>
<p>&quot;We were lucky that the incident occurred early in the morning,&quot; he said. &quot;Casualties could have been much higher if shops were open and there had been traffic on the road.&quot;</p>
