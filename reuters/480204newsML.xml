<title>INDIA: India's Congress to accept anyone but Deve Gowda.</title>
<headline>India's Congress to accept anyone but Deve Gowda.</headline>
<dateline>NEW DELHI 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>India's Congress Party said on Tuesday it was prepared to accept another candidate from the ruling United Front alliance to replace Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not against any member of the Steering Committee (of the United Front). My only complaint is against Deve Gowda,&quot; Congress president Sitaram Kesri said in a television interview two days after declaring himself a candidate for the top job.  </p>
<p>The Hong Kong-based Star TV's mainly Indian news programme quoted Kesri as hinting he would accept G.K. Moopanar, head of the Tamil Maanila Congress, a key constituent of the United Front, as the next prime minister.</p>
<p>Kesri, in a bombshell announcement on Sunday, told a news conference that the Congress had withdrawn its make-or-break support for Deve Gowda because of his alleged failure to fight communalism.</p>
<p>The allusion was to recent electoral successes of the rightwing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the expense of the Congress. &quot;I am not talking about posts. It is a fight of ideologies,&quot; Kesri said.</p>
<p>President Shankar Dayal Sharma on Monday asked Deve Gowda to seek a vote of confidence in parliament by April 11, raising the prospects of an almost certain defeat for his 10-month old government unless the Congress changes its mind.</p>
