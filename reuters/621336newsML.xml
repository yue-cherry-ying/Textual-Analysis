<p>Natan Sharansky's image as a hero has lost some of its lustre in the year since he assumed a role in Israel's corridors of power.</p>
<p>Political life has proved a challenge for Sharansky, a Jewish dissident who battled the Soviet Union during nine years behind bars before realising his dream of settling in Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to tell you frankly that to be part of the establishment is much less fun than to fight the establishment,&quot; said Sharansky, the 49-year-old industry and trade minister in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet.</p>
<p>Buoyed by hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Sharansky's party came out of nowhere in elections a year ago with the clout to make or break Netanyahu's government.</p>
<p>In his biggest test so far, Sharansky came under pressure from politicians on all sides both to topple Netanyahu and to prop him up over a corruption scandal.</p>
<p>At first Sharansky threatened to quit if even 10 percent of the influence-peddling allegations proved true. But when prosecutors found insufficient evidence to put Netanyahu on trial, Sharansky stayed put.</p>
<p>&quot;The police report on the appointment was very serious,&quot; he said in an interview at his Jerusalem office. &quot;At the same time there is all the difference in the world between being suspected and between being accused.&quot;</p>
<p>Sharansky has won high marks for making ministry appointments on a professional rather than a political basis. He co-chairs a committee on government appointments he forced Netanyahu to set up because of the corruption scandal.</p>
<p>His Yisrael ba-Aliya (Israel of Immigration) party has given an official voice to the one of every six Israelis who hail from the former Soviet Union, most of them arriving in a wave of immigration since Moscow flung open the doors in 1989.</p>
<p>But a Gallup poll of Israelis for the newspaper Maariv ranked Sharansky 13th among the 18 cabinet ministers a year into office. He scored a grade of 5.37 on a 10-point scale but still came in two places ahead of Netanyahu.</p>
<p>A former employer, Jerusalem Report editor Hirsh Goodman, wrote a column in May calling Sharansky &quot;just another cheap politician&quot; intent only on personal political survival.</p>
<p>It was a far cry from the hero's welcome that greeted Sharansky on his arrival in 1986 at the end of his Gulag ordeal.</p>
<p>The contrast has not been lost on Sharansky, who said: &quot;Sometimes it's by far more difficult to say what is right and what is wrong than it was 20 years ago in prison.&quot;</p>
<p>Even as Sharansky grapples with the everyday problems of Israeli politics, he surrounds himself with trappings that remind him of his earlier struggle.</p>
<p>He has shunned the coat and tie of most politicians, explaining: &quot;Since I went out of prison, I am in constant struggle not to be imprisoned by the rules of the free world.&quot;</p>
<p>For years he has donned an Israeli army cap, once a symbol of his dissident struggle and now a way of avoiding being typecast in a country that defines a man's Jewish religious convictions by the colour and fabric of the skullcap he wears.</p>
<p>That said, he regards himself as religious and carries with him a Book of Psalms at all times -- a memento of his time in prisons and work camps.</p>
<p>Mounted on the wall of Sharansky's office is a prized photo of his late friend Andrei Sakharov, the father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb who was internally exiled for criticising the Kremlin's human rights abuses.</p>
<p>Sharansky said it was no coincidence that pictures of Netanyahu and Israeli President Ezer Weizman hung on the wall directly opposite Sakharov's photo. He explained:</p>
<p>&quot;For Sakharov there was never any distance between what he sought and what he said and I think that every person -- especially a politician -- should learn a lot from Sakharov.&quot;</p>
<p>Sharansky's wife Avital campaigned for years the world over until his release in an East-West prisoner swap. She knocked on the doors of the powerful and called journalists day and night on behalf of her &quot;Anatoly&quot;, as he was known before moving to Israel and taking a Hebrew name.</p>
<p>Now she avoids the political spotlight.</p>
<p>&quot;Avital is not a public person and that's why all these years that she forced herself to be in public, to give press conferences, to lead demonstrations, to meet the leaders of the world, she really suffered,&quot; Sharansky said.</p>
<p>&quot;The moment that I was released, she started doing what she really always wanted and enjoyed -- bringing up kids, making important decisions about their school, and volunteering to help the new immigrants and other people.&quot;</p>
<p>Sharansky said he sensed that Avital, a devout Jew who waited 12 years to be reunited with him, would like him to study all day in a religious seminary. But for now he has other ideas.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem was always my desire to change things, to influence, to move ahead, to change the world,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On the peacemaking front Sharansky, having fought for his freedom, said he could relate to Palestinian demands for rights. But he said there was a difference between being a rights activist and turning to violence.</p>
<p>&quot;I definitely think that they should have all the rights in the world except the right and the opportunity to destroy us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sharansky said he would stay in the government so long as he believed he could positively influence its work, ensure an end to scandals and help to pursue peace, economic development and a better social life.</p>
<p>&quot;The moment I will feel that it becomes only an illusion, the moment I feel that I don't have real influence and that the same type of scandals which were in the past have a chance to happen again, I will not stay in the government even one day.&quot;</p>
