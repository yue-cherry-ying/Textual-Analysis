<p>Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said on Monday the government would continue to vigorously oppose compulsory targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>&quot;We, the government, are going to continue striving for an outcome that does not harm Australia's economic interests,&quot; Downer told a seminar in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Australia, a major coal exporter, is fighting U.S. and European Union efforts to impose compulsory across-the-board targets, with Canberra instead arguing for goals tailored to suit individual countries -- a process known as differentiation.</p>
<p>The European Union is pushing for parties to the United Nations Climate Change Convention to adopt targets to cut greenhouse emissions to 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.</p>
<p>Australia has privately raised the possibility of quitting the convention if unacceptable targets are imposed at a meeting of convention nations in Kyoto, Japan in December.</p>
<p>Downer said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics (ABARE) had estimated that the cumulative loss to the Australian economy by the year 2020 would be A$150 billion (US$112.5 billion) if the government adopted the approach suggested by the European Union.</p>
<p>&quot;The reality is because we are a relatively small and highly specialised economy we cannot afford the cost involved in taking a disproportionately high share of the global greenhouse abatement effort,&quot; Downer said.</p>
<p>Downer said recent high-level lobbying efforts within the United Nations were showing signs of progress. He added that Australian prime minister, John Howard, had received support on the issue from several American legislators during his recent visit to that country.</p>
<p>&quot;Our sense is there is growing pressure on the U.S. administration to carefully examine the costs that greenhouse abatement would impose on the American economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Downer said Australia was prepared to pull its weight to meet the global challenge of greenhouse emissions but was also committed to simultaneously ensuring that Australia's future prosperity was not put at risk.</p>
