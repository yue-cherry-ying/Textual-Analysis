<p>As an axe continues to hang over much of Europe's excess oil refining capacity, Rotterdam's oil giants have remodelled their plants to face the millennium.</p>
<p>Royal Dutch/Shell's started up the 3.3 billion guilder ($1.7 billion) &quot;PER+&quot; upgrade at its 374,000 barrels per day (bpd) capacity Pernis plant this month.</p>
<p>Within a year, one of the two refineries owned by rival Nerefco -- a BP/Texaco joint venture -- will close, but most of the capacity will remain after a massive upgrade of its nearby Europoort plant, at around a tenth of the cost of Shell's project.</p>
<p>Both plans are a reaction to declining profits from European refining, the result of overcapacity and a product mix ill-suited to current demand.</p>
<p>The investments acknowledge the increasing market share of diesel.</p>
<p>Shell predicts that by 2005, diesel demand in Europe, at about 125 million tonnes, will for the first time outstrip that for gasoline.</p>
<p>The measures are also designed to address tougher EU environmental legislation.</p>
<p>A European Commission proposal recommends reducing the level of sulphur in diesel from the current 500 parts per million (ppm) to 350 ppm by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Shell's plan will also cut the output of less profitable fuel oil, used for power generation, by 40 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;In however many years time, refineries will have a product (fuel oil) which has next to no value. Shell is acting now,&quot; said David Stedman head of research at Daiwa Europe.</p>
<p>Shell's &quot;PER+&quot; complex adds three units to the existing Pernis refinery -- a new hydrocracker, the largest of its kind in the world, a gasification unit to produce hydrogen and a 115 megawatt (MW) power plant.</p>
<p>The refinery may end up transmitting up to 80 MW to the public grid, making it one of the first refineries to be a net seller of electricity.</p>
<p>Shell is keen to trumpet the environmental benefits of its investment.</p>
<p>The new units will result in the recovery of almost three times as much sulphur as before and nitrogen oxide emissions will be cut be around 40 percent.</p>
<p>More carbon dioxide will also be collected, leading to talk of underground storage of the gas or use in greenhouses by the horticultural industry.</p>
<p>&quot;We have set ourselves the goal of becoming one of the top 10 refineries in the world in 1998 in terms of management and efficiency,&quot; said Govert Boeles, director of personnel and social affairs at Shell Pernis.</p>
<p>The Per+ complex will be fully operational in the early autumn.</p>
<p>Nerefco's plans are less grandiose.</p>
<p>By the end of this year, the company's 220,000 bpd capacity Pernis refinery will be reduced to a single hydrofiner, a unit for sulphur removal, and that too will wind down in autumn 1998.</p>
<p>Most of the loss will be made up by the expansion at Europoort. Its 200,000 bpd capacity will double with the upgrading of a currently disused central distillation unit due to start up in November.</p>
<p>Output of diesel will also rise after the completion of a new 40,000 bpd hydrofiner at Europoort, to replace the 25,000 bpd unit in Pernis.</p>
<p>The result will be more middle distillate and chemical feedstock naphtha and less gasoline and fuel oil and lower levels of sulphur.</p>
<p>&quot;It's fairly clear that Nerefco's changes are better suited (than Shell's) to market conditions of low returns,&quot; said Jeremy Hudson, energy analyst at Salomon Brothers in London.</p>
<p>Dutch refineries may have been forced to the forefront of change because of their dominant role in export and international spot markets.</p>
<p>Shell's Pernis refinery exports two-thirds of its annual output of 17.9 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Return on downstream investments will remain poor while western Europe's overcapacity persists, analysts say.</p>
<p>West European refinery output is expected to fall by 300,000 bpd over the next two years.</p>
