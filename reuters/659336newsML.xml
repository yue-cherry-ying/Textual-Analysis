<p>An accident at Japan's only nuclear fuel reprocessing plant has left the island nation with swelling stockpiles of spent radioactive material, government officials and industry sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>And questions as to the cause of the accident have stalled the progress of new facilities built to deal with the growing problem, they said. &quot;We've known some storage facilities would run out of their capacities around 2000, and we have been taking measures accordingly,&quot; said an official for the trade ministry's Agency of Natural Resources and Energy.</p>
<p>&quot;What we didn't anticipate is the (Tokaimura) accident and delays in opening a new processing plant.&quot;</p>
<p>He was referring to a March fire and explosion accident at Japan's sole spent fuel reprocessing plant in Tokaimura, 110 kilometres (69 miles) northeast of Tokyo, which exposed 37 workers to low level radiation and threw Japan's ambitious nuclear energy programme into a tailspin.</p>
<p>The closure of the Tokaimura plant, which took spent nuclear fuel and separated waste from the re-usable remnants of uranium and plutonium, has blocked progress at a second plant built to handle spent fuel.</p>
<p>The plant, to be operated by Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd in northern Japan's Aomori prefecture, has a 3,000-tonne storage facility and was scheduled to begin receiving shipments from other plants in June.</p>
<p>But regional authorities there have halted talks on the new plant's safety measures until the cause of Tokaimura can be determined. To make matters worse, Japan's nuclear fuel reprocessing contracts with foreign countries such as France will expire by 1998, making the Aomori stalemate even more worrisome.</p>
<p>And energy agency officials say the Japanese government has no plans to extend the existing contracts for overseas reprocessing, nor to ship spent fuel abroad for storage. Japan Atomic Power Co's Tsuruga nuclear plant in Fukui on the Sea of Japan coast, which is suffering the most acute storage pinch, had filled over 70 percent of it's 450 tonne storage capacity as of the end of last year. A company spokesman said the plant's existing storage unit will hit maximum by 2002, unless fuel can be shipped out or additional storage constructed.</p>
<p>Japan Atomic has a plan to expand the capacity of the existing temporary storage facility by 70 percent before the turn of the century. But Fukui prefectural authorities are balking, saying that the quick fix of new storage may see radioactive material pile up indefinitely.</p>
<p>Other Japan plants face similar dilemmas, officials say.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, government investigation into the cause of Tokaimura's fire and explosion has no clear end in sight. &quot;We are working with no deadline in mind,&quot; said an official at Japan's Science and Technology Agency.</p>
<p>&quot;We are determined to get down to the bottom of the cause of the accident no matter how long it takes.&quot;</p>
