<p>England defender Stuart Pearce confirmed on Thursday that he was standing down as Nottingham Forest's team manager and that general manager Dave Bassett was taking over.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old England fullback told a lunchtime news conference that he was intending to revert to being solely a player and pledged his allegiance to the club and backing for Bassett.</p>
<p>Pearce stressed he was ready to help Forest, who were relegated from the premier league at the weekend, regain their premier league place.</p>
<p>He said: &quot;As manager it has been difficult to distance myself from the players so I don't think being a player again would be a problem. I'm happy to work under Dave Bassett.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm contracted here as a player and I will be here as a player next season,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pearce became caretaker player manager on December 20 when Frank Clark quit. Forest started brightly under his guidance, but only one win in their last 14 league matches condemned them to the drop for the second time in four seasons.</p>
