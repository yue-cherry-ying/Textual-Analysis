<p>Base metal prices made substantial gains to steal the show on the world commodities markets on Thursday after a spate of investment fund buying against a backdrop of waning stocks.</p>
<p>Zinc was the star of the day on the London Metal Exchange (LME) as it zoomed to 4-1/2 year highs of $1,328 per tonne by midday, up from the previous close of $1,287.</p>
<p>As zinc pulled ahead, aluminium rose nine dollars to chalk up a six-week high of $1,672 per tonne. On Wednesday it had it jumped $29 on good fund-based demand and a fall in warehouse stocks.</p>
<p>Copper also made gains to break key resistance at $2,380, rising $13 on the open to an intraday high of $2,387 per tonne by the midsession.</p>
<p>Metals analysts said the jump in the price of zinc was no surprise due to the tight supply situation and expected further rises in the future. Zinc has already risen 26 percent ($300) since the start of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;We think zinc prices could peak out this time next year at 85 cents/lb ($1,873/tonne),&quot; said Nick Moore, a London-based metals analyst for Flemings Global Mining Group. &quot;It's a genuinely tight market.&quot;</p>
<p>The metal, used primarily in galvanising steel and manufacturing brass, became the darling of funds and speculators in recent months after world demand overtook production and started eating into big inventories.</p>
<p>&quot;The general expectation is that much of the previously huge inventory overhang will have been eroded by the latter part of 1997,&quot; brokers Billiton said in a report issued on Thursday.</p>
<p>Western world demand exceeded supply by 200,000 tonnes last year, and the trend was expected to continue, according to the global watchdog the International Lead and Zinc Study Group.</p>
<p>Many analysts said that even if China, the world's biggest zinc producer, should seek to capitalise on the rising prices and increase exports, it would fail to dampen bullish prospects.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in commodity markets, coffee  was  jumpy on fears of short Latin American supply and the onset of the Brazilian frost season.</p>
<p>World coffee prices hiccuped in late trading in London following news that port workers in the Brazilian port of Santos had stopped work to protest at reduced pay.</p>
<p>Futures for robusta coffee beans hit a six-week high of $1,785 per tonne, $32 up on the open for the July contract. The last time it graced those levels was on March 11 when it closed at $1,820.</p>
<p>Futures prices for robusta beans, mostly used in making soluble or instant coffee, have risen by one-third since the start of 1997 while arabica types, traded in New York, have doubled.</p>
<p>The increase in raw coffee prices has already filtered through to supermarket shelves in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>The benchmark New York arabica contract made a modest gain of 8.10 cents to an intraday high of 219.50 per pound.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, gold ended in London $3.05 higher at $343.65/$344.15 an ounce after New York-led fund buying, but failed to break resistance at $345.15.</p>
<p>July Wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade rose 4-3/4 cents a bushel to $4.09 on Thursday, to keep its head above the $4.00 resistance level for the second day running.</p>
<p>Wheat &quot;spiked&quot; up to a high of $4.59 on April 21 after floods and a cold snap in the United States and worries about a prolonged dry spell in western Europe. Weather concerns have somewhat abated in recent days.</p>
<p>Crude oil prices were up following signs that the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is preparing to freeze its production ceiling at its meeting next month and tackle quota busting.</p>
<p>The benchmark Brent Blend of North Sea crude for July hit a day's high of $18.65 per barrel from opening at $18.24.</p>
