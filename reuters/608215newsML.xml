<p>AmerUs Life Holdings Inc said Friday it has reached a settlement of a class action lawsuit in Texas state court over alleged improper life insurance sales practices.</p>
<p>The company said the lawsuit, involving its AmerUs Life Insurance Co unit, will be settled within the range of a $5 million reserve established during the third quarter of 1996.  </p>
<p>&quot;We beleive that our reserve of $5 million is adequate to satisfy substantially all the claims of those affected policy owners while having a minimal financial impact on our operations,&quot; said Roger Brooks, chief executive officer, said in a news release.</p>
<p>The sales practices cited include expectations that policy holders would not have to pay premiums, using cash values from existing policies to pay for other policies, and saying the policies could be used as an investment.</p>
<p>Some policyholders may have been affected by declining interest rates in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which caused them to pay more cash premiums than originally expected, AmerUs said.</p>
<p>AmerUs Life said it denies any wrongdoing in the lawsuit.</p>
<p>AmerUs shares were unchanged at 25-5/8 on Friday in exchange trading.</p>
