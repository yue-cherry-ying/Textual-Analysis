<headline>Albanian PM meets rebels in south for first time.</headline>
<dateline>TIRANA 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino went to Albania's rebel-held south on Tuesday for the first time since insurgents seized control of the region last month, local reporters said.</p>
<p>Fino arrived by helicopter in the rebel-held stronghold of Gjirokaster, 30 kms (20 miles) from the Greek border and was welcomed by rebels bristling with weapons, the reporters said.</p>
<p>He was greeted by rebel leaders and their bodyguards from Gjirokaster and Tepelene, another stronghold to the north. He shook hands with Gjoleke Malaj, the rebel boss in Tepelene.</p>
<p>Fino told reporters he was in the region to meet &quot;legal representatives of local power and public order&quot; and he barred the rebels from closed-door talks with elected officials.</p>
<p>Legally elected officials have remained in the region but the south has been controlled by rebel-run Committees of Public Salvation since the army was driven out and munitions depots looted in early March.</p>
<p>The meeting with elected officials lasted 10 minutes and then moved to a hall where Fino, elected officials, rebel leaders and the Salvation committees all joined in discussions, the reporters said.</p>
<p>Albania has been swept by violence since January when a number of fraudulent investment schemes collapsed, wiping out millions of dollars in savings.</p>
<p>The anti-government riots and protests evolved into a full- scale uprising against President Sali Berisha, who is blamed for letting the &quot;pyramid&quot; schemes flourish.</p>
<p>Rebels seized towns and villages throughout the south, and now control about half of the country.</p>
