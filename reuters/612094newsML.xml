<headline>Pressure mounts on ASEAN to defer Burma membership.</headline>

<p>Pressure mounted on the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Friday to defer giving membership to Burma after the military regime's latest crackdown on democracy campaigners.</p>
<p>But diplomats and officials say ASEAN, which groups some of the world's fastest-growing economies and has taken a leading role in Asian security issues, would not be deterred.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright said on Thursday she would consider ways of adding pressure on ASEAN, expected to admit Burma as a member in July along with Cambodia and Laos.</p>
<p>&quot;I have written to various (ASEAN) leaders. I would very much like to slow down the possibility of Burma coming into the ASEAN,&quot; Albright said when questioned about Burma policy at a Senate committee hearing.</p>
<p>&quot;We have tried very hard to get the ASEAN countries to follow our steps, but they don't seem to be interested in it,&quot; she added. &quot;I will relook at whether we should take some further action in encouraging them further.&quot;</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton, citing &quot;severe repression&quot; in Burma, on Tuesday imposed economic sanctions on Rangoon, banning all new U.S. investment.</p>
<p>Reports from Rangoon said at least 60 members of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) were arrested this week ahead of a planned party gathering.</p>
<p>Britain and Germany on Thursday condemned the arrests and called for action against Burma's military government.</p>
<p>&quot;We are urgently exploring with our EU (European Union) partners the scope for further action against the SLORC,&quot; a British Foreign Office statement said.</p>
<p>In Bonn, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in a statement: &quot;The latest intimidation, threats and arrests represent a new attempt by the military regime...to silence the democratic opposition.&quot;</p>
<p>Foreign ministers of ASEAN -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- will meet in Kuala Lumpur on May 31 to decide exactly when to admit Burma.</p>
<p>All indications point to ASEAN's annual meeting on July 24-25, diplomats say.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything I hear from the Malaysians and others in ASEAN is it's quite likely to happen in July,&quot; said a Western diplomat who attended a senior officials meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in Malaysia's island resort of Langkawi this week.</p>
<p>That would put the United States and the European Union in the ticklish position of sitting at the same table as Burma when ARF holds its ministerial meeting following the ASEAN meeting.</p>
<p>All three are members of ARF, a 19-member grouping set up four years ago to help resolve potential conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Western members tried to raise the Burma issue at the ARF senior officials meeting, despite ground rules forbidding discussion of any country's internal affairs.</p>
<p>&quot;The Burmese delegation gave the standard recitation of how things are getting better all the time,&quot; one diplomat said.</p>
<p>Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has made a name in international affairs as an outspoken critic of the West, is determined to admit Burma this year when Malaysia takes its turn as ASEAN chairman on the grouping's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>The Philippines, up to now ASEAN's most reluctant member on Burma, on Thursday called for its admission.</p>
<p>Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Rodolfo Severino told reporters that Burma's admission was important for regional stability &quot;and the people of Myanmar themselves&quot;.</p>
