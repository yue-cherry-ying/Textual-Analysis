<p>Estimates of surging U.S. crude oil stocks fed by rising imports sent an early spring chill through the ranks of energy analysts on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Crude oil on hand at the nation's refineries rose 6.4 million barrels last week, including more than 3 million barrels added to inventories in the critical Gulf Coast and Midwest regions, the American Petroleum Institute estimated.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see really much positive if anything in these numbers,&quot; said Prudential energy analyst Rich Redash. &quot;As with the snow melting today, so will the bulls.&quot;</p>
<p>Crude oil inventories nationwide were pegged at 308.9 million barrels for the week ended March 28, up 11.14 million barrels compared to the same week last year, API said.</p>
<p>The West Coast PADD 5 market accounted for 5.04 million barrels of the build. &quot;(The build) is still bearish, but maybe less so than the full build because of the West Coast,&quot; said Tom Bentz, ING Futures and Options vice president.</p>
<p>Gulf Coast PADD 3 refineries loaded up with imported crude, adding a net 2.48 million barrels to stocks on hand at week's end that left inventories 17.6 million barrels above the same week last year in that region, analysts said.</p>
<p>Crude imports surged on the week, averaging 8.02 million barrels per day or 1.11 million barrels per day above the prior week, the Washington, D.C.-based trade group said in its weekly stocks survey.</p>
<p>&quot;You've got a lot of swing crudes floating around,&quot; Redash said of a steady stream of North Sea, West African and Latin American crude barrels finding a home at U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.</p>
<p>Refined products imports, meanwhile, were pegged at an average 1.55 million barrels per day, down an average 674,000 barrels per day compared to the prior week, the API said.</p>
<p>Refinery utilization in the critical Gulf Coast refining region was unchanged on the week with refineries operating at 96.2 percent of capacity, up 0.1 percentage points from the prior week, the trade group said.</p>
<p>Nationwide, domestic refineries were operating at 93.6 percent of capacity, up 0.9 percentage points compared to the prior week and up 1.5 percentage points compared to the same week last year, the API said.</p>
<p>Gasoline stocks nationwide were drawn down 335,000 barrels to end the week at 198.21 million barrels, or 5.39 million barrels below the same week last year, API said.</p>
<p>Distillate stocks in primary storage at the nation's refineries stood at 99.43 million barrels for the week, down 2.58 million barrels for the week but still 8.27 million barrels above the same week last year, API said.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the increase in refinery runs, both heat and gasoline production were down. I don't know how to read that,&quot; Bentz said.</p>
