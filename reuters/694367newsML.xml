<p>Armed members of Mozambique's former rebel movement Renamo have surrounded a unit of riot police and are threatening war, the governor of the central Sofala province was reported as saying on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;They are threatening to wage war and many people are already abandoning Maringue and seeking safer places,&quot; Governor Felisberto Tomas, whose province includes the Maringue district, told the country's main daily paper Noticias.</p>
<p>Maringue housed Renamo's military headquarters during the closing years of the civil war which started in 1976. Since the 1992 peace accord and its defeat in the 1994 elections, Renamo has tried to keep control over Maringue.</p>
<p>Attempts by the ruling Frelimo to establish offices in Maringue have been met repeatedly with violence from Renamo. The most recent attack was in April when the rebel group attacked the tents being used by Frelimo civilians and burnt the Frelimo flag.</p>
<p>Frelimo then pulled out of Maringue and retreated to the central port city of Beira.</p>
<p>When a police unit was sent to Maringue earlier this month Renamo -- now the main opposition party in parliament -- claimed the government was &quot;provoking and harassing&quot; its members.</p>
<p>Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama promised this month that he would visit Maringue for two months to monitor police behaviour.</p>
<p>Tomas said the situation deteriorated on Wednesday when a large group of Renamo supporters in Maringue armed themselves and dressed in uniform. Renamo was supposed to have surrendered all its weapons during the United Nations-supervised peace process between 1992 and 1994.</p>
<p>The governor said the riot police unit has remained calm and was protecting Maringue district administrator, Nobre Meque. Ironically Meque is a Renamo member, nominated for the job by his party. But Renamo now claims Meque was &quot;bought&quot; by Frelimo.</p>
<p>Dhlakama is scheduled to arrive in Maringue on Monday.</p>
