<p>When Harold Englehardt died April 1 at age 96, the former bank president left a lasting legacy to the west central Michigan community that had been his home for 75 years: a $12 million gift.</p>
<p>Local officials revealed the gift at a news conference Tuesday. They said the money will be used for charitable purposes in the city of Lowell, population 4,000, and two surrounding communities, which have about 8,000 residents.</p>
<p>Lowell City Manager David Pasquale, who found out about the gift Monday, said the size of the donation dwarfs the city's $1.9 million general fund for the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>&quot;We knew something might be in the works, but had no direct knowledge. It's just astounding,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Englehardt arrived in Lowell in 1922 to take a job as a bank cashier at the Lowell State Bank. He later bought the Lowell Granite Co. and eventually became president of the bank, which became FMB State Savings Bank.</p>
<p>Englehardt and his wife, Mildred, lived in Lowell their entire lives and had no children. The couple were active in the community, providing meals to the homeless and setting up scholarships.</p>
<p>Pasquale said Englehardt was known to be well-off, but he lived modestly and could often be seen driving around town or visiting his favourite restaurant.</p>
<p>Lowell officials said Englehardt's gift was set up as an &quot;advised&quot; fund of the Grand Rapids Foundation, a 75-year-old charitable organisation. Foundation managers will oversee management of the fund, including investments to grow the principal amount.</p>
<p>A five-person advisory committee was established to award charitable grants. Committee members include Pasquale and John Darling, a great nephew of Englehardt's.</p>
<p>&quot;This is his way of giving something back to a community that has meant so much to him and his wife,&quot; said Darling.</p>
