<headline>Italian police arrest 11 Mafiosi from key clan.</headline>
<dateline>PALERMO, Sicily 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Italian police said on Thursday they had detained 11 members of the Corleone Mafia clan of arrested boss of bosses Salvatore Riina.</p>
<p>Among those arrested in the swoop, which was ordered by prosecutors in the Sicilian capital Palermo and based on testimony from Mafia turncoats, was Riina's nephew, Mario Grizzaffi.</p>
<p>The 11 were charged with being high-ranking members of Cosa Nostra and deputising for Riina and other arrested Mob bosses. Police gave no details of the operation.</p>
<p>Prosecutors alleged Grizzaffi took part in numerous Mafia summits and that he and others sheltered Mafiosi on the run, stored weapons and blackmailed businessmen.</p>
<p>Two men in their 60s were among those detained.</p>
<p>Riina's clan, from the hilltop town of Corleone immortalised in Hollywood's Godfather movies, rose to prominence at the head of Cosa Nostra with a reign of terror which shook even the Mob.</p>
<p>Riina was arrested in January 1993 after nearly 23 years on the run.</p>
