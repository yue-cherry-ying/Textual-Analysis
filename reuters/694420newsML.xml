<p>Typhoon Peter stormed through southern Japan on Saturday, killing one person, disrupting air, rail and road traffic and triggering landslides.</p>
<p>Peter, the second typhoon to hit Japan this month, was packing maximum winds of 108 kph (67.5 mph) and was expected to dump up to 35 cm (14 inches) of rain, the Meteorological Agency said.</p>
<p>As of 10.00 a.m. (0100 GMT), Typhoon Peter was storming through Nagasaki, 980 km (600 miles) southwest of Tokyo, the agency said.</p>
<p>Police said a 44-year-old woman drowned after falling into a river while trying to get into her car.</p>
<p>The typhoon was moving northeast towards Japan's main island of Honshu at a speed of 35 kph (22 mph), it said.</p>
<p>More than 100 domestic flights were cancelled because of the typhoon, airline companies said.</p>
<p>Police said the typhoon caused landslides at a dozen locations on Japan's southern main island Kyushu.</p>
<p>The Meteorological Agency issued flash flood warnings throughout southern and central Japan, including Tokyo, due to heavy rains forecast in the wake of Typhoon Peter.</p>
<p>Last week, Typhoon Opal killed one person and disrupted air, rail and road traffic when it hit central Japan.</p>
