<p>Space visionary Arthur C. Clarke on Tuesday said evidence uncovered by the U.S. Pathfinder mission so far could support the widely-believed theory that there might be life on Mars.</p>
<p>&quot;Evidence of running water in the past is a key element which supports the theory that there could have been life on Mars,&quot; Clarke told Reuters from his home in the Sri Lankan capital.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks more and more plausible that conditions on Mars a billion years or so ago may have been favourable to life,&quot; said the 79-year-old Clarke, author of scores of popular novels and non-fiction books on life beyond Earth.</p>
<p>Scientists of the Pathfinder mission said on Monday the area around the spacecraft's landing site was hit by a catastrophic flood billions of years ago. Scientists want to know where the water went and what happened to what they believe was an atmosphere that was once as dense as Earth's but is now much thinner.</p>
<p>One of the aims of the Mars expeditionary programme, which will send four more landers to various sites on the planet over the next eight years, is to discover if life, even in its most primitive form, ever existed on the Red Planet.</p>
<p>Clarke, who wrote about colonising Mars, said it was quite possible that even though conditions on that planet today are quite hostile, at least by Earth standards, there may exist undiscovered oases which are more favourable to life.</p>
<p>&quot;Missions in the near future will tell us far more about Mars. Who knows, it may be mankind's next home,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The British-born Clarke, who has lived in Sri Lanka for the past 30 years, said he was delighted with the results of the &quot;fantastically successful&quot; Pathfinder mission.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the writer launched his latest book &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot;. It is the last in a series of popular futuristic science fiction novels which began with Clarke's 1968 book, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.</p>
