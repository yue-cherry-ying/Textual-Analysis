<p>Labour leader Tony Blair has confessed how hungry he is for the top job of prime minister as Britain heads into the last 10 days of the election campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;I want it so badly,&quot; he said of the prize of power that has for so long eluded the main opposition party, left to languish in the political wilderness for 18 years by wary voters.</p>
<p>&quot;The chance to do something ... Opposition is important, you have to get your messages across, but God, you know, to be able to make real changes ...&quot; he told the Sunday Times.</p>
<p>Blair, the centrist who has dumped much of Labour's socialist dogma, laid out his political stall with fervour: &quot;My guiding belief is that politics must be modernised.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The principles of the party were absolutely fine but nationalisation, state control, that way of organising things had had its day,&quot; he said in a clear message to the middle class voters he needs to turn their backs on Conservative rule.</p>
<p>The latest opinion poll in the Sunday Times showed that Labour's once yawning lead over the Conservatives had sunk to its lowest point for four years -- but they are still 14 points ahead in the runup to the May 1 election.</p>
<p>It showed voters preferred the Conservatives as the best party to manage Britain's booming economy and keep taxes down.</p>
<p>But splits within the Conservatives over Britain's role in the European Union have hit the ruling party which depicted Blair in campaign advertisements as a ventriloquist's dummy on the knee of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.</p>
<p>The poll showed 48 percent believed Blair would make the stronger leader compared to 29 percent for Prime Minister John Major, seeking to give the Conservatives their fifth election win in a row.</p>
<p>Blair denounced the Conservatives as degenerate and said the advertisement was &quot;the act of a desperate party.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Major is always fighting for a job, never fighting for a vision,&quot; Blair told the Independent on Sunday.</p>
<p>His anger was echoed by former Conservative Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath who called the advertisement abhorrent and contemptible.</p>
<p>Like a true evangeliser, Blair has revamped his party with fervent zeal and he is proud of the Christian Socialist credentials that motivate him.</p>
<p>But in the Sunday Times profile interview, Blair confessed: &quot;I can't stand politicians who wear God on their sleeve.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no point in trying to deny that I'm a Christian but that's not a reason for voting for me or not voting for me.&quot;</p>
<p>Critics mock &quot;Tony Bland&quot; as a sound-bite politician whose cautious election campaign has sought to bury the old &quot;tax-and-spend&quot; Labour image that proved anathema to voters.</p>
<p>But Blair confronted those who say he is inexperienced and not tough enough: &quot;I listen carefully to colleagues but in the end it's like running a business. You can't do it by committee ... The buck stops me with me and that's that.&quot;</p>
