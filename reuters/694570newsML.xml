<p>An Italian judge has reopened an investigation into a World War Two bombing of German soldiers by partisans in Rome that provoked a Nazi reprisal in which 335 people were killed, court officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Maurizio Pacioni, a preliminary investigating judge, ruled that the March, 1944, bombing in Rome's Via Rasella which killed 32 people, mostly German soldiers with some Italian civilians, should not be considered an act of war.</p>
<p>Pacioni called for a fresh investigation of the case despite a 1957 ruling by Italy's highest court which said the bombers could not be punished for an act of war against Rome's Nazi occupiers.</p>
<p>Friday's ruling came after a relative of a civilian victim of the bombing asked to have the case reopened.</p>
<p>The relative's lawyer, Francesco Caroleo Grimaldi, has written that he suspects the attack was actually a settling of accounts between rival partisan factions rather than a blast aimed at the Germans.</p>
<p>In that the case, the three surviving executors of the bombing could face charges of massacre or murder since their act would no longer be considered one of war, sources say.</p>
<p>But the ruling has sparked a storm of protest with many accusing Pacioni of reviving a dead case for political motives.</p>
<p>He announced his decision the same day that a military prosecutor sought for the second time to have former Nazi SS captain Erich Priebke sentenced to life for his part the German reprisal to the Via Rasella attack.</p>
<p>The prosecutor also asked for a 24-year term for former SS major Karl Hass, who like Priebke faces charges of complicity in the Ardeatine Caves massacre, which is considered Italy's worst World War Two atrocity.</p>
<p>There were 335 victims, 75 of them Jewish, in the reprisal. It took place 24 hours after the Via Rasella bombing.</p>
<p>Pietro Ingrao, a former partisan resistance fighter and veteran leftist leader, called Pacioni's ruling an &quot;aberration&quot; and told the judge to brush up on his history.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the conclusion of someone who doesn't have the faintist idea of what the war against Nazi fascism was all about and of how much suffering the duty of fighting the oppressor cost us,&quot; Ingrao said.</p>
<p>Rosario Bentivegna, who planted the bomb in Via Rasella, accused Pacioni of being motivated by political interests.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1996, the trial against Priebke was opened, and now they want one for us. Who are they? Fascists,&quot; Bentivegna was quoted as telling Corriere della Sera daily.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Pacioni) is trying to distract attention from the Priebke trial. It does not surprise me,&quot; Bentivegna said.</p>
<p>Priebke's first trial ended in uproar last August when a military court ruled he was guilty of complicity in the massacre but could not be punished under a statute of limitations.</p>
<p>Protestors besieged the court and Priebke was re-arrested a few hours later. The verdict was quashed on appeal.</p>
<p>Hass had reluctantly testified at that first trial from a hospital bed after injuring himself while trying to flee from a hotel balcony outside Rome.</p>
<p>He was later arrested after admitting in court that he too killed victims. Like Priebke, he is now under house arrest.</p>
