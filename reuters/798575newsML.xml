<p>Marie-Louise Meilleur, the 116-year-old Canadian woman confirmed by the Guinness Book of Records on Thursday as the world's oldest person, is blind and deaf, but still loves to sing.</p>
<p>&quot;When we go see her, she sings, 'C'est le mois de Marie' (It's the Virgin Mary's month).' And she sings very loud! She is very religious,&quot; Meilleur's step-granddaughter Nicole Bossi told Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>Meilleur, who lives in a nursing home in Corbeil in northern Ontario, will turn 117 on Aug. 29.</p>
<p>Born Marie-Louise Fibronie Chassi in 1880 in Kamouraska, Quebec, Meilleur has taken over the age record from Frenchwoman Jeanne Calmant, who died earlier this month at the age of 122.</p>
<p>Meilleur has more than 300 known descendants spread over six generations. She was married for the first time in 1900 to a Kamouraska fisherman, Etienne Leclerc. They had six children before her husband died of pneumonia in 1911.</p>
<p>She later married Hector Meilleur, a lumber worker. The couple settled in northern Ontario and she had six more children.</p>
<p>Meilleur has outlived her second husband and eight of her 12 children.</p>
<p>Bossi, when asked the secret of her step-grandmother's longevity, said: &quot;She often says: 'Work and prayer.' But I know that she doesn't like meat. She has disdain for that.&quot;</p>
<p>She added that there may also be &quot;something about the air in Kamouraska,&quot; a village about 93 miles (150 km) east of Quebec City, the capital of Canada's French-speaking province of Quebec.</p>
<p>After Calment's death on Aug. 4, Bossi sent Guinness's office in London many of Meilleur's documents, including her birth certificate and her entry in the 1881 Canadian census.</p>
