<p>Australian 10-year bond futures ended after hours trading back near the top of this month's 92.010/92.300 range, continuing Thursday's bounce from 92.110.</p>
<p>The June 10-year contract ended SYCOM at 92.230 after brushing 92.250 and up from Thursday's 92.180 close.</p>
<p>The contract's downside potential appears to be protected for now after its ability to recovery in the face of a sharply weakened short-end on Thursday, although analysts doubt that it has the momentum to make an impression on key resistance at 92.310 at the stage.</p>
<p>Initial resistance is seen at 92.280.  </p>
<p>The local market was also underpinned by a rally in U.S. Treasuries where bargain-hunting helped to absorb the 10-year supply from Wednesday's poorly received auction.</p>
<p>Local bill futures contracts showed modest gains in SYCOM, but remained well down on their recent highs after Reserve Bank governor Ian Macfarlane ruled out a further easing in monetary policy on Thursday.</p>
<p>There is no domestic data on Friday leaving the focus on next Tuesday's 1997/98 budget, which is expected to see a favourable outcome from the market with little or no net fixed-interest supply likely to be projected for the year.  </p>
<p>However, the market will be taking note of a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in New York at 10.30 a.m. local time (0030 GMT) for any clues on U.S. policy prior to the Federal Open Market Committee on May 20.</p>
