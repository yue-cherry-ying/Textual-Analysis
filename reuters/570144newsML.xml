<p>CSCE world sugar was called to open mostly unchanged on Thursday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Firm support remained at 10.65 cents, the recent low reached on May 2. Resistance stood at 10.92 cents, where the July contract stalled on Wednesday.</p>
<p>July ended down 0.12 to 10.76 cents per lb, having ranged from 10.92 to 10.75 cents on Wednesday. The rest of the board settled 0.08 lower to 0.01 firmer.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 12,504 lots.</p>
<p>The State-run Trading Corp of Pakistan said it had scrapped tenders invited last month from international suppliers, for the import of 50,000 tonnes of crystal white refined sugar, with shipments to reach Karachi in June and July.</p>
<p>An official said fresh tenders would be invited within the next few days, and suppliers would be asked to ship 25,000 tonnes of sugar to Karachi by June 20 and the rest by July 10.</p>
<p>India released an additional 50,000 tonnes of sugar for free sale in May in order to check rising prices. The government had earlier released a free sale quota of 750,000 tonnes of sugar for the month.</p>
<p>LIFFE white sugar futures were mixed in light trade Thursday. At 0850 EDT/1350 GMT, August stood $0.20 higher to $311.90, while the back months were unchanged to down $0.60.</p>
