<p>Two members of Britain's new Labour government have admitted they failed to declare an all-expenses paid trip to a Geneva hotel in 1993 to see key players in the protracted Bosnian war, the Sunday Times reported.</p>
<p>It said the revelation involving David Clark, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (minister responsible for open government), and Armed Forces Minister John Reid would be an embarrassment for Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has vowed to crack down on sleaze in government.</p>
<p>Clark and Reid later released a joint statement saying they believed the United Nations had picked up the bill and that they therefore did not need to declare the trip.</p>
<p>&quot;If the facts as we now know suggest that we should have done so, we very much regret it,&quot; they said. Labour Party officials said they regarded the matter as closed.</p>
<p>The party was in opposition at the time of the trip. The two members of parliament were appointed to Blair's government when Labour won the May 1 general election. Clark and Reid had earlier told the Sunday Times they had erred by not revealing the three-day trip, during which they met former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and then leading international mediator David Owen.</p>
<p>Clark told the British Press Association news agency that the Geneva meeting had helped save lives by persuading Karadzic -- now wanted on war crimes charges -- to withdraw Bosnian Serb troops who had been shelling Sarajevo from a mountain position above the city.</p>
<p>Last week, veteran Labour member of parliament Robert Wareing was suspended from the party after he allegedly failed to declare a link with a firm reported to be in Serbia. He denied the charge.</p>
