<p>IPE natural gas futures ended the afternoon session mostly weaker on Tuesday, with a glut of summer gas preying on the physical market, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's plenty of summer gas around, that's why we didn't understand the gains last week,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>Afternoon trade was thin, adding just 25 lots, or five deals, to the morning total of 80 lots traded.</p>
<p>Dealers said that pressure on the front end of the forward curve caused by unseasonally warm temperatures was having a knock-on effect, particularly after TransCo sold gas on the flexibility mechanism over the weekend.</p>
<p>May and June both slipped 0.05 p/th to 10.15 p/th, while July shed 0.125 to trade at $10.10 p/th. August traded unchanged at 10.20 p/th.</p>
<p>March and April 1998 also slipped lower, but December this year climbed a modest 0.035 to trade at 14.285.</p>
<p>Warm temperatures in the UK were expected to ease, buoying gas demand later in the week, forecasters said.</p>
<p>The UK Met Office said on Tuesday in its three-day forecast that it foresaw &quot;rain in the north spreading southwards followed by much colder weather with wintry showers over Scotland.&quot;</p>
