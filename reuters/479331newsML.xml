<p>Connecticut's unemployment rate fell three-tenths of a precentage point in February to 4.9 percent, signaling that the economy still is improving, the state Department of Labor said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The rate stands nearly one percentage point below the year-ago level of 5.8 percent. January's level was revised.</p>
<p>&quot;Connecticut's continued nonfarm job growth, and other positive indicators, give us evidence of a continuing recovery,&quot; said Salvatore DiPilo, labor statistics supervisor, in prepared remarks.</p>
<p>The manufacturing production workweek averaged 42.3 hours, off four-tenths of an hour, while average hourly earnings, at $14.22, rose one cent from January, and 37 cents over the year. But the average weekly wage of $601.51 was off $5.26 from January, though it rose a slim $11.50 over the year. These data were not seasonally adjusted.</p>
<p>The sectors that added gobs included government, up 2,200, services, 2,100, construction and mining, 700, manufacturing, 400, and transportation, communication, and utilities, 200.</p>
<p>However, there were declines in the wholesale and retail trade, which shed 900, and finance, insurance and real estate, down 400.</p>
