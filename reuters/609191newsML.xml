<p>Japanese traders, relieved by the June resumption of long-delayed platinum group metal (PGM) talks with Russia, said on Friday they expect the talks to go smoothly and for lofty palladium prices to ease.</p>
<p>Despite Russian export delays since the beginning of this year, Japan's total PGM imports from Russia under contracts are likely to be slightly lower or flat in 1997, compared with the previous year, they said.</p>
<p>Japanese traders said they expect palladium prices to head lower gradually, although it may take time for the market to return to normal after five months of delivery delays.</p>
<p>&quot;The overheated palladium market will be finally coming to an end,&quot; another trader said. &quot;Palladium prices are heading to $140 per ounce in the next few months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In addition to widening concerns that high palladium prices and Russian supply woes are denting demand from the electronics industry, Japanese users are trying to find ways to depend less on Russian metal supplies after the Russian suspension.</p>
<p>&quot;Previous fears that Russia (state exporter Almazjuvelireexport) would tighten PGM exports to Japan now seem to have lessened as Almaz informed us it would supply the amount of PGM as the Japanese side wants,&quot; a trading house trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there will be few hurdles in the negotiations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, a Russian trade representative in Tokyo said formal contract talks were set for early June.</p>
<p>Almaz officials have also said PGM shipments for this year will be in line with the volume in 1996 despite the late start, and shipments will start in late May or June.</p>
<p>Some traders are concerned about falling palladium demand from Japan's electronics industry due to the surprisingly long Russian supply disruption.</p>
<p>Japan is the world's largest consumer of platinum group metals. Russia supplies more than 60 percent of the world's palladium. Demand from the electronics sector accounts for about 60 percent of Japan's total palladium demand.</p>
<p>&quot;It's inevitable that the electronics industry would accelerate efforts to shift to cheaper metals, spurred by the high palladium prices amid a lack of faith in Russian supplies,&quot; the trading house trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although everybody wants metals now, they are considering ways to depend less on Russian supplies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Almaz has long-term export supply contracts with 13 companies, including leading trade houses and bullion houses.</p>
<p>Other sources echoed the view that alternative sources were necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a feeling that most companies (which have long term contracts with Almaz) hope to reduce PGM imports slightly with Russia this year,&quot; an official of a bullion house said.</p>
<p>&quot;During the delivery delays this year, we managed to survive. We want to avoid the risk of having unsold stocks like last year,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>After heavy imports in 1995, Japan struggled with palladium oversupply last year.</p>
<p>During the period of shipment delays this year, Japan managed to survive by boosting spot imports and using more recycled palladium.</p>
