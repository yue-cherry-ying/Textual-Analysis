<p>A wave of pre-holiday buying sent U.S. stocks leaping into record ground on Friday.</p>
<p>The rally marked the 20th record closing high on the year for the Dow industrials, and was most noteworthy for bringing the Nasdaq composite back into record ground for the first time since late January.</p>
<p>The Dow rose 88 points, or 1.2 percent, to 7346, topping its May 15 record of 7333.55. U.S. financial markets are closed Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.  </p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 11 points, or 1.4 percent, to 847, beating its May 15 record of 841.88.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite jumped 17 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1390, beating its January 22 record of 1388.06.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq's previous inability to match the Dow's return to record territory had been seen by market analysts as a potential Achilles' heel for Wall Street.</p>
<p>But high technology and smaller stocks began closing the gap on blue chips over the past three weeks. And with many market players exiting early on Friday ahead of the holiday, the bulls easily carried the day.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's been a real change in sentiment in the smaller cap stocks and in high technology stocks towards a more positive view,&quot; said James Volk, director of equity trading at Jensen Securities.</p>
<p>Some market players, however, noted that U.S. stocks have historically rallied into three-day weekends, often only to unwind the gains the following session.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think this rally means much,&quot; said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray &amp; Co.</p>
<p>An early close to the Treasury market on a positive note also added to the upbeat tone in stocks, traders said.  </p>
<p>The 30-year Treasury bond finshed up 1/32, its yield holding at 6.99 percent.</p>
<p>Next week could lead to choppy trading as investors fret over the long-bond yield cracking the key seven-percent level, said Gregory Nie, technical analyst at EVEREN Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Bonds north of seven percent can become a bit of a headache again for equities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The stock market got relief this week from a Federal Reserve decision not to raise interest rates. But data next week, including Wednesday's report on April durable goods orders, could put the focus on the Fed again, analysts said.  </p>
<p>The Dow rose 151 points on the week.</p>
<p>After this week's sharp gains, any renewed worries that the Fed will raise interest rates at its next meeting in early July will put fresh selling pressure on stocks, said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer of Value Line's Asset Management division.</p>
<p>&quot;Any risk to the market at this point forward is to the downside rather than to the upside,&quot; Orlando said.  </p>
<p>Westinghouse Electric Corp's CBS unit said Peter Lund, president of its CBS television and cable group, had resigned. Analysts said the executive-suite shake-up would boost to the slumping television network. Westinghouse's shares ended up 1-3/4 to 18-3/4.</p>
<p>Medtronic Inc rose five to 71-7/8 after the medical device company late Thursday reported fiscal fourth-quarter results. J.P. Morgan Securities raised its fiscal 1998 and 1999 earnings estimates on Medtronic, citing the strong earnings.  </p>
<p>Shares of computer disk drive companies extended their decline after two brokerages cut their earnings estimates on Seagate Technology Inc. There was also growing concern that disk drive prices would decline further, traders said.</p>
<p>Seagate fell 2-1/8 to 40-1/4, Read-Rite Corp dropped 2-1/8 to 19-7/8, Western Digital Corp lost 4-1/4 to 52-7/8 and Quantum Corp gave back 3/8 to 38.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq officially closed up 17.12 to 1389.72, a record.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 rose 11.37 to 847.03, a record.</p>
