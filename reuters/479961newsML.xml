<title>USA: Cronkite admitted for heart bypass surgery.</title>
<headline>Cronkite admitted for heart bypass surgery.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Walter Cronkite, the CBS anchorman who set the tone for the dominance of network television news, was admitted to a hospital on Tuesday for heart surgery, his assistant said.</p>
<p>&quot;He is in the hospital for quadruple bypass surgery,&quot; Julie Sukman, Cronkite's assistant at CBS, said. &quot;He did not have a heart attack, the surgery was recommended after a check up last week.&quot;</p>
<p>The New York Hospital Cornell Medical Centre confirmed that Cronkite, 80, had been admitted to the Manhattan hospital but declined to give further details.</p>
<p>Cronkite started the first national half-hour nightly news for CBS in September 1963 and presided over it until he retired at age 65 in 1981, developing a reputation as the &quot;most trusted man in America.&quot;</p>
<p>In his memoir, &quot;A Reporter's Life&quot;, published at the end of last year, Cronkite wrote that the medium he helped create -- it weaned many Americans off newspapers and led them to depend first on TV for news -- was seriously flawed and that his greatest disappointment was not going to the moon.</p>
