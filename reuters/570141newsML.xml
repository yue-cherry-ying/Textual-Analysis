<p>CSCE coffee futures were called to open 4.00 to 5.00 cents per lb higher on Thursday, as traders expected prices to bounce back after the nearbys' two-day decline.</p>
<p>Traders said a drop in stocks certified for delivery against the exchange also buoyed sentiment. After Wednesday's close, the CSCE reported certified coffee stocks fell by 3,000 bags, to 24,699 bags as of May 6.</p>
<p>There were 11,250 bags of coffee pending grading, the exchange said.</p>
<p>Wednesday, New York arabica futures ended mixed, with active July falling 1.45 cents per lb on the day, to 211.40 cents, after ranging between 218.00 and 209.00.</p>
<p>Spot May, which set a new life-of-contract high of 256.00 early in the day, ended 3.95 cents lower, at 245.65. The back months closed 1.20 to 2.00 higher.</p>
<p>May/July spread narrowed to 34.25 cents today from 36.75 at the close on Tuesday, while July/September shrunk to 20.05 cents from 22.70 cents.</p>
<p>Technically, traders pegged July resistance at 214.50, followed by 219.00. On the downside, yesterday's low of 209.00 was seen as near-term support, with a break below that level could lead to a test of 200.00.</p>
<p>On the fundamental side, the Brazilian government sold 128,005 60-kg bags -- or about 64 percent -- of the 200,090 bags of coffee stocks offered at auction on Wednesday, an official fron Banco do Brasil said.</p>
<p>In other news, Brazilian traders said January-June coffee exports are likely to exceed the six million 60-kg bags agreed by members of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC).</p>
<p>Brazil has already shipped 3.89 million bags in the first quarter of this year and export registrations for the second three months reached 3.20 million bags by April 25.</p>
<p>The London coffee futures were broadly higher early Thursday, but activity was sluggish due to the Ascension Day holiday across Europe and in the Ivory Coast. LIFFE July was up $25 at the midday break, to $1,778, while the rest rose $25 to $30.</p>
