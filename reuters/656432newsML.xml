<p>Enlisted Navy men assigned to aircraft carriers had an increased risk of developing a mysterious illness that often attacks the lungs, federal health officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it found a &quot;small, but statistically significant,&quot; increase in cases of sarcoidosis among Navy men who had served on aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>&quot;On average, there was about a 50 percent increased risk of having a diagnosis of sarcoid for those who worked on an aircraft carrier compared to all enlisted men,&quot; Dr. Linda Rosenstock, director of the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), said.</p>
<p>Sarcoidosis, mostly seen in young adults, occurs 10 to 17 times as often in blacks than in whites. Some physicians believe it occurs because of the inhalation of infectious or allergenic substances from the environment.</p>
<p>The CDC cited one case in which mineral dust deposits were found in the lungs of an enlisted man diagnosed with sarcoidosis. He said he had ground anti-skid materials from aircraft carrier decks for two years.</p>
<p>Rosenstock said an environmental cause was possible, but she also said the increase could be due to more frequent X-ray screening on aircraft carriers, which generally have large, well-equipped medical facilities.</p>
<p>&quot;We really don't have the explanation,&quot; she said. &quot;It raises more questions than answers.&quot;</p>
<p>Researchers at NIOSH reviewed 1,121 cases of enlisted men diagnosed with sarcoidosis between 1965 and 1993. They found that both black and white men were more likely to have developed the illness if they had served on a Navy aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>Sarcoidosis can attack any organ of the body in any location, causing granulomas, or small areas of inflamed cells. It is most frequently found in the lungs, where it can cause lung stiffness and loss of lung volume.</p>
<p>The American Lung Association said one in 20 people with sarcoidosis dies, though many patients have no symptoms and never know that they have the disease.</p>
<p>The lung association said past claims that pine pollen, spray deodorants and broken fluorescent light tubes can cause the ailment had proved false. It said a genetic factor might cause some groups to be more susceptible.</p>
