<p>Benchmark Dated Brent crude leapt on Friday as a trader sought to cover commitments outside the region but other North Sea grades looked to have peaked, traders said.</p>
<p>A Brent cargo due to load June 9-11 was kept from the paper chains by BP who sold it to Swiss-based trading house Glencore for July Brent +17 cents, 19 cents firmer than a Dated Brent deal on Thursday.</p>
<p>Glencore also kept two more of the cargoes turning wet and was heard putting together a VLCC after locking in a healthy arbitrage last week.</p>
<p>&quot;What you have is just one aggressive buyer covering shorts made when the economics were much better,&quot; said a senior trader for a major oil company.</p>
<p>Prompt Brent CFDs surged in response to news of the firmer Dated deal, next week's dates (May 27-30) talking at July Brent +10/+14 cents a barrel from trade at July evens on Thursday.</p>
<p>Brent intermonth spreads were also a cent or two firmer, June/July trading at +8 and +9 cents despite weaker July Brent which slipped 10 cents to $20.08 a barrel on the IPE.</p>
<p>The early keeping of all five cargoes turning wet on Friday also helped Brent market sentiment, dealers said.  </p>
<p>But other North Sea grades looked to have peaked, with thin early June supply balanced by slack refinery demand in Europe where margins took another turn for the worse on Thursday and were expected to come under further pressure from Brent's rally.</p>
<p>&quot;Fundamentally it looks pretty weak now. There's little demand in northwest Europe, the Med is no good and the arbitrage looks shut,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>&quot;If anything the grades have been trading at slightly lower numbers in the last couple of days. The market's pretty balanced at the moment, we don't expect the differentials to weaken dramatically,&quot; said another.  </p>
<p>An Oseberg cargo due to load June 5-7 traded on Thursday at Dated Brent +12 cents, five cents cheaper than a June 18-20 deal Wednesday at +17 cents.</p>
