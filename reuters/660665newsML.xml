<title>FRANCE: French mail order mogul found guilty of fraud.</title>

<text>
<p>A French court on Friday found a mail order sales mogul guilty of fraud for selling useless &quot;miracle&quot; gadgets and failing to deliver on promises of enticing prizes.</p>
<p>The court in the southeastern city of Grasse handed Bernard Graeff, 48, a two-year suspended jail term, fined him 200,000 francs ($34,500) and barred him from the mail order business for five years.</p>
<p>It also ordered him to pay 2,500 francs ($430) to each of 1,382 disappointed clients, for a total of more than 3.4 million francs ($590,000).</p>
<p>In all, some 15,000 customers filed complaints against Graeff's firm, France Direct Service, which has since gone bankrupt and is operating under judicial supervision.</p>
<p>During Graeff's trial in November, Prosecutor Guy Robert contended the firm had &quot;promised fabulous gains through various games in order to sell goods which were mostly poor-quality imported gadgets&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;You became rich on the backs of people with little means and you stole their dreams as well,&quot; Robert said.</p>
<p>Graeff was accused of leading customers to believe they would automatically win cars or exotic holidays if they ordered his goods.</p>
<p>His offerings, including rotating television antennas, singing birds and sauna-effect pyjamas for slimmers, were often simply never delivered. In other cases, customers received a pocket gadget closer to a stapler than to the sewing machine they had expected.</p>
