<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shenzhen Development Bank Ltd declined to comment on Friday on a sharp rise in its domestic currency A share price.</p>
<p>The bank's A shares closed at 39.05 yuan, up 2.41 yuan from Thursday, despite rumours the bank was being investigated for share trading irregularities.</p>
<p>Traders said investors shrugged off the rumours after hearing of the bank's dividend plans, which will be confirmed at a shareholders' meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>The bank said on Monday it had found irregularities in its own stock trading in 1996, and its shares were suspended from trading that morning for the announcement.</p>
<p>A statement published in major financial newspapers said the bank was conducting investigations and would make further announcements as details became available.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen stock market was rife with rumours on Friday that authorities were investigating the bank for alleged insider trading conducted in 1996, brokers said.</p>
<p>There was also widespread talk that the bank could be fined and funds earned through improper trades seized, brokers said.</p>
<p>Officials at both the bank and the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country's top securities watchdog, declined to comment on the speculation.</p>
<p>The bank spearheaded the bull-run in Shenzhen's A share market throughout 1996. Its stock price began 1996 at 3.16 yuan and ended the year at 16.52.</p>
