<p>Former &quot;Baywatch&quot; TV star Pamela Anderson Lee on Wednesday hailed her victory in a breach-of-contract lawsuit as showing the movie industry she was no &quot;pushover.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it sends a strong message to other actors,&quot; she told reporters. &quot;I've got a lot of really good feedback from other actors who are really happy with the verdict and feel a lot more protected.&quot;</p>
<p>Lee's news conference came one day after a judge ruled in her favour in a lawsuit brought by a movie company alleging she broke a contract and backed out of a film project. The company sought $5 million.</p>
<p>&quot;I think people now realise I'm not a pushover,&quot; said the actress who appeared to be basking in victory. Her laywers too, seemed elated with Tuesday's ruling.</p>
<p>&quot;She made a decision to fight for the truth,&quot; said attorney Henry Holmes. &quot;The case has changed the movie industry -- I hope for the good.&quot;</p>
<p>His reference was to the common Hollywood practice of making multi-million-dollar movie deals on a verbal agreement or a handshake.</p>
<p>Judge David Horowitz ruled The Private Movie Co. failed to prove &quot;by a preponderance of evidence&quot; that Lee entered into a contract to make the cable TV movie &quot;Hello, She Lied.&quot;</p>
<p>In his written ruling, Horowitz said there was no binding agreement, despite the producer's claim that she had made an oral agreement to make the film.</p>
<p>During the non-jury trial, lawyers for the plaintiffs also acknowledged a written agreement with Lee was never executed.</p>
<p>The company claimed she broke a contract because she was offered a better deal to make a feature film, &quot;Barb Wire.&quot;</p>
<p>Lee, married to rock drummer Tommy Lee of Motley Crue, said during testimony that she pulled out of the project because she objected to sex scenes in the proposed film.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't feel comfortable with love-making scenes -- but nudity was never an issue,&quot; she said at the news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt I was being manipulated, I felt I was being taken advantage of and I did not want to settle this case (out of court).&quot;</p>
<p>Lee's lawyer dismissed the film-makers' pledge to appeal the ruling, but plaintiffs' attorney Adam Miller told Reuters to &quot;tell him to get his pen ready. We're appealing.&quot;</p>
