<p>Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said on Friday revised estimates showed Pakistan's budget deficit for fiscal 1996/97 (July/June) would be 6.3 percent of gross domestic product, the same as the previous year.</p>
<p>But he added that the deficit in the next fiscal year would be close to five percent.</p>
<p>The deficit estimate for the financial year, which Aziz was also quoted on Friday as calling worst in Pakistan's history, is far higher than the four percent committed by the previous government of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.</p>
<p>The commitment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to bring down the deficit as one of the conditions for a suspended standby loan was also reaffirmed by a caretaker government set up for three months after Bhutto's sacking last November on disputed charges of misrule.</p>
<p>&quot;Our revised estimate of the budget deficit is 6.3 percent of the GDP, which is the same as in the preceding year,&quot; Aziz said in a telephone interview with Reuters Financial Television (RFTV) in Tokyo, which was monitored in Islamabad.</p>
<p>He had said earlier this month the four percent target was unlikely to be achieved before the new economic reform agenda of the present government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif made some progress.</p>
<p>&quot;My aim is to bring it down at least by one percent because any more or larger target would not be realistic,&quot; Aziz said in Friday's interview. &quot;So if we bring it down close to five percent we will have done very well.&quot;</p>
<p>He said this would be done despite an increase in debt servicing by 30 to 40 billion rupees, which would be more than one percent of the GDP. &quot;So I think the target of close to five percent is a realistic one and that is our aim next year.&quot;</p>
<p>The official APP news agency quoted Aziz as telling a meeting of the parliamentary group of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League party and its allies on Thursday that the current financial year was the worst in Pakistan's 50-year history because of the Bhutto government's &quot;useless policies&quot;.</p>
<p>The rate of increase in national production has dropped to 2-1/2 percent while it had been around six percent during the last 30 years, he said.</p>
<p>Aziz told RFTV that Pakistan had set a target of increasing its exports by 10 percent in 1997/98. Pakistan total exports in July-March were $6.129 billion against imports of $8.753 billion.</p>
<p>He said repayment of Pakistan's short-term debt would become easier if exports went up by ten percent.</p>
<p>&quot;If we are able to increase our exports by 10 percent next year, which is our target..., which is an extra billion dollars, then the short-term debt servicing will become fine,&quot; he added.</p>
