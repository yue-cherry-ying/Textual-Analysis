<p>A Turkish television advert showing President Saddam Hussein being distracted from war plans by a sweet tooth has angered Iraq.</p>
<p>Baghdad has lodged an official protest about the advert for a Turkish chocolate bar, a foreign ministry official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Iraq complained last week. I think they were a bit too sensitive,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the advert, a Saddam look-alike actor and actors posing as his generals position tanks and rockets on a model of the desert and discuss military tactics.</p>
<p>A young boy appears on the scene distributing bars of chocolate, to the delight of a smiling Saddam who leaves the war games and thanks the lad in Arabic.</p>
<p>The Turkish official said he did not understand why Iraq was upset. &quot;It's a nice advert. I actually thought the Americans would complain for showing Saddam in a good light,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>NATO member Turkey was part of the U.S.-led coalition that defeated neighbour Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait.</p>
