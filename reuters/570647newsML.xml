<p>NATO, increasingly confident it will clinch an historic post-Cold War treaty with Russia next week, is preparing a final package of &quot;sweeteners&quot; to help President Boris Yeltsin drop Moscow's remaining objections.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very close to our bottom line, and we cannot offer significantly more, but there are a few things we can do,&quot; said one senior NATO official. He declined to be drawn on what final inducements NATO might offer.</p>
<p>Alliance Secretary-General Javier Solana is due in Moscow on Tuesday for a sixth round of talks with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, cautiously optimistic he will strike a deal that will allow NATO's planned expansion to proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>NATO's hopes of finally agreeing what will be called a &quot;NATO-Russia Act&quot;, embracing all aspects of relations between the former enemies, were boosted on Thursday when Yeltsin said he might take part in the Moscow talks himself.</p>
<p>Yeltsin told reporters about &quot;98 percent of the document is ready&quot; and said he wanted the remaining problems sorted out next week so the document could be signed by NATO's 16 heads of government and state and himself in Paris, probably on May 27.</p>
<p>&quot;They must discuss the outstanding problems at their meeting on May 13, maybe with my participation, so as to have the document finally ready,&quot; he said after a wreath-laying ceremony at the Kremlin's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, part of ceremonies marking the allied victory over Nazi Germany in 1945.</p>
<p>NATO diplomats have always said the final decisions would have to be taken by the Russian president as they involve an acceptance that Moscow cannot halt the alliance's plan to grant membership to countries such as Poland and Hungary.</p>
<p>&quot;This is good news, we are in the end-game, the Russians now have to make an important political decision,&quot; said one NATO official.</p>
<p>The deal with NATO gives Moscow a permanent consultative mechanism through a NATO-Russia council, to be set up in Brussels at NATO's headquarters with its own secretariat, and foresees an extensive exchange of military liaison officers.</p>
<p>Russia will be able to raise virtually any issue it wants, but the council's deliberations will not be binding on those of an enlarged NATO -- thereby fulfilling a basic condition of the West that new members enjoy the same rights as existing ones.</p>
<p>The Western allies see the deal as forming the centrepiece of a new European security order for the 21st century, but admit Russia failure to stop its former allies from the now-defunct Warsaw Pact from joining NATO is a bitter pill.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had to convince the Russians that the best way to minimise the consequences of enlargement is to conclude the deal with NATO, it gives them an enormous amount unthinkable only a few years ago,&quot; said one diplomat.</p>
<p>NATO's Solana, 54, has painstakingly negotiated the new pact, tactfully making the Russians realise enlargement will go ahead whatever they say.</p>
<p>A summit in Madrid in July will invite at least three countries -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- to join the alliance that won the Cold War without a shot being fired and closer ties with a host of other applicants.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone realises it is tough for them (the Russians), we want to help them as much as possible but they realise now we are at the wire,&quot; added the diplomat.</p>
<p>The alliance has said it will not place nuclear weapons or forces on the territory of the new members, but has refused to give in to Russian demands limiting improvements in military facilties in those countries.</p>
