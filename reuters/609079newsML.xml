<p>Singapore light distillate prices were steady in lacklustre market talk, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>Regional gasoline demand emerged in the form of Indian Oil Corp's (IOC) reappearance in the spot market to buy leaded gasoline for June and to buy test cargoes of unleaded gasoline for July to October through two tenders, industry sources said.</p>
<p>IOC, absent from the spot gasoline market since March, has issued the first tender to buy 25,000 tonnes of 87-octane with a lead content of 0.15 grammes per litre for delivery to Bombay between June 10-14.</p>
<p>The tender closes May 28 at 0800 GMT and is valid May 29 2200 GMT.</p>
<p>Traders said the requirement was due to normal shortfalls in IOC's system while the second tender which sought unleaded 87-octane gasoline, was for testing the environmental-friendly new grade.</p>
<p>The second which requires delivery in drums, is asking for 16 kilolitres (100 barrels) on unleaded gasoline for delivery in July, and 32 kilolitres for delivery each in August, September and October.</p>
<p>The four-month term tender closes June 3 at 2000 GMT and is valid until June 6 at 2200 GMT.</p>
<p>Gasoline, currently assessed long to balanced, is expected to firm amid the cut in exports from South Korea and China during the summer months and in reforming operations, traders said.</p>
<p>Feedstock naphtha for the reformers were around $2.00 per barrel higher than gasoline, forcing refiners in Singapore to cut their reformate production to 75-80-percent, one refiner said.</p>
<p>Naphtha June swaps were quoted at $22.20/$22.50 per barrel, compared to $22.30/$22.60 on Thursday while the contango to July widened to 20 cents from 10 cents.</p>
