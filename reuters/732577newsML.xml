<p>Combination treatment with aspirin and the hormone prednisone is not effective in helping women reduce the chance of miscarriages and may increase the risk of premature births, a study showed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The study, which will be published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, found the combination treatment did not increase the likelihood that women who have had repeated miscarriages will be able to carry an infant to term.</p>
<p>The treatment, instead, may dramatically increase the risk of premature births, the study found.</p>
<p>A team led by Dr. Carl A. Laskin of the University of Toronto based its results on 385 women who had at least two miscarriages and tested positive for a very sensitive immune system that may have been responsible for their spontaneous abortions.</p>
<p>Of the 202 volunteers who became pregnant, half took the prednisone/aspirin combination and 66 had babies. The remainder, who were given a placebo, produced 57 babies, which was not a significant statistical difference.</p>
<p>Yet when the researchers looked at the number of babies that were premature, they found a sharp difference between the two groups. More infants were born prematurely in the treatment group, 62 percent, than in the placebo group, 12 percent, researchers said.</p>
<p>In addition, the likelihood that the mother would develop high blood pressure and diabetes was about three times higher among those taking the prednisone/aspirin combination.</p>
<p>&quot;Prednisone and aspirin are not effective in preventing foetal loss&quot; in women whose immune systems carry self-destructive antibodies, the group concluded.</p>
