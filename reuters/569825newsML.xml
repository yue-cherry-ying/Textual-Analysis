<p>Niagara Mohawk Power Corp said increased first quarter earnings were primarily the result of a change in accounting for natural gas pipeline costs which increased first quarter margins.</p>
<p>The utility Wednesday reported first-quarter earnings of $93.6 million, or $0.65 per share, compared with $86.5 million, or $0.60 per share, for the first-quarter 1996.</p>
<p>The company also said directors declared dividends at prescribed rates for all series of preferred stock.  </p>
<p>Despite lower sales of electricity and natural gas in the first quarter of 1997, earnings were higher primarily as a result of the company's new multi-year gas rate agreement, Niagara Mohawk said.</p>
<p>That agreement changes the way the company accounts for gas pipeline costs, resulting in higher gas margins in the first quarter, it explained.  The impact of these higher margin, about $0.08 per share, is due to timing and will reverse over the remainder of 1997, it said.</p>
<p>the company said retail sales of electricity were down 1.8 percent in the first quarter.  </p>
<p>This was primarily due to the effects of warmer weather during the quarter. Total electricity sales decreased 2.9 percent, as wholesale sales were down 0.8 percent during the quarter.</p>
<p>Electric revenues for the first quarter of 1997 were $877.4 million, an increase of 3.1 percent from a year earlier, primarily as a result of increased payments to independent power producers recovered through the fuel adjustment clause, Niagara Mohawk said.</p>
<p>Retail sales of natural gas decreased 13.5 percent in the first quarter, reflecting decreased sales in all customer classes, again, primarily due to the warmer weather during the first quarter. Total natural gas deliveries, which include the transportation of customer-owned gas, were down 1.2 percent.</p>
<p>Natural gas revenues for the first quarter of 1997 were $286.5 million, down 8.2 percent from a year earlier, as the restructuring of natural gas rates in the recent natural gas rate agreement helped mitigate the effect of decreased sales in the first quarter, the utility said.</p>
