<p>LIFFE robusta coffee futures charged higher on continued fund and industry buying with benchmark July finishing at the highest level since mid-March.</p>
<p>Traders said further gains were on the cards as roasters still have much price-fixing to do.</p>
<p>July ended Thursday $27 up at $1,780 a tonne, the previous resistance, after a ceiling at $1,785. Traders said the contract now looked set to challenge the next hurdle at $1,800, followed by the double top at $1,815 and $1,820 -- the two recent highs.</p>
<p>The robusta market rose for the fourth day in a row as hedge funds and roasters made an aggressive comeback after a lull. During that period, July alone gained some 13 percent.</p>
<p>Traders said London's advance came without much support from New York.</p>
<p>&quot;For the first time, London didn't take too much notice of New York,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>New York jumped on Thursday on news port workers in Santos, Brazil, stopped work due to a salary delay. But traders in London said the stoppage was likely to be short-lived.</p>
<p>&quot;Furthermore, there's not much coffee to be shipped,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Arbitrage trading against New York regained lustre after a long spell as robusta prices began to stir. July/July arbitrage stood at 135 cents a lb by the close.</p>
<p>The upward momentum in London was also speeded by lack of aggressive origin offers. Indonesian sellers are sidelined either because of a local holiday in the country or are expecting much higher levels.</p>
<p>Volume reached just 6,774 lots by the close. --Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985</p>
