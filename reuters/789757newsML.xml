<p>An Italian tourist kidnapped by Yemeni tribesmen is in good health and negotiations for his release are proceeding well, an official at the Italian embassy in Sanaa said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Giorgio Bonanomi, 49, was abducted on Wednesday. A Yemeni security official said he was taken to Radaa in al-Baidha province, 150 km (93 miles) southeast of the capital Sanaa.</p>
<p>&quot;We talked to the Vice Minister of Interior and he said that the negotiations are positive. But we are still waiting for news,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We received a letter through the government from Mr Bonanomi and he said 'I am in good condition and the treatment is very good. Don't worry about me. I hope the story will be over soon,'&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bonanomi, from Lecco in northern Italy, was kidnapped less than two weeks after the abduction of two other Italians by Yemeni tribesmen.</p>
<p>Luigi Archetti and Maria Paola Mariconi were held as part of a property dispute with authorities but were released after one day.</p>
<p>Kidnapping is a common tactic by Yemeni tribes holding grievances against the government or foreign oil firms operating in Yemen, one of the Arab world's poorest countries.</p>
<p>Tribesmen have tried to use hostages -- who have included French and U.S. diplomats and a Saudi ambassador -- as bargaining chips in mostly land and water disputes.</p>
<p>In March, four German tourists were kidnapped. Earlier that month a group of seven German motorcycle tourists were also seized.</p>
<p>In February, a U.S. oil engineer was taken hostage by a Yemeni mountain tribe.</p>
<p>All hostages have been released unharmed so far.</p>
