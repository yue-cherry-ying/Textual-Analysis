<p>A New Zealand spear fisherman survived a wild, 90-minute ride behind a 134 kg (295 pound) striped marlin at the weekend -- and landed his catch.</p>
<p>Chris Browne, 54, told Monday's daily Dominion newspaper he was towed behind the 2.85 metre (9.4 foot) fish after spearing it during a free-dive competition, without sub-aqua gear.</p>
<p>While the mighty game fish have been speared before, Browne is thought to be the first New Zealand diver to succesfully land one. He eventually hauled it out of the Pacific Ocean near the Hen and Chickens Islands, off the northern New Zealand coast.</p>
<p>Browne said it was a &quot;snap decision&quot; to stay with the fish.</p>
<p>&quot;No time to muck around, this fish was moving...it came back at me when I first speared it but I gave it quite an aggressive kick with one of my fins and it veered away.&quot;</p>
<p>He aquaplaned behind the marlin as it towed him four kilometres out to sea and then around the islands, using its speed of up to 10-knots (18.5 km/h) to keep his head above water. At times the fish dived to a depth of 18 metres, he said.</p>
<p>Browne, one of New Zealand's top free divers with 25 years' experience, said his endurance training meant he outlasted the marlin which eventually died.</p>
<p>Browne did not do well in the competition, however, as the divers were competing for the best range of catches across nine types of fish. He managed only one.</p>
