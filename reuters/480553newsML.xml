<title>SOUTH KOREA: South Korean retail petrol price falls - refiners.</title>
<headline>South Korean retail petrol price falls - refiners.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>Petrol prices at South Korean pumps dropped to a range of 831-843 won a litre on Tuesday, down from an average of 845-846 won last month, oil refiners said.</p>
<p>They said the cut in petrol prices reflected a fall in international crude oil prices.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Korean won hadn't depreciated so much against the dollar, the prices could have fallen even further,&quot; said an official at Yukong Ltd.</p>
<p>The won slipped to 897.10 won per dollar at the end of March from 864.20 at the beginning of March.</p>
<p>Yukong and LG-Caltex Oil Corp lowered their retail petrol price to 843 won a litre, Hyundai Oil Refinery Co to 842 won, Ssangyong Oil Refining Co to 832 won and Hanwha Energy Co Ltd to 831 won.</p>
<p>Prices of kerosene and diesel have also dropped this month, refiners said.</p>
<p>From January 1, South Korea allowed domestic refiners to set their own sales prices of gasoline, kerosene, diesel and C-type fuel oil. The government had previously set a monthly price ceiling.  </p>
<p>The new rule is part of South Korea's wider deregulation of oil product imports and exports.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said it would intervene if prices became too volatile and endangered the stability of the economy. Oil refiners are required to give prior notice to the government over the price changes.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Fair Trade Act, the government will punish refiners which set prices artificially low to grab market share.</p>
