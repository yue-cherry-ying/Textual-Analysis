<p>Lithuania may be without the service of its Chernobyl-style nuclear power plant, Ignalina, temporarily if a set of extra safety measures is not implemented in time, the economy ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;It might be that unit one and unit two could be out of operation,&quot; economy ministry adviser Jonas Kazlauskas told reporters.</p>
<p>Ignalina is trying to improve safety at the plant during routine maintenance periods following a safety analysis report this year that said extra safety measures needed to be taken.</p>
<p>&quot;These measures exceed 100, but we need to urgently implement six of the safety analysis report measures to start operation of unit one after routine maintenance,&quot; Kazlauskas said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's possible that both reactors will not be working for some time if these measures are not implemented,&quot; Kazlauskas told Reuters. &quot;But we think this will not be the case.&quot;</p>
<p>Kazlauskas did not say when or how long Ignalina might be out of service.</p>
<p>Reactor number one is currently undergoing routine maintenance.</p>
<p>&quot;According to the former schedule, it should start back up on July 1, but we need to implement all six measures,&quot; Kazlauskas said. &quot;We think this maintenance could be prolonged for one or two months after July 1.&quot;</p>
<p>Reactor number two is expected to undergo routine maintenance after the first reactor is up and running, Kazlauskas said.</p>
