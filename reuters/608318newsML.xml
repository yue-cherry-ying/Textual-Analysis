<p>Metal Management Inc said Friday it earned $589,000, or $0.06 a share, including discontinued operations, for the fourth quarter ended March 31.</p>

<p>Revenues from continuing operations were $24.9 million during the quarter, the company said. Earnings before taxes, interest and other financing costs, depreciation, and amortization were $910,000 during the period.</p>
