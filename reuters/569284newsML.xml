<title>COLOMBIA: Top Colombian lawman resigns to run for president.</title>
<headline>Top Colombian lawman resigns to run for president.</headline>
<dateline>BOGOTA 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Colombia's chief prosecutor, Alfonso Valdivieso, has tendered his resignation and is preparing to announce his candidacy for the presidency, sources close to Valdivieso said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The sources, who spoke on condition they would not be identified by name, said Valdivieso's &quot;irrevocable&quot; letter of resignation had been presented to the Supreme Court late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Public opinion surveys have consistently shown Valdivieso, an anti-drug crusader and sworn enemy of corrupt politicians, to be the most popular public figure in Colombia.</p>
<p>Presidential elections will be held in May of next year and Colombian law requires that anyone in public office intending to bid for the country's top job step down a year ahead of the polls.</p>
<p>Valdivieso was appointed in 1994, less than two weeks after President Ernesto Samper took office amid a mushrooming scandal over charges that he received millions of dollars in drug money to finance his campaign.</p>
<p>He made his mark, and earned himself many enemies in Samper's government, by heading the so-called 8,000 Process -- a probe into the campaign finance scandal that nearly led to Samper's impeachment last year.</p>
<p>Although he is a member of Samper's ruling Liberal Party, Valdivieso, 46, is widely expected to run as an independent candidate for the presidency.</p>
<p>Valdivieso is a cousin of Luis Carlos Galan, a charismatic and highly popular political leader who was assassinated while campaigning for the presidency in 1989. In addition to his current post as prosecutor general, a job from which he has seen all of Colombia's cocaine kings either jailed or killed, he has served as ambassador to Israel, Education minister and senator.</p>
<p>Valdivieso's leading opponent for the presidency, according to a flurry of recent polls, is Interior Minister Horacio Serpa, an outspoken supporter of Samper and frequent critic of the United States.</p>
<p>Serpa, a firebrand populist, is expected to step down to launch his own bid to succeed Samper within a matter of days.</p>
