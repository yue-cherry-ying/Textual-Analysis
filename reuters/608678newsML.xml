<p>Zaire's ousted president Mobutu Sese Seko is expected to leave the West African state of Togo on Friday, probably for Morocco, Togolese official sources said.</p>
<p>The veteran leader, who is fighting cancer, arrived in Lome from his jungle palace at Gbadolite in northern Zaire on Sunday night, a day after Laurent Kabila's rebels marched into the capital Kinshasa.  </p>
<p>The sources said Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema, another veteran strongman, had spent about 40 minutes with Mobutu on Thursday. They said Mobutu remained very weak.</p>
<p>He initially landed in Togo for a technical stop but Togolese sources said the government had reluctantly agreed to let him stay longer because of his state of health.</p>
<p>French Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain hinted on Wednesday that France might be prepared to admit Mobutu for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Mobutu has received regular treatment for prostate cancer at a hospital in Monaco in recent months while recuperating from surgery at his palatial villa near the Riviera resort of Nice.</p>
