<title>NIGERIA: Nigerian banks depress stock market trading.</title>

<p>Nigerian share prices fell on Friday on the back of tumbling bank stocks, dealers said.</p>
<p>The all-share index dropped to 8666.03 from Thursday's 8670.10 as large-scale dumping of shares of the leading banks wiped away much of their earlier gains this year.</p>
<p>Dealers said illiquidity was fast creeping into the market, curbing irrational pricing.</p>
<p>&quot;Most stocks are now on offer and people are now putting their money where their mouth is,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Afribank and Union Bank lost 20 kobo each to close, respectively, at 8.20 naira and 14.40 naira. First Bank closed at 14.50 naira, down 10 kobo, the same as UBA which finished at 12.20 naira.</p>
<p>One stock still hotly demanded is Nestle which rose one naira to 90 naira on Friday.</p>
<p>It was hiked by investors seeking to raise their stake in the highly profitable company, dealers said.</p>
<p>Oil marketer Texaco also advanced to 49.20 naira, up 10 kobo although other oil marketers weakened on lack of demand.</p>
<p>Agip ended at 22.70 naira, shedding five kobo while African Petroleum fell 10 kobo to 57.90 naira.</p>
<p>Traders said a new fuel scarcity in Lagos did not have any impact on the prices of oil marketers which are usually punished by the market for similar shortages.</p>
<p>&quot;We may view the oil sector more critically next week should the scarcity persist,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The market would continue to see more equities trading lower next week because brokerage houses had large volumes of shares to sell, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides, traders are careful not to trade above the amount they have in their bank accounts for fear of being penalised by the central clearing system,&quot; said one.</p>
