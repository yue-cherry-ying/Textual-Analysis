<title>ISRAEL: Israel bonds close higher triggering lower yields.</title>
<headline>Israel bonds close higher triggering lower yields.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Israeli bonds closed up on Thursday in active demand for most kinds of bonds causing yields to continue to fall, traders said.</p>
<p>Indices:</p>
<p>* Government bonds general: +0.01 pct to 106.28</p>
<p>* CPI-linked government bonds: +0.07 at 106.5</p>
<p>* Unlinked government bonds: +0.01 pct to 105.96</p>
<p>* Dollar-linked government bonds: -0.35 to 105.18</p>
<p>* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: +0.06 to 104.99</p>
<p>Volume was 135 million shekels.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we saw a continuation of the trend of lower yields,&quot; said Ilan Doron of Solid Capital Markets. &quot;Yields of CPI-linked bonds are going in the direction of four percent and lower, and yields of unlinked bonds are at 13.8 percent. Makam's are at 13.7 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Demand for unlinked bonds was up because of estimates that the April consumer price index will be lower than expected. We forecast that April's CPI will be a surprise and lower than the expected 1.1-1.2 percent mainly because of lower house prices,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand for CPI-linked bonds was up as well because there is lack of supply in the market. The government is issuing less CPI-linked bonds,&quot; Doron said.</p>
<p>April's CPI, which will be published on May 15, is generally high due to the Passover holiday. Forecasts are that it will be around the 1.0-1.2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices of dollar-linked bonds were lower today and yields on some bonds were above seven percent. Yesterday yields were at around 6.8 percent,&quot; said a trader at IBI Investment House.</p>
<p>&quot;Traders were afraid that the dollar would weaken against the shekel after having weakened in the world markets, but the exchange rate was unchanged today,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.4030 shekels against 3.4040 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>On Sunday and Monday there will be no trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange because of the Israeli Memorial and Independence Days.</p>
<p>Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity.</p>
<p>($1 = 3.40 shekels)</p>
