<p>The father of &quot;Home Alone&quot; star Macaulay Culkin withdrew from a custody case on Tuesday and offered to give the child actor's mother sole custody of him and his siblings after a long dispute.</p>
<p>The announcement by Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Culkin came prior to what was to have been the opening of a custody trial in Manhattan Supreme Court between the children's father and their mother, Patricia Brentrup. The couple, who have seven children, never married.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Culkin advised me this morning that he does not intend to appear or defend this proceeding,&quot; his attorney Donald Frank said outside the courtroom.</p>
<p>&quot;To contest the matter would decimate the family even more ... and he did not want to put the family through any more pain,&quot; he said. &quot;He was trying to save the family.&quot;</p>
<p>Brentrup, 41, filed for custody of the children in 1995 and has accused their father of trying to destroy their acting careers. She had also accused Culkin, 51, of excessive drinking and physical abuse.</p>
<p>He has accused her of allowing the children to run wild.</p>
<p>Manhattan Supreme Court Justice David Saxe was expected to issue a final ruling in the custody case after listening to testimony by Brentrup during an uncontested prceeding known as an inquest.</p>
<p>Brentrup emerged from the closed court proceeding, smiling broadly. &quot;I'm very relieved,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm going home to rejoice with my children.&quot;</p>
<p>Macauley Culkin, who rose to stardom in &quot;Home Alone,&quot; has let it be known that he prefers living with his mother. He also appeared in &quot;Home Alone 2&quot; and &quot;Richie Rich&quot; and has earned about $17 million.</p>
<p>The couple's son Kieran, 14, also has acted in movies. The other children involved in the custody case are Quinn, 12, Christian, 10, and Rory, 7. Twenty-year-old Shane and 18-year-old Dakota are not involved in the case.</p>
