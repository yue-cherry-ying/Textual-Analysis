<p>U.S. stocks ended higher on Thursday, lifted after a drop in long-term interest rates that helped investors put a positive spin on the impact of a proposed capital gains tax cut, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Trading went against conventional wisdom that news of a proposal to make a capital gains tax cut effective as of Wednesday would unleash a wave of pent-up selling on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Dow finished up 51 points at 7137, backing off in late trade from a peak of 7215.  </p>
<p>&quot;It was definitely a shock,&quot; said Jay Meagrow, an institutional trader at McDonald &amp; Co, referring to the market's reaction on Thursday. &quot;I didn't see it coming.&quot;</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite rose eight points to 1331.</p>
<p>After the stock market close on Wednesday, the Republican chairmen of the congressional tax-writing committees said they would propose setting May 7, 1997, as the effective date for a capital gains tax cut.</p>
<p>The tax cut would allow investors to keep more of their profits after they sell stocks and other securities.  </p>
<p>Still, lightening the capital gains tax burden also makes investing in stocks more attractive, a view that apparently prevailed on Thursday, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand for stocks seems to be the dominant factor,&quot; said Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First. &quot;A rather positive spin is being given to this capital gains tax apparent agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dow recovered from a 140-point decline on Wednesday, which was fueled by a rise in long-term interest rates in the bond market, analysts said.  </p>
<p>But on Thursday, the yield on the closely watched 30-year Treasury bond backed away from 7.0 percent, a psychological barrier, setting the positive tone for stocks, market players said. The long bond was up 11/32 in late trading, its yield dropping to 6.94 percent from Wednesday's close at 6.96 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It adds a lot of octane to the equity market when rates move well below the seven percent,&quot; said Guy Truicko, equity portfolio manager at Unity Management.  </p>
<p>Shares of International Business Machines Corp jumped 5-5/8 to 167-3/4 after company officials held an upbeat meeting with analysts late Wednesday. CS First Boston raised its 12-month price target on the stock to $195 from $165.</p>
<p>US Airways Group Inc rose 2-3/4 to 34-1/2 after the company said it would cut unprofitable routes and close some facilities in a sweeping restructuring aimed at cutting costs.</p>
<p>Energy stocks gained amid a rise in crude oil prices. Atlantic Richfield Co advanced 2-5/8 to 145-3/4, Texaco Inc gained 4-3/8 to 110-5/8 and Chevron Corp added one to 70-5/8.  </p>
<p>United HealthCare Corp ended up 5/8 to 51-1/8 after hitting a session high of 53-1/2. The health maintenance organization reported a decline in first-quarter earnings but said new enrollment was strong and its retention rate was high in the face of price increases of more than five percent.</p>
<p>PETsMART Inc which runs a chain of pet supply superstores, fell 13/16 to 10-13/16. It said it expected its income from operations for its first quarter ended May 4 to fall short of Wall Street expectations.</p>
