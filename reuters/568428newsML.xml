<p>General liability insurer EXEL Ltd said it may seek out more acquisitions after it digests GCR Holdings Ltd, which it bought Thursday for $27.00 a share, or $637 million.</p>
<p>EXEL's acquisition of the nearly 95.0 percent -- or 23.6 million -- GCR shares it doesn't already own will leave it with between $200 million and $300 million in excess capital, according to EXEL spokesman Gavin Arton. And in a rapidly consolidating insurance industry, the company might use that capital on more acquisitions, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;After the deal we'll still have enough capital to do an acquisition or a buyback,&quot; said EXEL spokesman Gavin Arton. He also said the company would consider an expanded stock buyback, adding that the GCR acquisition, however, &quot;will slow our buyback plan for this year, and we certainly wouldn't do a buyback in the next few months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Arton speculated that if EXEL were to make an acquisition, it would probably seek a company in the &quot;specialty financial insurance area.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;We'd possibly consider a company that provides risk-management products, like someone who insures currency risk,&quot; Arton said. He added, however, that to date &quot;there's nothing we've targeted.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said EXEL's chief executive, Brian O'Hara, also alluded to more acquisitions on his conference call with them today, following EXEL's GCR announcement.</p>
<p>&quot;They (EXEL) have told us they may make additional acquisitions,&quot; said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at the S&amp;P Equity Group. &quot;On the conference call they said today's acquisition won't prevent them from making further deals.&quot;  </p>
<p>EXEL got a bargain when it bought GCR, said analysts who follow the company. EXEL's shares closed up 3-3/8 at 43.</p>
<p>&quot;I liked what I saw,&quot; said Merrill Lynch analyst Jay Cohen, who upgraded EXEL from &quot;accumulate&quot; to &quot;buy&quot; and raised his 12-month price target for the stock to between $51 and $53 a share.</p>
<p>Cohen said the deal would immediately add between $0.40 and $0.55 per share to EXEL's annual earnings. He and other analysts also said the acquisition allows EXEL to diversify into new areas, like catastrophe reinsurance.</p>
<p>Such diversification is crucial in today's insurance industry, where bigger is often better because companies can achieve economies of scale, said S&amp;P's Cathy Seifert.</p>
<p>&quot;The entire industry is in the midst of a consolidation,&quot; she said. &quot;I think if you look at the list of insurance companies out there a year from now, there will be fewer smaller insurance companies.&quot;</p>
<p>Yesterday, for example, life insurer Unitrin Inc said it would buy Reliable Life Insurance Co in a stock swap transaction. The deal gives Untrin a bigger presence in Texas, one of its key states, a Unitrin spokesman said.</p>
<p>The spokesman, who asked not to be named, also said that for most insurers, &quot;there's always some advantage in being large.&quot;</p>
