<title>TANZANIA: First joint trial for Rwanda genocide postponed.</title>
<headline>First joint trial for Rwanda genocide postponed.</headline>
<dateline>ARUSHA, Tanzania 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>The first joint trial of two Rwandans accused of genocide and crimes against humanity was postponed on Thursday at the International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda.</p>
<p>The trial of Clement Kayishema and Obed Ruzindana, which began on April 11, was postponed until the prosecution and defence agree on a date for it to resume in the north Tanzanian town of Arusha.</p>
<p>A total of 14 witnesses were presented by the prosecution against Kayishema and none against Ruzindana. Both have pleaded not guilty to crimes against humanity and genocide during the mass slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and Hutu moderates in 1994.</p>
<p>Kayishema, 43, was a prefect or the senior government official in Kibuye prefecture in western Rwanda at the time of the genocide in 1994. Ruzindana, 38, was a businessman in the capital Kigali.</p>
<p>The last prosecution witness, known only in court as Witness L to protect his identity, said he saw Kayishema at Kibuye stadium tell a white man who wanted to distribute food to Tutsi refugees that he would throw him in Lake Kivu if he did so.</p>
<p>The witness said the next time he saw Kayishema he came with gendarmes and ordered them to shoot Tutsis and they opened fire.</p>
<p>Under tribunal rules, the accused face life imprisonment if found guilty. Special tribunals for genocide suspects inside Rwanda since December have sentenced at least 29 people to death.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan dismissed two top tribunal officials in January after a U.N. report detailed administrative mismanagement, unqualified staff and legal chaos at the tribunal in Arusha.</p>
