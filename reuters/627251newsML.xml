<title>SPAIN: Spanish princess to wed in Barcelona's Cathedral.</title>
<headline>Spanish princess to wed in Barcelona's Cathedral.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Spain's Princess Cristina, the youngest daughter of King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, has chosen Barcelona's great Gothic Cathedral for her October wedding, the royal palace announced on Friday.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old princess, third in line to the throne, plans to marry Olympic handball player Inaki Urdangarin on October 4, a date set by the palace earlier in May. They will have a lunch reception afterward at the lavish Royal Palace of Pedralbes.</p>
<p>The couple, who met at the Atlanta Olympic Games where Spain's handball team won a bronze medal, both live and work in Barcelona, making the Catalan costal city a natural choice for the wedding site.</p>
<p>The 550-year-old Cathedral, located in the heart of the city's old quarter, is one of the grandest of Spain's Gothic buildings and for some quirky reason has always had a flock of white geese living in its cloistered gardens.</p>
<p>Cristina, like her unmarried younger brother, Crown Prince Felipe, and her elder sister Elena, is beloved by the Spanish public for her unpretentious and low-key style.</p>
<p>But the wedding promises to be a glittering affair.</p>
<p>When Elena got married in the southern city of Seville two years ago, royals from all over the world attended and it was broadcast on television to 400 million viewers.</p>
