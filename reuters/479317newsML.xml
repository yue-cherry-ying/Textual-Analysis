<p>A deadly fire swept through an apartment complex Tuesday in Earlington, Kentucky, causing the top floor of the three-story building to collapse and knocking out phone services to the town, authorities said.</p>
<p>Hopkins County State Police said there were an unknown number of deaths in the early morning blaze and the fire may have been set deliberately. Preliminary reports indicated there were five deaths.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the state fire marshal's office said the blaze, which caused the third floor to collapse, continued to burn several hours after it was first reported.</p>
<p>The fire along Earlington's Main Street knocked out phone service to the town of 1,800, 140 miles southwest of Louisville, fire marshal's spokeswoman Carol Czirr said.</p>
