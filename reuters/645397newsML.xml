<p>Afghanistan's Taleban militia said it had recaptured a strategic town north of the capital Kabul on Saturday as neighbouring states sought to bring peace to the shattered country.</p>
<p>Taleban sources, quoted by a Pakistan-based Afghan news service, said the forces of the purist Islamic militia took Jabal os-Siraj, 70 km (44 miles) from Kabul, in an early morning attack and were advancing further in an apparent move to clear the main highway to the opposition-held north.</p>
<p>They said a 2,000-strong militia force, helped by tanks and bombers, drove out the followers of renowned opposition guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah Masood from the town after a four-hour battle.</p>
<p>There was no immediate independent confirmation of the report, which coincided with a flurry of diplomatic activity by Afghanistan's neighbours.</p>
<p>A Russian deputy foreign minister, Viktor Pasuvaluk, and Turkmenistan's Foreign Minister Boris Shikhmuradov met Pakistani authorities in Islamabad on Friday and were quoted by official statements as calling for intra-Afghan peace talks.</p>
<p>Shikhmuradov met Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan and, according to a government statement, supported Pakistan's proposal for holding &quot;intra-Afghan dialogue in Islamabad under U.N. auspices and in consulatation with the countries bordering Afghanistan&quot;.</p>
<p>Pasuvaluk met Khan and other foreign ministry officials, and a Pakistan government statement later said the two sides shared the view that &quot;an intra-Afghan dialogue would lead to an indigenous solution&quot; to the conflict.</p>
<p>Iranian deputy foreign minister Alaeddin Boroujerdi met the leader of anti-Taleban Shi'ite Moslem Hezb-i-Wahdat party, Karim Khalili, in the central Afghan town of Bamiyan, AIP said.</p>
<p>In a related development, a Taleban spokesman, Wakil Ahmad, said three opposition pilots defected and landed a helicopter at Kabul airport after unloading military supplies from neighbouring Tajikistan in Masood's native Panjsher Valley.</p>
<p>Ahmad, speaking from the southern Afghan town of Kandahar, said the Taleban forces were advancing towards the mouth of Panjsher Valley to recapture another strategic town, Golbahar, which the Taleban recently lost to the opposition.</p>
<p>Jabal os-Siraj controls access to the Salang highway that leads to the north over the towering Hindu Kush mountains.</p>
<p>Masood's forces had captured both Golbahar and Jabal os-Siraj last week, cutting off a Taleban force based in Pul-i-Khumri, further north in Baghlan province. The Taleban were also ousted from the newly taken main northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif by Malik's forces.</p>
<p>The use of tanks and other heavy arms in Saturday's battle was made possible after the Taleban repaired a bridge at Matak between Jabal os-Siraj and Charikar, south of there, that had been blown up by Masood's forces, AIP said.</p>
<p>Taleban sources said about 45 opposition fighters and only three Taleban were killed in Saturday's battle.</p>
