<p>Their predicament may have evoked international sympathy, but the plight of the hostages held inside the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima for 105 days apparently holds little sway with the tax man.</p>
<p>The Peruvian tax office, the SUNAT, said on Tuesday that the roughly 50 hostages who are Peruvian citizens will have one month after their release -- whenever that is -- to pay their 1996 income taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;The deadline for paying the ... 1996 income tax for those who are currently being held as hostages in the Japanese ambassador's residence in Peru will be 30 working days after they recover their freedom,&quot; an official statement from SUNAT said.</p>
<p>Peruvians must file their 1996 returns by April 2, but people inside the besieged residence need &quot;a period that allows them to comply with the filing of their annual tax statements,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The Peruvians inside the residence include two cabinet ministers, President Alberto Fujimori's brother Pedro and high-ranking military and police officers.</p>
