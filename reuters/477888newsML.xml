<p>--------------------MARKET COMMENT----------------------------</p>
<p>* Toronto stocks ended higher on Tuesday, buoyed by strength</p>
<p>in golds and banking * Computer problems due to heavy trading</p>
<p>in Bre-X Minerals hampered session * 84 million shares traded</p>
<p>Toronto's key stock index ended higher on Tuesday as the saga of Bre-X Minerals Ltd and its Indonesian gold find continued to dominate Canada's biggest stock market.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Index climbed 50.15 points to close at 5900.37 in heavy turnover of 84.07 million shares worth C$1.4 billion. But the overall market was mixed with declining issues narrowly outpacing advances 476 to 464. 298 issues were flat.</p>
<p>Frantic trading in Bre-X collapsed the TSE's computer trading system earlier in the day, forcing the exchange to halt trading in the stock before the market closed.  </p>
<p>Shares in the Calgary-based gold prospector were halted for a statement by the company this morning. When it resumed, a whopping 7.7 million shares changed hands in the first 22 minutes of trading before the system crashed.</p>
<p>Bre-X closed up 1.35 at 3.85. It was the first time Bre-X traded since investors lopped nearly C$3 billion off its stock market value last Thursday.</p>
<p>TSE officials said the trading problems were due to old technology which will be replaced. On the Montreal Exchange, Bre-X closed up 0.81 at 3.50 on 9.8 million shares.</p>
<p>Analysts predicted more volatility for Bre-X shares this week. &quot;The question of what Bre-X will release over the next few days will be important to the market,&quot; said Josef Schachter, of Schachter Asset Management Inc.</p>
<p>The gold sector rose nearly 136 points, leading 12 of 14 sub-indices higher. Other strong groups included financial services, consumer products, energy and transportation.</p>
<p>The TSE posted minor losses in forestry and real estate.</p>
<p>--- HOT STOCKS ---</p>
<p>* Among bank shares, Bank of Nova Scotia rose 0.65 to 51.50 on 2.1 million shares, while Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce added 0.50 to 31.80 on 2.1 million shares.</p>
