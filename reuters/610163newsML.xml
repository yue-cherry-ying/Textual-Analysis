<p>Members of the far right National Front clashed with anti-racist protesters on Friday, two days before France's parliamentary election.</p>
<p>Claude Bourges, an aide to the National Front mayor of the southern town of Vitrolles, was hurt in the jaw and taken to hospital after the brawl, a Front spokesman said.</p>
<p>Police intervened when fighting broke out in Vitrolles' open-air market between members of the Front and militants of the &quot;Ras le Front&quot; (Enough of the Front). Both sides had been distributing leaflets ahead of Sunday's first round of France's parliamentary election.</p>
<p>The rightists included deputy party leader Bruno Megret, whose wife Catherine was elected mayor this year to make Vitrolles the fourth town in France in the hands of Jean-Marie Le Pen's anti-immigrant party.</p>
<p>Bruno Megret said that his wife had filed lawsuits against the head of the SOS Racism group, Fode Sylla, and others for inciting the violence in the town of 40,000.</p>
<p>&quot;Catherine and Bruno Megret and their militants were violently and deliberately attacked, verbally and physically,&quot; a statement said.</p>
<p>Sylla retorted that a member of the Megrets' security force &quot;took a pistol out of his jacket&quot; at the beginning of the trouble. The Megrets and their followers had started shoving people around, throwing tear gas canisters, he said.</p>
<p>Opinion polls published before a legal blackout last weekend gave the Front about 15 percent of the vote and up to three seats in the 577-seat National Assembly.</p>
