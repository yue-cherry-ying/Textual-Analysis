<p>Hong Kong stocks in London edged higher in thin trade after the Hong Kong market came off sharply overnight, traders said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng London Reference Index was up 33.41 points, or 0.28 percent at 12,107.60 by 1435 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the market has been extremely quiet, with people digesting the movements we've had in the last couple of days and we'll wait for Wall Street to see where we move from here,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials average was 33.61 points lower to 6,549.87 by 1535 GMT. Traders said some of the banking and property stocks were slightly firmer.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of these stocks (banking and property) seem to be reasonably well-bid, although I don't think there's very much business going with it. It seems to be more due to the sharp falls overnight,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong on Tuesday, the Hang Seng Index dropped 460.13 points or 3,67 percent to 12,074.19.</p>
