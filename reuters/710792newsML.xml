<headline>Americans unconvinced about NATO expansion-Clinton.</headline>

<p>President Bill Clinton predicted on Monday that only three nations would be invited to join the NATO alliance at its summit, and said he had some way to go before convincing Americans to support any expansion at all.</p>
<p>Clinton flew to Madrid on the eve of a two-day NATO summit which faces an intense debate over whether the 16-member alliance should be enlarged to include only Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- or Slovenia and Romania as well.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that the consensus decision will be for three, but I hope and believe there will be a clear message that the door to NATO remains open,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>Speaking with reporters at the conclusion of a meeting with a bi-partisan delegation of Republican and Democratic members of the U.S. Congress, in Spain for the summit, Clinton said he faced a challenge at home to win support for the addition of any members to the military alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a ways to go to convince the American people of the momentous importance of the decisions we are making here and the need for them to support it,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>Enlarging the alliance has generated some opposition in Congress and among the American public as questions have been raised about the increased costs that go with expansion and the added military obligations.</p>
<p>In a pre-summit editorial, the New York Times declared: &quot;Given the absence of a clear threat to Europe and the possibility of so many unpredictable consequences, NATO expansion seems a gratuitous risk.&quot;</p>
<p>Discussing his talk with lawmakers, Clinton said: &quot;They pointed out to me in no uncertain terms that we've got a sales job to do, but we think we can do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Senator Joseph Biden, a Democrat from Delaware who backs expansion, said afterwards that a Senate vote on approval is likely to come when the United States hopes to withdraw its peacekeeping forces from Bosnia next June.</p>
<p>Other Europeans participating in the NATO-led mission in Bosnia have threatened to withdraw too if U.S. forces pull out.</p>
<p>&quot;If at the time the United States withdraws its combat forces the Europeans all pull out, it is going to be a very difficult sell in the United States of America,&quot; Biden said.</p>
<p>&quot;Bosnia and cost-sharing are the keys to whether the Senate will vote for expansion,&quot; Biden predicted.</p>
<p>Clinton clearly sought to soften his opposition to allowing Romania and Slovenia NATO membership now, saying he was &quot;very enthusiastic about the developments that have taken place&quot; in both countries.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad they want to be in NATO,&quot; he said, &quot;and I think that they should get consideration. I just don't think at this time that they should be admitted.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. president plans to visit Romania for a few hours on Friday following a stop in Poland.</p>
<p>Clinton was asked about the possibility of eventually extending the alliance to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and said he opposed closing the door to any democracy.</p>
<p>Russia, which has grudgingly accepted NATO expansion to include some East European states, has threatened to review its ties with the alliance if the Baltic states, which were under Soviet rule from World War Two to 1991 and have large Russian minorities, are admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;My position is that no European democracy should be excluded from ultimate consideration,&quot; Clinton said, adding: &quot;My personal position is that that should apply to Russia as well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Any democratic country in Europe prepared to make NATO's commitments ... should be considered.&quot;</p>
