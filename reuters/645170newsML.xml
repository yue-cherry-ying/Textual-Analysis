<p>South Africa was still waiting for a positive response from the European Union on three trade issues, a senior government trade official said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Faizel Ismail, chief director of foreign trade relations, told a meeting of parliamentarians from the 12 Southern African Development Community (SADC) states that the next high-level South Africa-EU meeting on a trade agreement was set for July.</p>
<p>&quot;We have said to the EU that before we are able to go into detailed discussions about South Africa's offer, we need to get a positive response to the three key issues,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>These were EU restrictions on South African agricultural products, ways of meeting adjustment costs for South Africa and the region, and the way South Africa's SADC partners would be dealt with in the trade agreement.</p>
<p>Ismail said South Africa had so far declined to discuss its fish resources with the EU.</p>
<p>&quot;Their interest is to try to get access to our waters. We have not at this stage been able or willing to discuss issues of access. However we are willing to talk about cooperation on technical issues,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rob Davies, chairman of a South African parliamentary committee on trade, said there was no level playing field in trade between the EU and South Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;We're talking about subsidised agricultural exports from Europe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Subsidised European meat is entering the South African market... volume has increased from about 6,000 tonnes in 93 to 46,000 tonnes in 1996. This is beef which is coming in under two subsidies at something like half the domestic wholesale price,&quot; Daies said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is causing very severe disruption, not only to the South African meat industry but also to that of Namibia which is supplying the South African market,&quot; he said.</p>
