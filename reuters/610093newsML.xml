<p>The municipal yield curve steepened five basis points in the week ended Thursday, reversing the prior week's flattening, Delphis Hanover Corp. said Friday.</p>
<p>The steepening came as yields on short-term and intermediate bonds fell while long-term yields held steady during the week.</p>
<p>The Baa yield curve between one-year and thirty-year bonds steepened five basis points to 180 basis points, after flattening 10 the week before.</p>
<p>The spread between one-year and 30-year bonds in the triple-A category steepened five to 185 basis points, adding to the five basis point steepening from the week before.</p>
<p>Average yields on one-year, Aaa-rated municipal bonds fell five basis points for the second consecutive week, moving to 3.75 percent, while Baa-rated one-year bonds lost five to hit 4.55 percent.</p>
<p>In the intermediate sector, yields on Aaa-rated 10-year bonds were unchanged at 4.90 percent, while Baa-rated ten-years fell five for the second week in a row, to 5.70 percent.</p>
<p>Long-term municipals outperformed the Treasury market over the week.</p>
<p>The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond rose 12 basis points to 6.99 percent. Thirty-year municipal yields, meanwhile, were unchanged for the second week in a row at 5.60 percent.</p>
<p>Yields were also unchanged on 30-year, Baa-rated bonds, holding at 6.35 percent.</p>
<p>Thirty-year, Aaa-rated munis yielded 80.1 percent of Treasury long bond at the close Thursday, compared to 81.5 percent the week before.</p>
<p>The credit spread between Aaa-rated and Baa-rated one-years was unchanged at 80 basis points. The 30-year spread was also unchanged at 75 basis points.</p>
