<p>Burma's gross domestic product growth (GDP) is seen rising to 6.4 percent in fiscal 1997/98 (April-March) from a provisional 5.8 percent achieved in 1996/97, official media reported on Monday.  </p>
<p>&quot;The implementation of the 1996/97 annual plan according to the provisional data indicates a growth rate of 5.8 (percent) over the previous year,&quot; the media reported without giving growth figures for 1995/96.</p>
<p>The 1996/97 fiscal year represented the first year of a national five-year plan due to end in 2000/2001, it said.</p>
<p>Burma's ruling military-dominated State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) said in the media that it hoped to increase GDP by 6.4 percent in fiscal 1997/98 from the previous year.</p>
<p>The government said that one of its main objectives in this new fiscal year would be to strive for more foreign exchange earnings not only from exports of goods but also from the services sector.</p>
<p>It did not detail foreign exchange earnings from the previous year but said the government projected the total value of exports in the new fiscal year to rise to 5.9 billion kyat (about $1 billion) from 5.2 billion kyat.  </p>
<p>The government targeted the total value of imports in 1997/98 at 11.2 billion kyat from 10.8 billion kyat in the previous fiscal year at current prices.</p>
<p>It also projected growth in the key agriculture sector at 6.3 percent in the new fiscal year from 7.3 percent growth in 1995/96. The media did not detail the growth rate for agriculture in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Total investment in Burma was projected to rise to 109.1 billion kyat in fiscal 1997/98 from 108.0 billion.</p>
<p>Separately, the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development said that at the end of February, 21 countries has invested $6.03 billion in 244 enterprises in 11 sectors in Burma since the country moved toward a market economy in late 1988.</p>
<p>The government said in the new fiscal year it would &quot;strive for a balanced budget to stabilise the value of the kyat.&quot;</p>
<p>The official exchange rate of the kyat against the U.S. dollar is about six to one, but it trades at about 160 kyat to the dollar in the blackmarket.</p>
<p>The SLORC also pledged to undertake more economic reform measures and to encourage innovations and initiatives but did not give any details.</p>
