<p>Police arrested two 15-year-olds Friday after the body of a man was found floating in a Central Park lake with his throat slashed.</p>
<p>Police said they believed the teens, a boy and a girl, had been rollerblading in the park after midnight when they met the man and started drinking with him. The teenagers and the victim, a man in his 40s, all knew each other, police said.</p>
<p>They said an argument apparently broke out after the older man put his arm around the girl.</p>
<p>The body of the unidentified man was found floating in the lake at about 3 a.m. EDT Friday by police after they had received an emergency call.</p>
<p>Both 15-year-olds were arrested at their homes in the comfortable Upper West Side neighbourhood of Manhattan that adjoins Central Park. They are both being questioned and have not been charged. A weapon was recovered, police said.</p>
