<p>Tight border controls between Hong Kong and China have put a noose on rampant smuggling before the territory's sovereignty change, customs officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>British-ruled Hong Kong's return to China at midnight June 30 is expected to further improve cooperation in checking cross-border movement of contraband, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Smuggling cases have gone down in recent months, both on land and sea,&quot; Peter Tiu, spokesman for Hong Kong's anti-smuggling Customs and Excise Department told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The smuggling trend has really fallen. The Chinese are now guarding their side very tightly, and especially on water, smuggling activities are drastically down,&quot; said another senior customs officer, who declined to be named.</p>
<p>&quot;At least for the near future, the situation will be stable,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Smugglers over the decades have enriched themselves by moving everything from mundane diesel fuel, cigarettes and luxury cars to exotic antiques, tombstones, dinosaur eggs, children and heavily pregnant Chinese women.</p>
<p>Whatever and whoever is wanted by just anybody who can pay, on either side of the border.</p>
<p>Despite tall wire fences along most parts of Hong Kong's land border with China and a 24-hour surveillance by sea, authorities often acknowledge that smugglers have been quick thinking and artful.</p>
<p>Last April, authorities ordered a massive overnight sea search by high-speed launches and a helicopter after they thought smugglers had shoved illegal Chinese children overboard as decoy during a cat-and-mouse chase with marine police at sea.</p>
<p>But police netted only a scarecrow -- the following day.</p>
<p>The smugglers' heyday may have ended. In the run up to Hong Kong's handover, now only four days away, China and Hong Kong have stepped up border patrols, and cross-border contact will intensify.</p>
<p>&quot;The lower smuggling activity is probably due to the exchange of intelligence and cooperation between governments in China and Hong Kong. There are not so many escape routes, so smugglers will think hard,&quot; Tiu said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been regularly meeting our Chinese counterparts for a very long time, for at least 10 years,&quot; another senior anti-smuggling official said, adding their Chinese counterparts at high levels were usually just a phone call away.</p>
