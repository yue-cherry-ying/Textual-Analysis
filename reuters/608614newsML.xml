<p>The Angolan army has moved into the country's key diamond producing area in a military offensive which threatens the fragile peace process with the former rebel UNITA, military analysts and UNITA officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>At least 11 people were reported killed.</p>
<p>&quot;This started up on Monday and is hasn't stopped yet,&quot; said one military analyst in the capital Luanda.</p>
<p>&quot;The nature of the violence and the size of the operation is significant. This is the largest operation since December 1995, when the government took back areas around Soyo,&quot; the analyst said, referring to a north western Angolan city.</p>
<p>Military and expatriate sources said on Friday that the army had moved into the area with armoured vehicles, clearing areas overrun by refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo and UNITA supporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The FAA (Angolan army) has entered into our areas in the Lunda Norte and has taken the towns of Muinda, Canzar, Cambulo and Buia,&quot; a UNITA general told Reuters. The areas are along the Cassai River on Angola's eastern border with Zaire.</p>
<p>UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, entered into a power-sharing agreement with the government on April 11, formally ending two decades of civil war which started at independence from Portugal in 1975.</p>
<p>But it still controls vast areas of the countryside -- some estimates are as much as 70 percent -- including Lunda Norte Province where the army offensive is under way.</p>
<p>Isaias Samakuva, UNITA's chief representative to the Joint Commission, the body overseeing Angola's peace process, told Reuters that at least 11 people had been killed in the UNITA town of Buya in Lunda Norte.</p>
<p>&quot;We received a report today that 11 were killed by artillery fire in Buya,&quot; said Samakuva. &quot;There have been other casualties as well but I don't know how many.&quot;</p>
<p>Officials say Angola's peace process is at a critical stage. Many UNITA areas are scheduled to be handed back to the government but, partly because of the recent offensive, UNITA has threatened to call a halt to the process.</p>
<p>&quot;We still want to go forward,&quot; said Samakuva, &quot;but obviously if this offensive continues we will call a halt to it. If the army keeps this up, if they insist on taking these areas militarily, then there will be no more peace process for UNITA.&quot;</p>
<p>Samakuva says the government is using reports of an influx of refugees into the area from Zaire's civil war as an excuse to take the areas back.</p>
<p>UNITA told Reuters in April it was weeks away from signing a deal on how to share the country's diamond deposits with state-owned diamond company Endiama.</p>
<p>Many foreign companies have not been able to take control of their legal diamond concessions issued by Endiama, because they are still under UNITA's control.</p>
<p>Diamond production in Angola is estimated to be worth around $1 billion a year with between $300 million and $600 million of production coming from UNITA-held areas.</p>
