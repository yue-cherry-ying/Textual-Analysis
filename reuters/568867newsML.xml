<p>Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown made no comment about the level of the pound on Thursday, a Treasury official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The last time he did an interview was Tuesday,&quot; the official said. He said rumours Brown had conducted a radio interview and discussed the pound, circulating in the New York market, were completely wrong.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Brown announced the Bank of England would have operational independence to set interest rates. In a statement to reporters, he also said monetary policy is directed towards achieving price stability.</p>
<p>&quot;We want a stable and competitive pound over the medium-term, consistent with our objective of price stability,&quot; he said in his statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, a Treasury official told Reuters: &quot;There is no question of adopting a target for the exchange rate.&quot;</p>
<p>The pound has had a rocky session, sliding four pfennigs after Bridge news agency reported that a Labour Party source had said re-entry into Europe's exchange rate mechanism might be attractive for sterling if the central rate was 2.50 marks.</p>
<p>The report was quickly denied by the Treasury which said &quot;there is no truth in it at all.&quot;</p>
