<p>A lack of funds and rising grain output have caused grain storage difficulties in northeastern Inner Mongolia, one of China's main grain producing regions, the China Business Times said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The region's grain storage facilities, which have not been improved since early 1990s due to the lack of money, were holding much more than capacity after two consecutive bumper harvests in 1995 and 1996, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The region needs to have capacity to store 5.0 million tonnes by 2000 because local annual output at that time was forecast to be stable at about 13.5 million tonnes, it said. It gave no figures for current capacity.</p>
<p>The region needed to increase grain storage capacity by about 400,000 tonnes each year through 2000, with annual investment of at least 200 million yuan ($24 million), the newsaper said, adding it was difficult for the economically backward region to raise such an amount.  </p>
<p>A government policy to protect the state purchasing price coupled with good weather in 1995 and 1996 had boosted the region's grain output, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The region produced 15.3 million tonnes of grain in 1996, an increase of 45 percent or 4.8 million tonnes compared with 1995, it said.</p>
