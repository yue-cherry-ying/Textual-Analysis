<p>Japan's share market appears to have overcome worries of a tumble led by the fragile banking sector and starts the new fiscal year with fairly good prospects bolstered by export-oriented blue chips, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still some downward risks in the market, but the risk that we had expected has abated,&quot; said Kazuhiro Miyake, chief strategist at Nikko Research Centre.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom of the Nikkei average in the April to June quarter will likely be around 17,000 at the worst.&quot;</p>
<p>Japan's &quot;nifty-fifty&quot; blue chip shares will continue to shine on the yen's weak trend against the dollar, which supports earnings of Japanese manufacturers.</p>
<p>Stocks, however, may be weighed down in the first half of the 1997/98 financial year which started on Tuesday, reflecting concerns about the effect of the April 1 sales tax rise on the nation's fledgling economic recovery.</p>
<p>But many analysts believe Japan Inc will enjoy a healthy profit growth of around 10 percent or more this year, higher than last year, aided by the weaker yen.</p>
<p>They said a possible corrective retreat by Wall Street could briefly put a lid on the Japanese stocks, helping confine the average in the fairly limited range of between 17,000 and 20,000 in the first half of the 1997/98 year.</p>
<p>U.S. stocks posted sharp losses for the second straight day on Monday, hurt by heightened concern about the outlook for interest rates. The Dow industrials tumbled 157 points to 6,583.</p>
<p>The Tokyo stock market's key index, the 225-share Nikkei average, slid at the opening on the first day of the new business year, partly hit by Wall Street's weakness.</p>
<p>The Nikkei closed down 133.81 points or 0.74 percent at 17,869.59 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The nation's troubled banking sector, burdened with mountains of bad loans, will continue to be a drag for the stock market but panic sales are no longer expected.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the market was caught by an on-again, off-again speculation that a couple of Japan's major banks are about to collapse, which hammered down the Nikkei.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd (NCB), one of the most troubled of banks, announced a restructuring package which includes support from other private banks and monetary authorities, ending one long-standing speculation.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has avoided panic sales after all. But some worries in the financial sector are likely to remain,&quot; said Tamizo Kimura, general manager at Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics Inc.</p>
<p>Kimura said the banking sector would stay fragile, but that the Nikkei would be underpinned by the generally upward trend in Japan's corporate earnings and the government's steps to boost liquidity in Japan's land market, unveiled on Monday.</p>
<p>The steps are likely to help banks dispose of bad loans, which are mostly collateralised by land.</p>
<p>Analysts said that in the long term, Japanese stocks may also draw some investors after Wall street's tumble, which followed a recent rise in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve tightened its grip on credit last month as a pre-emptive step to cool the economy. It was the first such a move in over two years.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fed's tighter stance is affecting the global investment stance. Japanese stocks look more reasonable, and global funds will likely shift from U.S. stocks,&quot; said Nikko's Miyake.</p>
