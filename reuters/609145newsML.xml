<p>Worries about high Thai interest rates and delayed merger of Thai Danu Bank and Finance One helped the stock market to close marginally lower, brokers said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors sold to take profits due to uncertainty of the Thai Danu -Finance One talks. They also waited to see whether local banks would cut interest rates,&quot; said Busaba Kunasirin of Chao Phya Finance and Securities.</p>
<p>The composite SET index closed 0.26 point lower at 581.13 on sluggish 3.2 billion baht turnover.  </p>
<p>Both Thai Danu Bank and Finance One, Thailand's largest finance company, were scheduled to announce progress of their alliance talks later on Friday.</p>
<p>But a senior Thai Danu official said shortly before the market close that his bank and Finance One had agreed to scrap their March agreement on negotiating a merger.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors were reluctant to invest as they waited for Thai interest rate cuts.  </p>
<p>Most key sectors, except the banking counter, retreated. Banks gained 1.38 percent and the communications sector dropped 1.11 percent.</p>
<p>Krung Thai Bank topped the active list, rising 0.25 baht to 30.25, TelecomAsia fell one to 30.75, and Nava Finance dropped 1.25 to 15.25.</p>
