<headline>Friend says Bob Dylan in hospital under false name.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-28</dateline>

<p>Singer Bob Dylan is in a hospital under an assumed name being treated for an infection producing swelling around the heart but his life was not considered in danger, a source close to Dylan's family said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The source, who asked not to be identified, declined to say where the hospital is but added that it is not in New York as some media have reported.</p>
<p>Dylan, 56, called off a European tour on Wednesday after his publicists in London said he was admitted to a hospital suffering from a potentially life-threatening infection.</p>
<p>&quot;This past weekend, Bob Dylan was admitted to hospital suffering from severe chest pains. His condition has been diagnosed as histoplasmosis, a potentially fatal infection which creates swelling in the sac which surrounds the heart,&quot; Dylan's London publicists said.</p>
<p>The source said Dylan was being treated with antibiotics and his condition was not considered life-threatening. The source declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>Dylan's New York publicists said they hoped he would be well enough to go through with a U.S. tour slated for August.</p>
<p>He was due to perform in Ireland, Britain and Switzerland during the summer tour. Van Morrison, who was to appear with him in London on June 7, said he would still perform.</p>
<p>Dylan recently completed a swing through Canada and the Northeast and last appeared in Los Angeles this month.</p>
<p>He released his first album in 1962 and is considered the most influential songwriter of his generation, with such classics as &quot;Blowin' in the Wind,&quot; &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin,&quot; &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues,&quot; &quot;Like a Rolling Stone,&quot; &quot;Tangled Up in Blue,&quot; and &quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. David Pegues, an infectious disease expert at UCLA Medical Centre, said histoplasmosis is caused by a fungus that is extremely common in certain parts of the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not unusual,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;If untreated, sure it could kill him ... but it's an eminently treatable and curable illness, and I'm sure Mr. Dylan has the best medical supervision.&quot;</p>
<p>He said treatment was with a course of anti-virals, either orally or intravenously, and victims normally would be out of action for a few weeks at least.</p>
