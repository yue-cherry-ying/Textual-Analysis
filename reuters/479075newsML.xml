<p>A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a prospective juror who feared she would break down under the stress of a trial and prodded attorneys to speed up slow-moving jury selection in the Oklahoma City bombing case.</p>
<p>For the first time since jury selection began on Monday in the trial of Timothy McVeigh, accused of having planted the bomb that killed 168 people, the judge dismissed a person on the spot after she disclosed she had been treated for stress.</p>
<p>&quot;We've agreed, and please, this is nothing personal, we've agreed this is probably too much to ask of you,&quot; U.S. District Court Judge Richard Matsch told the woman after conferring privately at the bench with prosecutors and defence lawyers.</p>
<p>McVeigh, looking like a college student in a button-down blue shirt and pressed khaki pants, followed proceedings closely. He laughed loudly when jokes were made and stared intently at a juror who said she could not believe that someone who looked as nice as he could have killed people in the devastating April 19, 1995, attack on the Alfred P. Murrah federal building.</p>
<p>The juror, a trained social worker and assistant teacher, said of McVeigh: &quot;He looks like a nice kid ... It is overwhelming for me to think that this person who looks like an average kind of person could do such a thing. This was a pretty awful thing. It's hard to imagine that someone could think up all of this.&quot;</p>
<p>As she spoke, McVeigh's father, William, sitting in the front row, hung his head while McVeigh stared at the juror.</p>
<p>Jury selection has proceeded at a snail's pace in the trial of McVeigh, a 28-year-old Gulf War veteran with extreme right-wing sympathies who could be sentenced to death if convicted. By the lunchtime break, only nine prospective jurors had been questioned about their views on the death penalty and their exposure to publicity about the case.</p>
<p>One potential juror said Matsch once presided over a lawsuit he had brought and had &quot;rendered a reasonable opinion.&quot; The judge joked, &quot;For once,&quot; and the potential juror said: &quot;It wasn't in my favour, sir.&quot; The whole courtroom burst into laughter, including McVeigh.</p>
<p>The excused woman was the second in two days to have admitted to stress problems that might affect her ability to serve on the jury. She appeared to choke up with tears at the start of her questioning. When asked if she had spoken about the case with anyone, she said she had spoken with four people and had asked for their prayers.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it'd probably be better if I don't (serve),&quot; she told Matsch.</p>
<p>Jurors sat behind a screen and were identified only by a number to protect their privacy as the trial began under tight security.</p>
<p>Earlier Matsch seemed eager to speed up questioning of potential jurors, several times snapping testily at lawyers. He cut off defence attorney Stephen Jones after a lengthy examination of one potential juror, including questions about whether she would require McVeigh to testify.</p>
<p>Matsch, known for his hair-trigger temper, said, &quot;She will do whatever I tell her to do. ... I believe you have had more than an adequate time to examine this witness.&quot;</p>
<p>Jones quickly conceded. &quot;With the court's admonition, I wouldn't ask any more questions.&quot;</p>
<p>Later the judge snapped at defence attorney Richard Burr, who was pressing a potential juror about her views on the death penalty, saying: &quot;I think we've exhausted this matter.&quot;</p>
<p>Legal experts said earlier predictions that a jury of 12 plus six alternates could be found in two to three weeks appeared to be wildly optimistic unless the pace of questioning is dramatically speeded up. They said it might take between four and six weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;It's slow but I have been waiting a long time. I want the process to be right and thorough. You can't rush the thing. It takes what it takes,&quot; said Marsha Kight, who lost her 23-year-old daughter in the bombing.</p>
<p>McVeigh officially is on trial for the &quot;use of a weapon of mass destruction&quot; and the murder of eight federal officials. A second defendant, his former Army buddy Terry Nichols, will be tried separately later. Nichols turned 42 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Matsch and the lawyers have to find a panel of 64 people from which to choose the jury, with the defence and the prosecution then having 20 challenges each to bar jurors they consider potentially hostile to their side.</p>
<p>Because the case carries the death penalty, people opposed to capital punishment will not be seated as jurors. Only one of six people questioned on Monday expressed such opposition.</p>
