<title>THAILAND: Thai parliament passes budget bill first draft.</title>
<headline>Thai parliament passes budget bill first draft.</headline>

<p>The Thai government's hotly debated 1998 fiscal budget bill easily passed its first reading in parliament late on Friday by a 217 to 144 vote, government officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>With Thailand going through its worst economic crisis since the mid-1980's, the 982 billion baht ($39.3 billion) austerity budget proposes a four percent increase in spending year-on-year, the smallest rise in spending for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's six-party coalition, which controls 222 of the 393 seats in the elected lower house, had been expected to push the bill through despite strong resistance by the opposition, which accuses the government of economic mismanagement.</p>
<p>But the budget debate of the past few days was overshadowed by decisive new measures announced by Thai financial authorities on Friday to force weak companies in the ailing finance sector to merge with healthy firms.</p>
<p>The central bank suspended the operations of 16 ailing finance firms and ordered them to merge with any of five strong finance firms.</p>
<p>Thailand's debt-ridden finance sector is overexposed to the depressed property sector and hard-hit by a liquidity crunch resulting from high interest rates.</p>
<p>The national economy is set to post its lowest growth rate -- 5.6 percent -- in over a decade, compared with 6.4 percent in 1996. The stock market is at eight-year lows and the baht has come under speculative attack while exports have turned sluggish.</p>
<p>During the budget deliberations, a 57-member ad hoc panel headed by new Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya was set upto further study the first draft of the 1997/98 (October-September) budget before its second reading next month.</p>
<p>&quot;I will do everything I can to restore the economy,&quot; Thanong said, but he did not give details of his plans. Thanong took office last week.</p>
<p>The opposition has roundly attacked the government for what it has called economic mismanagement, misuse of funds and unrealistic revenue forecasts at a time of economic downturn.</p>
<p>Former education minister Samphan Thongsamak, now in the opposition, accused incumbent Sukhavich Rangsitpol of illegally transferring ministry funds between departments.</p>
<p>But premier Chavalit defended the minister, saying that the minister's action on the funds was &quot;a productive idea that we should have.&quot;</p>
