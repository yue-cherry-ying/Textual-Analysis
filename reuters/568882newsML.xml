<title>UK: LIFFE white sugar rangebound, NY fails to inspire.</title>
<headline>LIFFE white sugar rangebound, NY fails to inspire.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>White sugar futures were tightly mixed in light volume on Thursday with few features of interest to spur a listless market.</p>
<p>While spreads attracted some limited dealing interest, such as October/December trading at $2.00 earlier, ranges were tight at a maximum $1.80.</p>
<p>Traders said the London market was subdued as activity was lacklustre in New York and Paris was closed due to the Ascension Day holiday across Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;Eight points in New York and a dollar in London is not going to set the world alight,&quot; said one trader, referring to movements on July raws and August whites.</p>
<p>At 1515 GMT August stood just 80 cents higher at $312.50 and October up 10 cents at $303.30. Volume reached 820 lots, half of which was in August.</p>
<p>Technically, August's slow stochastic indicators are poised to converge in overbought territory, suggesting that the market could soon see a downturn.</p>
<p>But the contract's short-term momentum indicators are sending out conflicting signals as the five-day line has just moved into positive from negative, suggesting a rising market, whereas the 10-day line is moving lower.</p>
<p>The Paris market is closed on Thursday.</p>
<p>India's government has released an additional 50,000 tonnes of sugar for free sale in May to curb rising prices after its earlier free sale quota release of 750,000 tonnes for the month.</p>
<p>Pakistan scrapped its tender to buy 50,000 tonnes of crystal whites and will issue a fresh tender within the next few days, with 25,000 tonnes to reach Karachi by June 20 and the remaining 25,000 by July 10.</p>
