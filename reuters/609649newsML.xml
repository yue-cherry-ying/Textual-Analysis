<p>Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said on Friday revised estimates meant Pakistan's budget deficit for fiscal 1996/97 (July/June) would be at the previous year's level of 6.3 percent of GDP but should ease to five percent next year.</p>
<p>The deficit estimate for the financial year, which Aziz termed as the worst in Pakistan's history, is far higher than the four percent committed by the previous government of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.</p>
<p>A commitment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to bring down the deficit as a condition for releasing a suspended standby loan was reaffirmed by the caretaker government in place for three months after Bhutto's sacking last November.</p>
<p>&quot;Our revised estimate of the budget deficit is 6.3 percent of the GDP, which is the same as in the preceding year,&quot; Aziz said in a telephone interview with Reuters Financial Television (RFTV) in Tokyo, which was monitored in Islamabad.</p>
<p>He had said earlier this month the four percent target was unlikely to be achieved before the new economic reform agenda of the present government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif made progress.</p>
<p>&quot;My aim is to bring it down at least by one percent because any more or larger target would not be realistic,&quot; Aziz said in Friday's interview. &quot;So if we bring it down close to five percent we will have done very well.&quot;</p>
<p>He said this would be done despite an increase in debt servicing by 30 to 40 billion rupees, which would be more than one percent of GDP. &quot;So I think the target of close to five percent is a realistic one and that is our aim next year.&quot;</p>
<p>The official APP news agency quoted Aziz as telling a meeting of the parliamentary group of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League party and its allies on Thursday that the current financial year was the worst in Pakistan's 50-year history because of the Bhutto government's &quot;useless policies&quot;.</p>
<p>The rate of increase in national production had dropped to 2-1/2 percent while it had been around six percent during the past 30 years, he said.</p>
<p>Aziz told RFTV that Pakistan had set a target of increasing exports by 10 percent in 1997/98. Pakistan's total exports in July-March were $6.129 billion against imports of $8.753 billion.</p>
<p>He said repayment of Pakistan's short-term debt would become easier if exports went up by 10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;If we are able to increase our exports by 10 percent next year, which is our target..., which is an extra billion dollars, then the short-term debt servicing will become fine,&quot; he added.</p>
