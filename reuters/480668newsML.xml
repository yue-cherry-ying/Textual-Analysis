<p>Portugal's Public Credit Management Institute (IGCP) was expected to place all 25 billion escudos of 10-year fixed rate bonds at today's auction at close to secondary market levels, dealers said.</p>
<p>Results of the auction are due around 1100 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's auction does not come at a good time because in the last few days most markets were closed, but it is clear that the IGCP will accept bids at around the secondary market level,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Another said: &quot;We have until 1000 a.m. (local time) this morning to see how other markets opened, to help us decide at what levels to bid.&quot;</p>
<p>At the last auction at which bids were accepted on February 14, the average weighted interest rate was 6.6993 percent.</p>
<p>Ten-year bonds closed last Thursday to yield 6.9 percent.</p>
