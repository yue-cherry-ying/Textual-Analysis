<title>USA: US OPTIONS FOCUS/Telebras busy as stock surges.</title>
<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS/Telebras busy as stock surges.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Options on U.S.-traded shares of Telebras, the Brazilian telephone company, were active as the stock rallied sharply, traders said Thursday.</p>
<p>American Depositary Receipts of Telebras rose 4-3/4 to 123-5/8 on turnover of nearly 3.7 million shares.</p>
<p>Brokers said the stock both in the U.S. and in Brazil rose on optimism over legislative progress on Brazil's new telecommunications law, higher rates and talk that two banks raised Telebras earnings estimates.  </p>
<p>One options trader in Chicago said Telebras also appeared to be following the upward trend in Brazilian shares overall.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been scattered paper both ways,&quot; he said, referring to options order flows.</p>
<p>The 115-, 120- and 125-strike calls in the May, June, July and October series were the most active Telebras options.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of these are in-the-money calls and they're paying premiums of 7 and 8,&quot; said Todd Salamone, senior analyst at Cincinnati-based Investment Research Institute, adding that much of the turnover was in small blocks.  </p>
<p>&quot;When I see blocks of 100, I don't look at that as speculative activity,&quot; he said. &quot;That may be smart money buying into it. It's not as risky a bet.&quot;</p>
<p>Some of the biggest volume was from spreads.</p>
<p>The October 115 call traded 4,900 contracts on the American Stock Exchange and the volume was split in two blocks, one of 1,200 contracts and one of 3,700, each of which crossed as a spread.</p>
<p>Salamone said the options activity was not bearish.  </p>
<p>&quot;When you start seeing the out-of-the-money activity, that's when it's a little more speculative,&quot; he said. &quot;That's when it gets scary.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that the stock, which reached a 12-month high at 125, has been developing a tight, consistent uptrend that will likely stay intact until volatility increases.</p>
<p>&quot;I would never bet against something like that,&quot; he said. &quot;That's not to say you're not going to have short-term pullbacks as buying opportunities.&quot;</p>
