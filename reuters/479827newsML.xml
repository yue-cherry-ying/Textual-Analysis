<title>UK: Nervous Bradys stick to U.S. Treasury path.</title>

<p>Emerging market debt nervously swayed with U.S. Treasuries on Tuesday and traders said the market will remain jittery.</p>
<p>&quot;Until we see a floor in Treasuries, you won't see anything in Bradys,&quot; one European bank trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's almost no liquidity. People must be desperate to trade at the moment,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Most of the market is waiting for New York to open and to see what happens on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Even after that there is the long wait for Friday's non-farm payroll data to give another clue on the direction of U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>East European debt was softer, following on from Monday's drop in New York with Wall Street's falling fortunes.</p>
<p>Russian Vneshekonombank dollar debt  RUVNUSLNS=RR is now at its recent lows of around 77 cents in the dollar, down from a record high earlier in the year of 87 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia can't buck the trend. It's going to be a nervous, spooky market this week,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>MinFin bonds, which had been hit in the past two trading days, were about unchanged by late morning after choppy trading.</p>
<p>The impact of weak U.S. Treasuries has been compounded by concerns over delays in closing Russia's agreement with commercial banks on old Soviet debt.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, news that Bulgaria had finally closed one of its troubled banks had little effect, traders said.</p>
<p>A Bulgarian court on Monday declared state-owned Mineralbank insolvent.</p>
<p>It is the first state-owned bank to go after the programme to deal with the banking sector was introduced almost a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully with this government in place, there will be more (closures),&quot; Merrill Lynch analyst Andrew Kenningham said.</p>
