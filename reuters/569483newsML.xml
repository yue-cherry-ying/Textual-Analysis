<p>The Defence Department said on Thursday it took seriously allegations of racism against black male soldiers in an Army sexual harassment scandal and the charges would &quot;be examined&quot; in the normal course of legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Some defence attorneys have alleged that military cases against black Army drill sergeants and the service's top enlisted man might be racially motivated by white female troops and willingness of investigators to readily accept allegations against blacks.</p>
<p>&quot;Those charges will be examined ... we take any allegation of irregularity seriously,&quot; Defence Department spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters in response to questions at the regular Pentagon news briefing.</p>
<p>But he told Reuters later that he did not mean to imply the department was launching any special investigation of what he called allegations being &quot;as part of a defence effort.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not signalling or saying that there is a new investigation of these charges. We are not launching any special investigation of these charges,&quot; Bacon told Reuters. &quot;In broad terms, we look at such allegations as part of the legal process.&quot;</p>
<p>He declined to discuss any individual cases, but the questions and comments came one day after the Army filed charges of adultery and assault against its top enlisted man, Army Sgt. Maj. Gene McKinney.</p>
<p>The McKinney case was the latest development in an Army harassment scandal that included charges of rape of women recruits, many of them white, by a number of drill sergeants and trainers, most of them black, at several training bases.</p>
<p>At the briefing, Bacon stressed the U.S. military &quot;remains an exemplary institution in dealing with the question of race,&quot; offering equal opportunity for enlistment, support and promotion.</p>
<p>McKinney, a black, was accused by four white female servicewomen of sexual harassment.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old McKinney denied the charges and said in a statement on Wednesday he believed race was &quot;driving this investigation and the way it is being conducted.&quot;</p>
<p>McKinney's attorney said he, too, was disturbed by allegations that Army investigators had asked witnesses if McKinney was specifically interested in sex with white women.</p>
<p>The Army's Criminal Investigation Command denied race was an issue in the investigation of McKinney or others.</p>
<p>Army Staff Sgt. Delmar Simpson, a key figure in one of the worst U.S. military sex scandals, was sentenced on Tuesday to 25 years in prison for raping six women and other sexual offences at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.</p>
<p>Some critics accused the Army in the Simpson and other cases of being too willing to accept the charges of white women against black men.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't believe it is a problem,&quot; Bacon said, when asked by reporters at the briefing if the issue was creating racial tension in the armed forces.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that the military remains an exemplary institution in dealing with the question of race,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We train everybody equally to work as a team and to trust one another. The military has a very well-defined promotion system where everybody is treated equally to the best of the system's ability.&quot;</p>
