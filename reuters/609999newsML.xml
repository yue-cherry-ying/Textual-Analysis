<p>Morocco prepared to receive ousted Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko on Friday but said he planned to stay in the North African country for only a few days.</p>
<p>&quot;President Mobutu has asked permission to spend a few days in Morocco for health resons before going to his permanent place of residence,&quot; the official MAP news agency said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Mobutu's stay in Morocco will be strictly private.&quot;</p>
<p>Reporters were banned from Rabat airport before Mobutu's plane arrived from Togo.</p>
<p>&quot;We received clear instructions that no reporter will be allowed to attend or take pictures of president Mobutu arriving here,&quot; an Interior Ministry official said.</p>
<p>Mobutu was due to arrive at about 1400 GMT, he said.</p>
<p>Mobutu left Togo for Morocco on the presidential plane of Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, officials said.</p>
<p>Witnesses at Lome airport said Mobutu, who is fighting prostate cancer, was supported on both sides by aides as he climbed onto the plane, which left at 0910 GMT.</p>
<p>Mobutu arrived in Lome from his jungle palace at Gbadolite in northern Zaire on Sunday night, a day after Laurent Kabila's rebels marched into the capital Kinshasa.</p>
<p>He initially landed in Togo for a technical stopover but Togolese sources said the government had reluctantly agreed to let him stay longer because of his state of health.</p>
<p>French Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain hinted on Wednesday that France might be prepared to admit Mobutu for medical treatment.</p>
<p>In Rabat, senior interior ministry officials and paramilitary gendarmes were seen at the airport before Mobutu's arrival.</p>
<p>A Reuters correspondent saw a black official limousine parked at the entrance to the airport's VIP lounge with two official 60-seat buses.</p>
<p>Mobutu visited Morocco for four days last February in the midst of the guerrilla war which overthrew him.</p>
