<p>The Pakistani parliament on Tuesday passed landmark constitutional amendments stripping the president of powers to sack governments and appoint armed forces chiefs and provincial governors.</p>
<p>Ruling and opposition parties joined in quickly passing a constitution amendment bill in the Senate (upper house) and the National Assembly (lower house) following Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's announcement in an overnight broadcast of plans to move for the change.</p>
<p>&quot;The bill is not just a unanimous bill of parliament, it is a unanimous bill of the entire nation which was passed here,&quot; Sharif said in brief remarks at the National Assembly.</p>
<p>He thanked his rival, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, for her party's support to the amendments and said: &quot;The objective in front of us is the interest of Pakistan and supremacy of parliament, and the spirit that we saw here will be maintained in the future.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Today is the beginning of real democracy in this country,&quot; National Assembly speaker Ilahi Bakhsh Soomro said as he announced the passage by the 217-member house by 190-0 votes.</p>
<p>&quot;The threat of dissolving this house or the government no longer exists,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The bill undoes clauses of the controversial Eighth Amendment, a relic from the military rule of the late president General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq from 1977 to 1988, and used by presidents to sack four prime ministers in the past eight years.</p>
<p>Sharif on Monday said his move had the approval of President Farooq Leghari, who used his Eighth Amendment powers in November to sack former prime minister Benazir Bhutto on disputed charges of corruption and misrule and dissolve the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The subsequent general elections on February 3 gave a landslide victory to Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (PML) party and a crushing defeat to Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP).</p>
<p>PML and PPP members voted for the bill in the Senate and the National Assembly in a rare display of unanimity between the two sides of the political divide, which have had a history of acrimony over the past several years.</p>
<p>Under the amendments, a dissolution of the National Assembly and subsequent sacking of a prime minister, and the appointment of armed forces chiefs and provincial governors by the president will be subject to a binding prime ministerial advice.</p>
<p>One amendment also bars provincial governors from dissolving provincial parliaments without a binding advice from the provincial chief ministers.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very good day for us,&quot; Sharif said in a speech to the Senate after the bill was passed there.</p>
<p>&quot;I promise that, insha-Allah (God-willing), the government and opposition will work together on national issues and there would be no victimisation of the opposition,&quot; he said as Bhutto, now the main opposition figure, watched the proceedings from the visitors' gallery.</p>
<p>Sharif said he met Leghari at the president's home village in Punjab province on Monday and &quot;he willingly agreed to this decision&quot;.</p>
<p>Zia, who introduced the Eighth Amendment as part of a bargain to end martial law, used it to sack his own hand-picked prime minister Mohammad Khan Junejo in May 1988 before being killed in a mysterious plane crash.</p>
<p>Bhutto was sacked first by president Ishaq Khan in 1990 and then by Leghari last November. Sharif was sacked by Ishaq Khan in 1993.</p>
<p>Bhutto has accused Leghari and the caretaker government he appointed of rigging the February 3 vote to deal a crushing defeat to her party. But she had pledged to back Sharif in repealing the Eighth Amendment.</p>
