<p>Not in their wildest dreams could Nantes have hoped earlier in a remarkable season that they would bring down the curtain on the French first division championship in a top-of-the-table clash with champions Monaco on Saturday.</p>
<p>The title was decided three weeks ago when Monaco, now 12 points ahead of Nantes and third-placed Paris St Germain, clinched their sixth crown.</p>
<p>But with the runners-up also qualifying for an expanded European Cup, the interest and excitement have persisted to the final day thanks in no small measure to a Nantes team who did not win in their opening 10 games but are subsequently unbeaten in 30.</p>
<p>PSG, beaten in the European Cup Winners' Cup final by Barcelona 10 days ago and having accepted in mid-season that they could not catch Monaco in the league title race, had set their sights on the prize of second place.</p>
<p>But arch-rivals Marseille, playing only for their pride, beat them 1-0 at the Velodrome last weekend while Nantes defeated Montpellier 3-0 at home to overtake the Parisians on goal difference and snatch the initiative.</p>
<p>Nantes were 17th, 19 points behind then leaders PSG after 12 matches in mid October.</p>
<p>PSG players this week stoked up the tension by suggesting the transfer to Monaco of Nantes top scorer Japhet N'Doram next season could have a bearing on the outcome of the match in the principality's Stade Louis II.</p>
<p>N'Doram responded by saying: &quot;I've always been very frank and very honest in football and outside (the game), so it shocks me that people could suspect (anything).&quot;</p>
<p>Coach Jean-Claude Suaudeau, whose captain Jean-Michel Ferri is out after sustaining an injury against Montpellier, commented in something of an understatement: &quot;The clash between a team that has been winning for 30 matches and a champion side is definitely interesting, especially considering that Monaco have not lost at home (in the league) this season.&quot;</p>
<p>Monaco will want to close the championship on a good note, the more so after the disappointment among their players of having only goalkeeper Fabien Barthez picked for France's World Cup warm-up tournament next month.</p>
<p>Their coach Jean Tigana was annoyed at the hints from the capital that they might not put everything into the match.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to play to win, as usual. We have prepared for that and, on top, everyone wants to play this match. It's the last match at Monaco, it's going to be a party,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Some are already disappointed. Martin Djetou, Belgium's Enzo Scifo and Marco Grassi of Switzerland are all injured, while top scorer Sonny Anderson and defenders Martin Djetou and Gilles Grimandi depend on late fitness tests.</p>
<p>Tigana added: &quot;We have our unbeaten home record to preserve and then there is a kind of respect we must have towards Nantes and also towards our profession.&quot;</p>
<p>Nantes forward Jocelyn Gourvennec pointed a finger north when he said: &quot;One could turn the argument around. Strasbourg, who play in Paris, have nothing left to fear or hope for.&quot;</p>
<p>Strasbourg, as League Cup winners, have already ensured a place in the UEFA Cup, which is the smaller prize that either PSG or Nantes will be left with on Saturday.</p>
<p>Bordeaux, bidding for one of the two other UEFA Cup places, are away to a Le Havre side unbeaten in their last four matches.</p>
<p>Rolland Corbis's side will want to secure their place with a victory but have been unsettled in midweek with confirmation that their coach leaves for Marseille at the end of the season and that France midfielder Ibrahim Ba, who joined Bordeaux from Le Havre last year, is set to move abroad.</p>
<p>Courbis, whose team scraped a 2-2 draw at home to Lyon last weekend, said: &quot;I'd never have thought it was so difficult to qualify for Europe.&quot;</p>
