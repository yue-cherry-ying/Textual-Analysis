<title>USA: American pilots' board to vote on proposal.</title>
<headline>American pilots' board to vote on proposal.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>The board of American Airlines' pilots union will meet later this week to decide whether to accept the airline's latest contract proposal, the pilots said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The board of the Allied Pilots Association, which represents 9,300 pilots at the second-largest U.S. carrier, will meet at the Arlington Park Hilton in Arlington Heights, Illinois, on Thursday and Friday, the union said.  </p>
<p>While the pilots and the airline have reached an agreement in principle, the issue of who will fly small jets that American plans to buy for its regional carrier, American Eagle, remains a potential sticking point, the union said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear to me that we are down to one issue in this debate -- the regional jets. The board has to decide whether the fix contained in the agreement in principle is sufficient or whether they want to attempt to execute a single-issue strike,&quot; James Sovich, president of the Allied Pilots Association, said in a recorded message to the union members.  </p>
<p>The union declined to provide details about the compromise contained in the agreement.</p>
<p>AMR Corp's American Airlines wants its lesser-paid American Eagle pilots to fly the small jets, contending that it needs such an arrangement to be competitive with low-cost commuter carriers. The mainline pilots fear the Eagle pilots will take over routes now flown by them.</p>
<p>If the board rejects the pact, a 30-day cooling-off period would begin, setting the stage for another possible strike.  </p>
<p>If the board accepts the labor proposal, the rank-and-file members must still ratify the deal. A 30-day cooling off period would follow if they rejected the pact.</p>
<p>The pilots have rejected board-approved deals in the past. On September 2, the board accepted a proposal by American, a unit of AMR Corp, but the union members rejected it on January 8, setting the stage for the latest round of negotiations.</p>
<p>The union went on strike on February 15 but was sent back to work minutes later by a Presidential Emergency Board set up by President Bill Clinton.</p>
