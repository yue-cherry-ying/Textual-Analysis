<title>CROATIA: Croatia's OTC market to launch electronic trading.</title>
<headline>Croatia's OTC market to launch electronic trading.</headline>
<dateline>ZAGREB 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Croatia's over-the-counter market in Varazdin plans to introduce electronic trading within a month, the daily Vjesnik quoted director Marijan Cingula on Friday as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Computerisation is progressing at such a fast pace in the world that trade without computer back-up is no longer even imaginable,&quot; Cingula said.</p>
<p>The Varazdin securities market initially wanted to buy Nasdaq's trading system but has abandoned these plans in favour of developing its own system, he said.</p>
<p>Private firm IGEA was entrusted with designing it and Zagreb-based ESC has already supplied equipment by Digital with the latest software, Cingula added.</p>
<p>Some 35 brokerages that trade on the OTC market have so far communicated with Varazdin only by telephone and fax. Reuter clients can view closing results on page  OTCVAR Monday-Friday in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The Zagreb Stock Exchange recently launched an on-line trading system, which will gradually replace simpler off-line communications with member brokerages via modem.</p>
<p>The bourse sees all 46 current members eventually obtaining a direct on-line link to its central computer. It also plans to feed live trading data to Reuters screens. -- Kolumbina Bencevic, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075</p>
