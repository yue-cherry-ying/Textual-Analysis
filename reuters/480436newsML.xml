<p>Malaysia's palm oil prices are likely to be maintained at an average of between 1,100 and 1,200 ringgit a tonne in 1997, the Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority (PORLA) said.</p>
<p>In its latest monthly bulletin report, PORLA said the prospects for the industry would also depend on the price competitiveness.</p>
<p>&quot;The competitive price of palm oil is also expected to boost exports to 7.4 million tonnes from 7.2 million tonnes in 1996, in line with the expected increase in output to 8.7 million tonnes from 8.3 million tonnes,&quot; PORLA said.</p>
<p>It said prices last year fell to 1,191.50 ringgit a tonne from 1,472.50 ringgit in 1995, but added that prices of other major vegetable oils in the world also fell due to a surplus in supply. At midday on Tuesday, the benchmark third position palm oil futures contract was at 1,252 ringgit a tonne.</p>
<p>The domestic market is expected to be stable, aided by the expected reduction in world supply of vegetable oils due to lower opening stock, PORLA said.</p>
<p>It said prospects for palm oil could be better if intensive efforts are made to recapture China's market and to strengthen markets in India, Pakistan and the European Union.  </p>
<p>In 1996, the largest export market was Pakistan, which raised its intake by eight percent to 1.14 million tonnes from 1.06 tonnes in 1995, while China took in 17 percent less at 873,616 tonnes from 1.046 million.</p>
<p>India imported 1.027 million tonnes against 742,405 tonnes in 1995, while the European Union's intake rose to 738,130 tonnes from 664,877 tonnes.</p>
<p>The continued duty exemption on export of processed palm oil would augur well for the Malaysian palm oil industry, it said.</p>
