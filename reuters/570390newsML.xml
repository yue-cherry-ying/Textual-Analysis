<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures opened slightly firmer on Thursday in quiet business as traders appeared to shrug off news that OPEC was likely to stick with its current output ceiling.</p>
<p>June Brent was just five cents a barrel firmer and stood at $18.21 a barrel at 0959 GMT while May gas oil stood 25 cents up at $167.75. The May/June gas oil backwardation had doubled to +$2.00.</p>
<p>&quot;On the Brent, nothing doing,&quot; one dealer said, noting that the Ascension Day holiday in much of Europe had sapped market liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;OPEC has not really had much of an influence at all,&quot; another said.</p>
<p>OPEC president Libyan Oil Minister Abdullah Salem al-Badri told Reuters on Thursday he expected the group to leave the 25.03 million barrels per day output ceiling unchanged when the organisation meets in June.</p>
<p>He admitted that OPEC output was running in excess of the official ceiling and said: &quot;We are overproducing, yes, but I have contacted everyone and I hope we will have cooperation.&quot;</p>
<p>While IPE gas oil outright prices were little changed, the May/June spread had widened sharply.</p>
<p>May expires on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Gas oil is a bit more interesting,&quot; the broker said, adding: &quot;There is high open interest - just under 16,000 lots - and there seems to be a little bit of a squeeze, with the May coming off the board on Monday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think the spreads could go further - with the shorts on the losing end.&quot;</p>
<p>Technical analysts were bullish, saying they saw good support for front-month Brent at $18.00 and then $17.88 a barrel, while first resistance was likely to be encountered at $18.39.&quot;</p>
