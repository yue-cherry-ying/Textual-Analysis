<p>France's new Socialist Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine conferred by telephone on Saturday with his German and Polish counterparts on forthcoming diplomatic events, the French Foreign Ministry announced.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Polish Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati telephoned from Warsaw, where Kinkel was visiting, to congratule Vedrine on his new portfolio and discuss a range of diplomatic topics, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said.</p>
<p>He declined to give details but said Kinkel and Vedrine discussed a European Union summit in Amsterdam on June 16-17 and a Franco-German summit set for next Friday in the French city of Poitiers.</p>
<p>Attending the Poitiers meeting will be new Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin as well as conservative President Jacques Chirac, obliged to share power since a leftist alliance swept France's previous centre-right government from power in last Sunday's parliamentary election.</p>
<p>The Franco-German meeting will take place among growing uncertainty surrounding the conditions and timetable for a single European currency.</p>
<p>During the election campaign, Jospin said he would impose conditions for European monetary union, including a ban on further austerity for the French people in order to qualify for the euro.</p>
<p>The Amsterdam EU summit is expected to reach agreement on a new pact on EU institutional reforms, intended to update the Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>The meeting will also focus on a stability pact intended to assure fiscal discipline on the part of states participating in European monetary union. The pact has already been drafted but questions have been raised whether the new French government would accept it or seek changes.</p>
<p>Vedrine and Rosati discussed the status of three-way ties between Bonn, Warsaw and Paris, known as the Weimar triangle, Doutriaux said.</p>
