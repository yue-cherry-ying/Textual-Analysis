<p>Arch Communications Group Inc said Monday it increased the facility size and extended the due date of the credit agreement of Arch's USA Mobile Communications Inc.</p>
<p>The facility was increased from $60 million to $110 million. This amount will be available through June 30, 2000. The final maturity was extended from December 31, 2000 to June 30, 2002.  At December 31, 1996 $53 million was drawn.  </p>
<p>Arch also amended its credit agreement for its other operating subsidiaries to extend the useful life of the facility and to provide for the acquisition of Narrowband Personal Communications Services spectrum.</p>
<p>The facility totals $500 million, of which $328 million was drawn at December 31, 1996. The total facility includes a reducing revolver of $250 million and two term loans of $100 million and $150 million. The full amount of the term loans was drawn and $78 million of the revolver was drawn at December 31, 1996.

<p>Arch chief executive C. E. Baker Jr. said, &quot;... we are very pleased to have added flexibility provided by our lending group to our Arch facility. We are now positioned to make strategic acquisitions of N-PCS spectrum should licenses become available on favorable terms, whether through auctions or from incumbent holders of licenses.&quot;</p>
