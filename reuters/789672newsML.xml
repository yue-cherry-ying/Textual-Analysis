<p>Ato Boldon, the world 200 metres gold medal firmly in his grasp, now plans to attack Donovan Bailey's world 100 record.</p>
<p>Boldon won the 200 title on Friday evening after finishing fifth behind training partner Maurice Greene of the United States in the 100 metres last Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;I was supposed to win both races,&quot; Boldon said on Saturday. &quot;I was reminded of a lesson and that is that the public does not care why you didn't win.</p>
<p>&quot;Wether you like it or not, the 100 metres is the most prestigious event. I wasn't able to win that one but I decided to go for the 200 and give my all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just hit that gun, then my 15 first steps were awesome.</p>
<p>&quot;I took a quick glance to my right and saw nobody there. I was shocked and happy at the same time. And relieved.&quot;</p>
<p>Boldon, who finished third in both the 100 and 200 metres at last year's Atlanta Olympics, now plans to reduce Bailey's mark of 9.84 set in the Olympic final.</p>
<p>&quot;It can definitely fall,&quot; said Boldon. &quot;It is very approachable and the fact that everybody is coming close says just that.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked when the record would come and who would break it, Boldon said Bailey, Greene and himself stood a chance in the remaining European Grands Prix.</p>
<p>He said the Zurich and Brussels Golden Four meetings were the most likely venues.</p>
<p>&quot;It can happen everywhere but I would personally like to reward them (the organisers of Zurich and Brussels) with a world record in their meeting,&quot; Boldon said. &quot;I'll give my best effort and my best effort can be very dangerous in terms of approaching or breaking the world record.&quot;</p>
<p>Boldon, who moved to the United States when he was 14, said he was proud to have given Trinidad and Tobago their first world title.</p>
<p>&quot;Before the start of the race, I saw myself on the screen and I just touched the colours on my chest,&quot; he said. &quot;When an American sprinter wins, the impact is not that great. With me, it's different. The kids back home expect me to win. If I don't, they will have a bad day.&quot;</p>
