<p>Pakistan's parliament passed constitutional amendments on Tuesday stripping the president's powers to sack governments and appoint armed forces chiefs and provincial governors, giving them to the prime minister.</p>
<p>Ruling and opposition parties joined in quickly passing a constitution amendment bill in the Senate (upper house) and the National Assembly (lower house) after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's announcement in an overnight broadcast of plans to stage what looked like a political coup.</p>
<p>&quot;The bill is not just a unanimous bill of parliament, it is a unanimous bill of the entire nation which was passed here,&quot; Sharif said in brief speech to the National Assembly after the passage of the bill.</p>
<p>&quot;The objective in front of us is the interest of Pakistan and supremacy of parliament, and the spirit that we saw here will be maintained in the future,&quot; he said as he thanked his rival, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, for her party's support to the amendments.</p>
<p>Bhutto, whose government was sacked last November by President Farooq Leghari, her former protege, said: &quot;Today's decision is a day of victory for all those political workers who had fought for the supremacy of parliament. This will create stability in the country.&quot;</p>
<p>National Assembly speaker Ilahi Bakhsh Soomro announced the passage in the 217-member house by a 190-0 vote.</p>
<p>&quot;Today is the beginning of real democracy in this country,&quot; he said. &quot;The threat of dissolving this house or the government no longer exists.&quot;</p>
<p>The bill, earlier passed by the 87-seat Senate 79-0, overwrites clauses of the controversial Eighth Amendment, a relic from the military rule of the late president General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq from 1977 to 1988, and used by presidents to sack four prime ministers in the past eight years.</p>
<p>Sharif said on Monday his move had the approval of Leghari, who used his Eighth Amendment powers on November 5 to sack Bhutto's three-year-old government on disputed charges of corruption and misrule and dissolved the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The subsequent general elections on February 3 gave a landslide victory to Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (PML) party and a crushing defeat to Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP).</p>
<p>PML and PPP members voted for the bill in the Senate and the National Assembly in a rare display of unity between the two sides of the political divide, which have had a history of acrimony during the past several years.</p>
<p>Under the amendments, a dissolution of the National Assembly and subsequent sacking of a prime minister, and the appointment of armed forces chiefs and provincial governors by the president will be subject to a binding prime ministerial advice.</p>
<p>One amendment also bars provincial governors from dissolving provincial parliaments without a binding advice from the provincial chief ministers.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very good day for us,&quot; Sharif said in a speech to the Senate after the bill was passed there.</p>
<p>Sharif said in his overnight broadcast that he met Leghari at the president's home village in Punjab province on Monday and &quot;he willingly agreed to this decision&quot;.</p>
