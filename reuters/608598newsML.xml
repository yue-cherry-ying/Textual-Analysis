<p>In a bid to pressure Ottawa and Washington to resolve a dispute over Pacific salmon fishing, British Columbia said on Friday it will cancel the lease on an underwater military testing range used by the United States.</p>
<p>Provincial Premier Glen Clark told reporters that British Columbia will cancel the lease held by the Canadian federal government on the seabed at the Nanoose Bay submarine and weapons testing ground off Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>The Canadian Maritime Experimental Test Range at Nanoose Bay on Canada's Pacific coast is used by U.S. submarines as a torpedo test range under a Canada-U.S. joint defense agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;This will effectively end the use of the torpedo test range by the United States Navy,&quot; Clark said to loud applause from a crowd of fishermen who attended his news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We have got to take some kind of dramatic action to get their attention ... It is clear this has not been on the radar screen of the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>Talks between Canada and the United States on how to share dwindling salmon stocks in the Pacific Northwest collapsed on Tuesday in Seattle. The two neighbors have squabbled for years over salmon catches and pressure for a deal was mounting before this year's salmon run begins in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The British Columbia premier on Friday accused Ottawa of not pressing hard enough in those talks and the United States of not giving its top negotiator authority to make a deal.</p>
<p>There was no immediate reaction from Washington to news of the lease cancellation. But before British Columbia's announcement, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she hoped to avoid such action.</p>
<p>When asked about the potential for such a step by British Columbia, Albright told reporters in Washington: &quot;We obviously do not want it to reach the kinds of proportions that you are discussing.&quot;</p>
<p>Albright said on Friday she planned to talk with Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy about the breakdown in talks. &quot;We have obviously wanted these talks to go forward in a way that the stakeholders there would feel that their rights have been looked at properly,&quot; she told a news conference.</p>
<p>The response from Ottawa to British Columbia's action was muted. Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Jennifer Ledwidge declined to comment on the lease cancellation other than to say the facility is very important to Canada's defense.</p>
<p>Separately, Axworthy called on the United States to reopen negotiations and warned of possible further measures on top of minor restrictions on U.S. fishboats announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Barring an immediate return to negotiations, we will consider further options. Any futher steps we take must be aimed at resuming negotiations -- not detracting from them,&quot; Axworthy said in a statement.</p>
<p>Ottawa on Wednesday began enforcing an existing regulation that requires all U.S. fishboats passing through its waters to report to Canadian authorities. The measure could delay fishermen on their way to fishing grounds.</p>
<p>The premier urged Ottawa to impose a large transit fee on U.S. fishing vessels as it did in 1994.</p>
<p>Clark also called on Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who faces a June 2 election, to get more involved in efforts to resolve the feud. Political analysts said Clark's move was timed to get the maximum attention from Chretien, whose Liberal party is in a tight race in British Columbia.</p>
<p>British Columbia's cancellation of the testing ground lease takes effect in 90 days.</p>
