<p>Gilt futures made a spirited recovery on Friday after falling more than a full point in a sell-off on Thursday, sparked by a poorly covered auction. The June gilt future clawed its way up 19/32 to close at 112-15 as the UK market closed for a three-day weekend. But the contract failed to reclaim the key 112-28 level which traders said prompted Thursday's sell-off.</p>
<p>The lower price levels had attracted buyers back into the market.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say that today's rally is more technical than anything else,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We had widened out to 150 against Germany overnight, that was one factor. Secondly, the yields at the long end of the market looked much better value.&quot;</p>
<p>By the close of trade on Friday the gilt/Bund spread had narrowed in to 145 basis points.</p>
<p>Traders said there was a slight flattening of the UK yield curve over the five to 10 year range but from there out to the ultra long 21 year stocks it was unchanged.</p>
<p>Traders were surprised that the recovery had come without the help of U.S. Treasuries, which only inched narrowly higher in moderate trade.</p>
<p>But they said gilts remained vulnerable to external pressures and would be watching a batch of U.S. data out next week for clues as to whether the Fed might raise interest rates.</p>
