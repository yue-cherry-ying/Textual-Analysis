<p>The June Bund future on LIFFE will try to push up to the 101.10 area on Friday before sliding to test support around Thursday's low at 100.63, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The price action is obviously pretty weak...but I'm not sure that the market can hold further losses for very long,&quot; said Karl Haeling, director of futures and options at DMG Futures and Options in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>&quot;We can go down, but are we vulnerable to a short covering rally after we trade lower?&quot;</p>
<p>By 0646 GMT, the June Bund was up 15 basis points at 100.88.  </p>
<p>Haeling said the contract had the chance to trade up towards 101.00, 101.10. &quot;But I think it's going to run into resistance there and come back to test the downside.&quot;</p>
<p>He put support at Thursday's low of 100.63, then a further prop around 100.50, where the market started to break out to the upside in late April.</p>
<p>Geert-Jan Nikken, technical analyst at ABN-AMRO in Amsterdam, said if the market took out 100.63, it would target 100.40, the 61.8 percent retracement of the recent uptrend.</p>
<p>&quot;Every high tick for the moment is a new short opportunity,&quot; said Nikken.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market gets more bearish every day. I wouldn't be surprised if we test 100.40 today.&quot;</p>
<p>Nikken said weekly charts showed a potential head and shoulders pattern beginning to form, with a neckline at 99.00 and a potential target at 94.00.</p>
<p>&quot;On weekly charts, we can definitely see a reversal pattern beginning to form -- but we're not that far along yet,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>By 0720 GMT, September Euromarks were up one basis point at 96.73.</p>
