<p>A sharp drop in the value of the Canadian dollar is pressuring the Bank of Canada to abandon its &quot;made-in-Canada&quot; interest rate policy and match last week's rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>&quot;The overriding issue here is that the Fed has tightened, the Bank (of Canada) hasn't. The market is not willing to live with a widening in the differential in monetary policy between Canada and the U.S.,&quot; said Andrew Spence, a senior economist with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Canada's dollar fell to its lowest point in almost two years on Tuesday, weakening to as low as C$1.3902 (71.93 U.S. cents).</p>
<p>Analysts said that if the Canadian dollar weakened much further, the Bank of Canada would be forced to hike short-term rates in order to draw funds back into Canada and defend the currency, although domestic economic fundamentals might not warrant it, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the weakening trend were to continue, then the odds of the Bank of Canada raising rates sooner than it would probably like to, increases,&quot; said Ted Carmichael, head of research with J.P. Morgan Canada.</p>
<p>Analysts added another significant drop in the value of the currency would prompt a quick response from the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;From here the Bank (of Canada), like everyone else, is continuing to watch the currency,&quot; Carmichael said.</p>
<p>Dealers attributed the weakness in the Canadian dollar to last week's increase in the federal funds rate -- which U.S. commercial banks charge one other for overnight loans -- by 25 basis points to 5.5 percent.</p>
<p>The difference in interest rates hurts the Canadian dollar because it gives investors less incentive to invest in low-yielding Canadian short-term securities such as T-bills.</p>
<p>The U.S. rate hike was seen as a preliminary move by the Fed to control inflation amid an economy running at full capacity and unemployment of about five percent.</p>
<p>The Bank of Canada has not followed the U.S. rate hike because Canada's unemployment rate is just under 10 percent, the economy is performing well below capacity and there are few inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>In light of sluggish Canadian growth, the central bank last year began charting an independent monetary policy, cutting rates even as the Fed kept rates steady.</p>
<p>Canada's key bank rate, which is similar to the U.S. federal funds rate, has been at 3.25 percent since Nov. 8, 1996.</p>
