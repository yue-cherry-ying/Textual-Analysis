<headline>Jury selection starts in Cosby extortion case.</headline>

<p>By Gail Appleson, Law Correspondent</p>
<p>A woman on trial for allegedly trying to extort $40 million from Bill Cosby has passed a lie detector test showing she believes that the popular entertainer is her father, her lawyer said Monday.</p>
<p>Autumn Jackson, 22, is accused of claiming to be Cosby's illegitimate daughter and allegedly threatening to sell her story to a tabloid newspaper unless being paid by the actor.</p>
<p>Jury selection in her case began Monday and is scheduled to continue Tuesday in Manhattan federal court. Opening arguments could begin as early as Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>A key issue in the trial will be whether Jackson actually believes she is the popular entertainer's daughter and saw her actions as those of a child trying to exercise her rights rather than an extortionist.</p>
<p>After potential jurors were dismissed for the day, Jackson's lawyer, Robert Baum, revealed during a hearing that his client took a lie detector test Sunday that showed she believes Cosby is her father.</p>
<p>&quot;She has taken a lie detector test and passed,&quot; Robert Baum told U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones.</p>
<p>Baum asked the results be admitted into evidence in the trial but Jones did not immediately rule on the motion.</p>
<p>Cosby has admitted having an affair with Jackson's mother but has denied being her father. According to court papers, Jackson was one of many young people whose educational expenses Cosby paid for several years.</p>
<p>The case is being widely watched because the government plans to call Cosby as a witness, and he is expected to be questioned thoroughly about his relationship with Jackson and her mother.</p>
<p>The extortion plot could not have surfaced at a worse time for the Cosby family. The entertainer's only son, Ennis, 27, was shot to death in California Jan. 16, just two days before Jackson was charged. Authorities say the two incidents are unrelated.</p>
<p>Jurors have been required to fill out a questionnaire to try to determine if they might be biased against Jackson because of the timing of the case or because of Cosby's acting roles as likable characters.</p>
<p>For example, one question asks whether there is &quot;anything about the fact that Bill Cosby is alleged to be the intended victim of the crime charged&quot; that would prevent potential jurors from being fair and impartial.</p>
<p>Jackson and her alleged accomplice, Jose Medina, 51, are on trial on charges they tried to obtain money from Cosby by threatening to reveal to a tabloid newpaper Jackson's claim that Cosby is her out-of-wedlock father.</p>
<p>A third defendant, Boris Sabas, 42, also known as Boris Shmulevich, is on trial on charges that he helped Jackson and Medina by driving them to the airport and assisting in travel arrangements as part of the scheme.</p>
<p>The three are accused of conspiracy, extortion and violating a federal law that prohibits people from engaging in interstate commerce to commit certain offences. If convicted on all counts, they face possible prison terms of 12 years and fines of $750,000.</p>
<p>In January, Jackson's boyfriend, Antonay Williams, 26, of Perry, Fla., pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to one count of conspiracy and one count of aiding and abetting extortion. He told the court he helped Jackson and Medina in their scheme by threatening to disclose to the media that Cosby was her father.</p>
<p>The indictment charges that Jackson and Medina tried to pressure Cosby into paying her by contacting Cosby's corporate sponsors and the CBS television network, which broadcasts his comedy series &quot;Cosby.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Jackson also sent a letter to Cosby's lawyer Jan. 16 saying, &quot;I need monies and I need monies now&quot; and &quot;I don't want to do anything to harm my father in any way, if at all possible to avoid.&quot;</p>
<p>According to court papers, she sent the lawyer a copy of an unsigned agreement with The Globe, a supermarket tabloid, providing for payment for her story.</p>
<p>The indictment alleges she spoke to the lawyer Jan. 17 and demanded $40 million. She eventually agreed to refrain from publicising her claim in exchange for $24 million.</p>
<p>The two defendants flew to New York on the night of Jan. 17 and met with the lawyer the next morning. They were arrested after they signed a declaration saying that in return for the $24 million they agreed not to sell Jackson's story.</p>
