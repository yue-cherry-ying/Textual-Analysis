<title>PHILIPPINES: Manila threatens to close down Boracay resorts.</title>

<p>The Philippine environment department on Tuesday threatened to close 102 resorts on the country's best known beach in a row over pollution.</p>
<p>The resorts in Boracay were given 30 days to explain why they should not be shut for operating without environmental clearance, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) said.</p>
<p>Lying 450 km (280 miles) south of Manila, Boracay has clear blue waters and miles of powdery white sand and is considered by many as an &quot;island paradise&quot;.</p>
<p>But last week that image was soiled when DENR Secretary Victor Ramos declared Boracay &quot;a disaster area&quot;, saying human waste had leaked into the sea water, infecting it with coliform bacteria that causes diarrhoea, typhoid and skin diseases.</p>
<p>Ramos' announcement drew sharp protests from tourism officials who said the beach was as pristine as ever.</p>
<p>Boracay has since become the centre of a controversy, with newspaper columnists taking sides, some saying Ramos was right in warning people of the health risks at Boracay and others saying it would hit tourist arrivals in the country.</p>
<p>The DENR said show-cause notices would be served on another 100 establishments in the next few days.</p>
<p>There are more than 200 resorts in Boracay.</p>
<p>More than 200,000 foreign tourists visited Boracay last year.</p>
