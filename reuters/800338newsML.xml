<p>European stock markets began hesitantly on Thursday, adjusting to Wall Street's rollercoaster ride on Wednesday and preparing for another raft of U.S. economic indicators this afternoon.</p>
<p>London started modestly firmer, Paris was flat, while Frankfurt fell.</p>
<p>The dollar was a touch stronger, rebounding against the mark after Wednesday's three-pfennig tumble as market expectations of higher German rates accelerated, though it was still below levels from late European trade on Wednesday.</p>
<p>London's FTSE-100 index of leading shares was 20 points higher, doubly relieved that the market had held above the psychological 5,000 points on Wednesday and that Wall Street's decline was just 33 points, ending at 7,928.32, after having been 75 points lower at one time.</p>
<p>&quot;Wall Street could have been a lot worse,&quot; said one trader. &quot;It was all over the place during the session but it will create nervousness again as we approach the opening today.&quot;</p>
<p>After more benign than expected U.S. Producer Prices for July released on Wednesday, investors were awaiting a confirmation of the trend in July Consumer Prices, due at 1230 GMT and expected to show a 0.2 percent rise.</p>
<p>The flood of data includes industrial production and business inventories for June, July real earnings and money supply figures.</p>
<p>The reports will be among the data considered by Federal Reserve policymakers next week when they decide whether economic growth is strong enough to require a rise in interest rates in a pre-emptive move against inflation.</p>
<p>German shares fell 1.20 percent in early trade, catching up with the declines on Wall Street late on Wednesday, and some dealers expected a further decline in thin and nervous trade in the lead-up to the U.S. data.</p>
<p>In Paris, shares began a shade higher after a 2.5 percent drop on Wednesday, but then turned lower. Dealers expect any upside to be limited by the end of the day as investors square their books and pack up for the mid-August long weekend.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange dealers said longer term sentiment on the dollar remains positive, but ponder whether the dollar will have to shed more ground before accelerating higher again.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a small rebound this morning but the market is leaning a bit more towards the downside in the short term,&quot; said Paul Meggyesi, senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>The pound, whose recent burst of strength has hit British exporters, fell below 2.90 marks as the German currency rose, but sterling later rebounded.</p>
<p>&quot;The main theme in continental Europe is German rate fears...That should give the deutschemark some support,&quot; said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International.</p>
<p>But the mark was off peaks scaled on Wednesday after the Bundesbank warned the pace of inflation had picked up and amid fresh talk of a delay to European economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 1.8325 marks and 116.36 yen, compared with 1.8547 and 115.80 in late European trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1000 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index was up 18.6 points at 5,022.2.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The DAX index was down 49.56 points at 4,228.92</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 index was down 6.44 at 2,917.60.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was $1.10 an ounce firmer in London at $327.30. Silver was down two cents at $4.49.</p>
