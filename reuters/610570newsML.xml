<p>Tokyo naphtha prices edged higher in afternoon trade on Friday, taking support from the firmer European naphtha market, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There were no fresh incentives in today's market except for stronger naphtha in Europe,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Open-spec naphtha for second-half July was assessed at $216.50/217.50 per tonne, up from Thursday's $216.00/217.25.</p>
<p>First-half August was quoted at $217.50/218.50. It was rumoured to have been traded at $217.25 on Thursday.</p>
<p>In spreads, the near-term contango continued to narrow, with 2nd-half July/2nd-half August quoted at minus $1.00/even.  </p>
<p>It was traded at minus $1.50 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Spreads from first-half August onwards have turned into backwardation, traders said.</p>
<p>In the low sulphur waxy residue (LSWR) market, Japan will import at least three cargoes, or about 1.2 million barrels, of Indonesian cargoes for June delivery, traders said.</p>
<p>Offer levels for June cargoes were nominally assessed at 30 to 40 cents per barrel over the Pertamina formula, against bids at the formula plus about 20 cents.</p>
