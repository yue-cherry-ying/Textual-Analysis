<title>USA: House panel cuts regional development bank funds.</title>
<headline>House panel cuts regional development bank funds.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>A House panel voted Thursday to approve the administration's request for funding of the International Development Association but sharply reduced funding for regional development banks.</p>
<p>The House Banking subcommittee approved an authorization bill for international financial institutions that allocated $1.6 billion for the 11th replenishment of IDA, an arm of the World Bank that lends to poor countries.</p>
<p>But the bill, responding to budgetary pressures, cut total outlays by 27 percent, holding the regional banks to fiscal year 1988 levels.  </p>
<p>It set the contribution to the Asian Development Bank at $100 million, compared with the administration request for $400 million.  Funds for the Inter-American Development Bank were capped at $25.6 million for paid-in shares -- a third of the administration's request -- and $4.5 billion for callable, or reserve, capital.</p>
<p>The bill authorized $7 million for a contribution to an International Monetary Fund facility that lends to poor countries compared with the administration's $75 million request.  </p>
<p>It also authorized $35.8 million for an increase in paid-in capital for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and $1 billion in callable capital.  The administration had asked for $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>The bill now goes to a House Appropriations panel which has to provide the funds.</p>
<p>Subcommittee chairman Michael Castle, a Delaware Republican, said the full funding of IDA was a symbol of U.S. willingness to meet its international obligations but said budgetary pressures required holding down levels of contributions to the regional banks.  </p>
<p>The subcommittee approved an amendment to the bill proposed by Democrat Barney Frank of Massachusetts calling on the Treasury Department to instruct U.S. directors at the IMF and World Bank to provide relief for heavily indebted poor countries primarily through grants rather than extended-term debt and to provide interim relief of financing for countries before they have completed their economic reforms.</p>
<p>Frank said the provision paralleled what the United States was already doing and described it as linking social responsibility to economic discipline.</p>
