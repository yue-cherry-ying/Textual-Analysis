<p>Leftist rebels killed at least eight people, including four policemen, in two separate attacks Friday in rural Colombia, authorities said.</p>
<p>National Police spokesmen said the police were killed in a pre-dawn attack by about 100 Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels on the town of Barbacoas in a rural area of southwest Narino province.</p>
<p>The town's police headquarters was destroyed by rebels using rocket-propelled grenades and dynamite, the spokesmen said. He added that two policemen were wounded and two others were listed as missing in the aftermath of the attack.</p>
<p>Before withdrawing from the town the rebels assaulted Barbacoas' jail and freed a dozen prisoners, the police spokesmen said.</p>
<p>In other developments, police said FARC rebels shot and killed four peasants after stealing a four-wheel drive vehicle near the town of Anapoima, a weekend resort located just 30 miles (50 km) southwest of the capital.</p>
<p>Police said the peasants may have been targeted as suspected army collaborators.</p>
<p>A report issued in March said 4,617 policemen had been killed in Colombia since 1990, more than anywhere else in the world. Most died in attacks by leftist guerrillas led by the FARC, the country's biggest rebel group, and the smaller National Liberation Army.</p>
