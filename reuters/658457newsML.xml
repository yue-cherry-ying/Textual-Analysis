<p>British Royal Marines have been temporarily banned from training on Cyprus after three of them were arrested naked at a bar on the island last month, a British army spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The commandant-general, Royal Marines, has stated members of the Royal Marines will not exercise or train in Cyprus in the short term in view of local sensitivities, to ensure that there is no repeat of an incident of that kind and to understand the requirement of good conduct,&quot; bases spokesman Mervyn Wynne-Jones told Reuters.</p>
<p>The three men, on Cyprus for &quot;adventurous training,&quot; were found naked by local police in the holiday resort of Ayia Napa on May 21 sitting outside a pub and singing &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;.</p>
<p>The servicemen, due to leave the island the following day, were charged with indecency and each fined 150 pounds ($295) by a civilian court.</p>
<p>Some 3,500 British troops are stationed on two military bases Britain has retained in the former colony since independence in 1960.</p>
<p>About 3,500 more troops, including the Royal Marines, come to Cyprus each year for training.</p>
