<p>The government cross-examined Staples Inc. CEO Tom Stemberg in U.S. District Court Thursday, seeking to undermine the office supply superstore chain's claims that it will cut prices if it merges with Office Depot.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission contends that if the two companies are permitted to complete their $4 billion merger they will have the power to raise prices on consumable office supplies, such as staples, file folders, pencils and paper.</p>
<p>During testimony, Stemberg contended that the merger would lead to lower prices.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the merger will allow us to ratchet down our prices to a whole new scale,&quot; he said, citing lower administrative costs and other efficiencies.</p>
<p>&quot;If we ever were to lose our low price edge, which is the reason people come to us, we'd be in a lot of trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>But the FTC used internal documents to try and tell a different story.</p>
<p>Shira Goodman, senior vice president of integration, acknowledged during her cross examination that a budget document for Staples' fiscal 1997 showed that in the area of sales to large firms -- such as International Business Machines Corp. and PepsiCo Inc. -- one goal was &quot;to increase prices with existing customers when possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Employees now with Office Depot would also be charged more for health care costs, she acknowledged, saving the merged company $456,000. Although she did not mention a specific time frame, accompanying documents suggest the savings would be accomplished in one year's time.</p>
<p>Stemberg and his attorneys have contended that one reason prices would continue to go down is that all kinds of other stores -- such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. -- would force them to keep prices down.</p>
<p>The FTC sought to show that Staples responds mainly to Office Depot and the third player in the superstore competition, OfficeMax.</p>
<p>Staples, based in Westborough, Mass., segregates its stores into dozens of &quot;pricing zones,&quot; including &quot;Office Depot&quot; zones.</p>
<p>Stemberg was asked if it were true that &quot;each and every one of the (Staples stores) in Office Depot zones is cheaper than the non-competitive zones.&quot;</p>
<p>Replied Stemberg: &quot;As a general statement, that would be fair.&quot;</p>
<p>During his cross-examination, Stemberg answered many questions with reluctance, often saying that he was unable to recall information.</p>
<p>The hearing was in its fourth of five days, and District Judge Thomas Hogan took the unusual step of running his court from about 9:30 a.m. until 7:30 p.m., with breaks. Usually his court ends no later than 4:45 p.m.</p>
<p>Friday is the final day of the hearing. Later both sides will offer closing arguments and written materials. Hogan has said he will rule by mid-June on whether to grant a preliminary injunction to the government, which would halt the merger until further proceedings.</p>
<p>But Stemberg said earlier this week that he would give up on the merger if the judge grants the preliminary injunctions.</p>
