<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian Commodities Roundup - Aug 15.</title>
<headline>Australian Commodities Roundup - Aug 15.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-08-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Gold prices fell sharply, and copper slumped, although most other base metals ended higher. Crude oil was little changed and wheat prices closed lower, while the CRB index was down 2.34 at 240.99.</p>
<p>METALS - Aluminium backwardations flared considerably ahead of next Monday, when the August &quot;third Wednesday&quot; date will be traded. Tightness has built up on this date, and Thursday saw both borrowing of metal and buying outright of cash as shorts scrambled to cover.</p>
<p>August/one day was at a $11 backwardation, August/week at $17, while the cash/threes spread moved out to near $20 at one stage, having been level earlier this week.</p>
<p>This underpinned the forward market, which shrugged off another stock increase. Three months traded as high as $1,720 before closing at $1,701, up, $5.50 from Wednesday's kerb.</p>
<p>Copper slumped after the spread cracked and cash/threes traded in from $17 to near a $7 backwardation by the close. At the start of the week there was a $20 backwardation.</p>
<p>Prices sagged on commission house selling on the kerb, but managed to stay within the market's current technical range. However, it appears that the downside is now being targeted, traders said. Last trade was at $2,271, down $16 from Thursday. Under $2,260 the market is vulnerable to sell-stops.</p>
<p>Zinc prices were firmer, boosted by September date tightness, with the market comfortably above the $1,500 level for most of the session.</p>
<p>The 2,400-tonne fall in stocks bolstered the market, especially after talk earlier this week of 20,000 tonnes heading to Singapore. Instead, stocks are so far dribbling into Singapore, with a net rise of only 1,525 tonnes on Thursday.</p>
<p>Nickel trading was volatile as the market staged a technical rally. On Wednesday, prices hit $6,520 a tonne, the lowest since the start of the year. But the sell-off left the market short, inducing a strong bounce today, with last business at $6,710, up $190. Once the correction has passed, further declines are likely, with stocks rising.</p>
<p>Lead prices tended to edge up, although the pace of trading was slow and the market remains vulnerable to a test of the $600 level again. Last trade was at $610, up $5.</p>
<p>Tin trading was equally slow, but prices were steadier throughout. The market ended at $$5,420, up $10. Alloy was quietly stable, closing at a little changed $1,507/12 a tonne.</p>
<p>GOLD</p>
<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures ended sharply lower on good volume, after the U.S. dollar firmed, along with U.S. stocks and bonds, following more benign U.S. economic data. COMEX December gold ended down $2.70 at $328.00 an ounce, after resistance at the top of the month $320-335 month-old range held once more. Estimated total COMEX gold volume was 45,000 lots. In the bullion market, spot gold ended quoted $324.20/70 an ounce, compared to the London Thursday afternoon fix at $326.15 and the New York close Wednesday around $326.90/40.</p>
<p>OIL</p>
<p>NYMEX crude moved off its session highs and hovered about unchanged in afternoon trade as its fortunes were hitched to gasoline which gave up strong early gains amid a consolidation, dealers said. September crude was up six cents a barrel at $20.25. September gasoline stood 0.52 cent higher at 66.60 cents a gallon while September heating oil was up 0.21 cent at 56.25 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>WHEAT</p>
<p>CBOT soft red winter wheat futures closed lower on spillover from Tuesday's USDA forecast for 1997 U.S. wheat production which was well above expectations and on a technical slide, traders said. CBOT soft red winter wheat closed 4-1/2 to seven cents lower, with September down six at $3.55-1/4 a bushel. Although U.S. export sales remain strong, the large supply of wheat in the U.S. diminished concerns about wheat end-users having difficulty originating their mill and export needs.</p>
<p>SUGAR</p>
<p>CSCE world sugar futures closed higher on the day but prices remained stuck in their recent trading range with no fundamental news to inspire any significant movement. October rose 0.06 cent on the day to 11.55 cents a lb, having ranged from 11.57 to 11.48 cents. The rest of the board settled 0.01 to 0.06 cent firmer.  </p>
