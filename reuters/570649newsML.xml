<p>Irish inflation was unchanged in April and economists said price pressures were likely to remain subdued this year, with Dublin firmly on course to meet the Maastricht entry criteria for the single European currency.</p>
<p>Experts hailed the figure and predicted annual inflation was likely to remain below two percent this year but warned the punt's recent slide against sterling could darken the outlook for next year.</p>
<p>Ireland's Central Statistics Office said consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in April, the same monthly increase as in March. Prices were up 1.4 percent in the 11 months to April. True annual figures are unavailable because monthly records have only been published from this year.</p>
<p>&quot;This was marginally better month-on-month than expected. The 11-month rate was in the belt we forecast and no surprise...We are in good shape and in the coming months we would probably see inflation staying near 1.5 percent,&quot; Dermot O'Brien, economist at NCB Stockbrokers, said.</p>
<p>The largest gainer among the CPI's components was food, with prices rising 0.4 percent in April from March. Clothes prices rose by 0.1 percent while fuel and durable household goods prices dropped.</p>
<p>But O'Brien said there were no signs of systemic upwards pressure on the index and said the EU Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, used for intra-EU comparisons, was also benign.</p>
<p>&quot;The harmonised figure on the EU basis is 1.3 percent on an 11-month comparison, which probably amounts to around 1.6 percent on a 12-month basis -- very comfortably within the Maastricht limits,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Padhraic Garvey, economist at Riada stockbrokers in Dublin, said it was encouraging that household goods and durable goods prices in particular had not been affected by the punt's recent weakness, given the high import content of those categories.</p>
<p>But he warned the Irish currency's frailty could feed through to consumer prices in six or nine months.</p>
<p>The Irish currency hit a five-year low against sterling last week after Ireland's central bank indicated it would not act to shore up the currency. Attention immediately focused on Ireland's low-inflation record.</p>
<p>&quot;For 1997, our forecast is for inflation below two percent. We would however be a little more concerned looking into next year and wouldn't be surprised by inflation possibly up to 2.5 percent or higher,&quot; Garvey said.</p>
<p>He said the currency effect could &quot;potentially&quot; open up an inflation gap between Ireland and Britain. He noted that Ireland's record of inflation below Britain was associated in the last few years with the punt's appreciation against sterling.</p>
