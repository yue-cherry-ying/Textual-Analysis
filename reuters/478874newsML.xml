<p>China on Tuesday warned the United States not to interfere in Beijing's dealings with its island rival Taiwan, saying Washington should desist from large-scale high-technology weapons sales to Taipei.</p>
<p>Officials in Taiwan declined to comment on reports they were set to stiffen the island's already formidable defences by buying U.S. missiles and advanced helicopter gunships, but said they welcomed continued arms sales from the United States.</p>
<p>Exports of sophisticated U.S. weaponry were bolstering pro-independence sentiment in Taiwan and should be stopped, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that the United States will take the stance of not interfering in China's internal affairs on the Taiwan issue, and even more that it will not make large sales of advanced weapons,&quot; Shen told a news briefing in Beijing.</p>
<p>Responding to recent remarks by visiting U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich that Washington would defend Taiwan from mainland attack, Shen said the island was a purely domestic matter.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue of Taiwan between China and the United States is just one issue, that of non-interference in China's internal affairs,&quot; Shen said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are always for peaceful reunification with Taiwan, but if a situation of independence occurs in Taiwan or foreign forces interfere in Taiwan, then we will take other necessary measures,&quot; he said but gave no details.</p>
<p>Beijing has considered Taiwan a rebel province since defeated Nationalist forces fled there in 1949 and has vowed to invade the island if it ever declares formal independence.</p>
<p>White House officials have sought to play down remarks by Gingrich, who was quoted during a three-day visit that ended on Sunday as telling Chinese officials here that the United States would defend Taiwan against such an attack.</p>
<p>Washington has said it would be gravely concerned by any attack against newly-democratic Taipei and has not shirked from displays of military muscle on the island's behalf.</p>
<p>When China carried out war games and missile tests off Taiwan in the run-up to the island's first presidential elections in March last year, Washington sent two aircraft carrier battlegroups to monitor the situation.</p>
<p>Differences over Taiwan have long been a major irritant to the sensitive Sino-U.S. relationship, already battered by disputes over human rights, copyright piracy and trade.</p>
<p>Local newspapers have reported that the United States has agreed to sell 54 AGM-84A Harpoon missiles and 21 Super Cobra attack helicopters to Taiwan, a deal that would almost certainly further infuriate Beijing.</p>
<p>Officials of the island's military, which on Tuesday fired two U.S. Hawk missiles offshore in a test seen as bolstering anti-China defences, declined to confirm the reports.</p>
<p>But Taiwan military spokesman Kung Fan-ting said the island welcomed further arms sales from the U.S.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally, we would not comment on any ongoing arms deal, but for any deal which can help increase our defence needs or maintain peace and stability in a region, we are pleased to have it struck,&quot; Kung said.</p>
<p>Arms shipments by Washington to Taiwan were supporting dreams of independence on the island and should not be repeated, said Chinese spokesman Shen.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently the large amount of U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan to a certain degree supports and connives at Taiwan separatist forces and hampers the process of peaceful reunification,&quot; he said.</p>
