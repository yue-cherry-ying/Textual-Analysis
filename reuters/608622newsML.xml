<p>Victorious rebel leader Laurent Kabila has ignored calls to work with Zaire's veteran opposition politician Etienne Tshisekedi, abolishing the post of prime minister and creating a presidential regime.</p>
<p>Announcing an incomplete transitional government late on Thursday after five hours of closed-door talks with aides, Kabila excluded the man who symbolised resistance to ousted President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no prime minister. It is a presidential regime,&quot; Gaetan Kakudji of Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL) told a Kinshasa news conference early on Friday.</p>
<p>Kabila crowned his seven-month rebellion on May 17 when his forces entered Kinshasa and he proclaimed himself president.</p>
<p>Mobutu, ailing with cancer, fled into exile after 32 years in power. Kabila immediately baptised the mineral-rich country the Democratic Republic of Congo, its name at independence from Belgium in 1960.</p>
<p>As soon as he took charge of Africa's third biggest country, Kabila was under intense domestic pressure and some Western encouragement to appoint Tshisekedi to a key post such as the prime ministership.</p>
<p>He brushed aside those calls despite warnings that Tshisekedi remains a hugely popular political figure in the capital of five million.</p>
<p>Kakudji, deputy secretary-general of the Alliance, replied firmly when pressed by reporters about Tshisekedi's exclusion.</p>
<p>&quot;You must not have a fixed idea. This country has many sons and daughters who are sufficiently capable of assuming political responsibilities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kabila has been cloistered in the prime minister's residence since arriving in Kinshasa unannounced on Tuesday night. He has not addressed the nation of 40 million or made any public appearances since then.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi's fanatical followers have been campaigning for a role for their hero, even threatening street marches if he were not made prime minister in Kabila's government.</p>
<p>&quot;We put Mobutu in a political ambulance and the ADFL took him to the cemetery,&quot; declared Tshisekedi's close associate Joseph Olengankoy on Thursday.</p>
<p>There was no immediate reaction from Tshisekedi's camp to his exclusion from the government.</p>
<p>Foreign reaction will be closely watched.</p>
<p>The European Union said before Thursday's cabinet news it hoped for a broad-based transitional government.</p>
<p>Western powers have cautiously voiced backing for Kabila, linking full recognition and economic aid to progress on broad-based democratic rule.</p>
<p>The 13 ministers named on Thursday included seven from the Alliance with top jobs going to Mwenze Kongolo at Interior, Bizima Karaka at Foreign Affairs and Mawapanga Mwana-Nanga at Finance.</p>
<p>The six non-Alliance ministers included a major defector from Tshisekedi's UDPS party -- Paul Bandoma was given the Agriculture portfolio.</p>
<p>Kabila's spokesmen said remaining posts, about seven, would be filled soon.</p>
<p>In another strike at Tshisekedi's vision of the future, Kakudji told reporters the nation's only fundamental text was the Alliance's own statutes.</p>
<p>This meant Kabila was ignoring the transitional constitution -- creating a prime ministerial system -- laboriously drafted during the past seven years of failed civilian efforts to oust Mobutu.</p>
<p>Asked whether the Alliance would permit political parties to function, Kakudji replied: &quot;The Alliance is an open structure which groups all tendencies.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the country's borders, closed since May 17, would remain shut &quot;for as long as necessary for your security&quot;.</p>
<p>A group of foreign journalists was prevented on Thursday from making the five-minute river crossing to neighbouring Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>The Alliance has steadily built up its military force in the capital. Columns of troops entered Mobutu's former presidential guard barracks on Thursday.</p>
<p>State television announced the Alliance had captured the country's only seaport of Matadi on the Atlantic near Angola.</p>
<p>Only a few pockets of territory are now thought to be outside Alliance control.</p>
<p>The guerrillas who began their long trek across Zaire from the shores of Lake Kivu last October took Matadi &quot;without meeting any resistance&quot;, television said. It did not say when.</p>
<p>Many former soldiers loyal to Mobutu were reported fleeing towards Matadi. Officials in Angola said on Thursday about 25,000 people, including armed men, had crossed over from Kabila's Congo.</p>
