<p>Roelf Meyer, co-architect of South Africa's post-apartheid constitution, quit parliament on Thursday with a standing ovation from his former foes and a sullen silence from the National Party he served for 18 years.</p>
<p>&quot;For all of us, the past seven years have been a wondrous and wonderful time,&quot; he said in a reference to the transition from apartheid since the white-led National Party repudiated apartheid in February 1990.</p>
<p>Meyer, then chief negotiator for the National Party (NP), and African National Congress (ANC) chief negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa dominated multi-party negotiations on a transition from white rule to democracy in 1994.</p>
<p>After the ANC runaway victory in the 1994 elections, Meyer and Ramaphosa headed a Constitutional Assembly that hammered out a final blueprint for democracy implemented in February.</p>
<p>Meyer, 49, fell out with former president F.W. de Klerk and NP conservatives earlier this month over his recommendation that the party should be prepared to sacrifice its identity to a new alliance capable of attracting significant black support.</p>
<p>He resigned two weeks ago after de Klerk sacked him from a task group exploring political options for the party that invented apartheid in 1948 and then repudiated it in 1990.</p>
<p>ANC members cheered and gave Meyer a standing ovation when he finished his farewell address to the National Assembly. NP leader de Klerk was not present when he spoke and unsmiling party members stayed sitting as Meyer left the chamber.</p>
