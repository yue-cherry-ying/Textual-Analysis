<p>The Tokyo stock market's benchmark index climbed above the 20,000 level on Friday, as steadiness in currencies encouraged investors to resume buying of blue chips which had been sold off recently, brokers said. They said, however, that trade was quiet ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p>The Nikkei average rose 131.61 points or 0.66 percent to end at 20,009.00. It June futures rose 180 points to 20,030.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade was rather slow but blue chips revived as the yen seems to have stabilised,&quot; said Tadahiro Kamogawa, Yamaichi Securities general manager. &quot;Domestic-demand related sectors such as real estate were firm, contributing to the gains.&quot;  </p>
<p>Turnover fell to 368 million shares from 407 million on Thursday as investors were reluctant to build up fresh positions ahead of the weekend. Winners beat losers 602 to 483, while 169 issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>The yen, which strengthened past 112 to the dollar at one point earlier in the week in Tokyo, hovered around 115-116 to the dollar during the stock trading session.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a growing belief in the market that the dollar has hit a low,&quot; said a senior broker at a second-tier Japanese securities house.  </p>
<p>Car makers were driven higher and stood at the top of the gaining sectors list. Toyota Motor Corp added 80 yen to 3,420. Honda Motor Co Ltd leapt 220 yen to 3,530.</p>
<p>Mazda Motor Corp also jumped, aided by solid earnings. It closed 16 yen higher at 357.</p>
<p>Automobiles were followed by precision instruments, real estate and electrical equipment.</p>
<p>Realtors  0#REA.T were helped by a perception that rents for commercial buildings around central Tokyo were likely to start recovering, brokers said.</p>
<p>Tokyu Land Corp added 36 yen to end at 502.  </p>
<p>Mitsui Fudosan Co Ltd rose 40 yen to finish at 1,490. Mitsubishi Estate Co Ltd added 30 yen to 1,630.</p>
<p>High-tech and electricals were also aided by the stability of currencies. Sony Corp added 280 yen to reach 9,680 and top printer maker Canon Inc rose 130 yen to reach 2,830 by the close. Canon was the fourth most heavily traded issue on the first section of the Tokyo bourse with a turnover of 3.93 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;On a valuation basis, high-techs are really the only issues investors can buy with confidence in the long term,&quot; said Shinichi Ishikawa, Credit Lyonnais Securities strategist.  </p>
<p>&quot;Once currencies settle down, buying in the sector should pick up and provide the indices with support,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Retreating sectors were headed by paper/pulp, non-ferrous metals, gas and mining.</p>
<p>Investors continued to pay close attention to the release of corporate earnings which peaked on Friday. Sumitomo Precision Products Co Ltd fell on a gloomy forecast for 1997/98 earnings, losing 33 yen to 744.</p>
<p>As the Nikkei average ended on a positive note, brokers said that the average would probably consolidate near 20,000 or try to re-capture the 20,500 level in the coming week.  </p>
<p>&quot;Eyes will continue to be fixed on currencies for signs of turbulence,&quot; a broker at a &quot;Big Four&quot; brokerage said. &quot;If the yen does not strengthen or move dramatically, the Nikkei average could attempt to end above the recent closing high near 20,500.&quot;</p>
<p>In other indices, TOPIX added 12.96 points or 0.88 percent to close at 1,489.89. The Nikkei 300 rose 3.04 points or 1.07 percent to end at 288.07.</p>
<p>The second section index was up 11.94 points or 0.68 percent at 1,758.77. Turnover was 10.05 million shares against 11.33 million on the previous day.  </p>
<p>The over-the-counter index slipped 2.08 points or 0.18 percent to stand at 1,180.96 by late afternoon Tokyo.</p>
