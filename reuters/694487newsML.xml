<p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, Taiwan's largest semiconductor maker, said on Saturday it had issued US$300 million in European convertible bonds to finance the company's future expansion.  </p>
<p>&quot;We issue the bonds mainly to raise funds needed to install the facilities of our fourth and fifth wafer fabrication plants,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Taiwan Semiconductor has embarked on an ambitious expansion. In mid-April, it announced it would build six advanced wafer-fabrication plants as part of a T$400 billion investment at southern Taiwan's Tainan Science-based Industrial Park.</p>
<p>The bonds were scheduled to be listed at the stock exchange in Luxembourg from July 3, and the company granted the underwriter an over-allotment option of up to US$50 million, it said.  </p>
<p>The five-year bonds were over-subscribed 700 percent during a five-day road show, U.S.-based underwriter Goldman Sachs said.</p>
<p>The bonds, one of the largest issues ever made by a local company, can be redeemed at maturity together with the principal plus interest of 36.23 percent.</p>
<p>The conversion price is T$144, which is a premium of 20 percent of the common share closing price as of June 26, 1997, the statement said.  </p>
<p>Taiwan Semiconductor is the world's largest custom maker of integrated circuits.</p>
<p>The firm's foundry business does not design and sell its own IC products, but custom makes them according to customers' applications.</p>
