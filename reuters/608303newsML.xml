<p>U.S. stocks guarded most  early session gains by midday on Friday, as bonds held steady and smaller-capitalization issues pushed higher, but trading lost steam going into a three-day U.S. holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The Dow industrial average was trading up around 38 points to 7296, after an initial 50-point bounce prompted the New York Stock Exchange to set index-arbitrage curbs 10 minutes after the market opened.</p>
<p>But the stock market lacked momentum, with a Memorial Day holiday on Monday and an early close in the bond market today.  </p>
<p>&quot;People are going to take off for the long weekend and things are really going to quiet down,&quot; John Gardner, chief equity strategist for Van Lieu Capital Corp, said.</p>
<p>The bond market, which has recently provided direction to stocks, would shut at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT and traders said people were squaring up equity positions early in the day.</p>
<p>This might have contributed to the stock market's early-morning rise, traders said.</p>
<p>Other traders said share prices took support from bonds, as the benchmark 30-year Treasury stayed near but did not go above a critical seven percent yield.  </p>
<p>Analysts had said if yields rose above seven percent, money managers would move funds from stocks to bond and cash.</p>
<p>Recent and enduring strength in shares of smaller-capitalized companies also lent some optimism to broader equity markets, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization issues traded up 1.68 points to 373 and the Nasdaq composite index was up five points to 1378. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was also up five points to 841.</p>
<p>Graham Tanaka, president of Tanaka Capital Management, said he also saw interest in defensive and technology stocks.  </p>
<p>&quot;Blue chips are coming back refreshed, after a pause,&quot; said Tanaka, who forecast the bull stock market continuing. &quot;We're seeing interest in drug stocks and defensive shares. Technology and smaller-cap stocks are also doing well.&quot;</p>
<p>But other analysts were hesitant to read too much good news into today's price rise.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just a dead day,&quot; John Cleland, chief investment strategist at Security Benefit Group of Cos, said.</p>
<p>Among particular issues, Westinghouse Electric led the list of active issues, after its CBS unit said Peter Lund, president of its CBS television and cable group, resigned.  </p>
<p>Its shares were up two points at 19.</p>
<p>Tobacco stocks were also active, following a report which indicated tobacco talks were making progress on several key regulatory and legal issues, even though many issues remained to be settled.</p>
<p>Philip Morris was up 1/4 point at 45 while RJ Reynolds was up 1-1/4 to 33-1/8.</p>
<p>Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore told Reuters a settlement of litigation against the tobacco industry was not imminent. But he said he hoped to know within two weeks whether a settlement could be reached.</p>
