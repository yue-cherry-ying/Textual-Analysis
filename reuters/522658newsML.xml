<p>Albania's would-be king was due to to make a pilgrimage on Sunday to the birthplace of his father, the Balkan country's last monarch, in the remote mountain village of Burajet north of Tirana.</p>
<p>King Leka I, as he styles himself, has vowed to help to restore order to a country which plunged into near anarchy after popular, but shaky, investement schemes collapsed in January.</p>
<p>Leka, who returned to Albania a week ago after 58 years in exile, was two days old when his father, King Zog, fled with his family in 1939 ahead of invading Italian fascists.</p>
<p>He capped his return by holding talks with Prime Minister Bashkim Fino on Saturday after a historic visit to his rival head of state, President Sali Berisha, on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that you will be a factor for peace,&quot; Fino told him. &quot;We have a moral responsibility to you after you were not allowed to come to your homeland because of the communist laws.&quot;</p>
<p>Leka, who towers over most Albanians at 2.04 metres (six feet eight inches), has been warmly welcomed by adoring crowds and he has also received considerable coverage on Albania's state-run television.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that my presence here will not be an obstacle,&quot; he told Fino. &quot;On the contrary, I think it will serve the efforts to achieve peace. I will start meeting the people of Albania soon. I will listen to them and their concerns.&quot;</p>
<p>Berisha told Leka, who lived in exile in South Africa  with his wife and 15-year-old son, that he would allow Albanians to vote in a referendum on whether they wanted to restore the monarchy.</p>
<p>Berisha was less accommodating when Leka tried to visit Albania in 1993 and was unceremoniously tossed out within hours after authorities declared that his passport, marked &quot;Kingdom of Albania&quot;, was invalid.</p>
<p>Leka, who believes he is the legal leader of Albania based on a constitution adopted in 1928, says a monarchy could help to unify Albania after two months of anarchic violence that claimed about 300 lives.</p>
<p>He has never been to Burajet, a farming village known for its sheep and grapes. Several villas there that belonged to his father, an ardent opponent of Serbs, were burned by Serb forces just before World War One began.</p>
<p>United of a multinational security force charged with safeguarded aid supplies continued to arrive in Albania on Saturday as relief agencies distributed emergency food and medicines to hospitals and orphanages.</p>
<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delivered aid to a psychiatric and general hospital and three orphanages in the rebel-held port of Vlore 150 km (90 miles) south of Tirana.</p>
<p>Extremely thin patients at Vlore's psychiatric hospital to unload bags of rice, flour and soap from a truck. Many patients had no shoes and socks and wore torn clothes.</p>
<p>&quot;These patients have received very little food in recent weeks,&quot; said Red Cross officer Barbara Jaggi.</p>
<p>Supplies of food and medicines to hospitals, orphanages and homes for the handicapped and elderly were severely disrupted by the turmoil in Europe's poorest nation.</p>
<p>The first consignment of United Nations food for the poor and needy was handed out to a flotilla of cars at the port of Durres, 40 km (25 miles) west of Tirana, for transport across the country.</p>
<p>&quot;All of our food was stolen six weeks ago,&quot; said Mark Nyberg, collecting supplies for an orphanage in Vlore. &quot;Our concern is not so much getting it to Vlore, but keeping it once we get there. The situation is far from stable.&quot;</p>
<p>Italian military spokesman Paolo Bianchi said he expected that the mulitnational security force would start escorting aid convoys from next Thursday.</p>
<p>He said the immediate priority of troops was to secure the roads and plan routes in cooperation with relief agencies.</p>
