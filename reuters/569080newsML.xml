<p>Russia's strategic Far Eastern port of Vladivostok, crushed by power cuts and fossil fuel shortages, declared a state of emergency on Thursday and officials said the city could be plunged into darkness within days.</p>
<p>Deputy Mayor Yuri Kopylov, head of the civic emergency committee, told Reuters that the city's half a million residents were receiving just six hours of electricity a day.</p>
<p>The water system was working irregularly because of a lack of power for pumps, and many local trains and trams could soon grind to a halt, he added.</p>
<p>Vladivostok has struggled in post-Soviet years as the navy that once dominated the economy in the formerly closed Pacific rim city lost its pre-eminence.</p>
<p>Workers across the region have not been paid for months -- part of a web of non-payments strangling local economies across Russia -- and Kopylov said a miners' strike from May 1 had all but imobilised most power plants.</p>
<p>He said only one Vladivostok power station was operating normally, but it had just two days' supply of coal, after which the entire city could lose the last of its electricity.</p>
<p>Alexander Gelbakh, spokesman for regional power utility Dalenergo, said the company was unable to provide power because of a spiral of debts.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't conclude agreements to get coal from other regions as all suppliers are demanding payment in advance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said Dalenergo owed suppliers about one trillion roubles ($174 million). But customers owed it 2.5 trillion roubles ($435 million), including 800 billion ($140 million), from the Vladivostok city administration, the firm's biggest debtor.</p>
<p>Mayor Viktor Cherepkov blamed Dalenergo leadership for the crisis, saying they had refused to accept coal and fuel oil from outside sources. Many locals appear to side with the mayor.</p>
<p>Kopylov said the regional coal company had enough supplies to provide regular power to the area, but that city and regional officials did not have the money to pay striking miners.</p>
<p>Local officials, who have often said they want the region to develop without Moscow's interference, have turned to the federal government for help.</p>
<p>Kopylov said city officials had left for Moscow on Thursday and would meet First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, who is also Russia's fuel and energy minister.</p>
<p>Russian offices are closed on Friday for a holiday to mark the anniversary of the end of World War Two and Nemstov's office said no meeting was planned in the coming days.</p>
<p>The emergency rules allow civil defence officials to take control of facilities requiring round-the-clock power, such as a fish factory where freezers could leak ammonia if shut down.</p>
