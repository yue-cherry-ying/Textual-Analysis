<p>Jewish settlers on Thursday occupied a newly acquired house in Arab East Jerusalem in a move that angered Palestinians who claim that part of the city as theirs.</p>
<p>The move took place while U.S. envoy Dennis Ross met Israeli and Palestinian leaders separately in an effort to pull peace talks out of a crisis sparked by another settlement in the part of the city Israel captured from Jordan in 1967.</p>
<p>&quot;Here is, thank God, the redemption of another house that will be another place of Torah learning,&quot; legislator Rabbi Benny Allon said of the stone-faced house on Jerusalem's Mount of Olives, acquired for a Jewish religious seminary from a church.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't negate the right of Arabs to live in Jerusalem but Jews have a right to live in all of the city,&quot; said Chaim Silberstein, the school's director. &quot;As a yeshiva we are not political,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview at the house.</p>
<p>Palestinians, however, viewed the move as a purely political act to strengthen Jewish presence in the mostly Arab part of the city where the Palestinians hope to establish the capital of a future state.</p>
<p>Israel's groundbreaking on what it calls a new neighbourhood named Har Homa in another part of East Jerusalem set off weeks of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very dangerous provocation which will raise tensions and the chance and danger of a clash,&quot; said an aide to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, referring to the house on the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an attempt to Judaise Arab East Jerusalem,&quot; the aide, Ahmed Tibi, told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>But he also had harsh words for the Armenian cleric who sold the garden-enclosed house to a U.S. Jew who leased it to the settlers. The PLO said earlier this week the sale of Arab land to Israelis would be punished by death.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt whoever sold this and other houses did a very serious thing they shouldn't have done, and carries the moral or perhaps immoral responsibility for this criminal and base act,&quot; Tibi said.</p>
<p>Ross, the U.S. envoy, has met Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an effort to bring the parties back to the negotiating table and resume implementation of their peace accords.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials said the mission would fail unless it addressed the core issue of Jewish settlements.</p>
<p>Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, secretary-general of the Palestinian Authority, told Israel's Arabic radio that work had to stop at the Har Homa settlement, on a hill the Palestinians call Jabal Abu Ghneim.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a basic condition and it is not possible to speak of resuming the peace process without halting settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim,&quot; Abdel Rahman said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's aide David Bar-Illan said the work would go on.</p>
<p>&quot;We obviously are not going to stop building in the settlements any more than the Palestinians are going to stop building in their towns,&quot; he said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Israel demands the Palestinian Authority crack down on guerrilla activity before resuming talks.</p>
