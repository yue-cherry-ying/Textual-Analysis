<headline>Canadian boy admits cyber terrorism of his family.</headline>
<dateline>EMERYVILLE, Ontario 1997-04-21</dateline>

<p>A 15-year-old Canadian boy has admitted he was responsible for months of notorious high-tech pranks that terrorised his own family, police said on Monday.</p>
<p>Police said they have decided against charging the boy in the case that puzzled technology experts and attracted media attention both in Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;Charges aren't going to be laid because the family has been victimised enough already,&quot; Sgt. Doug Babbitt of the Ontario Provincial Police said. &quot;We've provided the family with some counselling avenues, but ultimately it's up to them what to do with Billy.&quot;</p>
<p>Babbitt said the family was interviewed on Saturday and presented with all the evidence and with police suspicions that the harassment was an inside job.</p>
<p>&quot;That's when 'Sommy'&quot; -- the stalker's moniker -- &quot;came forward and identified himself,&quot; said Babbitt.</p>
<p>Debbie Tamai, mother of the son the media dubbed &quot;Cyber Punk,&quot; issued a statement on Sunday apologising for the actions of her son Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;He's my son, I don't know how I didn't know,&quot; she said. &quot;I must have been blind ... I feel so stupid, so sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>Since January, Ontario police, electrical and hydro utilities have been hunting for &quot;Sommy,&quot; the name adopted by the boy who tapped into the Tamai family's telephone and electrical systems.</p>
<p>Police said Tamai's son Billy disguised his voice electronically and cut into phone conversations by simply using an extension in his bedroom.</p>
<p>Billy managed to elude two full-time officers and as many as eight policemen assigned to the case at one time, even after a frenzy of international media attention that included intelligence and security experts brought in by an American news programme.</p>
<p>Last week, the Tamais decided to sell their home in Emeryville, about 220 miles (354 km) west of Toronto, rather than suffer the power cuts and phone disturbances any longer. Now they have decided to stay put.</p>
