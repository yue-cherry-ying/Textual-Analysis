<p>U.S. special envoy Bill Richardson held talks with President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Saturday and reported a breakthrough on the plight of Rwandan Hutu refugees.</p>
<p>Richardson, Washington's ambassador to the United Nations, said Kabila promised a U.N. commission access to investigate allegations of massacres in areas controlled by Kabila's forces.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a major breakthrough ... we have made major progress on the human rights and humanitarian front,&quot; Richardson told reporters after the talks in the southern mining capital of Lubumbashi.</p>
<p>He said an advance team would arrive by June 20 and work would start in earnest by July 7.</p>
<p>Richardson was to fly on to Kisangani, where international concern about the plight of Rwandan Hutu refugees has coloured Kabila's takeover.</p>
<p>The refugees are the rump of over a million who fled Rwanda fearing reprisals in 1994 after Hutu hardliners slaughtered hundreds of thousands of minority Tutsis.</p>
<p>Kabila's main allies are Tutsis from Rwanda and the refugees include many civilians but also fighters of Rwanda's former Hutu army who were blamed for the genocide.</p>
<p>The U.N. has airlifted home tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutus, others have fled to neighbouring Congo Brazzaville.</p>
<p>Richardson was heading a team of over a dozen experts from different branches of the U.S. administration, who will brief Kabila's government on international expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;They will be sticking close to the ministers and advising them what the international community wants to see -- but not really telling them what to do,&quot; one U.S. official told Reuters.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said that the initiative was unprecedented for Africa and ressembled something Washington organised for Eastern Europe following the collapse of Soviet Communism there.</p>
<p>Richardson and Kabila met at the Lubumbashi offices of the state mining giant Gecamines. &quot;We are here with a broad delegation... we are eager to have a dialogue,&quot; Richardson said.</p>
<p>His team included representatives from departments such as defense, treasury, commerce plus aid and human rights experts.</p>
<p>Richardson was at the centre of diplomatic efforts to ensure what he called a &quot;soft landing&quot; when Kabila's forces arrived in Kinshasa, the capital of the former Zaire on May 17, one day after veteran dictator Mobutu Sese Seko fled the city.</p>
<p>Kabila and his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL) ousted Mobutu after a seven-month civil war. Mobutu had ruled since a 1965 military coup.</p>
<p>Kabila proclaimed himself president with sweeping powers and was inaugurated last month. He has promised elections by April 1999.</p>
<p>Zaire, plundered by Mobutu and his cronies, was potentially one of Africa's richest nations with a wealth of minerals, hydroelectric energy potential and rich farmland.</p>
<p>Kabila and his government have flirted in public with the idea of free market economics but he and his team have a Marxist or socialist past and have spoken in favour of state intervention in key sectors.</p>
<p>Ministers have spoken of making certain mining contracts conditional on implementation of socially important schemes such as road building.</p>
