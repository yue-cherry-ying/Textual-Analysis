<p>Japan's economy is gradually recovering and becoming more solid, Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Yasuo Matsushita said in a speech to a convention of credit associations on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy is continuing its gradual recovery trend and the strength of the recovery is becoming more solid,&quot; he said, although he added that the economy is now at a stage where it is strongly affected by fiscal measures, such as the increase in the consumption tax to five percent from three percent that was introduced on April 1.</p>
<p>Matsushita's prepared remarks were read to the convention by BOJ Deputy Governor Toshihiko Fukui.  </p>
<p>Public works spending is declining and housing investments have also fallen due to a retreat in demand, which fell following a rush of purchases that preceded the tax rise.</p>
<p>Private consumption, especially of cars and home electronics, has been affected by the tax increase and it is necessary to watch over this carefully, he said.</p>
<p>But there is little possibility that the basic recovery trend in consumption will be damaged, due to steady improvement in employment and income conditions, he said.</p>
<p>Although some smaller firms are cautious, corporate capital spending is growing steadily on the back of an increase in profits, Matsushita said.  </p>
<p>Net exports are also continuing to increase and industrial production is steady, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;For now, we cannot avoid a temporary slowdown in the economy, but there is a strong possibility that the economy will continue its recovery trend on the back of a strengthening of the favourable (economic) cycle centring on private demand,&quot; Matsushita said. But the BOJ needs to watch over consumption, corporate activities and other economic data to determine this trend, he said.</p>
<p>April domestic wholesale prices and consumer prices have risen due to the increase in the consumption tax, but excluding this factor, prices have generally been stable, he said.</p>
<p>Domestic prices are generally expected to stay stable, taking into account the drop in crude oil prices and the correction in the weakness in the yen, but it is necessary to keep watch over price movements carefully, Matsushita said.</p>
<p>&quot;Taking into account these economic and price movements, the management of monetary policy for now is to continue putting emphasis on making the basis for economic recovery firmer and keeping careful watch over (economic) developments,&quot; Matsushita said.</p>
