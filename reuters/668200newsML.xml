<p>The guru of the Japanese doomsday cult accused of a Tokyo subway gassing refused on Tuesday to testify as a witness in the trial of one of his former disciples and was fined 100,000 yen ($884).</p>
<p>Judge Hideaki Mikami of the Tokyo District Court repeatedly asked Shoko Asahara, leader of the Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth Sect), to stand up and swear the oath as a witness but Asahara refused, instead mumbling words in incoherent English.</p>
<p>After a futile exchange of about five minutes, Judge Mikami fined Asahara, saying he was refusing to testify without a legitimate reason.</p>
<p>&quot;I know it is no use asking you to reflect on yourself or tell us the truth,&quot; defendant Ikuo Hayashi, a former doctor and once Asahara's top disciple, told the guru in a rare courtroom battle. Hayashi has pleaded guilty in his trial.</p>
<p>&quot;Religion was just a tool for you,&quot; Hayashi told Asahara still seated in the witness seat.</p>
<p>Soon after this, Asahara shouted at Hayashi to keep quiet but Hayashi retorted, saying &quot;If you can shout like that, why don't you testify as a witness?&quot;</p>
<p>Hayashi is one of 10 former cultists accused of releasing the nerve gas sarin in subway trains on March 20, 1995. Asahara is accused of masterminding the attack, which killed 12 passengers and subway staff and harmed more than 6,000 people.</p>
<p>Asahara is on trial on 16 other charges, including kidnappings, murders, drugs and weapons manufacturing as well as another gas attack in the central Japan city of Matsumoto in July 1994. Asahara has pleaded not guilty to all but one of the indictments, a murder case.</p>
<p>The maximum penalty for a murder conviction in Japan is the death sentence. Legal experts say the complexity of the case means that Asahara's trial, now in its second year, can easily last another 10 years before the first verdict on any of the indictments.</p>
