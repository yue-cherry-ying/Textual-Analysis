<title>HONG KONG: WEEK AHEAD - Asian stocks seen mixed.</title>
<headline>WEEK AHEAD - Asian stocks seen mixed.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Asian stocks are headed for another mixed week, with U.S. direction expected to dictate Hong Kong's performance while Tokyo shares continue a correction.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrials closed 130.49 points higher at 7,435.78 on Friday, despite a fall in U.S. unemployment rate for May to 4.8 percent, its lowest level since October 1973.</p>
<p>Other aspects of the employment report, such as a moderate level of wage increases during the month, pointed to continued strong steady growth in the U.S. economy but with limited upward pressure on prices, economists said.</p>
<p>Smaller Asian markets are expected to ignore the data and focus on local issues, with Bangkok ready for a slight technical bounce after last week's slide, Manila and Jakarta holding steady while Singapore weakens.</p>

<p>TOKYO - Japan stocks are likely to continue to correct in the coming week as market participants adjust their positions ahead of the expiry of June futures and options at the end of the week, brokers say.</p>
<p>But bargain-hunting by foreign investors as well as pension funds is likely to set in in times of weakness and a heavy fall for stocks is unlikely, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;The Nikkei average has been struggling to keep above 20,500 without much success and investors are beginning to think about reducing their longs,&quot; said a dealer at a second-tier brokerage.</p>
<p>On Friday, the 225-share Nikkei average finished at 20,485.75, down 2.40 points or 0.01 percent. Over the course of the week it gained over 400 points. It also achieved a new closing high for the calendar year, climbing to 20,611.56 during the week before falling prey to profit-taking.</p>

<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks, which have seen greater volatility in the past month, are likely to trend sideways in the coming week, with a slight upward bias, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the market will probably move sideways next week after such strong gains (of the past month),&quot; said Peter So, deputy head of research at Schroders Securities. &quot;And it might edge up a bit. Market sentiment is still good and the underlying tone is still very firm.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index closed 140.39 points lower at 14,655.13 after a volatile day with the index moving in a 366-point range. Over the week, the index shed 102.68 points or 0.70 percent.</p>
<p>Brokers said the U.S. bond market's positive response to the May employment report will also aid local sentiment.</p>

<p>TAIPEI - Taiwan share prices are expected to be firmer next week, continuing bullish run led by the star electronics, brokers said.</p>
<p>Electronics will continue to be the market's focus next week as investors are concerned that whether top chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor can continue its recent rallies after it goes ex-bonus issue on June 12, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some electronics like semiconductor makers may continue to attract buying on expected sound prospects, but some electronics may face profit-taking if their May sales -- to be announced by June 10 -- are not so good as expected,&quot; said Nomura Securities research chief Ben Lee.</p>
<p>But if electronics encounter corrections, Lee said he expects financials, plastics or even constructions to emerge to lead the upward momentum.</p>
<p>&quot;After all, bullish sentiment is still there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the index closed up 24.52 points or 0.29 percent at 8,367.46, up 2.51 percent from 8,163.11 a week earlier.</p>
<p>A 8,200-8,600 range was seen for next week.</p>
<p>The market is closed on Monday for a national holiday.</p>

<p>BANGKOK - After declining for the past week, the Thai stock market is expected to gain slightly in thin turnover as local investors move in to buy cheap, large capitalised shares, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index dropped 6.32 percent in the week to 530.62 points on Friday from a week ago. It fell 3.18 percent from Thursday to a new eight-year low.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has fallen quite a lot already and local speculators are expected to buy and accumulate stocks next week. Turnover will remain thin on persistent worries by investors over the country's economy downturn,&quot; said Samart Rusmeerojwong of James Capel Asia.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>JAKARTA - Jakarta stocks are likely remain steady after a spate of healthy first quarter earnings results, brokers said.</p>
<p>Brokers said foreign players were also likely to remain active after staying mostly on the sidelines before the general elections on May 29.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Jakarta composite index closed at 695.02, just one point weaker from last week's close of 696.03 points.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>MANILA - Philippine shares are likely to hover near support at 2,700 to 2,750 next week on thin volume prior to the resumption of an uptrend, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market may be seen moving two steps down, one step up before creeping back to 2,900 points,&quot; Saturnino Mejia, research head at Guoco Securities said.</p>
<p>The main index closed 15.64 points lower at 2,762.80 on Friday. Week-on-week, the main index shed 46.65 points or 1.66 percent from the previous level of 2,809.45.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>SEOUL - Seoul stocks would consolidate briefly next week and then continue to rally as investors were pinning hopes on the economy recovering sooner than many had earlier anticipated, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The consolidation is expected to continue early next week but the market will rise further toward the weekend,&quot; said analyst Hwang Chang-joong of LG Securities. &quot;I'm sure the market is riding a bull-run.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers said falling interest rates and the strengthening yen against the dollar helped boost investors' sentiment.</p>
<p>The composite stock index closed on Saturday at 762.77, up 6.00 points or 0.79 percent from last Saturday's 756.77.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE - Singapore shares were seen remaining under pressure in the week ahead with a lack of investor confidence locking the market in a weakening trading range, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not much confidence out there and so we're stuck in a weaker trading range,&quot; one dealer at a local firm said.</p>
<p>&quot;Malaysian stocks have more trading opportunities than Singapore at the moment, but over the longer term Singapore should give a stronger recovery, although that's some way off,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>The Straits Times Industrials Index closed at 2,032.30 on Friday, down 33.18 on the previous Friday's close of 2,065.48.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Australian shares are seen holding around current levels following a 0.4 percent fall last week as the market awaits fresh direction.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,600.9, down 9.6 points on a week earlier as the market eased back in moderate trade following strong gains late last week.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market appeared to be less sensitive to overseas movements than in the past and continued to hold up well with continued demand for stock.</p>
<p>&quot;It hasn't been wildly active, but hopefully we can maintain these levels,&quot; said a Sydney-based broker.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>WELLINGTON - New Zealand shares are expected to continue rising after a week of steady, modest gains, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The bonds have rallied considerably, the currency has weakened back on the Trade-Weighted Index and that underpins things on an valuation basis,&quot; Tim Snedden at ANZ Securities said. &quot;And I think there is a reasonable amount of offshore money coming into our market,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Among the stocks to watch would be Telecom, which goes ex-dividend on Monday, and foresters Fletcher Paper and Carter Holt Harvey as all three were attracting fresh interest.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 Capital Index closed the week at 2,356.80, up 19.34 points (0.8 percent) on last Friday's close.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>DHAKA - The bear run in the Bangladesh stock market is likely to continue until announcement of a new national budget with investors mostly preferring to watch than staking funds, brokers said.</p>
<p>Investors are expected to remain cautious in the week beginning on Sunday, they said. The national budget for 1997-98 fiscal year (July-June) is due to be announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Dhaka Stock Exchange benchmark index fell 74.84 points or 6.15 percent to 1,141.84 in the week to Thursday.</p>
