<p>A senior Egyptian official said in remarks published on Saturday that a Middle Eastern common market including Israel would not be established even if the Jewish state finalises peace accords with its Arab neighbours.</p>
<p>Assistant foreign minister Raouf Saad told the government-owned al-Ahram newspaper that Israel's strong economy and not its politics prevented the common market, an idea born of earlier progress in the Middle East peace process, from seeing the light.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no scope for talking about Middle Eastern economic cooperation which includes Israel. Even if there is peace, this issue is not on the agenda,&quot; Saad said.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers show that the Israeli economy is relatively large compared to the Middle Eastern and North African states...Israel will gain much more from such an economic grouping than the Arabs,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Israeli per capita income is comparable to incomes in the developed world and its gross domestic product makes up 16 percent of the total domestic product of the Arab world. If a common market is set up then it will become nothing but a market for Israeli goods and services,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But analysts say the current state of Arab-Israeli relations has put a damper on the common market idea and on normal trade ties with the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours began to deteriorate since rightwing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was elected in May 1996 on a platform that refuses to trade occupied Arab lands for peace.</p>
<p>Peace talks on the Syrian track have been stalled for more than a year and Palestinian-Israel negotiations have also been deadlocked since March after Israel broke ground on a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem -- land captured in a 1967 war.</p>
<p>Saad said that an Arab common market was a more viable option. On Thursday, the foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria and six Gulf Arab states said they would set up an economic bloc, expected to begin as a free-trade zone.</p>
