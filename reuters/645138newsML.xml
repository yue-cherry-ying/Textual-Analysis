<p>Scott Pruett won the provisional pole for Sunday's Detroit Grand Prix Indy Car race on Friday after crashing and wiping out his primary car in the morning.</p>
<p>Pruett's crew had to put his Reynard Ford back together like a jig-saw puzzle to get him back on the track, where he broke the track record set by Nigel Mansell in 1994 by posting a lap of one minute, 9.572 seconds (108.664 mph/174.873 kph).</p>
<p>&quot;We got into some oil, wiping out the left rear of the car,&quot; Pruett said about his first mishap of the day. He then tried his back-up car, but the transmission broke.</p>
<p>For the afternoon session, his team cannibalized the two cars. &quot;We had two dead soldiers and had to make one good one out of two dead ones,&quot; he explained. &quot;The team busted their butts to put a car together just to get car on the track.&quot;</p>
<p>Second fastest in a Reynard Mercedes-Benz was Canadian Greg Moore, winner of last week's race in Milwaukee. Third fastest was Mauricio Gugelmin of Brazil.</p>
<p>Teammates Michael Andretti and Roberto Moreno of Brazil were fourth and fifth fastest in Swift-Fords.</p>
<p>Final qualifying for the event, the eighth in the 17-race series, is scheduled for Saturday.</p>
