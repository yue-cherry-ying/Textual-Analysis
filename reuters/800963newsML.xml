<p>A commission of inquiry into tax avoidance by New Zealand corporates concluded on Thursday there was no evidence to support allegations made by Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters about former officials of the Serious Fraud Office or the Inland Revenue Department.  </p>
<p>In a two-volume report entitled &quot;A commission of inquiry into certain matters relating to taxation&quot;, commissioner Sir Ronald Davison said he saw no evidence of fraud or tax evasion needing action by the SFO or the IRD.</p>
<p>The commission, known as the &quot;Winebox inquiry&quot; because a series of papers it examined were originally delivered in a wine carton, concluded that the SFO and IRD had not acted incompetently.  </p>
<p>Allegations by New Zealand First leader Winston Peters against both organisations had lead to the establishment almost three years ago of the commission of inquiry into Cook Island tax deals.</p>
<p>In his report tabled in parliament, Davison said there was no proof of fraud in any of the four winebox transactions focused on by New Zealand First leader Peters.</p>
<p>He also concluded that there was no evidence of a conspiracy by corporates and individuals to defraud the IRD.  </p>
<p>Davison said the transactions disclosed in the winebox were only a few of the many undertaken by banks, financial institutions and corporates throughout New Zealand during the latter part of the 1980s.</p>
<p>&quot;One might question the ethics of seeking to escape the impact of heavy taxation, but the realities were that tax was regarded as a cost of doing business and something to be minimised to the extent possible within the letter of the law,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;However, in making his allegations of fraud, Winston Peters grossly overplayed his hand and elevated the four types of transactions which he specifically identified to a level of fraudulent conduct which in fact none has been proved to have possessed.</p>
<p>&quot;There is simply no evidence at all of the existence of such a fraud as he alleged in any of the winebox transactions.&quot;</p>
