<p>A top European official, seeking to dispel lingering doubts over the timing of monetary union, on Friday declared the euro on track to start in January 1999 and said most EU member states were likely to join it.</p>
<p>European Monetary Affairs Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy, predicting a new era of European stability and growth under the euro, also praised Italy's belt-tightening efforts and said Rome was moving in the right direction for entry.</p>
<p>&quot;The process is irreversible and the euro will be in place on January 1, 1999,&quot; he told Reuters during a visit to Geneva.</p>
<p>&quot;If we want to change the date, we have to change the (Maastricht) treaty. Now the process is so advanced that it's not possible for member states and companies to slow down.&quot;</p>
<p>De Silguy said Maastricht Treaty economic principles would be applied strictly for a smooth transition to monetary union. Nations hoping to join should stick to the criteria, including a curb on budget deficits to three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year, he said.</p>
<p>He declined to comment on Germany's plan to plug its budget gap by revaluing gold reserves, but warned against accounting tricks by European Union member states.</p>
<p>&quot;For countries participating in the euro, the most important thing is to achieve a sustainable level of convergence. Accounting measures must be complemented with structural measures to achieve sound finances in the long term, but creative accounting is out of the question,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are precise regulations known by everyone,&quot; he said. &quot;They will be applied. There is no question of doing creative accounting. We will apply the same accountability rules to all member states without discrimination.&quot;</p>
<p>De Silguy expected a majority of EU states to qualify for the first round of European economic and monetary union (EMU) but did not elaborate.</p>
<p>&quot;When I see the huge efforts made by governments of all the member states to be ready in time, the evolution of economic situations, I think there'll be a majority of member states which will be ready to join the EMU at the start,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked if Italy would qualify by 1999, he said: &quot;Italy is moving in the right direction. Italy has made fantastic efforts to reduce excessive public deficits and prepared reforms to be ready in due time.&quot;</p>
<p>De Silguy said the common European currency should fuel growth in Europe to an estimated four percent a year from 2.5 percent now, foster stability and help slash unemployment to eight percent from 12 percent now.</p>
<p>He dismissed fears the Swiss franc would appreciate sharply because of concerns about the stability of the euro and said such risks in a transition period would be minimised.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks and Swiss businesses must prepare themselves for the introduction of the euro because it will have important consequences for them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The euro will be a stable currency and the Swiss franc will indirectly benefit from this stability.&quot;</p>
