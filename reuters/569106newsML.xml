<p>The managements of some major Russian companies respect shareholder rights out of self-interest, even where it is hard to enforce legally guaranteed rights, according to a recently published study.</p>
<p>The study, by Dirk Willer of the London School of Economics Centre for Economic Performance, is based on a survey of 140 major companies, and contradicts the widely held view Russian companies generally ignore the interests of shareholders.</p>
<p>It thus backs the experience of funds such as Pictet et Cie's First Russian Frontiers Trust plc, which says it has encountered few difficulties despite adverse publicity about the problems of transferring and registering shares, voting or receiving dividends.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if there are no state-enforced shareholder rights, managers can find it optimal to choose to honour shareholder rights in order to be able to obtain funding for new projects by issuing new equity,&quot; the study said, noting that equity issues were not yet occurring on a large scale, although many firms were preparing for them.</p>
<p>&quot;In practice it is indeed the case that some firms start to honour shareholder rights, although it is only a minority among the 140 largest firms by sales whose shares are traded on the over the counter market,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The study, completed in November last year before a rally in Russian share prices in the New Year, says one reason for the relatively low valuation of Russian equity is the risk of violation of shareholder rights.</p>
<p>In some well-publicised early cases, management refused to register share purchases. More insufficient provision of financial information made it hard for shareholders to monitor management.</p>
<p>&quot;However, among the largest Russian stock-companies there is a small group of firms that has started to honour shareholder rights,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>As far as control rights are concerned, communications and power utility companies are more likely to be shareholder-friendly, probably because of their investment needs, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;This means that large investment needs can cause management to act in a shareholder-friendly way. It shows that in the short run market forces can act to some degree as a substitute for a well developed legal system that would protect shareholder rights,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The study also finds evidence that the state as a shareholder puts pressure on management to honour shareholder rights, as it wants to raise as much as possible from selling off its stake in the future.</p>
<p>Large companies tend to respect shareholder rights more than small ones, because only they can afford the fixed costs of equity issues, and because they are more visible.</p>
<p>But when employees retain large stakes in companies, the management, which is often interested in buying these shares, has an interest in a low share price and will not encourage shareholder rights.</p>
<p>As far as income rights are concerned, the study reaches the unsurprising conclusion that companies with large investment needs pay small dividends. This implies that dividends are in general not used to signal a shareholder-friendly management.</p>
<p>Large state ownership, or large stakes held by outside investors, are not associated with large dividends.</p>
<p>But whether dividends are declared on ordinary shares depends on the return of sales according to Russian accounting standards, implying that these figures are of some importance, even if they cannot be compared with international standards.</p>
