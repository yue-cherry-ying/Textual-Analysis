<p>Following are some of the main factors expected to affect Philippine stocks on Thursday:</p>
<p>* Philippine shares are likely to fall further due to a dearth of buying incentives and the steep fall in Wall Street last night, brokers said.</p>
<p>* &quot;We expect shares to move downward. There's nothing to perk up the market,&quot; Spencer Yap, an analyst of BPI Capital Corp, said.</p>
<p>He said fears of an economic slowdown, property collapse and rising bad loans, which drove shares spiralling downward in recent days, still hound investors.  </p>
<p>* Elline Salvatierra, an analyst of Dharmala Securities, said the steep fall in Wall Street last night could dampen the bearish sentiment in the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The Wall Street overnight weakness will be a big factor,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>* Analysts were looking at 2,600 to 2,650 as the immediate support level. The Philippine key index skidded 82.13 points to end at 2,694.40 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>* The Dow Jones fell 139.67 points to 7,085.65 on fresh fears that the economy's strong growth would prompt an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve.  </p>
<p>* The peso closed slightly weaker at 26.366 to the dollar vs Wednesday's close of 26.363.</p>
<p>* The Philippine overnight money was unchanged at 11.5625 percent.</p>
<p>* Twelve local and foreign real estate firms, including Robinsons Land Corp, Filinvest land, and Metro Pacific, have bbought bid documents for the bidding of the Food Terminal Inc.</p>
<p>* Uniwide Holdings Inc reports a consolidated net sale sof 3.2 billion pesos in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 28 percent from the 2.5 billion pesos posted in the same period last year.</p>
<p>* Globe Telecom says it is planning to invest in a new cable system, the South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 3, within the year.</p>
<p>* A computer bug delayed the launch of a new software product of MUSIC Semiconductors Corp and was responsible for the firm missing its first quarter revenue target of 107.7 million pesos, president Michael Burton says.</p>
<p>* First Holdings Corp says its net income for the first nine months of the year ending March 31 was 1.28 billion pesos.</p>
