<p>American consumers should soon be able to eat fats which reduce their cholesterol levels after a Johnson&amp;Johnson company on Tuesday sealed a deal with a tiny firm in south-west Finland.</p>
<p>Shares in Finnish food, animal feeds and chemicals group Raisio surged 30 percent, forcing the Helsinki bourse to ease trading limits, after it said it chose McNeil Consumer Products to market its patented cholesterol-cutting compound.</p>
<p>Benecol stanol ester is a molecule adapted by Finnish scientists, which has been clinically proven to lower blood cholesterol levels. Made mainly from pine trees, it has been on the Finnish market since 1995 in margarine form.</p>
<p>Raisio, whose main Finnish owners are the farmers who provide it with the raw materials for its food business, says Benecol can just as easily be consumed in other fats, like chocolate.</p>
<p>The company, based near the south-western town of Turku, said on Tuesday McNeil would get sole rights to use Benecol in a variety of forms on the North American market, with the aim to launch in spring 1998.</p>
<p>The deal, which also includes Mexico, Canada and Puerto Rico, needs approval by U.S. competition authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;Americans have identified cholesterol as one of their leading health concerns,&quot; said Brian Perkins, CEO of McNeil Consumer Products, in the Raisio statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that together with a proper diet and exercise, stanol ester opens up new possibilities for consumers to become more involved in their own health and wellness.&quot;</p>
<p>The population of North America is 70 times that of Finland's five million, where the annual value of the Benecol market is 90 million markka, Raisio said.</p>
<p>Scientists say high blood cholesterol is a key factor in heart disease, the number-one world killer accounting for over six million deaths worldwide in 1990, according to World Health Organisation figures.</p>
<p>About 950,000 Americans die of heart disease, stroke or hypertensive diseases yearly, according to Centres for Disease Control (CDC) data.</p>
<p>Raisio said the deal would have very favourable impact on its performance long-term, and investors applauded it.</p>
<p>Raisio's stock skyrocketed, adding 108.00 markka or nearly 30 percent to close at 478.00 markka in Helsinki -- a gain of 710 percent since it launched Benecol in November 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the share can probe its previous peaks,&quot; said Merita analyst Tanja Lounevirta, pointing to a 500.00 markka life-high reached in March.</p>
<p>McNeil, which makes Tylenol painkillers, were chosen for its marketing know-how and strong scientific and clinical research, said Raisio, whose annual sales at 3.9 billion markka in 1996 were a fraction of Johnson &amp; Johnson's $21.6 billion turnover.</p>
<p>Vice-President Tor Bergman told reporters Raisio was working on selling Benecol further afield: &quot;Europe and Japan are the next areas, and the work has begun,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Scientists have been looking at plant sterols since the 1950s, knowing they can reduce blood cholesterol levels: Raisio was the first to make them available in fat-soluble form.</p>
<p>A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1995 showed an average fall of 10.2 percent in blood cholesterol levels among 153 participants who took Benecol for a year as part of a managed diet.</p>
