<p>The dollar is likely to be weak and take a stab at the downside during Asian trading time on Thursday, with the market focusing on whether the greenback manages to hold its own above 123 yen or not.</p>
<p>Bearish sentiment in the wake of comments from Japanese Ministry of Finance official Eisuke Sakakibara on Thursday has made the market extremely sensitive to any negative factors, dealers said, adding that the market will watch closely for additional official comments today.</p>
<p>Institutional investor hedge sales and options-linked stop-loss selling are both likely to weigh the dollar down.  </p>
<p>The dollar slipped as low as 123.42 yen in late Tokyo trade on Thursday after Sakakibara said it was possible the yen could strengthen to about 103 yen to the dollar. Although the greenback did not fall that low during overnight New York trade, its recovery was limited to 124 yen, which dealers said was likely to cap gains in Asia today.</p>
<p>Options-linked stop-loss selling orders appeared to be placed below 123.50 yen, with a large volume of additional stop-loss orders under 123 yen, a credit bank dealer said. The greenback had already slipped to around 123.41 yen in early Asian trade.  </p>
<p>Dealers said it was difficult to peg additional support points below 123 yen, although one city bank dealer said the dollar could come to a temporary halt around 122.50 yen. &quot;But downward limits are difficult to predict today,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Of particular concern is the amount of possible hedge selling by institutional investors such as trust banks, life insurers, investment trust management firms and Japan's Postal Life Insurance Bureau (Kampo). Such sales, in which investors sell dollars pre-emptively to protect their unhedged foreign assets from sudden downward moves by the U.S. currency, began to emerge in Tokyo trade on Thursday, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Most of Thursday's hedge sales appeared to be from trust banks, although there was some vague market talk of life insurer hedge selling as well. A manager at one Japanese life insurer, however, said it was still too early to expect large amounts of such sales.</p>
<p>The dollar is also under downward pressure against the Swiss franc and the mark, which is contributing to the generally bearish mood. Tokyo trade is expected to be led, however, by the dollar's moves against the yen, dealers said.</p>
