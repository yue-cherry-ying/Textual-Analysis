<headline>US, Asian strength boost quiet Euro fuel markets.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>European fuel swaps were boosted on Thursday by stronger U.S. and Asian prices but physical markets were left moribund by public holidays across the continent, traders said.</p>
<p>High sulphur barge paper for May traded at $84.50/$85.00 on the back of bullish sentiment in Singapore, where 180-cst grade was sold at $102 a tonne for May 26-30 delivery, up $2 on Tuesday, in anticipation of fresh demand.</p>
<p>May Singapore swaps were also up, at $101.50/$102.50. Stronger U.S. prices have also boosted one percent cracked swaps in Europe which are at $88/$90 for May, with June and July flat at $91.00/$92.00.</p>
<p>Low sulphur was also notionally supported by crude's strength and tight prompt supply. No cargoes were seen available until the month's end, though the flurry of deals last week has left the grade's few buyers relaxed.</p>
<p>No barge trade was seen, with all continental European players out of their offices for the Ascension day holiday.</p>
<p>The high sulphur cargo market was again quiet, though a short into an Irish utility was believed still needing filled. A British bunker requirement was heard covered with a Russian straight-run cargo.</p>
