<p>Most grains futures prices fell on the Budapest Commodity Exchange (BCE) due to rains that  boosted crop expectations and falling international prices, traders and experts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The upper soil was quite dry in the last few weeks and today's showers have probably increased moisture levels by some 30 percent,&quot; said Attila Bussay of the Hungarian Meteorological Office.</p>
<p>One trader added that rains were the main reason behind today's fall in grains futures prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Both speculators and producers' crop expectations have risen, so they are back into the market,&quot; said Robert Monostori of Agrimpex.</p>
<p>As a result, August milling wheat dropped 320 forints per tonne to 23,850, September fell 390 to 24,210 and December finished at 25,700 forints, down 300.</p>
<p>August and October were the only two months which saw relatively significant turnover with 397 and 185 lots respectively.</p>
<p>Total grains turnover was a meagre 251.2 million forints or 527 contracts, of which milling wheat accounted for 396 lots and maize for 51.</p>
<p>Maize fell the daily 400 forints per tonne limit in deferred maturities from November 1997 to July 1998. October maize held steady at 20,300 forints and July 1997 finished lower at 19,260 forints, down 240.</p>
<p>Feed wheat finished lower in minimal turnover, untraded feed barley and sunflower seed remained flat.</p>
