<p>Thousands of New Yorkers have been flocking to a lower Manhattan art gallery to see a naked Russian artist crawl around on all fours like a dog -- barking, growling and snapping at people who try to pet him.</p>
<p>If man bites dog is news, as editors have long advised fresh recruits, then man becomes dog probably is news as well.</p>
<p>But is it art?</p>
<p>And if it is, is art going to the dogs?</p>
<p>In short, is what 36-year-old Oleg Kulik of Moscow is doing in a barred cage at the Deitch Projects gallery in Soho something on a par with a Picasso circus dog or a William Wegman photograph of a dog dressed as a man? Or is he just crying woof?</p>
<p>Kulik was too busy barking the other day to give an answer but his wife, writer Mila Bredikhina, said: &quot;It is art, it is about the past and the future, about the difference between man and animal. It is not political statement.&quot;</p>
<p>Sure. And it is also about what New Yorkers do during their lunchtime and how art critics earn their living, trying to puzzle out the meaning of something nobody has thought much about because the number of performance artists wearing only a leather collar and acting like a dog is pretty small just now.</p>
<p>In fact, after Sunday the number will revert to zero as Kulik plans to go the airport as a dog, change into his human clothes -- the ones he has not worn since he arrived in New York last week -- and return in triumph to Moscow AS A MAN.</p>
<p>FAREWELL TO BARKING</p>
<p>He will also resume speaking, something he has not done as a caged dog who is fed oatmeal and slurps water from a metal bowl while people gawk at him and occasionally don protective clothing to enter his cage so he can attack them, maybe nip at their heels or pretend they are a fireplug.</p>
<p>You know, the kind of stuff dogs do.</p>
<p>The show is called &quot;I Bite America and America Bites Me.&quot;</p>
<p>Bredikhina says that either as a man or a dog Kulik is a great husband and a really terrific human being.</p>
<p>&quot;He wants to explore in his mind what it means to be an animal. He searches for basic feelings. The main thing is to commmunicate, not to bite.</p>
<p>&quot;He was Pavlov's dog for a month. He was a mad dog in Moscow. He was a dog in Stockholm. He is a pit bull type dog here. He was also a bird and a fish,&quot; she said, adding modestly: &quot;I like him as a human and as an animal.&quot;</p>
<p>NEW YORKERS WILL MISS HIM</p>
<p>When he cleans up his kennel and sheds his canine cannister for more conventional human form, a lot of New Yorkers probably will feel they will have nowhere to go.</p>
<p>&quot;I've  seen him three times and I have to tell you he is really growling today,&quot; said one man who asked not to identified at the gallery the other day. He was with a group of art students and they left after a few minutes to see a show of stuffed minature mice across the street.</p>
<p>Gallery manager Sarah Watson said that thousands of people have tramped through the gallery since the performance began its two-week run last week.</p>
<p>&quot;They include a lot of people who do not understand contemporary art and they treat him as if he was a dog. This isn't a way of life. This is a performance,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>She added that some people dismissed the performance as silly. Others have devoted their lunch hours to visiting.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the first time we have put someone in a cage. We paid for him and his wife to come over and we pay him a per diem,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>But, after all, you can't get rich living a dog's life.</p>
