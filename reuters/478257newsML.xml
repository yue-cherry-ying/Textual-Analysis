<headline>NCAA BASKETBALL-ARIZONA CELEBRATES WITH RALLY AT FOOTBALL STADIUM.</headline>

<p>The triumphant Arizona Wildcats returned home Tuesday to a rally drawing 40,000 frenzied fans to the school's football stadium to celebrate their first national college basketball championship.</p>
<p>The Arizona players, who beat defending champions Kentucky 84-79 in overtime Monday night at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, were transported from the airport by motorcade to the football stadium for an hour-long rally.</p>
<p>The Wildcats capped a brilliant tournament run with their victory over Kentucky. Arizona, a club with only one senior, became the first team ever to vanquish three top seeds (Kansas, North Carolina and Kentucky) on the way to the title.</p>
<p>&quot;I still have difficulty believing this has happened,&quot; said Arizona coach Lute Olson, who had also been to the Final Four in 1988 and 1994, but lost in the semifinals both times.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had other teams, outstanding teams, more experienced teams.&quot;</p>
<p>Junior guard Miles Simon matched a career-high with 30 points in Monday's win and was named outstanding player of the tournament.</p>
<p>With the victory, Arizona finally buried its past NCAA Tournament failures, including first-round upset losses in 1992, 1993 and 1995.</p>
<p>Olson, who had suffered from a label as a coach who couldn't win &quot;the big one,&quot; led his team to six Tournament victories, one seemingly more improbable than the last.</p>
<p>Teaming up with Simon to give Arizona an unbeatable backcourt combination was 19-year-old freshman Mike Bibby, who helped break the vaunted Kentucky fullcourt press and finished the championship final with 19 points and nine rebounds.</p>
