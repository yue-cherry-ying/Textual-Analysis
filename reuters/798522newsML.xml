<title>UK: FOCUS - Tight supply ratchets up aluminium.</title>
<headline>FOCUS - Tight supply ratchets up aluminium.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tightness gripped the aluminium market on Thursday and speculators scrambled to cover metal for delivery due next week as premiums for nearby supply widened sharply.</p>
<p>Technical tightness had been building up for some time on the London Metal Exchange (LME) aluminium market but Thursday saw a rush to cover ahead of next Wednesday's delivery date.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, people have been covering ahead of next week. They tend to do that nowadays, rather than leave it to the last moment,&quot; analyst Robin Bhar of LME trader Brandeis said.</p>
<p>In lively sessions the premium to borrow August aluminium for one day was at $11 per tonne. The premium for cash metal over three months delivery flared to near $20 after they had been almost level earlier this week.</p>
<p>Floor traders said the tightness has been signposted, with bank interests said to be long and speculative funds on the other side of the market.</p>
<p>Traders do not expect the LME authorities to take any immediate action despite a recent Board reminder to members of its rules regarding market conditions and abuse.</p>
<p>The nearby tightness underpinned the forward market, which shrugged off another stock increase which probably reflects metal attracted by the August backwardation.</p>
<p>Three months aluminium traded as high as $1,720 per tonne before closing at $1,701, up $5.50 from Wednesday.</p>
<p>Commodity markets generally were quiet and rangebound on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Precious metals drifted lower after early New York prices turned slightly easier. Dealers said U.S. economic data were well in line with economists' forecasts so the reaction in the financial markets was muted limiting the knock on effect in gold.</p>
<p>Brisk U.S. holiday season gasoline demand helped oil prices modestly higher.</p>
