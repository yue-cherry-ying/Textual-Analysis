<title>USA: Calif. Senate OKs bill to allow smokers' lawsuits.</title>
<headline>Calif. Senate OKs bill to allow smokers' lawsuits.</headline>
<dateline>SACRAMENTO, Calif. 1997-07-07</dateline>

<p>The California state Senate Monday approved a bill making it easier for individual smokers to sue tobacco companies.</p>
<p>The bill, passed 29-10 in the Senate, requires Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's signature to become law. The Assembly approved the bill last week.</p>
<p>The bill, written by state Senator Quentin Kopp had appeared dead after it failed in the Assembly in June. But heavy lobbying by Kopp, health groups and trial lawyers revived the measure, officials said.</p>
<p>A 1987 California law exempted tobacco and other &quot;inherently unsafe&quot; products from liability lawsuits. The state legislature passed a limited amendment to the law last month that allowed the state to sue the tobacco industry, which it promptly did. But it said nothing about individuals.</p>
<p>Kopp's bill goes further by removing tobacco from the list of products protected from liability lawsuits, thereby allowing lawsuits by individuals.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill said it was essential to allow individual Californians to take advantage of the money made available through the proposed federal settlement with the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>The proposed $368.5 billion agreement hammered out by state attorneys general last month would ban future class-action lawsuits over tobacco liability but would still allow smokers to sue individually.</p>
<p>Opponents argued that smokers knew the health risks of smoking and that the bill would just be a boon to trial lawyers.</p>
