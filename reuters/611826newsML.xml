<p>The Philippines' US$1.25 billion Yankee bond could be launched sooner rather than later, according to Philippines' president Fidel Ramos.</p>
<p>&quot;It was cancelled because of very poor U.S. market conditions at the time,&quot; Ramos told reporters at a news conference in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we resume the roadshow for the Yankee bonds upon the recommendation of the governor of the central bank of the Philippines and I think he has already applied for travel authority to go back to the U.S. so that he can kick it off,&quot; Ramos said.</p>
<p>The bond is intended as a benchmark issue for the Philippines, which is working hard to build its capital markets and finance an aggressive programme of infrastructure development.</p>
<p>But its planned launch in early April was delayed when interest rate action in the United States caused some short-term market instability.</p>
<p>Central bank governor Gabriel Singson said earlier on Thursday that he had &quot;the luxury of time&quot; in deciding the launch date, and that he was watching markets closely day by day.</p>
<p>The U.S. long bond yield was at about 6.50 percent for a spread of about 160 basis points at the original launch date, he said, but exactly similar conditions were not necessary to justify a new launch date.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission registration is valid for nine months, and everything is in place to allow the central bank to move swiftly as soon as markets conditions warrant, Singson said.</p>
