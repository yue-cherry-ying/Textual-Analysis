<p>Stamp dealers in China's capital are cashing in on the imminent end to more than 150 years of British colonial rule over Hong Kong with buyers snapping up postal souvenirs, officials and dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;As the day of the Hong Kong handover gets closer, it seems as if everyone in the country wants to buy a set or two of commemorative stamps for a souvenir,&quot; said Chang Liancheng, manager of the Yuetan stamp market, Beijing's largest.</p>
<p>The British colony of Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>Potential buyers roam the market looking at commemorative envelopes, one printed by a private company in Hong Kong and showing troops from China's People's Liberation Army marching through Hong Kong's Central business district.</p>
<p>In addition to stamps, dealers pull out coins with the symbol of Hong Kong, the bauhinia flower, and Chinese telephone cards with the head of the late leader Deng Xiaoping gazing down on the Hong Kong skyline.</p>
<p>&quot;If you are a patriotic Chinese and the stamps are not too expensive, then you can buy one or two sets as a souvenir,&quot; Chang said in an interview.</p>
<p>Prices range from 8 yuan ($1) for a set of three large stamps with Hong Kong scenes, to more than 3,000 yuan ($360) for a limited edition commemorative envelope which contains two errors, dealers said.</p>
<p>The word &quot;tomorrow&quot; is misspelled in English in a phrase which states: &quot;Remember the history and hail a glorious tommorrow&quot;. In addition, the official date of the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong is given as December 29 instead of December 19, 1984, dealers said.</p>
<p>The stamps come from Hong Kong, China and other countries and people buy them to collect, for investment or simply out of patriotism for the handover, dealers said.</p>
<p>China's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is planning an official issue of stamps to mark the event, but has yet to unveil the eagerly awaited set, a ministry official said.</p>
<p>The market for Hong Kong-related memorabilia began to heat up in January, when prices for stamps rose five or six times in three weeks, they said.</p>
<p>Prices have since stabilised, but dealers and collectors said they expected more surges after the handover as latecomers try to grab a piece of history.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very happy about the handover because Hong Kong was originally part of China,&quot; said one dealer, who gave his surname as Zhou. &quot;It's been over 100 years since Hong Kong was part of China, of course I'm happy.&quot;</p>
<p>Since April, Zhou has sold 200 envelopes with a picture of Hong Kong's skyline and a HK$1.60 ($0.21) stamp for 80 yuan apiece.</p>
<p>The reverse side of the colourful envelope, printed by the government-backed China National Philatelic Corp, reads: &quot;Welcome Hong Kong's return to the embrace of the motherland.&quot;</p>
<p>Zhou hopes prices will continue to rise after the handover, but tells would-be philatelists there are still bargains available.</p>
<p>A stamped envelope marking the return of the Portuguese colony of Macau to Chinese rule in 1999 is now selling for only 180 yuan ($22) with still two years to go.</p>
