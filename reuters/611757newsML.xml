<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan April jobless rate at 2.59 percent.</title>
<headline>Taiwan April jobless rate at 2.59 percent.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Taiwan's unemployment rate was 2.59 percent in April, lower than government and private economists had expected, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said on Friday.  </p>
<p>The April joblessness figure came in significantly below an average 2.896 forecast compiled from a May 21 Reuters Poll of Taiwan economists.</p>
<p>Directorate economists found the relatively low figure surprising as well, noting that the impact of an islandwide outbreak of hog foot-and-mouth disease in March and a related ban on Taiwan's huge pork exports was unexpectedly small.</p>
<p>&quot;The impact of the hog epidemic was lower than expected,&quot; a directorate official told Reuters as the figure was issued.  </p>
<p>The April unemployment figure not only was lower than the month-earlier level of 2.79 percent in March, but was the lowest in 11 months. Joblessness in May 1996 was 2.35 percent.</p>
<p>Because Taiwan's hog-farm crisis erupted on March 20, April was the first full month to reflect its economic impact.</p>
<p>At first, government and private economists widely concurred that the scaling back of Taiwan's huge export-related feedlot and meatpacking industry would seriously add to joblessness. Pork export had been a US$1.56 billion-a-year industry.</p>
<p>Initial estimates ran as high as 50,000 jobs lost, which would have added 0.5-0.6 percentage points to unemployment.  </p>
<p>Some economists more recently had revised their estimates of the farm epidemic's impact to 20,000 jobs lost.</p>
<p>Directorate officials said on Friday that precise figures for epidemic-related job losses would not be available before mid-June, but said they did not expect the numbers to be high.</p>
<p>&quot;The unemployed population will not increase sharply (due to the foot and mouth epidemic),&quot; agency director Chen Chang-hsiung told reporters after announcing the April figures.</p>
<p>Besides banning all pork exports temporarily, the government responded to the outbreak by ordering the slaughter of all hogs, even healthy ones, at all affected farms -- or about four million of Taiwan's 14 million pigs.  </p>
<p>Other factors contributed significantly to April's month-on-month unemployment decline, chiefly a steadily accelerating recovery, which added jobs in the manufacturing and long-struggling construction sectors, Chen said.  </p>
<p>The directorate said the number of unemployed people in April decreased by 20,000 to 242,000 from March.</p>
<p>The number of employed fell 4,000 to 9.119 million, but jobs in industrial sectors rose by 46,000, it said.</p>
