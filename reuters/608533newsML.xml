<p>Brent crude soared on Friday, gaining 19 cents over Thursday, in what some traders said was a strong trade unlikely to be matched early next week due to weaker demand, traders said.</p>
<p>A June 9-11 Brent kept early on Friday from the paper chains by BP was sold to trading house Glencore for July Brent +17 cents compared with a June 2-4 cargo that fetched July Brent -2 cents a day earlier.</p>
<p>But despite the high number fetched by the benchmark crude, which has been making gains since the start of May to the chagrin of refiners who saw margins dwindle, the short-term outlook for Brent was a few cents below Friday's level.</p>
<p>&quot;The outlook is fairly on the strong side...but this may be overdoing it,&quot; one trader said commenting on Friday's figure.</p>
<p>&quot;European demand is not that strong and freight rates are still high,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>A Gullfaks A loading June 12 was sold by a Norwegian major at Dated Brent -11 cents -- a &quot;good price&quot;, as one trader put it, for the grade that usually trades at lower numbers.</p>
<p>At least two other deals were reported done in Norwegian grades but they were private and confidential, traders said.</p>
<p>The Norwegian grades seem to have hit their stride, traders said, adding that the bad refining margins in Europe would cut demand for them.</p>
<p>&quot;I see a little bit of weakness but they will not be under any serious pressure...They will not come off too much,&quot; a trader said.</p>
