<headline>China's major rubber producer says hit by imports.</headline>

<p>China's Hainan Nongkeng (Group) Co, the biggest domestic natural rubber producer, has been hard hit by cheaper imports, a group official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are losing money now,&quot; the official said by telephone from Haikou, capital of the southern island.</p>
<p>China's natural rubber prices had fallen 4,000 yuan ($482) per tonne as of mid-May from a year ago, while prices of synthetic rubber were down by 3,000 yuan over the same period, the Chemical Industry News said.</p>
<p>The slump in rubber prices had cost the company 600 million yuan in lost revenues, the official said.</p>
<p>Current ex-factory prices of Nongkeng stood at about 10,000 yuan per tonne excluding tax, the official said. Prices were estimated at over 10,700 yuan if taxes were included.</p>
<p>Nongkeng's production costs have reached about 12,000 yuan because of rising payments on bank interest and benefits to retired workers, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some importers have been selling natural rubber at 11,200 yuan per tonne, the official said, adding this could mean that a five percent import duty and a 17 percent value-added tax were not being paid.</p>
<p>He did not give any specific instances but he said that export processors could sell rubber -- originally imported for processing and re-export -- on the domestic market without the full tax payment. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>&quot;They should have to sell at 13,768 yuan if they paid import duty and taxes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nongkeng plans to produce 210,000 tonnes of natural rubber in 1997, he said. Output was 180,000 tonnes in 1996 and 203,000 tonnes in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Rubber prices are unlikely to fall further,&quot; the official said, adding that any recovery would depend on a boost in prices by big producing countries.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard to predict when prices will eventually pick up,&quot; said an official of the State Materials Reserves Bureau, the central reserve body.</p>
<p>China's natural rubber prices were expected to fluctuate between 10,000-11,000 yuan for some time before gaining ground, he said.</p>
<p>The central reserve so far this year has not received any government instructions to purchase rubber in the domestic market, the official said.</p>
<p>China imported 160,000 tonnes of natural rubber, including latex, in the first four months of this year, up by 15.5 percent from the same period of 1996, customs figure showed. Imports for April alone were 50,000 tonnes.</p>
