<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair met European leaders on Friday promising a new constructive approach to Europe but no surrender of control over the island nation's borders.</p>
<p>&quot;It's absolutely essential that Britain retains control of its own borders,&quot; Blair said as he arrived for Friday's informal European summit designed to let other leaders get to know Blair after his landslide election victory.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we want to be constructive players in Europe, but we will stand up absolutely and firmly for British interests,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Borders are one of the key issues in a rewrite of Europe's treaties designed to prepare the bloc for the entry of new member states from the east.</p>
<p>Blair, who swept to power on May 1 after 18 years of Conservative rule, has just three weeks left to shape the new treaty before the Amsterdam summit where it must be agreed.</p>
<p>In a bitter election campaign, Conservative members of parliament warned that Blair would cave in to European pressure and give away British sovereignty.</p>
<p>But Blair, emboldened by a huge parliamentary majority, is determined not just to protect British interests but to set out his new vision for the bloc in the same way he has done for his revitalised Labour Party.</p>
<p>Showing none of the timidity of a first-time summit participant, Blair said as he entered the Dutch seaside hotel where the summit is being held that he had a strong message for his fellow leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;We will also be saying to all our European partners that it's important that Europe itself focuses on those things that clearly matter to people; jobs, competitiveness, the environment; the basic issues that will determine whether Europe is a success,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Blair's first meeting before the start of the summit proper was with other left-of-centre leaders.</p>
<p>Labour has said that one of its key strategies will be to form broad alliances with like-minded parties in Europe, something that ousted prime minister John Major failed to do.</p>
<p>But Blair will also be seeking to soothe the ruffled feathers of Italy's Christian Democrat Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who took offence when the new British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Britain wanted to take its place as a key European player alongside France and Germany.</p>
<p>Aides have said that no snub to Italy was intended and that Blair would be stressing this.</p>
<p>But European Commission President Jacques Santer is likely to receive a frostier reception when he meets Blair for one-to-one talks on Friday.</p>
<p>Labour was angered when Santer made a speech during the election campaign attacking critics of closer European integration. Senior party sources described the speech as &quot;unhelpful&quot;.</p>
<p>Aides said on Thursday Blair's message that the EU had to refocus was aimed at its &quot;elites&quot; who had lost touch with the people of Europe -- a group which was clearly intended to include Santer.</p>
<p>European leaders were generally delighted at the change of leadership in London after years in which the British government -- under the influence of anti-European &quot;Eurosceptics&quot; -- had become increasingly obstructive.</p>
<p>Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen said as he went into the summit that Blair's election had been been &quot;enormously helpful&quot;. His fellow social democrat, Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson, added: &quot;We have already seen now that it is easier to negotiate.&quot;</p>
