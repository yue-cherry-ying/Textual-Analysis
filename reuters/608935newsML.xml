<p>A Mexican journalist murdered earlier this week warned in a letter written before his death that government officials or pro-government journalists could have him killed.</p>
<p>Jesus Bueno Leon, whose bullet-riddled body was found in western Mexico on Thursday, said in a letter obtained by Reuters on Friday that his work had angered officials in his troubled home state of Guerrero.</p>
<p>Bueno, director at the regional weekly Siete Dias, listed seven possible leads for police to investigate in his case, but placed overall responsibility for his death on Guerrero Governor Angel Aguirre Rivero.</p>
<p>&quot;Someone confided to me -- someone in a position to know -- ...to watch out. I think they want to punish you. He was referring, obviously, to Aguirre Rivero, or judicial police. For that reason, I place public blame on Gov. Angel Aguirre Rivero,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>Bueno, whose work aimed at denouncing government corruption had created conflict with officials, urged police to investigate Aguirre Rivero as well as the state's former interior minister Jose Ruben Robles Catalan.</p>
<p>&quot;I would start the investigation with Jose Ruben Robles Catalan...,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>Bueno was found dead on a rural road close to the city of Chilpancingo some 120 miles (200 km) south of Mexico City.</p>
<p>&quot;I write these lines -- which I leave in case anything should happen to me, my children, or my family in general -- to testify ... to recent events in my work as a journalist that have led to spats with high-ranking government officials and even other members of the journalistic profession,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>Chilpancingo is the state capital of Guerrero, a southern state with guerrilla activity, widespread kidnappings and frequent political and social unrest.</p>
<p>Bueno pointed to two journalists, one foreign and the other who works or worked for the newspaper, El Reportero. He said they had published articles attacking his work, and called for investigations of them and their ties to various state politicians.</p>
<p>Mexico's National Union of Journalists said two months ago its members had asked Angel Aguirre to protect Bueno after the journalist had received death threats.</p>
<p>In a press release from the state government of Guerrero, dated May 22, the governor Aguirre Rivero expressed his profound consternation and condemned the slaying.</p>
<p>&quot;The governor Aguirre Rivero wants to emphasise and make clear that his government is not persecuting nor harassing any journalist and is asking for help to denounce anyone breaking the law,&quot; the state government said in a press release.</p>
