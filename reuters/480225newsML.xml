<p>Singapore marked the deregulation of its cellular phone and paging markets on Tuesday by scrapping licence fees for mobile phones and with signs growing of a price war between messaging companies.</p>
<p>Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan told a glitzy ceremony to launch one of the island's three new paging services that the government would remove licence fees for all portable phones, saving users between Singapore $50 (US$34.72) and S$100 a year.</p>
<p>Total savings would be around S$23 million a year, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This move, together with the new competition regime, will make mobile telecommunication services even more accessible to users,&quot; Mah said.</p>
<p>The Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (TAS) said in a statement the cut would affect 440,000 mobile phone users, 1,100 mobile data system users and 12,000 trunked radio users.</p>
<p>Singapore's mobile phone and paging markets were opened to full competition for the first time on Tuesday.</p>
<p>State-owned Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (SingTel) has lost its monopoly and now faces one competitor, MobileOne, in the mobile phone market and three pager services.</p>
<p>The deregulation was marked by a series of full-page advertisements in Singapore's daily and evening newspapers offering a range of cut-price offers to lure new and existing customers to the new mobile phone and paging services.</p>
<p>In another move to boost competition in the local telecoms market, TAS announced it would give S$100 million in grants to local telecommunications companies to improve their networks and help them compete in the global telecoms market.</p>
<p>TAS said the grants, for projects including those which encouraged technology transfers by foreign firms, would help Singapore's telecommunications infrastructure stay world-class.</p>
<p>Mah was officiating at the launch of Sunpage, a unit of the state-owned Singapore Technologies conglomerate.</p>
<p>Sunpage used a laser show, fireworks, giant balloons and psychedelic lighting to reveal the cheapest rates yet for basic paging services and a range of more sophisticated services to attack the growing messaging and secretarial paging market.</p>
<p>Sunpage's rates start at Singapore $9.80 a month, against S$9.90 for new competitor Hutchison Paging and S$15 for SingTel.</p>
<p>Sunpage general manager Yong Lum Sung told Reuters its low prices aimed at taking a third of a deregulated Singapore market he said could grow to around 1.5 million pagers.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very aggressive. We aim to get about 30 percent of the market in three to five years,&quot; Yong said in an interview.</p>
<p>Singapore has one of the world's highest pager usage rates with 34 pagers for every 100 people and some forecasts predict penetration rates could rise to 50 percent, Mah said.</p>
<p>But Yong said intense price competition in the new open market could mean all players would suffer, and warned his rivals not to risk setting off a full-blown price war.</p>
<p>Hutchison Paging is a joint venture of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, Intraco Ltd and Teledata.</p>
<p>The other new paging firm is MobileOne, a joint venture of Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless, Hong Kong Telecom, Keppel Telecom and Singapore Press Holdings.</p>
<p>Tan Guong Ching, the chairman of Singapore Technologies Telemedia (STT), told the Sunpage launch his firm hoped to get a full basic telecommunications licence in Singapore when that market is opened in April 2000.</p>
<p>STT has joined with state-owned utility Singapore Power, British Telecommunications Plc and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) to bid for a licence.</p>
<p>Mah has said the government will award one or two basic telecommunications licences to compete with SingTel next year.</p>
<p>MobileOne postponed a quayside party to launch its mobile phones and pagers on Monday after rain drove the crowds away and high wind set off fireworks prematurely, The New Paper reported.</p>
