<p>President Bill Clinton said on Tuesday he was &quot;prepared personally to do anything I can&quot; to rescue the Middle East peace process, possibly including a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got to try to keep the lid on things over there ... It is not going to be easy,&quot; Clinton said, referring to increasingly violent clashes between Israelis and Palestinians and the stalling of negotiations.  </p>
<p>Clinton told reporters shortly after a White House meeting with King Hussein of Jordan that he and the king had traded ideas on how to restore an environment of security and confidence between Israel and the Palestinians. Violence has broken out in the West Bank and Gaza in recent days.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm prepared personally to do anything I can to get this process back on track and move it forward, but I think the less I say about it the more likely I am to have some success in doing that,&quot; Clinton said. He said he was &quot;encouraged by what I would have to call creative thinking on the part of all the parties involved and I would include the Israelis and the Palestinians in that.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he looked forward to meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if Netanyahu comes to Washington this weekend to confer with representatives of the American Jewish community.</p>
<p>A White House official had said earlier it was not certain if Netanyahu would make the trip, but Clinton said, &quot;I undertand he's coming and I certainly hope to see him. I expect to see him ... I think its important for us to talk and I'm glad he's coming.&quot;</p>
