<headline>Marks &amp; Spencer plans clothing mail order.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>British high street retail chain Marks and Spencer Plc said on Tuesday it plans to expand its mail order operations into clothing catalogues by the spring of next year.</p>
<p>&quot;In response to the increasing desire for customers to shop from home, as well as from stores, regional trials will feature select ranges of adult clothing,&quot; the company said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Marks and Spencer, with five million holders of its M&amp;S account cards, has developed over the past 10 years a business delivering furnishings, flowers, hampers and wine direct to customers' homes, with a turnover totalling 85 million pounds ($139.4 million).</p>
<p>Business clothing is already sold through a catalogue, and a regional trial of Schoolwear mail order in 1996 will lead to a national campaign later this year, it said.</p>
<p>A facility is being built in Warrington, Cheshire, in northeast England, to handle the additional business and the company is recruiting staff with mail order experience to oversee future growth in this area.</p>
<p>Marks and Spencer last month said it had not yet decided on whether to expand its mail order operations. Last week, British retailer Sears Plc said it had agreed to talk exclusively to retail-to-football pools group Littlewoods LWD.CN on the sale of its Freemans home shopping arm, Britain's third largest mail order company. ($ = 0.609 British Pounds)</p>
