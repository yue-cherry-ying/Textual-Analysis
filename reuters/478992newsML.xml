<p>The Orient International (Holding) Co Ltd has won official designation as a conglomerate, giving it special financing privileges that will help it compete on overseas markets, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We selected Orient International mainly because of its business strength,&quot; said an official of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-based company became the second Chinese firm to win the designation, which allows the company to diversify into financing and investment. China National Chemicals Import and Export Corp (Sinochem) was the first such company.</p>
<p>China aims to build up its equivalent of powerful conglomerates along the lines of those in Japan and South Korea, the commission official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The state would give favourable treatment to us in share listings, setting up a financial subsidiary and in other areas,&quot; said an Orient International official, speaking from the firm's headquarters in Shanghai.  </p>
<p>The company, which is mainly involved in the trading of textiles, garments and machinery products, is considering listing shares in future, the official said without giving details.</p>
<p>Its pre-tax profits soared 192 percent to 110 million yuan in 1996 on total sales of 30 billion yuan. Exports reached $1.83 billion and imports were $870 million in 1996, the official said.</p>
<p>Total assets of the firm stood at 8.0 billion yuan at the end of 1996, including its 16 wholly-owned subsidiaries, he said.</p>
