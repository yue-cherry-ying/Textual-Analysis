<p>Laurent Kabila's decision not to appoint a prime minister in the Democratic Republic of Congo on Friday is the latest major development in the country. Kabila's forces took the capital on May 17, ending seven months of civil war in the former Zaire.</p>
<p>Here is a chronology of major events:</p>
<p>1996</p>
<p>Oct 7: Deputy governor of Zaire's South Kivu province tells 300,000-strong Banyamulenge community -- ethnic Tutsis settled in the region for generations -- to leave Zaire within a week or &quot;be hunted down as rebels&quot;. Warning sparks a revolt.</p>
<p>Oct 24: Rebels seize their first major town, Uvira at the northern end of Lake Tanganyika. Six days later they seize Bukavu, capital of South Kivu province.</p>

<p>Nov 14: Rebels bombard Mugunga, Zaire's biggest refugee camp, with rockets, mortars and heavy artillery for six hours.</p>
<p>Nov 15: Exodus of frightened Rwandan Hutu refugees from Mugunga and other camps. Up to 700,000 refugees return to Rwanda, the remainder flee west with armed Hutu hardliners blamed for 1994 genocide of minority Tutsis there.</p>
<p>Nov 24: Zaire marks 31 years of Mobutu's rule; Mobutu is in Europe where he had been since cancer surgery in Switzerland in August.</p>

<p>April 8 : Mobutu declares nationwide state of emergency.</p>
<p>April 9 : Rebels capture Zaire's second city of Lubumbashi, capital of mineral-rich Shaba province; Mobutu shunts aside Tshisekedi, names General Likulia Bolongo prime minister.</p>
<p>April 14: Tshisekedi supporters close down capital Kinshasa for two days as part of campaign to oust Mobutu.</p>

<p>April 30: Relief agencies begin airlift to Rwanda.</p>
<p>May 4: Ship-borne talks between Kabila and Mobutu hosted by South Africa's Nelson Mandela end inconclusively; ninety-one refugees crushed to death on train from Biaro, 41 km south of Kisangani.</p>
<p>May 13: Night-time curfew declared in Kinshasa.</p>
<p>May 14: Second ship-borne meeting between Kabila and Mobutu cancelled when rebel leader failed to attend.</p>
<p>May 15: Mandela, after meeting Kabila in Cape Town, says Mobutu wants four days' grace to study South African proposals for an orderly handover of power to the rebels.</p>
