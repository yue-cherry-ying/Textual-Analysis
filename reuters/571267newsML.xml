<p>President Fernando Henrique Cardoso celebrated Wednesday his biggest victory in the government's drive to reduce its influence over the Brazilian economy, after successfully selling a controling stake in mining giant Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD).</p>
<p>Valepar, an international consortium led by Brazil's largest steelmaker CSN, paid $3.15 billion for 41.73 percent of CVRD voting stock in an auction on the Rio de Janeiro stock exchange Tuesday.</p>
<p>The auction, to be followed by a share offer to CVRD employees and by a global public offer, kicked off the biggest privatisation in Latin America.</p>
<p>It is expected to net the government at least $5 billion, with roughly two-thirds of that coming from financing abroad.</p>
<p>The $2 billion expected to flow into Brazil this month to help finance the purchase of the CVRD stake will pad foreign reserves and alleviate some current account worries, analysts said.</p>
<p>Planning Minister Antonio Kandir said half of the receipts from Tuesday's auction would go toward paying off debt, while the other half would be spent on infrastructure projects across Brazil.</p>
<p>Analysts hailed the auction as a milestone for economic reform in Brazil, saying Latin America's biggest country was sending the world an important message by showing its commitment to economic liberalisation and modernisation.</p>
<p>However, legal headaches which have dogged the privatisation from the start are expected to plague the new controlling shareholders of CVRD for years to come.</p>
<p>A flood of lawsuits and court injunctions against the sell-off managed to delay the auction for a week from its original date of April 29 and continued to pour in even as the hammer went down on the CVRD deal.</p>
<p>Legal experts said it could take anywhere from two to 10 years to hear all the challenges to the CVRD sale, but they did not believe the lawsuits could reverse the outcome of the auction.</p>
<p>CSN Chairman Benjamin Steinbruch, dubbed by Wednesday's newspapers as Brazil's new &quot;King of Steel&quot;, said he was confident any legal obstacles would be overcome.</p>
<p>Analysts said Valepar, which was funded by NationsBank Corp., Citibank, financier George Soros and local pension funds, would directly or indirectly control up to 80 percent of Brazilian steel production.</p>
<p>Besides managing the world's largest iron ore mine, CVRD has a stake in all the major Brazilian steelmakers including CSN. Steinbruch rejected speculation he might be planning to build a vast steel and iron ore holding, saying CVRD and CSN would continue to operate independently.</p>
<p>He also said the new management would not carry out any &quot;abrupt&quot; changes in CVRD and had no plans to split up the firm.</p>
<p>Steinbruch said he was &quot;comfortable&quot; with the price paid for CVRD, which was too high for rival consortium Valecom composed of Brazil's Votorantim group, South Africa's Anglo-American Corp. and a group of Japanese investors.</p>
<p>The stockmarket, however, was disappointed with the auction price as traders expected a higher premium than the 20 percent Valepar paid above the base price of $25 per share.</p>
