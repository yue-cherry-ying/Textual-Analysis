<p>A proposed constitutional amendment to protect the American flag from being burned or suffering other forms of desecration was approved by a House subcommittee Thursday.</p>
<p>The amendment would overturn a Supreme Court decision which found that burning the U.S. flag was a form of political protest protected by the Constitution's free speech provisions.</p>
<p>&quot;The American flag represents the very fabric of our nation -- the freedom, democracy and justice upon which our great nation was built,&quot; Representative Charles Canady, the chairman of the Constitution subcommittee, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;This amendment gives Congress the power to protect the American flag from physical desecration, giving our national symbol the respect it deserves,&quot; Canady, a Florida Republican, added.</p>
<p>The amendment was approved on a voice vote of the 13 subcommittee members and sent to the full Judiciary Committee. Canady said he expected the full House to vote on the amendment by mid-June just before Flag Day June 14.</p>
<p>The amendment was considered in previous sessions of Congress but never got the required two-thirds majority vote needed in both the House and Senate to send it to the states for ratification.</p>
