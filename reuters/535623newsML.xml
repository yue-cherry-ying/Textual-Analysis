<p>Some Indian pilgrims killed when a fire swept through a tent camp in Saudi Arabia may have been prevented from escaping because of the actions of a camp guard, the Indian embassy in Riyadh said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe a gatekeeper prevented some of the Indian haj pilgrims from leaving the camp when the blaze started,&quot; said an Indian diplomat at the embassy.</p>
<p>&quot;Gatekeepers work for Mutawef groups (equivalent to tour operators)...they are not Saudi officials,&quot; the diplomat said.</p>
<p>Mutawefs in Saudi Arabia organise travel, lodging and catering for pilgrims as well as guiding them through haj rituals.</p>
<p>Riyadh has said 343 died and more than 1,500 were injured in the April 15 blaze which raged through 70,000 tents erected for pilgrims at Mena near the Islamic holy city of Mecca.</p>
<p>India's ambassador to Saudi Arabia on Thursday said that 55 Indians were now confirmed dead and another 247 missing.</p>
<p>&quot;The dead are 55. The missing are 247. Persons who are injured but who are staying in their normal place of stay is 163 and persons who are in hospital are 191, but I am waiting for an update on that (last figure),&quot; India's Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mohammad Hamad Ansari told Reuters.</p>
<p>Identifying the bodies has been made difficult as many had been charred beyond recognition, diplomats and officials said.</p>
<p>Witnesses of the fire said many victims burnt to death, others suffocated from the deadly fumes while some were crushed by a stampede as panic gripped the pilgrims.</p>
<p>Some diplomats said the week-old death toll could end up higher than already announced in view of the critical condition of some victims being treated at Saudi hospitals.</p>
<p>About 80,000 Indians performed the haj this year.</p>
