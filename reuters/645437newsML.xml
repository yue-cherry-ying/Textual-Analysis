<p>Motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson Inc increased its production rate slightly so far in 1997 to about 525 to 530 units per day from 520 at the end of 1996, chief executive Richard Teerlink said in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;That's increased slightly -- 525, 530,&quot; Teerlink told Reuters after a ceremony here to dedicate the company's new Willie G. Davidson product development center.</p>
<p>The Milwaukee-based company has previously stated it will have the capacity to produce at least 130,000 units in 1997, as it moves toward a goal of more than 200,000 units by the end of 2003. In 1996, it made 118,771 motorcycles.</p>
<p>Harley-Davidson had a 48.2 percent share of the heavyweight motorcycle market last year, up from 47.7 percent in 1995. While it is too soon to measure with certainty what is happening in 1997, Teerlink said, &quot;We've had some increase in market share. I can't tell you exactly what that is.... last year, we gained market share. The market grew, we grew. We're contemplating growing again this year in units.&quot;</p>
<p>He declined to comment on whether the company could reach 50 percent of the market this year. &quot;We know we're going to sell every unit that we manufacture. That's really the most important thing.&quot;</p>
<p>A new manufacturing facility being built in Kansas City, Mo., and scheduled to be running in 1998 has not encountered problems so far, Teerlink said. &quot;It's right on schedule.&quot;</p>
<p>Teerlink declined to comment on earnings estimates but reiterated an anticipation for double-digit growth.</p>
<p>&quot;One thing we've said about the future is that we anticipate double-digit growth in the revenue line, double-digit growth in the profit line, and that we anticipate the growth is going to be higher on the profit line than it is on the revenue line, and that operating margins should be the same.&quot;</p>
<p>Revenues were $1.53 billion in 1996 with net income of $143.4 million or $1.90 per share from continuing operations before extraordinary items and accounting changes.</p>
<p>The new $25 million product development center here will house about 400 employees, mostly engineers, and is equipped with eight state of the art labs. Teerlink said results are already being seen. &quot;This is a very high-tech facility that will cut our cycle time down in product development,&quot; he said.</p>
