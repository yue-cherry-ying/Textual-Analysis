<p>Attorney General Janet Reno confirmed on Thursday an investigation was under way involving an intercepted conversation that suggested Israel may have an intelligence source who can obtain sensitive U.S. information.</p>
<p>&quot;We have an ongoing investigation, so I can't comment,&quot; Reno said at her weekly Justice Department news briefing.</p>
<p>She was responding to a question on whether there was any concern about the investigation into possible Israeli penetration of the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Reno also was asked if she was concerned that transcripts of the conversation from the super-secret U.S. National Security Agency had been printed by the news media and whether there was an investigation into who leaked the information.</p>
<p>Justice Department officials later said Reno's reference to an ongoing investigation involved the possible Israeli security breach, not an investigation into the disclosure of the probe by the Washington Post on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Reno and the officials declined to give any details of the investigation.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, Israel has flatly denied the FBI was probing whether a senior U.S. government official had been passing highly sensitive information to the Israeli government.</p>
<p>But the New York Times on Thursday, quoting unamed U.S. officials, also confirmed the probe. It said results of the investigation so far have been &quot;inconclusive&quot; and that one official suggested the FBI had not identified any suspects.</p>
<p>The Post said the investigation was launched in January after the National Security Agency intercepted a secure communication between a senior Israeli intelligence officer in Washington and a superior in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>The communication referred to someone codenamed &quot;Mega&quot; and an attempt to obtain a sensitive American document, a letter from then Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, the Post reported.</p>
<p>The Post said the content of the conversation led U.S. officials to believe Mega may be someone in the U.S. government who had provided information to Israel in the past.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, Israeli media and experts on Thursday suggested a misunderstanding over the codename &quot;Mega&quot; was to blame.</p>
<p>&quot;I can tell you that I know the facts, know the truth. When the truth becomes clear, I believe everyone will understand how false and ludicrous the story is,&quot; said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet secretary Danny Naveh.</p>
<p>Israel's Haaretz newspaper said Mega was apparently a mistaken decoding of &quot;Elga&quot; -- an old Israeli intelligence word for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
