<title>USA: FCC suspends payment deadline for wireless firms.</title>
<headline>FCC suspends payment deadline for wireless firms.</headline>

<p>Companies that won wireless phone licenses at a $10.2 billion federal auction last year got financial relief late Monday after regulators suspended a deadline for the companies to make payments on the licenses.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission suspended the March 31 deadline indefinitely while it considers a request from some of the biggest auction winners for a more lenient timetable to make interest payments on the money owed for the licenses.</p>
<p>The FCC also noted it is considering whether to hand over to another federal agency, such as the Treasury Department, the job of collecting the payments. Industry officials support such a move.</p>
<p>NextWave Telecom Inc., Pocket Communications Inc. and seven other license winners formally asked the FCC in March for permission to make the interest payments on an annual basis instead of quarterly.</p>
<p>The companies are under financial strain from the large payments and a dearth of Wall Street financing. Investors are cool toward companies wanting to offer &quot;personal communications services,&quot; or PCS.</p>
<p>NextWave's winning bids totalled $4.7 billion -- making it the No. 1 bidder -- while Washington-based Pocket's added up to $1.4 billion. Pocket was the No. 2 winner.</p>
<p>The companies hope any additional time between interest payments would stimulate investor confidence.</p>
<p>PCS technology is expected to make the wireless phone a mass-market product, allowing consumers to use different communications services -- such as phone, paging, fax and Internet access -- through a single handheld device.</p>
