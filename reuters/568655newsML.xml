<p>Fifth seed Byron Black of Zimbabwe was upset by little-known American Steve Campbell 3-6 6-4 6-3 in the second round Wednesday at the America's Red Clay Tennis Championship.</p>
<p>It marked the second consecutive week that the 193rd-ranked Campbell, a qualifier here, posted a big win. At last week's tournament in Atlanta, Campbell ousted former world number one Jim Courier in the first round.</p>
<p>In another second-round match, top seed Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden breezed past 663rd-ranked wildcard recipient Luke Jensen of the United States 6-1 6-2.</p>
<p>The 23rd-ranked Bjorkman never offered Jensen a chance to break his serve in the 56 minute match.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt very good,&quot; Bjorkman said. &quot;I was hitting the ball well and it was great conditions, perfect weather for a match. I was very confident at the start of the match and kept rolling.&quot;</p>
<p>Campbell claims that clay courts are his &quot;least favourite&quot; surface but after his recent success &quot;kind of likes it now.&quot;</p>
<p>Returning to the tour this year after nearly a year off with tendinitis of the left knee, Campbell plays an intelligent game and covers the court well.</p>
<p>&quot;The court was very slippery which kind of gave me the upper hand on points,&quot; Campbell said. &quot;My biggest advantage was playing a good defensive game. I think that frustrated him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's funny, I was feeling pretty much in control the whole match,&quot; the 64th-ranked Black said. &quot;It's very frustrating. He moves unbelievably well. He makes you hit one more shot. I was just beating up on myself.&quot;</p>
<p>After dominating the first set, Black squandered four break point opportunities in the first game of the second set. The last three games of the set were service breaks with Campbell breaking serve in the eighth and 10th game.</p>
<p>Black seemed on the road to victory went he went up 2-1 with a service break in the third set but could not hold on to the advantage, losing his serve in the sixth and eighth games.</p>
