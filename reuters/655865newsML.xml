<p>Four South African missionaries have been evacuated from Brazzaville and are expected to return home at the weekend, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Pretoria has no diplomatic mission in Congo and has struggled to trace its nationals during a week of fierce clashes between forces loyal to the president and a former Marxist military ruler.</p>
<p>Revising its numbers upward, the ministry said the French military had helped evacuate 10 South African businessmen and four missionaries from the Jesus Alive Ministries from Brazzaville to the Gabonese capital of Libreville.</p>
<p>&quot;Arrangements have been made for this group of four to fly back to South Africa on Sunday,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Another five South Africans were traced in the Congolese coastal city of Pointe Noire, but said they were far from the fighting and did not need assistance.</p>
<p>A group of 42 South African farmers living in the Congo's Niari valley, 350 km (220 miles) north of Brazzaville, had also reported no fighting.</p>
<p>The South African oil and chemicals firm Sasol Ltd made its own arrangements to withdraw four staff this week.</p>
<p>France, Congo's former colonial ruler, has 1,250 troops evacuating foreigners from Brazzaville.</p>
