<p>Guatemalan officials said on Friday they would bring formal charges next week against three Swiss men who are in jail in Guatemala under suspicion of drug trafficking.</p>
<p>&quot;A judge will hear statements in the case on Tuesday. I don't know what the exact charges will be until after the hearing,&quot; public prosecutor Jose Alberto Lopez told Reuters.</p>
<p>Police have arrested Andreas Haenggi, head of a Nestle foodstuffs factory in Guatemala since 1993, his son, Nicolas, and an Italian-born Swiss citizen, Silvio Geovanelli.</p>
<p>Lopez said a first hearing in the case was cancelled on Friday because the men did not yet have lawyers.</p>
<p>According to the prosecutor the three men used a phantom company, Geovanelli's plant and flower export business, to export drugs. He also confirmed investigators were looking into whether Nestle facilities were used to support the alleged drug operation.</p>
<p>In Zurich on Thursday, Nestle said it had no reason to doubt the integrity of Andreas Haenggi, who had worked for the company for 20 years.</p>
<p>Investigators are working to establish that the men were part of a ring that operated for three to five years and exported large quantities of drugs to Europe. Lopez said he could not say how much cocaine the alleged drug ring moved over the years.</p>
<p>Police also arrested a Guatemalan, Antigua police chief Jose Luis Sebadua.</p>
<p>Tuesday's hearing will be held in the Caribbean port city of Puerto Barrios where police investigations began into the case four months ago, Lopez said.</p>
<p>Prison authorities transferred Andreas and Nicolas Haenggi from a jail in Guatemala City to the Puerto Barrios jail on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>In April in Puerto Barrios police seized 30 pounds (13 kg) of cocaine hidden in an ornamental plant shipment destined for Germany.</p>
<p>In July, German authorities arrested two Germans, Harmut Zersch and Deiter Chomsi, who received another shipment of cocaine allegedly sent by the Guatemalan ring via Spain.</p>
