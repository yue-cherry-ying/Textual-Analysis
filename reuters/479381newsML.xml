<p>Billionaire Paul Allen savored his first victory Monday in his quest for a publicly funded football stadium in Seattle.</p>
<p>In a narrow voice vote, a state Senate panel approved -- and sent to the full Senate -- a package of specialty taxes to tear down Seattle's much-maligned Kingdome and build an open-air stadium in its place. Less than three weeks ago, the same committee rejected a similar package 18-3.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the momentum has been building for the governor's latest package,&quot; said Bert Kolde, vice chairman of Allen's Football Northwest. Kolde said some lawmakers were persuaded to change their votes by a provision that calls for a statewide referendum.</p>
<p>&quot;This entire plan requires a vote of the people. It will be placed on the ballot June 3,&quot; noted state Sen. Jim West during perfunctory committee debate.</p>
<p>The current version of a plan pushed by Democratic Gov. Gary Locke would pay for the new stadium with lottery scratch ticket games, a wholesale tax on sports logo-bearing items, and stadium admissions and parking taxes.</p>
<p>Allen, the multibillionaire co-founder of Microsoft Corp., would contribute $100 million toward the total project cost of $425 million.</p>
<p>Locke made personal appeals to senators of both parties in separate closed-door meetings Monday morning.</p>
<p>Allen's lobbyists indicated the billionaire is willing to be flexible on his looming stadium ultimatum. Early in March, Allen issued a strongly worded statement in which he threatened to walk away from his option to purchase the struggling Seahawks football team unless the legislature approved a new stadium by Thursday.</p>
<p>The full Senate could vote by Wednesday, but then the measure has to wind its way through the House.</p>
<p>&quot;You never change the deadline until you get past it,&quot; was the way Allen's chief lobbyist Forrest &quot;Bud&quot; Coffey described the billionaire's attitude.</p>
