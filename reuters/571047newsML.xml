<p>U.S. firm Andersen Consulting has been asked to evaluate operations and management at Japan's troubled state-run nuclear power company, an official of the Science and Technology Agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The request was made by the Japanese government agency, which oversees the operations of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC).</p>
<p>&quot;It's Anderson (that we've asked to make a study) and we are about to sign a contract,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>He added that the two parties hoped to reach a conclusion and make an announcement by the end of this week or early next.</p>
<p>Andersen's findings will be part of a larger study of potential PNC reforms underway by a special government panel, the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The panel itself hopes to reach some kind of a decision by the summer,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>An Andersen spokeswoman said that the deal was still being considered by the Japanese government.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a fact that we did submit a proposal, but we haven't heard anything at this point,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Andersen Consulting is a multibillion dollar global management and technology consultancy that works with clients from a wide range of industries.</p>
<p>A PNC spokesman said that the company had received an unofficial notice from the Science and Technology Agency about the consultancy work.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been told that a company, which we believe is a consulting firm, has been hired to make a (study of PNC) as part of the investigation being undertaken by the agency,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we will be cooperating with the effort, which will be rather like giving the company a health check,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A growing list of accidents and cover-ups has placed PNC under intense public scrutiny in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Government officials said on Wednesday they were considering the permanent closure of PNC's Monju prototype fast breeder nuclear reactor on the Sea of Japan coast.</p>
<p>The 280,000 kilowatt reactor was closed last December after an accident involving the leakage of an estimated two to three tonnes of liquid sodium from a cooling system.</p>
<p>In March, a PNC-run nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in Tokaimura on the Pacific coast was the scene of Japan's worst-ever nuclear accident when an explosion exposed 37 workers to low levels of radiation.</p>
<p>Later it was revealed that the chief investigator of Japan's top nuclear agency deliberately destroyed photographs of the accident.</p>
