<p>Poland's grain harvest in 1997 may be up to 1.3 million tonnes smaller than last year's 24.7 million tonnes, but large state reserves will keep grain prices stable and curb import needs, a senior government-linked analyst said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Michal Kisiel, the author of the bi-annual grain markets report for the Agriculture Ministry, told Reuters in an interview that Poland's 1997 grain output should be 23.4 to 24.5 million tonnes, against demand of 26.2 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Given large-scale winter damage, smaller sowing areas and a delayed spring...Poland may have a grain deficit of up to 2.8 million tonnes -- in the worst-case scenario,&quot; Kisiel said.</p>
<p>&quot;However, this does not mean that (local) grain markets will be destabilised or that prices will rise because Poland's (state-held) grain reserves are at a record high,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said the state would hold an estimated 4.0 to 4.5 million tonnes of grain reserves after this year's harvest.</p>
<p>Official grain reserve data is not given by the government.</p>
<p>Kisiel said that after this year's harvest Poland would probably need to import only about 400,000 tonnes of the high-grade durum wheat which it buys abroad every year, because it is not grown in Poland.</p>
<p>Since July 1996 Poland has imported an estimated total of 3.3 million tonnes of all kinds of grain.</p>
<p>&quot;Imports on the recent high level will not continue in the near term, but there will still be demand for the high-gluten wheat imports,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Central Statistical Office (GUS) said 12 percent of Poland's winter grain and rapeseed crops was ruined over the winter, with about 600,000 hectares needing to be reploughed. That was up from last year's eight percent winter losses.</p>
<p>GUS also said winter wheat and rye were sown on 2.0 and 2.4 million hectares respectively, both about one percent less than the previous year.</p>
<p>Kisiel said spring grains would not be able to compensate for the weak winter crop because of the late spring and low water levels in the ground after a relatively snow-free winter would keep down yields per hectare this year.</p>
<p>He said Poland could potentially export about 200,000 tonnes of grains, mostly to the former Soviet republics, but domestic grain prices were too high to be competitive on world markets.</p>
<p>According to GUS figures wheat was sold for an average 528 zlotys ($167) per tonne in March, but Kisiel said wheat for human consumption sold for about 580 zlotys.</p>
<p>He said in the longer-term Poland was a potentially booming market for industrially produced animal feed, as small local farms specialise in animal production and conform to European Union (EU) standards.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand for mixed feeds is expected to rise to about six million tonnes in 2000 from about 3.5 million tonnes in the 1995/97 growing season as the quality of Poland's livestock comes closer to EU norms,&quot; he said. ($ = 3.153 Polish Zlotys)</p>
