<p>Red Cross talks between North and South Korea are expected to resume this month after they failed to reach agreement on food aid for the north at a meeting in Beijing this week, Seoul officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The officials said they were not discouraged by North Korean accusations that the South was insincere after the first contact between Red Cross representatives of the two countries in nearly five years ended in deadlock on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are optimistic the two sides will resume contacts this month,&quot; a senior Seoul government official said, asking not to be identified.</p>
<p>North Korea on Tuesday slammed South Korea for deadlock at the Beijing talks that were called to discuss speeding up food aid for the famished north, which is sliding into famine after being badly hit by floods in 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;No agreement was reached at the contact due to the South side's eccentric and incomprehensible attitude,&quot; Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is empty talk and a sheer waste of time to discuss the procedures and method of the offering with the South side's position remaining unclear,&quot; KCNA quoted a spokesman for the North Korean Red Cross as saying.</p>
<p>But an official with the South Korean Red Cross said: &quot;The Beijing talks were held in a friendly atmosphere despite what the North says publicly.&quot;</p>
<p>After formal talks ended, the two sides had a long dinner together and expressed understanding of each other's position.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, a breakdown is not a proper description of the Beijing talks. The two sides agreed to meet again and I'm pretty confident we will be successful.&quot;</p>
<p>The Beijing talks made no progress but the two sides agreed to use a telephone link at the Korean border village of Panmunjom for further dialogue.</p>
<p>The South Korean Red Cross had wanted to set up channels for direct delivery of relief supplies. The North sought a promise of an exact aid amount before discussing procedures, Red Cross officials said.</p>
<p>The South also wanted the grain to be handed over directly between the two Korean organisations rather than using the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies as a go-between as in past shipments of aid.</p>
<p>The North has said the talks would resume after the South decided on the amount of food aid it would give.</p>
<p>Lee Jong-geun, spokesman of the South Korean Red Cross, said his organisation could not give the exact amount of assistance because it would depend on how much South Korean citizens were willing to donate.</p>
<p>&quot;We will brief about 30 civic groups next Monday on the Beijing talks,&quot; Lee said. But he denied a local newspaper report that his organisation would try to compile commitments from each civic group to inform the North of the total size of aid.</p>
<p>&quot;Our delegates have explained our situation, including efforts by civic groups to raise donations for aid, to the Northern side. More preparatory works would also be informed to the North.&quot;</p>
<p>The Red Cross is the only route for private food donations from the South to the North.</p>
<p>Seoul officials have said they hope the Red Cross contacts will lead to better ties between the two Koreas, which have remained technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean War was halted by a truce rather than a peace treaty.</p>
