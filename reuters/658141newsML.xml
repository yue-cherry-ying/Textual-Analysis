<p>It's a tale of British dastardliness, Japanese cruelty and Chinese steadfast courage -- the history of Hong Kong as portrayed in a new play soon to be premiered in Shanghai to mark the territory's handover to Beijing on June 30.</p>
<p>&quot;We lived through this era, and we thought we should use our talents to do something to mark the event,&quot; said Liu Angu, actor and co-director of &quot;The Pearl Returns to the Sea&quot;.</p>
<p>The play, which follows the history of the British colony from the 1840s to the night of the handover, was written by 84-year-old Shanghai playwright Dong Xuan, who spent some years living in Hong Kong, Liu said in an interview on Thursday.</p>
<p>Opening night of an 11-day run in Shanghai will be June 26, and the organisers hope the production will be invited to Beijing and maybe Hong Kong for further performances.</p>
<p>The play covers several periods in Hong Kong's history through the eyes of a single family: Britain's takeover of Hong Kong in the 1840s as a spoil of the Opium War, British suppression of labour troubles in the mid-1920s, and the Japanese occupation in the early 1940s.</p>
<p>The play ends with Hong Kong's positive reaction to China's opening and reformist policies championed by the late leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a part of patriotic education,&quot; said Liu. &quot;Many young people know nothing about this history.&quot;</p>
<p>The acting company has been put together especially for the production, with performers ranging from seven years old to 84.</p>
<p>All are taking part for free.</p>
<p>Liu said there was nothing in the play about any contribution Britain might have made to the development of Hong Kong into the prosperous financial centre that is being handed back to China.</p>
<p>&quot;But I guess we could thank the British opium traders for building a foundation on which Hong Kong could become rich,&quot; he added.</p>
