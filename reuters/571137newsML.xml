<p>Singapore stock market weakened in quiet Thursday morning trade, dampened by Wall Street's 139-point fall overnight.</p>
<p>Dealers said sentiment was cautious after Wall Street failed to sustain recent gains and also ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan later tonight.</p>
<p>At 0230 GMT, the Straits Times Industrials Index was down 7.79 points at 2,060.34.</p>
<p>Dealers said activity was light with the Malaysia market closed for a holiday. Total market volume was around 45 million shares. There were 74 gainers to 113 losers.</p>
<p>Dominating the losers were mostly banking stocks like DBS, UOB and the foreign trnaches of OUB and OCBC.</p>
<p>One local dealer said despite recent declines, most banks remained &quot;pricey&quot;. The SES finance index fell 4.83 points or 0.93 percent to 512.42.</p>
<p>Uraco Holdings firmed two cents to S$0.86 in active trade of over 4.5 million after it said it had no dealings with CAM International Holdings, which is under investigation for fraud. Uraco holds slightly over six percent stake of CAM.</p>
