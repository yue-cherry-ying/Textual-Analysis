<p>Philippine shares ended higher for the third straight session amid light turnover on Friday despite a mild wave of profit-taking in late trading, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no more negative news, so far, so the market reacted (positively),&quot; said Harry Liu, president at Summit Securities.</p>
<p>The main index closed 11.51 points higher, or 0.44 percent, at 2,598.20. The index reached its intra-day high of 2,624.82 shortly after the opening bell.</p>
<p>&quot;Early on, the focus was on secondary and blue-chip issues. But the stars of the day were thirdliners,&quot; one dealer said.  </p>
<p>Traders said steady U.S. interest rates, improved first quarter agricultural growth and an absence of bad news prodded the recent uptick although volumes have been low.</p>
<p>&quot;I still think it's premature to say we are on the road to full recovery. Government is trying to paint a strong first quarter macroeconomic picture. There are some positioning on blue chips but overall, the volume is thin,&quot; said Saturnino Mejia, research head at Guoco Securities Phils Inc.</p>
<p>Turnover was light at 1.86 billion pesos, below the daily average of between 2.7 billion and 2.9 billion pesos.</p>
<p>Philippine TA Securities Inc said a sustained climb in share prices was unlikely unless supported by heavier volume, better corporate financial results and a positive first quarter GNP.</p>
