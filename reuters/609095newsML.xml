<p>Thai sugar premiums were slightly higher this week as the market expected more buying by China on the back of strong whites premiums, trade sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>Raws premiums for May/July deliveries were quoted around 0.55/0.65 cents/pound (bid/offer) over New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange (CSCE) futures on an FOB basis.</p>
<p>July/September deliveries were quoted at 0.50-0.60 cents/ pound over New York.</p>
<p>May whites premiums were quoted around $17 per tonne over London futures, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;With white-to-raw premium rising to almost $100 per tonne. China is expected to speed up its tolling,&quot; said one Thai shipper.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that Thailand has no more white sugar left in  stock, prices go up. Some of us watch China sell at such strong premiums with tears in the eyes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Thailand sold out of white sugar earlier in the season because of strong demand, mostly from Indonesia.</p>
<p>But some said premiums firmed also because some trading houses were chasing the prices up.</p>
<p>&quot;The premiums are expected to continue to firm near-term. But there is no strong fundamentals or foreseeable new leads that would sustain it,&quot; said a trader from a leading Japanese trading firm.</p>
<p>One vessel was at a port loading 14,000 tonnes of raw sugar for China while three others were scheduled to arrive later this month for deliveries to the same destination.</p>
<p>According to trade industry estimates, the balance of sugar that has not been exported this season could reach one million tonnes.</p>
<p>The 1996/97 crushing season has ended, with only seven out of 46 mills still open. White sugar produced in this period is for the domestic quota and not for exports.</p>
<p>Preliminary figures from the industry ministry showed that 56.19 million tonnes of sugar cane were crushed as of May 14 against 57.26 million in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Sugar output so far has totalled 5.78 million tonnes tel quel against 5.98 million during the corresponding period last year.</p>
<p>Thailand's sugar exports in January-April were estimated at 2.14 million tonnes tel quel, a sharp drop from 2.73 million tonnes during the same period last year, according to independent surveyors.</p>
