<p>Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi has denied the European Cup holders are seriously considering an offer for attacker Christian Vieri from Atletico Madrid, Italian newspapers reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We will never let Vieri go. Not now and not after the European Cup. For him 25 billion lire? It would be a small sum,&quot; Moggi was quoted as saying in La Gazzetta dello Sport.</p>
<p>Juventus vice-president Roberto Bettega had suggested on Wednesday that every player had his price after the Spanish club reportedly made an offer of 25 billion lire ($15 million) for the 23-year-old Italian international.</p>
<p>Moggi said Juventus would not go down the same road as last season when the club sold striker Fabrizio Ravanelli to English premier league side Middlesbrough for $11 million and Portuguese midfielder Paulo Sousa to German champions Borussia Dortmund.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is different to last year. We have constructed a young team which will last a while, therefore Vieri will stay with us,&quot; Moggi said.</p>
<p>&quot;Others left Juventus because they were a certain age, they didn't guarantee us a future, they couldn't keep up with our ambitions,&quot; he was quoted as saying by Tuttosport.</p>
<p>Vieri, who had a dream start in international soccer earlier this year when he scored in his debut for Italy against Moldova, told reporters he was thinking only of helping Juventus win the Italian league and retain the European Cup.</p>
<p>Moggi added that Yugoslav midfielder Vladimir Jugovic would also be staying with Juventus despite interest from Lazio.</p>
