<p>Latvian share volumes stayed low on Thursday with official list shares showing a mixed trend, dealers said.</p>
<p>Volume came to 76,000 lats compared with yesterday's 68,000 lats and the Rietumu index fell 1.86 percent to 171.86 and the Saule10 bank index slipped 1.63 percent to 147.38.</p>
<p>Unibanka came back on to the most active list and was by the most traded as it turned over 24,300 lats although it lost six santimes to 3.40 lats.</p>
<p>The rest of the market was very quiet with some dealers bemoaning the lack of activity of foreign investors.</p>
<p>However, Petri Karjalainen, director for Baltic securities at international investment house Williams de Broe, said that foreigners wanted to invest in Latvia but needed more shares.</p>
<p>&quot;From an international perspective, larger companies and blue chips are needed on the Baltic bourses,&quot; he told Reuters at a seminar on investment.</p>
<p>&quot;Latvia's market is still peanuts...it needs to have at least 10 new big companies before it will take off,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Staburadze, also on the official list, saw turnover of 9,500 lats and was stable at 2.70 lats while Daugavpils Chain on the secondary list turned over 9,000 lats and was stable at 2.44.</p>
