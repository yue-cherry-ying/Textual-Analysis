<p>A gunman shot and killed world-renowned fashion designer Gianni Versace outside his Miami Beach mansion on Tuesday in an execution-style killing that plunged the fashion world into shock and mourning.</p>
<p>Police believe he was deliberately targetted.</p>
<p>Versace, couturier to stars and royalty, was shot twice at point-blank range in the back of the head by a lone gunman who immediately ran away, police and witnesses said. He was left slumped on the steps of his mansion on trendy Ocean Drive with blood dripping from his wounds.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe he was targetted, yes,&quot; Miami Beach Police Chief Richard Barreto told a news conference. &quot;There was apparently no robbery attempt involved.&quot;</p>
<p>Shock and disbelief reverberated from the cafes of glitzy Miami Beach, an area he had helped revitalize, to the capitals of the fashion world over which he reigned.</p>
<p>&quot;My reaction is one of revolt against such an unnatural and violent death, and one of profound grief,&quot; Giorgio Armani, along with Versace one of Italy's top stylists, said in Rome.</p>
<p>Diana, Princess of Wales, said she was devastated.</p>
<p>Versace, 50 and a bachelor, symbolised Italian fashion to the world and dressed the likes of Diana, singers Madonna, Sting and Elton John, and actresses Demi Moore and Liz Hurley. He had built a multi-million-dollar empire after learning the basics of fashion from his mother</p>
<p>He was killed as he walked back to his white-walled, Mediterranean-style mansion from buying magazines at the News Cafe on Ocean Drive, a beach-front street of renovated art deco hotels and trendy restaurants.</p>
<p>Police said they were seeking a white man aged about 25 who approached Versace and shot him as he unlocked the gates. &quot;The information that we now have suggests that this terrible crime was an extraordinary occurrence and not just a random robbery,&quot; Dade County Mayor Alex Penelas, who has jurisdiction over the several cities making up Greater Miami, told the news conference. He gave no other details.</p>
<p>Barreto said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was taking part in the probe but did not confirm a local television report that FBI experts on contract killings had been brought in.</p>
<p>Eddie Bianchi, 50, the owner of a Rollerblade shop, told Reuters he was nearby when the shooting occurred.</p>
<p>&quot;We heard two shots. I saw people running. Gianni was on the stairs. He was shot twice in the head. We were trying to help Gianni on the floor, but we realized it was too late.&quot;</p>
<p>A News Cafe manager said Versace was his usual gracious self when he came there on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;There was nothing to detect any difference,&quot; Ryan Yorke told Reuters. Versace bought Newsweek, Entertainment Weekly, the New Yorker, People and American Books before leaving.</p>
<p>He was a regular at the 24-hour cafe, Yorke said.</p>
<p>&quot;He would come in the morning to get newspapers, sometimes he would have breakfast or lunch, most often alone. He would hang out, relax, chill out, watch the parade on Ocean Drive. &quot;He was always very gentle, unassuming, gracious, very private.&quot;</p>
<p>Miami Beach, a finger of land off the Florida mainland, is the center of Miami's swinging fashion and music industry. It has its own police force and city administration.</p>
<p>Globe-trotting Versace was not a permanent resident but frequently stayed at the mansion. He also made homes at exclusive addresses in Rome, New York, London, Milan and Paris.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no words to describe how I feel right now,&quot; said top designer Gianfrance Ferre. &quot;What happened is absurd, unexplainable, terrible...I feel only infinite pain.&quot;</p>
<p>Princess Diana, a friend who wore his clothes despite her preference for British designers, said in a statement from the south of France: &quot;I am devastated by the loss of this great and talented man.&quot;</p>
<p>Versace's early collections were classic, clean lines but he later began to explore brighter colors and designs inspired by the antiquity of ancient Greece.</p>
<p>At last week's &quot;haute couture&quot; shows in Paris, he showed a collection consisting largely of tight black dresses with heavily padded, angular shoulders which he characterized as &quot;a kind of Byzantine minimalism&quot; and &quot;neo-Japanese.&quot;</p>
<p>The grey-haired designer, who often sported stubble on his chin, was born on December 2, 1946. He moved to Milan at the age of 25 and drew his first pret-a-porter collection in 1972.</p>
<p>In 1978 he launched his own Gianni Versace label in a fashion show in Milan.</p>
<p>Versace had been in partnership with his brother Santo and was planning to issue public stock in the company, whose sales rose by 23.5 percent in 1996 to $483 million. But the murder seemed certain to derail any immediate plans to issue shares.</p>
<p>The killing was the second murder in as many years to stun the glamorous world of Italian fashion, recalling the 1995 slaying of fashion king Maurizio Gucci.</p>
<p>Gucci, the last grandson of Guccio Gucci who founded the international fashion dynasty, was shot dead in broad daylight outside his office in Milan in March 1995.</p>
<p>Five people were arrested in connection with Gucci's murder in January this year, including his first wife Patrizia Martinelli, who is charged with ordering the killing.</p>
