<p>Media giant Time Warner Inc confirmed on Tuesday that the body found in a Manhattan apartment was that of Jonathan Levin, son of company chairman Gerald Levin.</p>
<p>The badly decomposed body was discovered in Levin's Columbus Avenue apartment at about 10:30 p.m. EDT on Monday (0230 GMT Tuesday), a police spokeswoman said. The body was bound and gagged but there were no visible stab or gunshot wounds, she added.</p>
<p>&quot;We are shocked and saddened by the death of Jonathan Levin,&quot; Time Warner President Richard Parsons said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Levin, a 34-year-old English teacher at Taft High School in the Bronx, did not turn up for work on Monday, school officials said.</p>
<p>A police spokeswoman said other teachers who lived in the same building had called police after one of them, who had a key to Levin's apartment, found the body on Monday night.</p>
<p>A dog was found locked in Levin's bedroom, she said.</p>
<p>Gerald Levin took over as chairman of Time Warner in 1992, replacing Nicholas Nicholas. Time Warner was formed by the 1989 merger of Time and Warner communications.</p>
