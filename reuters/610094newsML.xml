<title>USA: CME hogs seen steady to lower, pork bellies higher.</title>
<headline>CME hogs seen steady to lower, pork bellies higher.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>CME hog futures were expected to open steady to 0.150 cent per lb lower while pork belly futures were called 0.100 to 0.300 cent higher, livestock analysts said.</p>
<p>Steady to lower cash hog indications and mostly lower cash pork prices were expected to weigh on hog futures. Packers do not need hogs for Monday and some packers have already started buying hogs for Tuesday, analysts said.</p>
<p>However, continued reports that hog supplies are less than expected may limit losses. Action in pork bellies may also spill over into the hog pit, they said.  </p>
<p>Further gains in pork bellies were expected following the strong cash belly market and further support from the Cold Storage report earlier in the week that showed a counterseasonal decline in stocks, they said.</p>
<p>However, choppy trade Thursday and expected evening of positions ahead of the long Memorial Holiday weekend may bring uneven trade. Some analysts also voiced concern that July failed to set a new contract high on Thursday jump before prices turned uneven. High cash prices may also turn off demand for bellies, they added.</p>
