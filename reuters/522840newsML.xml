<p>India's United Front coalition on Saturday named Inder Kumar Gujral, a 77-year-old scholar with strong experience in foreign policy, as its leader to head a new centre-left government. Caretaker Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda told reporters the 15-party coalition's decision-making Steering Committee unanimously chose Gujral, foreign minister in the outgoing government, to lead the alliance and become prime minister.</p>
<p>&quot;The United Front Steering Committee has taken a decision to elect Mr I.K. Gujral as leader of the party,&quot; said Deve Gowda, whose 10-month-old government was defeated in a vote of confidence in parliament on April 11.</p>
<p>The Congress party, which provoked Deve Gowda's downfall by withdrawing its parliamentary support, said on Friday that it would back a new United Front leader at the head of a centre-left government.</p>
<p>Neither the United Front nor Congress want mid-term elections which opinion surveys show could put the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) within striking distance of power.</p>
<p>Their common opposition to the BJP, more than shared principles, has kept the United Front and Congress from rupturing ties despite mounting acrimony which resulted in Deve Gowda's downfall.</p>
<p>The choice of Gujral, who enjoys a spotless reputation, ended a three-week crisis that had shaken financial markets and threatened to lead to India's second general election in a year.</p>
<p>&quot;I bow my head to the people of India,&quot; Gujral told reporters after the decision was announced. &quot;I promise them to the best of my capacity to give a clean government, a government that serves them.&quot;</p>
<p>Deve Gowda said a delegation of leaders from the coalition's 15 parties would go to the presidential palace on Sunday to convey the decision to President Shankar Dayal Sharma.</p>
<p>Gujral served as foreign minister from 1989 to 1990 under then prime minister V.P. Singh, and was again named to the post when Deve Gowda took office at the head of a minority government last June.</p>
<p>United Front officials said strong support for Gujral as a candidate without political enemies built up during the day as alliance leaders held hectic talks to end the crisis.</p>
<p>He has held seven ministerial portfolios dating back to 1967, and served as ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1976 to 1980.</p>
<p>Gujral is widely respected but has little political base -- considered an advantage in the current highly politicised atmosphere.</p>
<p>Chandrababu Naidu, the convenor of the United Front's Steering Committee who spearheaded the talks to find a leader, said he eventually persuaded the alliance's many contenders for the prime ministership to throw their weight behind Gujral.</p>
<p>&quot;My job was to have a consensus and I.K. Gujral's choice was by consensus,&quot; Naidu told reporters. &quot;There were some political parties with their proposals. After interacting, we arrived at the name of the prime minister.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if the United Front had agreed to name a deputy prime minister, Naidu said: &quot;Nothing has been decided yet. It may be taken up tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday there were reports that caretaker Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, who has a strong political base in the populous northern state of Uttar Pradesh, would be named deputy prime minister.</p>
<p>Coalition officials said Congress president Sitaram Kesri would be informed of the alliance's decision on Saturday.</p>
