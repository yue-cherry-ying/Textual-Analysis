<p>Bundesbank council member Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher said on Thursday that the next official tax revenue estimate for 1997 due in November may show an additional shortfall of up to 10 billion marks compared with the last estimate in May.</p>
<p>&quot;Tax revenues have been lagging behind (economic) growth and this has been going on for years. The tax base is eroding...this is really a warning to stop this erosion,&quot; Kuehbacher told German television in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;My estimate is that compared with the May estimate which was still too generous in its growth assumptions, up to 10 billion marks could again be missing in November.&quot;</p>
<p>Kuehbacher said the Bundesbank as fiscal agent of the government was seeing Bonn's tax revenues month for month, &quot;and we have to say, your (the government's) expectations are not being fulfilled.&quot;  </p>
<p>Kuehbacher was speaking after the Bundesbank warned in its latest monthly report that Bonn's 1997 tax revenue would probably be even lower than the May estimate which showed tax receipts this year were likely to be 18 billion marks less than the original prediction in November 1996.</p>
<p>In a strongly-worded report, the Bundesbank said Germany's tax structure had reached a &quot;dead end&quot; and called for fundamental reform.</p>
<p>It said the current system benefited skilled tax-avoiders and did not do enough to encourage business activity and create jobs.</p>
<p>But the Finance Ministry said on Wednesday it still saw no reason to lower estimates for 1997 tax revenue.</p>
<p>A sluggish economy and record unemployment have caused tax revenues to decline, endangering Germany's effort to qualify for European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Kuehbacher also said tax loopholes must be closed which allow Germans to avoid paying tax on their investments by shifting funds to tax havens like Luxembourg.</p>
<p>&quot;Such loopholes must be closed at a European level,&quot; Kuehbacher said. &quot;It can't go on that one invests one's capital in a neighbouring country, perhaps even with one's own domestic bank, to avoid tax.&quot;</p>
<p>Government plans to reform the tax system were thwarted last month when opposition Social Democrats blocked a bill which would have cut tax by a net 30 billion marks.</p>
