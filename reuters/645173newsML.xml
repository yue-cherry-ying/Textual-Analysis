<p>The head of the smaller party in Poland's ruling coalition, Waldemar Pawlak, warned Polish consumers on Saturday that they would bear the brunt of the country's future entry into the European Union (EU).</p>
<p>&quot;The results of integration with the European Union will be mainly felt by Polish consumers, since prices on the European market considerably exceed the prices of our food products,&quot; PAP news agency reported Pawlak as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Poland should learn lessons from the countries that have successively joined the EU so as to limit negative consequences,&quot; Pawlak, leader of the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) told a conference in the west Poland city of Gorzow Wielkopolski.</p>
<p>&quot;After Poland joins the EU, the biggest threat to Polish agriculture will be the problem of improving competitiveness so our domestic food-processing industry is not supplanted by that of Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>Pawlak and his agrarian party say they support Poland's aim of joining the European Union but he often argues that unless entry is carefully negotiated it could harm Polish agriculture which is based chiefly on small, family-owned farms.</p>
<p>The PSL has had a stormy relationship with its coalition partner, the more reform-minded, ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), with which it has shared power since 1993.</p>
<p>It is uncertain whether their cooperation will survive after parliamentary elections due in September, as the PSL says it could work with other parties of both left and right.</p>
<p>Pawlak, a former prime minister, said the PSL might form a coalition with partners who are concerned about Poland's economic interests, but left his options open saying: &quot;There is still ample time for our party to make its final choice of a partner.&quot; -- Warsaw Newsroom 48 22 653 9700</p>
