<p>The E coli bacteria that cause sometimes deadly food poisoning can live in the soil for months and survive on cold metal, but are no harder to kill than any other bug, scientists said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Reporting the results of the first study into the bacteria, experts from Britain's Centre for Applied Microbiology at Porton Down said E coli outbreaks were becoming more common, but were still much rarer than other food poisoning such as salmonella.</p>
<p>&quot;We have shown the organism is not a superbug,&quot; Andy Maul, an environmental microbiologist at Porton Down, told a news briefing.</p>
<p>Bleach kills it within 20 minutes, and basic hygiene could help prevent its spread.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the public perception is that this is a particularly dangerous organism,&quot; the centre's Mike Hudson said. &quot;It's encouraging that we don't have to take special measures.&quot;</p>
<p>E coli is a normal gut bacteria that can mutate to a poisonous strain known as 0157. It has been in the headlines since the first outbreak, traced to a U.S. hamburger chain, in 1982.</p>
<p>The first case was reported in a California woman in 1975. In 1989 an outbreak in Montana made 243 people ill, killing four. In 1996 9,500 people, mostly schoolchildren, were infected and 11 died.</p>
<p>And late last year and early this year 20 elderly people died from an outbreak in Scotland in which 490 people became ill.</p>
<p>E coli 0157 produces several poisons and also molecules that help it cling to the surface of the gut.</p>
<p>Hudson and Maul said incidence had nearly tripled from 0.46 per 100,000 in 1990 in England and Wales to 1.26 in 1996. There were many more cases in Scotland, with 3.36 per 100,000 in 1990 and 9.50 in 1996 -- for a total of 506 cases.</p>
<p>Hudson said he did not know why there were so many more cases in Scotland. But as a comparison he noted there had been 792 cases of E coli 0157 in England and Wales in 1995 -- and 29,717 cases of salmonella -- which can also kill.</p>
<p>However, E coli is very much more infectious than salmonella. It can cause bloody diarrhoea, kidney failure and blood clots -- or no symptoms at all.</p>
<p>Maule said E coli had been passed to people in meat, on unwashed vegetables and fruit, in milk and in water.</p>
<p>A battery of tests funded by the British health department showed it could persist in soil for 20 days and in laboratory tests it lived for months in soil and grass samples.</p>
<p>It can survive for a week on an untreated steel surface.</p>
<p>In April a government-appointed scientist recommended cleaning up slaughterhouses and butcher shops to prevent more outbreaks. The government said this week it would implement his recommendations.</p>
