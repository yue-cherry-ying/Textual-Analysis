<headline>UAE murder trial adjourns as Filipino seeks mercy.</headline>
<dateline>DUBAI 1997-06-07</dateline>

<p>The trial of a Filipino man jailed in the UAE for killing an Indian national has been adjourned until September to give the defendant time to ask the victim's family for mercy, the defence lawyer said on Saturday.</p>
<p>John Aquino, 37, could face the death penalty if found guilty of murdering Harbajan Singh in 1989.</p>
<p>&quot;The trial has been adjourned until September 27 in order for the defendant to seek pardon from the heirs of the deceased,&quot; lawyer Badawi Mohammad Nur told Reuters.</p>
<p>The trial at the United Arab Emirates supreme court had resumed on Saturday after a three-month break in which Aquino and the Philippines ambassador to the UAE appealed to Singh's family in Britain for clemency. Ambassador Roy Seneres said the family had not replied.</p>
<p>Under Islamic sharia law applied in the oil-rich Gulf state, the victim's family can ask for the death penalty if the suspect is convicted of murder, or could agree to a jail term and accept financial recompense, known as blood money.</p>
<p>Seneres said the embassy had raised donations of $50,000 as blood money and offered it to Singh's family in advance of a verdict. He said the normal blood money required in the UAE was $41,000.</p>
<p>&quot;We and John Aquino wrote to the family in Birmingham asking for forgiveness. (Aquino) wrote in Filipino -- with an English translation -- asking for forgiveness in a touching and remorseful way,&quot; Seneres said.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately we have received no reply until now. Thanks to the court's adjournment, we will once again appeal to them for mercy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A court in the northern emirate of Ajman sentenced Aquino to death in 1989 for stabbing to death Singh and attempting to murder another Indian man in a dispute. After seven years on death row, the UAE's supreme court overturned the death sentence in December and ordered a new trial.</p>
<p>The Federal Supreme Court makes the final ruling on death sentences, but any execution must be approved by UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan.</p>
<p>The UAE faced international criticism in 1995 when a court sentenced Filipina Sarah Balabagan to death for stabbing her 70-year-old employer to death. She said he had tried to rape her. Sheikh Zaid intervened and convinced the victim's family to accept a financial settlement.</p>
