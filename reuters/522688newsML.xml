<p>Surrounded by a raucous, chanting crowd, a panel of U.S. congressmen gathered on this Caribbean island on Saturday to discuss a bill that would allow Puerto Rico to become the 51st state.</p>
<p>The bill, filed by Representative Don Young, an Alaska Republican, would sanction a referendum in 1998 in which Puerto Rico could choose to become a U.S. state, an independent nation or retain its current status as a U.S. commonwealth.</p>
<p>&quot;Puerto Rico's status has been raised to a national issue of importance,&quot; Young aide Manase Mansur told a news conference. &quot;There is a growing consensus in Congress that this issue needs to be addressed and will be addressed.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the current commonwealth status Puerto Rico's 3.7 million residents are U.S. citizens, but do not pay federal taxes and cannot vote in general presidential elections.</p>
<p>The Spanish-speaking island was colonised by Spain in the 15th century and ceded to the United States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War. Its relationship with the United States is a contentious issue on the island, as evidenced by the passion and intensity of the crowd attending the hearing.</p>
<p>Supporters of each of the three options marched through the streets of the capital San Juan shouting slogans and waving flags.</p>
<p>Inside the San Juan Fine Arts Theatre, a group from the House resources committee, including Democratic Reps. George Miller of California and Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, Young and others held a hearing which was frequently interrupted by chants and standing ovations.</p>
<p>&quot;We have talked for 100 years. It's time to act,&quot; statehood supporter Charlie Rodriguez, a Puerto Rico senator, told the congressmen. &quot;Statehood is the only formula that guarantees U.S. citizenship.&quot;</p>
<p>Rodriguez and other statehood supporters see commonwealth status as &quot;colonialism&quot;, in which residents of the island do not enjoy full rights of U.S. citizenship. Rodriguez, who testified entirely in English, found a willing ear in Kennedy, who supports statehood.</p>
<p>&quot;I eagerly await the plebiscite that is sanctioned by this legislation,&quot; Kennedy said. &quot;If we want to talk about equality for all Puerto Ricans we should give them a voice.&quot;</p>
<p>But Commonwealth supporters accused Young of slanting the bill to favour statehood. They say the bill does not truthfully represent the realities of statehood for Puerto Rico, which would lose Spanish as its official language and the right to field its own Olympic team.</p>
<p>The bill &quot;tilts the tables to favour a formula that's never been supported by a majority of our people,&quot; said Anibal Acevedo, president of the pro-commonweath Popular Democratic Party.</p>
<p>In Puerto Rico's most recent referendum in 1993, 48 percent voted for commonwealth status, 46 percent chose statehood and independence advocates garnered 4.4 percent.</p>
<p>Commonwealth supporters call their status &quot;lo mejor de ambos mundos&quot; -- the best of both worlds. They emphasise they are both Puerto Ricans and U.S. citizens and stress their ties to both cultures.</p>
<p>Acevedo accordingly gave the first half of his testimony in English and then switched to Spanish, &quot;because my heart dreams in Spanish.&quot; His testimony was frequently interrupted by pro-commonwealth supporters in the theatre.</p>
<p>Independence advocate Fernando Martin, who spoke solely in Spanish, told the congressmen that Puerto Rico was a different culture and would never fit in the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a Latin American nation and proud of our culture and heritage,&quot; he said.</p>
