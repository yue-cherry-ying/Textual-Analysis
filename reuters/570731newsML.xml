<p>---------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - MAY 8-----------------</p>
<p>Cocoa futures should hold above initial support at 1,000 stg basis July and gradually push towards the peaks of the chart's double-top formation, technical analysts said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>July, the benchmark contract, managed to retain most of Wednesday's gains and closed at 1,003 stg, 14 up on the day -- above the critical 980 and the psychological 1,000 stg marks.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said the constructive performance suggested more gains could be on the cards as July edged into the upper sector of a double-top formation.</p>
<p>&quot;Cocoa is holding on to critical support at 980 and it's marginally oversold so it should continue to do so,&quot; said Elli Gifford, an independent technical analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;There's very little in the way of resistance until you get to 1,040...and there's absolutely no reason why it shouldn't go higher,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Traders called the London market to open five stg higher than Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>But analysts have also warned that sellers lurking around the 1,060 stg area could hamper upside progress, as the position has seen two hefty slumps after the peaks at 1,065 and 1,061 stg.</p>
<p>The two peaks would be the next logical upside target once 1,040 stg was cleared, Gifford said.</p>
