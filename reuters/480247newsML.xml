<p>The United Nations said on Monday that talks between representatives of the Zairean government and the rebels were scheduled for South Africa this weekend and would be led by its special envoy, Mohamed Sahnoun.</p>
<p>The discussions are tentatively scheduled for Saturday, U.N. officials said, and Sahnoun was in Cape Town on Monday.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, at the United Nations for a brief visit, was asked by reporters if Washington would send an emissary.</p>
<p>&quot;For now we want to make sure the talks do in fact take place with an active role for the United Nations and we will have to consider what level emissary to send to it,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan appears to have asserted his authority to have Sahnoun play the lead negotiating role following a series of summits and a plethora of special envoys from various countries. The Algerian diplomat also represents the Organisation of African Unity in Central Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;The secretary-general's intention in entering into a joint venture with OAU was that there were a few too many cooks involved in this broth,&quot; said spokesman Fred Eckhard.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the things he hoped to get out of his visit to Lome is that the UN-OAU envoy would lead the discussions and that has now been firmly agreed by all concerned,&quot; he said, referring to a recent African summit in Togo's capital Lome.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Sahnoun) will conduct the negotiations. The South African government is providing logistical and other support for his efforts,&quot; Eckhard said.</p>
<p>Among the envoys who in recent months have attempted to negotiate a ceasefire and peace settlement are those from the the European Union, the United States, Belgium, Kenya as well as South Africa.</p>
<p>Zairean rebels said on Monday they were ready for talks with President Mobutu Sese Seko's representatives as early as Thursday in preparation for a meeting between him and rebel chief Laurent Kabila.</p>
<p>Zaire's state radio said the government would announce its team in the coming days.</p>
<p>Talks in South Africa earlier this year, engineered mainly by the United States, ended without agreement. Diplomats said U.S. officials were ill-prepared for the talks and had not organised a proper delegation from the Zairean government.</p>
<p>Kabila, however, attended, affording himself the opportunity to shake hands with President Nelson Mandela.</p>
