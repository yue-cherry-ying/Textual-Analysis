<title>CHINA: Caution prevails in Tokyo stocks, Hong Kong seen up.</title>
<headline>Caution prevails in Tokyo stocks, Hong Kong seen up.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-08-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Investor interest in Tokyo stocks is likely to remain cautious in the week ahead, while Hong Kong's market is expected to continue its rally, brokers said.</p>
<p>And the Bangkok bourse, hit by news of tough government measures to right the economy, may bounce back on hopes talks with the International Monetary Fund will produce positive results, they said.</p>
<p>Tokyo's key Nikkei index is expected to be adversely affected by scepticism about the economy's strength but in Hong Kong a funds inflow from investors seeking China exposure should boost the Hang Seng.</p>

<p>TOKYO - Malaise in the Tokyo stock market is likely to continue in the week ahead, amid anxiety over Japan's fragile economic recovery, credit risk at construction firms and a widening racketeer scandal, analysts said.</p>
<p>While some brokers say the country's economy is heading into a slow recovery for the long term, many add that it will take time for the market to regain confidence.</p>
<p>On Friday, the benchmark Nikkei 225 average closed at 19,604.46, down 199.92 points from the previous week's close.</p>
<p>Brokers expect the key market index to trade between 19,000 and 20,000 next week.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still a good deal of scepticism about the strength of Japan's economy,&quot; said Kiyoshi Kimura, general manager of the research department at Societe Generale Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to keep in mind the possibility of a break below 19,000,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The key will be whether the market can be convinced there's no need for concern over the economy,&quot; said Hiroyuki Nakai, chief investment strategist at Nikko Securities Co Ltd.</p>

<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks are expected to continue to rally in the coming week, fuelled by an influx of local, regional and overseas funds seeking short and long-term Hong Kong and China investment exposure, brokers and analysts said.</p>
<p>But brokers also said market volatility had increased and profit-taking could arise in the next rally.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has the momentum to reach 17,000,&quot; said David Williamson, director at Indosuez W.I. Carr. &quot;But we could see selling into that level.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index closed 25.73 points or 0.15 percent lower at 16,647.54 on Friday after a record-breaking week. On Thursday, the index set its second consecutive record close at 16,673.27, after stretching to an all time high of 16,820.31 earlier in the day. Over the week, the index advanced a total of 268.32 points or 1.64 percent.</p>
<p>Turnover also set a single-day record of HK$34.2 billion on Thursday.</p>

<p>BANGKOK - Thai stocks, which fell during the past week after the announcement of harsh economic measures, are expected to rise in the week ahead on hopes that loan talks with the International Monetary Fund will go without a hitch, brokers said.</p>
<p>The market fell sharply after the government imposed a raft of austerity measures on Tuesday, including the shock suspension of 42 ailing finance firms. Investors were later concerned about the future of the remaining firms, and worried about rises in prices after a three percentage point rise in value added tax comes into effect.</p>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index lost 2.33 percent in the week to 636.85 points on Friday from a week ago. It declined 0.19 percent from Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is expected to rise next week in thin turnover as investors await for the outcome of talks between Thai and IMF officials. Thailand is expected to get loans to remedy its ailing economy but the question is whether it would receive the full amount that it had asked,&quot; said Chetta Meemangkang of Prime Finance and Securities.</p>
<p>IMF lender states and financial institutions are due to meet in Tokyo on Monday to discuss the multi-billion dollar loan package for Thailand.</p>
<p>Turnover is likely to be thin in the next week as the market will be closed on Tuesday for Queen Sirikit's birthday.</p>

<p>DHAKA - Dhaka stocks are likely to see a continuing downtrend in their prices when trading resumes on Sunday following a two-day weekend, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said institutional buyers were likely to stay on the sidelines until a funding crisis due to tightening of bank lending had eased. &quot;The market is suffering from a depressed sentiment. It badly needs strong financial support,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>The Dhaka Stock Exchange all-share price index lost 20.75 points to 952.38 in the week to Thursday.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>JAKARTA - Jakarta stocks are seen remaining weak as worries over interest rates, new margin finance regulations and payments due on large rights issues were likely to continue haunting the market, analysts and brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the market) is likely to remain weak...as the overnight rates are still high,&quot; Robert Allison, head of sales with Paribas Asia Equity, said.</p>
<p>The central bank on Friday cut rates on its short-term certificates (SBIs) for periods of one week and above by 50 basis points while maintaining high rates for shorter-term paper, but the move failed to boost sentiment.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Jakarta composite index closed at 675.44 points against last week's close of 721.77 points.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>KARACHI, Pakistan - Pakistani stocks are likely to remain firm on blue-chip buying and dealers said the index would consolidate despite profit-taking by speculators in stocks that had risen sharply during the recent rally.</p>
<p>&quot;The index has a potential to post further gains, but some profit-taking is expected,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;Sentiment will remain positive and the index will hover around the 2,000-point level.&quot;</p>
<p>On Friday, the Karachi Stock Exchange's 100-share index rose 1.47 points, or 0.07 percent, to close at 2,014.68, compared to 1,933.26 a week ago.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR - The Composite Index of 100 large-capitalised stocks closed 70.27 points or 7.01 percent lower for the week over the previous week. On Friday, the index ended at 932.36, up 4.03 points or 0.43 percent from Thursday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe next week is going to be volatile, with a lot of caution. Investors are unlikely to come in in a big way unless everything settles down, like the currency, interest rates, and no more tightening measures by Bank Negara,&quot; said Soh Meng Hui, research manager at KL City Securities.</p>
<p>Small-capitalised stocks possibly would not be as badly hit as large-cap issues, said Soh.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be some trading opportunities there,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Share prices have been hit badly since central Bank Negara imposed limited capital control measures to control excessive currency speculation.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>MANILA - Philippine shares will likely consolidate in the week ahead until interest rates are cut further, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still very much a regional play right now and there's still caution in Asia. Although there's no massive sell-off in the Philippine stock market, there are also no new money inflows yet,&quot; said Erwin Tan, research head at Securities 2000 Inc.</p>
<p>The equities market had been hurt by high domestic interest rates as the central bank shielded the peso against the currency turmoil in the region.</p>
<p>The central bank had so far brought down its closely watched overnight borrowing rate to 18 percent from 32 percent last month.</p>
<p>The main index closed lower on Friday by 22.19 points, or 0.83 percent at 2,647.82 points. But week-on-week, the index still rose by 12.18 points from the previous Friday's 2,635.64.</p>

<p>SEOUL - Seoul stocks are likely to show gradual rises in anticipation of an economic turnaround aided by the strengthening yen and falling interest rates, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are pinning their hopes on an improving economy as the dollar plunged to 114 yen from 118 previously,&quot; said Cha Hee-gun at Sunkyong Securities. &quot;But the rises will be limited as the market needs to soak up selling pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>But a Daishin Securities report recommended a flexible attitude with close monitoring of yen/dollar movement.</p>
<p>Brokers forecast the index would move in a boxed range between 740 and 770.</p>
<p>The composite stock index rose 30.41 points or 4.16 percent to 760.84 on Saturday against 730.43 a week ago.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE - Dealers in Singapore said concerns over the possible termination of dual listings in selected blue chip shares and Singapore's Big Four banks would continue to haunt the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The possible delisting of foreign tranches have shaken investors confidence. Market sentiment was already quite unstable and this certainly isn't going to help,&quot; said a broker with a local house.</p>
<p>On Friday, speculation was rife over when banks and selected blue chips would merge their local and foreign shares listing in the wake of ST Computer Systems &amp; Services Ltd's surprising move to merge its two tranches.</p>
<p>The move triggered a fall in the foreign tranches and a rise in the local tranches.</p>
<p>Dealers said a statement by the Monetary Authority of Singapore that it had no intention to ask banks to merge their two listings helped calm the market and buffer the fall in foreign tranches.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Straits Times Industrials Index ended 9.32 points down at 1,943.92 compared to 1,955.25 a week ago.</p>

<p>SYDNEY - Australian shares are seen maintaining a steady tone near term with most eyes on the profit season just started.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,711.4, down 0.6 percent on the week.</p>
<p>The market ended the week little changed with bellwether BHP dragging the broader market just lower after its shares fell amid investor concern over executive departures and direction.</p>
<p>&quot;It will depend on Wall Street and BHP but otherwise it looks okay. The company results, are without a doubt the main focus,&quot; said a dealer at a Sydney-based brokerage.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>TAIPEI - Taiwan's stock market is expected to test its upside, buoyed by government officials' recent bullish comments on the stock market and the economy, but brokers said a liquidity squeeze in the banking system may add caution.</p>
<p>Top government officials have recently described the stock market as &quot;sound&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Those messages show the government's supportive attitude towards the stock market. It is very encouraging,&quot; Golden Securities' research head Albert Lin said.</p>
<p>But brokers said soaring money rates due to a tight liquidity would likely slow buying interest.</p>
<p>&quot;Liquidity will be a main concern for many investors. If liquidity remains tight, it will surely hurt buying interest in the short term.&quot;</p>
<p>Market focus would remain on electronics and construction.</p>
<p>No major economic indicators are expected to be announced in the coming week.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the index ended up 69.70 points or 0.70 percent at 9,993.54, down 0.6 percent from last Saturday's 10,048.90.</p>
<p>A 9,900-10,100 range was seen for next week.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>WELLINGTON - Earnings reports showing how New Zealand's bellwether stocks have fared during the recent economic downturn and how optimistic they are about the predicted upswing will determine the market's direction, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not so much their historic figures but how their prospective profitability looks,&quot; said Doyle Paterson Brown principal Murray Doyle.</p>
<p>The sharp rise in short term interest rates had been offset by the equally sharp fall in the dollar and stocks with currency exposure such as Air New Zealand and Fletcher Energy should benefit, brokers said.</p>
<p>Fears the Reserve Bank will act to tighten monetary conditions, which on Friday moved to a 100 basis points in interest terms easier than the RB's desired level, could inhibit equities.</p>
<p>The barometer top 40 index closed 1.43 percent down for the week at 2,538.</p>
