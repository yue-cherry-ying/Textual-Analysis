<p>A Syrian health official has arrived in Baghdad to pursue trade deals under Iraq's oil-for-food deal with the United Nations, Iraqi newspapers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said Na'il al-Nabulsi, deputy chairman of the medical industries council at the Syrian Health Ministry, headed a delegation representing leading Syrian medical firms.</p>
<p>&quot;These firms are ready to bring medicine to Iraq under the memorandum of understanding with the United Nations,&quot; the government newspaper al-Jumhouriya quoted Nabulsi as saying.</p>
<p>Iraq and Syria decided last month to reopen their borders for trade, closed since the beginning of the 1980s when ties were cut because Damascus sided with Iran in the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran war.</p>
<p>Since then the two Arab countries, ruled by rival factions of the Baath party, have been exchanging economic teams.</p>
<p>The Iraqi Trade Ministry said last month it had signed several contracts with visiting Syrian businessmen to supply wheat, beans, soap and detergents under the oil deal.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim of this visit is to set up a mechanism of joint cooperation in the field of medical industries and open new horizons of cooperation,&quot; Nabulsi said.</p>
<p>Jumhouriya said Syrian firms would organise a medical exhibition in Baghdad in cooperation with the Iraqi Health Ministry late this month.</p>
<p>Syrian officials have announced that Syria's Mediterranean ports were ready to handle Iraq's imports under the oil deal.</p>
<p>The pact allows Iraq oil exports worth $2 billion over six months to enable it buy food, medicine and other essential commodities for Iraqis hard-hit by U.N. sanctions imposed after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The deal, which started in December last year, was renewed for another six months in June.</p>
