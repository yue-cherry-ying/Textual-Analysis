<title>PHILIPPINES: Manila overnight money firm.</title>
<headline>Manila overnight money firm.</headline>

<text>
<p>Manila overnight money was firm at an average of 9.9375 percent on Tuesday as most banks were able to square their positions immediately, traders said.</p>
<p>Done rates moved from 10.15625 to 9.9375 percent, with 31 lenders and 18 borrowers.</p>
<p>&quot;Banks quickly lent to the Central Bank in case the Central Bank again closes its overnight borrowing facility,&quot; a dealer said.  </p>
<p>Traders further noted that the Central Bank kept its overnight borrowing rate at 9.9 percent, which placed a floor on rates.</p>
<p>In the secondary market, the lowering of the Central Bank's one-year rate to 10.3 from 10.4 percent on its special series T-bill spurred banks to buy more bills. Its action was to align with the results of Monday's T-bill sales.</p>
<p>Traders said banks decided to purchase bills before rates slide further.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of eight financial insitutions showed bid rates of 9.45 to 9.60 percent on three-month bills, 9.80 to 10.05 on six months, and 10.375 to 10.525 on the one-year bills.</p>
