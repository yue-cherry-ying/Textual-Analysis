<p>Thai stocks will fall again on Thursday as investors remain concerned about the country's fundamental economic conditions and worried about the possibility of rising U.S. interest rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>The SET Index finished 16.71 points lower on Wednesday at a new 5-1/2 year low of 626.57 in turnover worth 3.74 billion baht. The SET 50 lost 1.39 points to 45.96.</p>
<p>Lower economic growth prospects, focussed on the possibility of further budget cuts, a flat corporate earnings outlook, loan quality concerns and an overnight 140 point fall in New York will weigh negatively on sentiment, analysts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think the weakening bond market in the U.S. might rise fears that rates there could rise, that would make it more difficult for rates to come down again in Thailand,&quot; said a senior analyst at Thai Rung Reung.</p>
<p>Leading Thai commercial banks last week cut minimum lending rate by 25 basis points. Analysts said more cuts are required if the economy, already widely forecast to grow at a decade-low five percent this year, is to rebound.</p>
<p>Concerns surrounding lower growth have been heightened by the possibility of further budget cut to balance a potential fiscal deficit, analysts said.</p>
