<p>Australian retailers on Friday they welcomed the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) decision to cut interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 5.5 percent.</p>
<p>The retail index of the Australian Stock Exchange was up 1.3 percent at midday. The overall market, as measured by The All Ordinaries Index, was up 0.3 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It's received very positively. Coming on top of the two interest rate cuts in late 1996 this is a further injection into the economy which will hopefully engender consumer confidence,&quot; Woolworths managing director Reg Clairs told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Clairs said it would take time for the effect of the cut to filter through to disposable income.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now only just starting to feel the positive effects of those rate cuts late last year,&quot; Clairs said.</p>
<p>Chris Bennett, general manager finance of West Australian wholesaler Foodland Associated Ltd also welcomed the cut. &quot;We believe that the RBA has correctly anticipated that the level of unemployment in the economy is too high,&quot; Bennett said.</p>
<p>Australia's unemployment rate remained at 8.7 percent in April. Friday's rate cut was the fourth in less than a year, with rates being cut by a total of two percentage points.  </p>
<p>Bennett said because Foodland traded only in Western Australia and New Zealand, it would not be as affected by the decision as other retailers.</p>
<p>&quot;In Western Australia unemployment is considerably lower than the rest of Australia so the rate cut is probably likely to have less effect in this state than other states,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bennett said he expected the effect of the cut to be almost immediate. &quot;It's a clear sign to people that they can expect lower rates on their credit cards and their housing interest rates are going to fall,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>But Gerry Harvey, chairman of retail and retail franchisor, Havey Norman Ltd told Reuters the cut was too little and too late. &quot;They had to do it they didn't have any choice. I would like to see another one percent cut tomorrow,&quot; Harvey said.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless business picks up this second half they are going to have to keep dropping it,&quot; he said. Harvey said the previous rate cuts had had no effect on the company's sales.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally when you drop these things you do get an effect but this has being going on for a year with no effect,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Harvey said he believed official interest rates should be at about 4.5 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;The reality of it is that I'm out there in the market place and I know what is happening and they (RBA) know what is happening three or four months later and they are reacting to that,&quot; Harvey said.</p>
<p>He said he would be surprised if the latest cut had any immediate effect on sales but was hopeful things would improve.</p>
<p>At 1.00 p.m (0350 GMT), Woolworths shares were 12 cents higher at A$3.98, Foodland shares were 20 cents higher at A$7.95 while Harvey Norman stock was seven cents up at A$6.75.</p>
<p>Shares in Coles Myer Ltd, the largest of the retailers, were up a cent at A$A$5.96.</p>
