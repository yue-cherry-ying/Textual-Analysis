<p>Veteran American singer Bob Dylan, 56, has cancelled a European tour after being admitted to hospital suffering from chest pains, his British publicist said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This past weekend, Bob Dylan was admitted to hospital suffering from severe chest pains. His condition has been diagnosed as histoplamosis, a potentially fatal infection which creates swelling in the sac which surrounds the heart,&quot; publicity firm Hall or Nothing said in a statement.</p>
<p>He will remain in hospital until his doctors are confident that his condition has improved. Media reports said he was hospitalised in New York but this could not be confirmed by the publicist.</p>
<p>The singer was due to perform in Ireland, Britain and Switzerland during his tour. Van Morrison, who was due to appear with him on the London leg on June 7 said he would still perform.</p>
<p>Dylan, a leading exponent of folk, released his first album in 1962. The civil rights activist coined such classics as &quot;A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall&quot;, &quot;Masters of War&quot; and &quot;All I Really Want To Do&quot;.</p>
