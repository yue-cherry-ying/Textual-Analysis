<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Thursday issued his strongest attack against race row politician Pauline Hanson, accusing her of exploiting fear and instability and threatening Australia's links with Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;The Hanson cure would be worse than the disease,&quot; Howard said in a speech launching the Australian branch of the influential U.S. Asia Society.</p>
<p>&quot;The political campaign mounted by the member for Oxley seeks to exploit fear and instability without offering solutions for hope.&quot;</p>
<p>Howard avoided personally attacking Hanson, saying such attacks would only feed sympathy for her.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a serious mistake to attack those who are apparently attracted to her as bigoted, narrow-minded and racist. A few, no doubt, are. Most, however, are not.&quot;</p>
<p>But Howard said Hanson must be held responsible for her views.</p>
<p>The red-haired, former fish and chip shop proprietor elected as an independent in last year's polls has called for a halt to Asian immigration, claiming Asians are swamping Australia, and for a cut in welfare spending on Aborigines.</p>
<p>&quot;She is wrong when she suggests that Aboriginals are not disadvantaged. She is wrong when she says that Australia is in danger of being swamped by Asians,&quot; Howard declared.</p>
<p>&quot;She is wrong to seek scapegoats for society's problems.&quot;</p>
<p>The prime minister said Australia's long-term economic prosperity was in Asia but warned that Australia must also foster mutual understanding through personal links instead of merely building economic links.</p>
<p>East Asia currently takes 60 percent of Australia's exports.</p>
<p>&quot;None of these goals will be achieved through empty populism or cheap sloganeering. None will be achieved through bitter and divisive recriminations,&quot; Howard said.</p>
<p>&quot;The pursuit of our economic interests in the region cannot be divorced from acceptance by the countries of our region that we are a worthwhile partner,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It means welcoming visitors and investment from Asian nations. It is impossible to imagine a prosperous and successful Australia which is not deeply engaged in Asia. Those who propose putting up the shutters could not be more wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>Hanson's three-week-old One Nation Party has recently outpolled Australia's third major party, the Australian Democrats. Support for Howard's government has slipped to its lowest level since its election in March 1996, with most disaffected voters turning to Hanson.</p>
<p>Howard said many people were listening to Hanson because they feared the pace of social and economic change taking place in Australia. They felt they had lost their voice due to &quot;stultifying political correctness&quot; under the previous Labor government.</p>
<p>&quot;Those same Australians resent the constant claim that our history is little more than a litany of racism, sexism and imperial triumphalism,&quot; Howard said.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is that Australia is a deeply tolerant, fair-minded and generous society. Discrimination on the basis of a person's racial or ethnic origin is offensive to all decent Australians.&quot;</p>
