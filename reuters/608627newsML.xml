<p>Belgium will withdraw 300 troops from its 700-strong evacuation force for the former Zaire stationed in Congo on Sunday, a spokesman for the force said on Friday.</p>
<p>Belgium is one of several Western countries that have sent troops to Congo in case they need to evacuate their nationals from Kinshasa, where Laurent Kabila's rebel forces took over last Saturday and renamed the country the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>Asked whether Friday's protest march by supporters of Etienne Tshisekedi, a key opposition figure in Kinshasa, had in any way changed their departure plans, the Belgian spokesman said:</p>
<p>&quot;The decision to pull out was a political one and we haven't received any instructions to the contrary.&quot;</p>
<p>He said 300 troops would leave on Sunday. The remaining men would leave in stages but their departure dates were not immediately known.</p>
<p>The U.S. forces had been scheduled to complete their departure by last Wednesday. The U.S. Ambassador to Congo Aubrey Hooks said on Thursday that a decision on dates &quot;would be taken within the coming week&quot; and that the departure was likely to take another week at most.</p>
<p>Part of the British contingent has already returned home. The remaining troops were not immediately available for comment, nor were the French forces. Individual French soldiers indicated in the past few days they are likely to spend another month in Brazzaville.</p>
<p>The smallest evacuation force present, the Portuguese, were not available for comment.</p>
