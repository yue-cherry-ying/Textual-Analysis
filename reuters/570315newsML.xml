<p>Britain's new Labour government wants to make a fresh start in Europe, but a report that it might rejoin the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) flies in the face of everything the party's high command is on record as saying.</p>
<p>Labour party and Treasury officials were puzzled by the report by Bridge News that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown might be attracted to re-entering the semi-fixed exchange rate grid at a central rate of 2.50 marks.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has no intention of rejoining the ERM. Mr Brown has made that clear on other occasions going back a year ago,&quot; a Treasury spokesman said.</p>
<p>An aide to Brown was more outspoken and discounted it as complete rubbish. However he welcomed the fact that the report had dented sterling's strength overnight.</p>
<p>Brown acknowledged on Tuesday that sterling's meteoric rise to a peak of above 2.80 marks this week was hurting British exporters. If he could wave a magic wand, he would no doubt prefer a rate of 2.50 marks.</p>
<p>But nothing he and Labour leader Tony Blair said during the election campaign suggests they have in mind an ERM re-entry plan on a par with Tuesday's bombshell decision to hand over power to set interest rates to the Bank of England.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Brown has no plans to do that, not least because on Tuesday he announced monetary policy is directed towards achieving price stability with reference to the inflation target. There's no question of adopting a target for the exchange rate instead of that,&quot; the Treasury spokesman said.</p>
<p>The purpose of rejoining the ERM would be to qualify for the EU's single currency planned for launch in 1999. Labour officially is keeping its options open whether to join.</p>
<p>But Blair stressed during the campaign the &quot;formidable obstacles&quot; in the way of signing up for economic and monetary union (EMU) in the first wave and said it was &quot;a big if&quot; whether Britain would do so in the five-year term of the new parliament.</p>
<p>Senior Labour officials, with memories of Britain's humiliating ejection from the ERM in September 1992 still fresh, are convinced that yoking the economy to a single European monetary policy would be disastrous as long as Britain's business cycle is out of step with the continent's.</p>
<p>&quot;Until this changes, it's hard to see how Britain could join (EMU),&quot; one of Blair's top aides said last month.</p>
<p>Conversely, even leading Labour figures who are unsympathetic to EMU believe Britain would find it hard to stay aloof if a single currency was quickly seen to be a success.</p>
<p>&quot;If the single currency proceeds, I very much doubt in the medium term whether it's possible for Britain to stay out,&quot; Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said last year.</p>
<p>Speculation on a possible entry date has focussed on 2001, the year before the future European Central Bank plans the introduction of Euro notes and coins.</p>
<p>By then the Bank of England will have been autonomous for four years and Britain will be able to judge whether an independent central bank with a remit to tame inflation is a recipe for long-term stability, as Brown hopes, or for job-destroying deflation, as Labour left-wingers fear.</p>
