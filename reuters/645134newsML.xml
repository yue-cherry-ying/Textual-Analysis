<p>The Mailman delivered early then survived a late run by the Bulls as Karl Malone led Utah to a big lead and the Jazz held on to beat Chicago 104-93 Friday and gain a foothold in the NBA Finals.</p>
<p>The NBA's Most Valuable Player, performing at home after two defeats in Chicago and taunts of &quot;MVP&quot; every time Bulls favourite Michael Jordan was in the spotlight, scored 37 points and got 10 rebounds, three assists and four steals.</p>
<p>He also got some help off the bench from Greg Foster, who had 17 points, and his longtime running mate John Stockton, who after a subpar first three quarters wound up with 17 points -- including Utah's last six, lead-preserving points on free throws -- and dished out 12 assists.</p>
<p>Scottie Pippen had 27 points and Michael Jordan 26 as Chicago, which trailed by as many as 24 points, began stealing the ball and hitting 3-pointers to come as close as five points at 100-95 with just over a half-minute to go.</p>
<p>But Stockton's pressure-charged free throws at the end held off the Bulls, who now lead the best-of-seven series two games to one.</p>
<p>Games 4 and 5 will also be in Salt Lake City before returning to Chicago, if necessary.</p>
<p>The Jazz still have not lost at home in these playoffs and have been defeated only once at the Delta Centre since the All-Star break, winning 22 in a row.</p>
<p>The Bulls, who came in 3-0 in Finals Game 3's on the road, have never swept the championship series. They have also never lost a Finals in four previous appearances.</p>
