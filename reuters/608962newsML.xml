<p>Shares on the Lima stock exchange closed up Friday as they have all week due to investor confidence in an improving economy and high interest in the mining sector, brokers said.</p>
<p>Players see the bull run continuing early next week.</p>
<p>Friday, the rose 1.79 percent to 2,045.7 points, while the blue-chip Selective Index climbed 1.50 percent to 2,979.5 points, according to preliminary figures given at the market's close at 1.30 p.m. local time (1830 GMT).  </p>
<p>&quot;We are optimistic and believe the rises are going to carry on,&quot; said Aldo Quintana of local brokerage Interfip. &quot;For the market to rest at a ceiling now is impossible when you take into account the improvement in the economy and the international price rises for metals.&quot;</p>
<p>At the end of the bolsa's strongest weekly gain this year, the Selective Index broke the 3,000-point barrier for the first time Friday but fell back during late trade in the four-hour session. The General Index moved above the 2000-point mark for the first time Thursday.  </p>
<p>In a total of 2,898 trades, volume was a strong 61.0 million soles ($22.6 million), brokers said.</p>
<p>Polymetallic miner Atacocha continued its bull run, climbing 4.64 percent to 2.48 soles on heavy volume of 1.8 million shares. Morococha resumed its series of steep rises that was briefly interrupted Thursday as the miner gained Friday 4.56 percent to close at 7.11 soles on 682,000 shares.</p>
<p>The country's leading bank, Banco de Credito, rose 1.8 percent to 5.09 soles on volume of 339,000 shares.</p>
