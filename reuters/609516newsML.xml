<p>Italian bank San Paolo di Torino said total demand for its share offer which closed on Friday was more than three times oversubscribed.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the offer period the total demand for the public sale offer (OPV) and the offer to institutional investors was more than 760 million shares,&quot; a San Paolo statement said.</p>
<p>The global offer was for 220 million ordinary shares.</p>
<p>The public offer registered applications by more than 400,000 subscribers for more than 460 million shares, including San Paolo employees.</p>
<p>For the institutional offer, there were requests by 400 investors for more than 300 million shares.  </p>
<p>&quot;The global offer of shares in Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino Spa ended today with complete success,&quot; the bank said.</p>
<p>The final price for the shares on offer to the public and San Paolo employees, as well as the price for the institutional offer, will be announced on Saturday May 24.</p>
<p>However analysts' calculations estimate the public offer price at 10,434.45 lire per share.</p>
<p>The bank has said the final offer price would be the lower price of two alternatives: a maximum price of 10,850 lire per share announced last week or the official price on the closing day of the offer, with a discount of 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>The official price on Friday was 10,702 lire and with the discount becomes 10,434.45 lire, analysts said.</p>
<p>San Paolo has said that in addition to the initial 220 million shares on offer there would be a &quot;green shoe&quot; extra allocation of 33 million shares for institutions if the issue were to be oversubscribed.</p>
<p>San Paolo noted on Friday the amount originally destined for the OPV had been a minimum of 70 million shares of which 20 million were reserved for San Paolo employees.</p>
<p>&quot;The definitive amount of shares destined for the public sale offer will be determined taking account of the number of requests via the OPV and the number and quality of requests from institutional investors,&quot; it said.</p>
