<p>Kingspan Group Plc said on Friday that the strong trend experienced in 1996 was continuing into 1997 and the first six months should show considerable improvement.</p>
<p>It said 1996 was an excellent year for the group demonstrating a fairly robust demand for all its products in all major markets.</p>
<p>&quot;This trend is continuing in 1997 and the first six months should show considerable improvement on the same period last year,&quot; chairman Eugene Murtagh told shareholders at an annual meeting.  </p>
<p>Murtagh said the Irish market remained very strong on a consistent basis. It said the UK has been on the road to recovery for the past two years, but on a quarter by quarter basis it remained volatile.</p>
<p>&quot;Kingspan is still managing to show consistent growth, even against these somewhat erratic UK market conditions,&quot; the group said.</p>
<p>It said its exposure to the German market was quite limited and while it had been a difficult market overall, Kingspan has managed to maintain its activity level there, although at slightly reduced margins.</p>
<p>The Benelux market is very consistent and looks like remaining so for the rest of 1997, it said, adding that the full year outlook was favourable, given the good start to 1997.</p>
