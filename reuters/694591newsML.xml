<p>The management of French carmaker Renault met on Saturday to decide the fate of a Belgian factory and its 3,000 workers after coming under heavy political and trade union pressure to reconsider its plan to close the plant on July 31.</p>
<p>A Renault spokeswoman said the meeting started at 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) and the company planned to issue a communique after the talks ended.</p>
<p>Chairman Louis Schweitzer called Saturday's board meeting to examine an independent report into alternatives to the closure plan, which was announced last February.</p>
<p>Renault announced at a shareholders meeting on June 10 that it would commission the report by an independent consultant.</p>
<p>It said then that if the study led it to confirm its decision &quot;a plan would be immediately implemented, including on the one hand the appropriate social measures and, on the other hand, the establishment of a significant industrial activity on the site&quot;.</p>
<p>The plan to shut the plant at Vilvoorde near Brussels has provoked a storm of controversy. The plight of some 3,000 workers has been held up by unions and some politicians as proof of the need for greater solidarity at a time of mass unemployment in the European Union.</p>
<p>France's new socialist-led government referred to the Renault saga when it recently announced plans to review legislation on worker lay-offs.</p>
<p>Finance Minister dominique Strauss-Kahn has highlighted the issue, saying that France had this kind of problem in mind when it got EU leaders to adopt a pact on jobs and employment at a summit in Amsterdam earlier this month.</p>
<p>Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene has criticised Renault's plan but warned earlier this month against too much optimism about the closure being abandonned. He said the final decision would be taken by Renault and not by the French government which owns 46 percent of the company.</p>
