<p>Cambodian co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh said on Tuesday he feared a deadly weekend grenade attack was not an isolated incident and could mark the onset of further violence ahead of coming elections.</p>
<p>&quot;I fear it is not an isolated incident,&quot; said Ranariddh of the attack that killed at least 14 people and wounded more than 100. &quot;I think that it is a real act of political crime, an act of intimidation toward the next elections.&quot;</p>
<p>Local and national elections are expected in 1997 and 1998.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters, Ranariddh said opposition forces as well as his own party were no longer safe in Cambodia.</p>
<p>He said his troubled relationship with coalition partner co-Premier Hun Sen was becoming increasingly tense.</p>
<p>&quot;It is more and more difficult to work with (Hun Sen). The tension is not created by me,&quot; he said, adding he would seek a meeting with Hun Sen soon to resolve the situation.</p>
<p>The grenade attack outside the National Assembly in Phnom Penh on Sunday was the worst and most blatant act of political violence to hit Cambodia's fragile democracy since the current coalition government came to power after United Nations-organised general elections in May 1993.</p>
<p>Protest leader and apparent target Sam Rainsy, who narrowly escaped injury, on Tuesday continued to blame the attack on his bitter foe Hun Sen, but the Information Ministry said it was unclear who was responsible and that a probe was underway.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a massacre...a mass killing of innocent people,&quot; said Rainsy, who has also said he fears further violence ahead of the local and national elections.</p>
<p>A U.N. human rights official denounced the attack as an attempt to wipe out the leadership of the main opposition party.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a clear attempt to assassinate the leadership of an opposition political party who was conducting a legal and peaceful political demonstration,&quot; said Thomas Hammarberg, special U.N. representative for Human Rights in Cambodia.</p>
<p>The U.N. official said he feared the killings and other violence had created an environment that could make the holding of free and fair general elections next year difficult.</p>
<p>Hammarberg added in a statement that he had &quot;serious concerns about the possibility of a serious, professional investigation in this matter&quot;.</p>
<p>Amnesty International also condemned the attack.</p>
<p>&quot;The incident appears to be part of a pattern of increasing political tension and violence, and is an extremely worrying development,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Ranariddh and Hun Sen, who formed an uneasy coalition after the 1993 elections, are expected to oppose each other in the polls.</p>
<p>To strengthen his position, Ranariddh recently formed an alliance with Sam Rainsy and a third party to oppose Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP).</p>
<p>An emotional Ranariddh called Sunday's attack a &quot;tragedy for democracy&quot; and said it was a case of political intimidation, but added that it was too early to place blame for the attack.</p>
<p>But he took a tough stance against Hun Sen's warnings on Sunday that he would seek to arrest those who had organised the demonstration, an apparent threat to Sam Rainsy.</p>
<p>Ranariddh said he would not permit Sam Rainsy to be arrested for a legal demonstration which he said had rightfully called attention to a politicised justice system.</p>
