<p>Conservative President Jacques Chirac has warned French voters against electing a left-wing government on May 25-June 1 and obliging him to share power in a duo once likened to rival cats or a two-headed monster.</p>
<p>But France's two bouts of &quot;cohabitation&quot;, in 1986-88 and 1993-95, hardly bear out Chirac's fears that France's voice in Europe will be undermined by squabbling between a prime minister and president from opposite ideological camps.</p>
<p>Overall, foreign policy went smoothly in both periods.</p>
<p>Opinion polls show the opposition Socialists and Communists have an outside chance of victory in the two-stage National Assembly vote. And surveys show voters often favour cohabitation as an institutional straitjacket for politicians.</p>
<p>If anyone in France has suffered from power-sharing, it is Chirac who, as prime minister from 1986 to 1988, was repeatedly outfoxed by the then Socialist president, Francois Mitterrand.</p>
<p>&quot;Like cats we sleep with one eye open,&quot; Mitterrand remarked of the uneasy partnership. The French delegation turned up &quot;like a two-headed monster&quot; at one international summit in Tokyo, former president Valery Giscard d'Estaing said.</p>
<p>Mitterrand went on to have a more harmonious &quot;velvet cohabitation&quot; with conservative premier Edouard Balladur from 1993 to 1995. Chirac said in 1993 that the thought of cohabitation as premier &quot;sends shivers down my spine&quot;.</p>
<p>Now president, Chirac has called a snap election gambling that voters will re-elect the centre-right, ensuring him a friendly majority until the end of his seven-year term in 2002.</p>
<p>Chirac raised the spectre of cohabitation on Tuesday and his allies have rattled it ever since. But many analysts reckon that Socialist leader Lionel Jospin's commitment to European Union integration if he were premier would differ little from Chirac's even though Jospin wants conditions on a single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us never forget that (France) will only be able to defend its interests if it is capable of speaking with a single voice, a strong voice,&quot; Chirac said.</p>
<p>The phrase echoed Mitterrand, who said in 1986 on the eve of a Group of Seven summit of industrial powers in Tokyo with new prime minister Chirac: &quot;Each has his role. They can be complementary, but in the last resort, France must have just a single voice towards the outside world.&quot;</p>
<p>That summit ended with a knock-out victory for Mitterrand, who attended the final news conference with other leaders while Chirac was forced to sit in silence alone at the foot of the stage, smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>Jospin has said that &quot;it's obvious that, in the case of cohabitation, France would speak with a sole voice after 1997 as it did between 1986 and 1988 and between 1993 and 1995.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When one sees the way they're grabbing all the power at the moment, I think it would be in the French people's interests to share power,&quot; he said. Under the constitution, the president has pre-eminence in foreign affairs and is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and thus of France's nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>Former European Commission president Jacques Delors, a French Socialist, recalled that a European leader had come to Mitterrand at a 1988 European summit to gripe about Chirac. &quot;It's the French position,&quot; he said Mitterrand snapped back.</p>
<p>Chirac and Mitterrand pushed together for the ratification of the Single European Act and both vaunted the benefits of the single European market in fighting the 1988 presidential race, which Mitterrand won.</p>
<p>Domestically, the relationship was fraught. The first open crisis arose in July 1986 when Mitterrand refused to sign decrees speeding up the privatisation of state firms and making it easier for firms to lay off workers.</p>
<p>Faced with a choice between resigning and knuckling under, Chirac yielded and took the cumbersome, slower route of pushing all his policies through parliament.</p>
