<text>
<p>Equifax Inc said Tuesday its Insurance Services Group, which is being spun off, had agreed in principle to acquire Kroll Associates Inc, a large provider of corporate intelligence and risk management consulting services.</p>
<p>Terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Equifax said the deal was expected to be completed shortly after the spinoff of the Insurance Services Group.</p>
<p>Equifax previously announced it would spin off the group to its shareholders, subject to a regulatory ruling that the dividend distribution of stock will be tax-free to shareholders.  </p>
<p>The spin-off is expected to take place this summer.</p>
<p>After the spinoff, Equifax said the Insurance Services Group will be renamed ChoicePoint and will be traded publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPS.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an important step in furthering our vision of using information to help our customers better manage increasingly complex business risks,&quot; said Derek Smith, Equifax executive vice president and chief executive of ChoicePoint.</p>
<p>&quot;Kroll Associates brings unique expertise in corporate intelligence and risk management consulting services, and a depth of experience in diverse industries and markets that is important to our strategy.&quot;</p>
<p>Kroll Associates currently employs about 300 people in 22 offices in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin America, with relationships with over 1,000 investigations professionals worldwide.  The company is expected to continue to operate with its current management team and structure and to retain the Kroll Associates name.</p>
