<text>
<p>Norway on Friday contributed $2 million towards a U.N. trust fund for preventive diplomacy and has promised to donate another $2 million by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The Netherlands said it would shortly give $500,000 for the same purpose. Some of the monies will be used immediately to finance the activities of Mohamed Sahnoun, the U.N. representative for Central Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;For us the secretary-general of the United Nations is the most important peaekemaker in the world. and it is the obligation of member states to give him the resources to play the role that we want him to play,&quot; said Jan Egeland, Norway's state secretary in handing over the check.</p>
<p>&quot;It is often sad to see that when there is a momentum, when there is a window of opporunity, the United Nations and the secretary general do not have enough resources to act quickly and swiftly,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Asked about lack of funds, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the organisation's unwieldy budget process has often slowed down approved activities. He said that in Mozambique, where countries created a special fund, the United Nations was able to spend monies to convert a guerrilla movement into a political party.</p>
<p>The newly-created trust fund was first proposed  by former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlim Brundtland who said it was important to provide the United Nations with the means of taking early action to defuse potential conficts and prevent existing onces from escalating.</p>
