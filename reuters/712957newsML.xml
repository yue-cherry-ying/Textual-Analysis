<p>Montserratians mourned on Tuesday for victims of the Soufriere Hills volcano as search and rescue teams found a man burned but alive nearly two weeks after deadly rock flows wiped out seven villages.</p>
<p>Residents remaining on the troubled Caribbean island attended church services during a national day of mourning for 22 people killed or missing as a result of massive flows of superheated rock, gases and ash from the volcano on June 25.</p>
<p>They were the first deaths attributed to the volcano since it roared to life in July, 1995, after nearly four centuries of dormancy. Government spokesman Claude Hogan said nine people were confirmed dead and up to 13 others were still missing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Search teams continued their hunt in the devastated villages and early on Tuesday found a man alive in the town of Streatham on the mountain's northern flank, Hogan said. His feet were burned but little else was known of his condition.</p>
<p>The rescue effort was dangerous because of debris from the volcano and the continuing threat of eruptions although the mountain was relatively quiet on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The search remains difficult. The area is covered in 10-12 feet of ash,&quot; Hogan said. &quot;It will not stop until we can reasonably account for those we have missing.&quot;</p>
<p>He said as many as 700 people had left for neighbouring islands since the latest volcanic activity, leaving about 5,800 people on Montserrat, a tiny British colony in the eastern Caribbean 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Antigua.</p>
<p>The population was about 11,000 before the volcanic activity began. &quot;People are leaving or planning to leave. There is quite a bit of uncertainty,&quot; Chief Minister Bertrand Osborne said. &quot;But the scientists have assured us that the north side of the island is still safe.&quot;</p>
<p>Osborne said food supplies were adequate and new supplies of fuel, which was being rationed, were expected on Tuesday.</p>
