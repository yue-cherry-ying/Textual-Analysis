<headline>Oppenheimer in talks on sale, source says.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Privately held Wall Street brokerage Oppenheimer &amp; Co. Inc. is currently in talks with a possible suitor on being acquired, an Oppenheimer source said Thursday.</p>
<p>The talks were in the preliminary stages, said one source at the brokerage, with no announcement imminent.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who doesn't know that brokerage firms are the object of interest at the moment has been living inside the Arctic Circle,&quot; said the source, a senior executive at the firm. &quot;It's a fair conclusion to say we are being talked to.&quot;</p>
<p>An Oppenheimer spokesman said the firm had no official comment on a Wall Street Journal report that it was in talks to be acquired by PNC Bank Corp. for $500 million. A PNC spokesman also said the bank would have no comment, and another Oppenheimer source said the buyer was not expected to be PNC.</p>
<p>The newspaper also reported that Fleet Financial Group would review Oppenheimer's books in the next several weeks. Fleet officials were not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>The $500 million price mentioned in the newspaper report would be about 1.6 times Oppenheimer's book value, or the value of its total assets minus its liabilities. That figure would be significantly less than the range of 2-1/2 times book value that Bankers Trust New York Corp. agreed to in its $1.6 billion acquisition of brokerage Alex. Brown Inc., said one takeover specialist, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>&quot;I have always heard they were on the block,&quot; said the trader. &quot;All the brokerage firms are going to get taken over. Banks want to get into this business.</p>
<p>&quot;Bigger is better and the banks can provide the necessary capital. For many brokerage firms, it is their only exit strategy.&quot;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, rumours were rampant on Wall Street that J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Inc. and Chase Manhattan Corp. were looking at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Lehman denied the reports.</p>
<p>One industry analyst, who discounted the speculation on Lehman, valued the firm at $50 to $55 per share. Lehman shares rose 37.5 cents to $38.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
