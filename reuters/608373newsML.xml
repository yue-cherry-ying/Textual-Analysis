<title>CANADA: BASEBALL-BLUE JAYS BRING RUBEN SIERRA UP FROM MINORS.</title>
<headline>BASEBALL-BLUE JAYS BRING RUBEN SIERRA UP FROM MINORS.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Toronto Blue Jays, hoping to add punch to the American League's lightest-hitting lineup, brought veteran outfielder Ruben Sierra up from the minor leagues Friday.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays purchased his contract from Triple-A Syracuse less than two weeks after signing him to the minor-league pact and 16 days after he was released by the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old switch-hitter batted just .219 with one homer and five RBI in eight games with Syracuse. The Reds cut loose Sierra on May 6 after he hit .244 with two homers and seven RBI in 25 games.</p>
<p>Cincinnati acquired him from Detroit last October for two minor leaguers but assumed just $600,000 of Sierra's $6.5 million salary for 1997.</p>
<p>Sierra's last productive season was 1995, when he combined to hit .263 with 19 homers and 86 RBI in 126 games for the Oakland Athletics and New York Yankees. Last year, he batted just .247 for the Yankees and Tigers with 12 homers and 72 RBI.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays are last in the American League with a .242 team batting average and their 158 runs are 35 fewer than any other team in the league.</p>
