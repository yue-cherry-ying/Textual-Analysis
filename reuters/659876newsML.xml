<p>Secretary-General Kofi Annan has sent a &quot;wish list&quot; to the leaders of industrialised countries meeting next week in Denver, Colorado, focusing on some of the issues he hopes they will address.</p>
<p>The letter, made public on Friday, urges backing for U.N. efforts to help developing countries and safeguard the environment, and for moves to reform and strengthen the United Nations to meet the challenges of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Taking part in the June 20-22 summit will be the heads of state or government of the Group of Seven nations, comprising Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, joined as in past years by Russia.</p>
<p>Annan's letter said globalization of the economy held great potential for growth and development, &quot;yet many developing countries, and in particular the least developing countries, have not shared in the fruits of globalization, including expanded international trade and investment.&quot;</p>
<p>He suggested one important outcome of the Denver summit might be reaffirmation of support for an integrated approach, through the United Nations, to peace-building and economic and social progress.</p>
<p>The G7 countries could also reaffirm their commitment to sustain the United Nations as a major and reliable source of on-the-ground support to development around the world, and particularly in the low-income countries.&quot;</p>
<p>He made a special plea on behalf of African countries, saying there were clear indications their economies were emerging from the stagnation of the 1980s and that the &quot;stage is set for the industrial countries to reinforce the progress now at last underway in Africa.&quot;</p>
<p>Annan said environmental issues had a special significance since the Denver summit would be followed by a special session of the General Assembly from June 23-27 at which world leaders will review progress in carrying out the goals of a landmark 1992 U.N. conference in Rio de Janeiro on the environment.</p>
<p>&quot;Much has been accomplished since Rio. There are also major areas of disappointment in the implementation process,&quot; the letter said. It added that a &quot;reaffirmation by the Denver summit of the goals reached five years ago is highly desirable, including the provision of increased financial and technical assistance to the developing world.&quot;</p>
<p>Noting that three U.N. departments dealing with socio-economic and development issues had been merged, as suggested by last year's summit in Lyon, Annan outlined further plans to reform and strengthen the United Nations.</p>
<p>&quot;A strong positive message of support from the Denver summit for the reform measures under way and those to be announced this summer, would be most valuable,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Annan also discussed the world body's dire financial straits -- without mentioning the $1.3 billion owed by the United States. He said when regular budget funds were exhausted by the end of August, the United Nations would have to resume borrowing from its peacekeeping accounts.</p>
<p>&quot;It is urged that the summit support an early positive resolution of this recurrent fiscal crisis,&quot; he said.</p>
