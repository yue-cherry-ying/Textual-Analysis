<p>IPE Brent crude futures closed 27 cents lower on Tuesday in lethargic activity that nevertheless saw firm support for front-month May at just above $19.00 a barrel, brokers said.</p>
<p>Front month May settled at $19.11 a barrel, towards the bottom end of the day's range and 10 cents off the low.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people are nervous of going short at these numbers and we saw some cash deals holding the market up,&quot; a trader said. Traders said business overall was featureless and thin.</p>
<p>Oversupplied physical Brent lent the market a bearish tone, an April 7-9 loader selling for May Brent -94 cents, equivalent to six cents lower than Thursday's values.</p>
<p>The May Brent contract spiked to the day's high of $19.27 a barrel around 1625 GMT, lifted by a break above $20.60 a barrel on May NYMEX crude. But May Brent was immediately sold into and retreated to trade in a range of $19.15 to $19.20 a barrel.</p>
<p>NYMEX crude later slipped briefly into contango amid ample prompt supply, but increased refinery runs were expected to keep it shallow and short-lived, traders in New York said.</p>
<p>At 1829 GMT, May NYMEX crude was up two cents at $20.43 a barrel. May gasoline was up 0.08 cent at 63.30 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is looking for these API numbers,&quot; said a NYMEX floor trader.</p>
<p>The U.S. market was forecasting a one million barrel build in stocks for the week ended March 28. Distillate stocks were seen down 1.13 million barrels and gasoline down 2 million barrels.</p>
<p>IPE gas oil futures closed $1.25 a tonne lower as U.S. sellers brushed off the potentially bullish effect of snowstorms in the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>April gas oil settled at $165.50 a tonne, 25 cents off the low.</p>
<p>U.S. players were seen selling the contract down while European dealers appeared more supportive. Snowstorms in parts of the U.S. northeast failed to revive the contract. Heating oil was 0.18 cent higher on NYMEX at 54.60 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>Weekly U.S. inventory data was expected late on Tuesday and GNI said they expected crude, gasoline and distillate stocks all to be &quot;flat to a couple of million barrels lower.&quot;</p>
