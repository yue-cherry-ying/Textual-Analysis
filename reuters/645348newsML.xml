<p>The French Defence Ministry confirmed on Sunday that there had been a clash in Congo Brazzaville between French and Congolese soldiers but said it had no details.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a fire fight,&quot; a Defence Ministry spokesman said. He said he had no other information at this time.</p>
<p>In Brazzaville, Western diplomats said a French soldier had been shot dead and two others wounded on Saturday after they came under fire during a day of clashes between rival militias.</p>
<p>Three days of clashes pitting supporters of former president Denis Sassou Nguesso against soldiers loyal to President Pascal Lissouba and other political and ethnic rivals have rocked Brazzaville, capital of the former French colony.</p>
<p>French soldiers came to Brazzaville several months ago and like U.S., British, Belgian and Portuguese troops remained on standby to evacuate foreign nationals from Kinshasa in the event of a bloodbath there during the final days of the civil war that brought Laurent Kabila to power. The others all left.</p>
