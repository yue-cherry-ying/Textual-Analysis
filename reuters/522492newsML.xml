<p>Albert Costa, who guaranteed himself a place in the world's top 10 at the Barcelona Open this week, can now win the event on Sunday.</p>
<p>Costa earned a showdown in the final against Albert Portas by scoring an impressive 7-6 (8-6) 7-5 victory over Carlos Moya in Saturday's all-Spanish semifinals.</p>
<p>Portas, a qualifier ranked just 133rd in the world, will play the first best-of-five-set match of his life after blasting aside Alberto Berasategui 6-3 7-5.</p>
<p>Costa's triumph over the only other Spaniard in the top 10 came the day after he had guaranteed himself a place among the elite in next week's revised rankings.</p>
<p>&quot;It's difficult to play with a friend.  We know each other so well, that at times you make mistakes trying to trick him,&quot; said Costa after a match in which 11 games had gone against serve.</p>
<p>The match was delayed half an hour by rain, and with the sting of Moya's serve dampened by the wet conditions, both players tried to break up each other's baseline game with drop shots.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally he serves well, perhaps it's because we know one other that there were so many breaks. It was a bit of a strange match,&quot; said Costa.</p>
<p>It turned on the first-set tie-break in which Moya, the beaten Australian Open finalist, looked unusually nervous.</p>
<p>Moya was able to force his way back from 5-2 down, but Costa held his nerve to take the tie-break 8-6 after double-faulting on his first set-point.</p>
<p>Costa kept the upper hand in the second set, despite allowing Moya to break back twice, and took the match after Moya let a further service game slip through his hands.</p>
<p>Moya acknowledged he was a 'bit sad' after the game.</p>
<p>&quot;I really hoped to play a final here, which is practically my home,&quot; said Moya &quot;But I'm 20 and I have an opportunity in the future.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At least a friend won ... and at least a Spaniard will win the tournament,&quot; added Moya, who said the friendship between the Spanish players on the circuit meant the match could have been played without linesmen.</p>
<p>Portas' win means the final will not just be between Spaniards, but between local men from the province of Catalonia.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be something special, everybody's happy,&quot; said Portas, who earlier in the week knocked out fifth-seeded Marcelo Rios of Chile after battling through the qualifying competition.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm living a dream this week, each day that passes is more incredible,&quot; said Portas. &quot;Practically not even I understand, it's happened so quickly, it's not normal.&quot;</p>
<p>Portas, 23, outpowered former French Open finalist Berasategui in a forehand battle in which the weakness of both players on the backhand side was exposed.</p>
<p>Portas put the first of his match points out and then saw a drop-shot hit the top of the tape and drop agonizingly back.</p>
<p>Portas threw away that game and seemed to have lost nerve but recovered to hang to his own serve and capitalised on mistakes in Berasategui's game to break again and secure a place in the final.</p>
