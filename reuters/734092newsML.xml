<p>Despite considerable investment, London's healthcare system has difficulty providing adequate primary care, mental health and residential services for the elderly, an independent medical research organisation said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A two-year investigation by health experts of the King's Fund says residential care for the elderly is in short supply, mental health services for minorities are poor and primary care services are below the standard for the rest of the country.</p>
<p>&quot;The main problem with London's health care is that those with the greatest needs are getting the worst care,&quot; Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the commission, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The commission recommends that the Labour government pool healthcare resources for example, by combining the budgets for hospital and community health services with family health services.</p>
<p>It urges the Labour government create an independent agency to ensure that the capital needs of the National Health Service are met. And it recommends Labour create specialist agencies to deal with the particular problems of primary care and mental health in the capital.</p>
<p>&quot;The system is under terrific strain at the moment. It is clear that the internal market fragmented care by putting dozens of health bodies in competition with each other,&quot; Hussey said. &quot;This report is about co-operation, working together to plan for the needs of Londoners.&quot;</p>
<p>The report puts particular emphasis on the provision of primary care in London which it says is below the standard for the rest of England.</p>
<p>London has a higher proportion of general practices without a nurse, a higher proportion that are single physician rather than group-led practices and a higher the proportion where physical premises are below minimum standards.</p>
<p>London general practices also perform less well than those in the rest of England on national immunisation and screening targets. For example, 58 per cent of London children under the age of five receive developmental monitoring such as sight and hearing tests, compared with 76 per cent for the rest of the country.</p>
<p>&quot;It is striking that even high-status areas of London perform less well (in general practice) than inner-deprived areas of other English cities,&quot; the report says.</p>
<p>The report notes that since 1981, acute services in London have been consolidated into fewer sites and the number of single-speciality sites have almost halved.</p>
<p>While most of the hospital closures involved smaller acute facilities, little or nothing has been done to address &quot;...the fragmentation of speciality and super-speciality services within London's teaching hospitals,&quot; the report says.</p>
<p>The report notes changes in the location of hospital services in London have been undertaken with a view to achieving greater cost effectiveness and higher quality of care.</p>
<p>Yet, at least one study has shown that evidence linking improved clinical outcomes with the volume of hospital activity is inconclusive.</p>
<p>&quot;More high-quality evaluative research is required if the case for the centralisation of certain kinds of treatment in specialist centres is to be strengthened,&quot; the report says.</p>
<p>Last month, the government appointed a special panel to look at the quality of healthcare services in London. The panel, headed by Sir Leslie Turnberg, president of the Royal College of Physicians, is expected to complete its review by the end of October.</p>
