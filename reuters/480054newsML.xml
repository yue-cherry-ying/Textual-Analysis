<title>REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: Irish bonds follow gloomy markets down.</title>

<p>Irish bonds slumped after the long Easter break on Tuesday in line with other European markets gloomy over fears of a further hike in U.S. interest rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>A strong NAPM report added to the gloom about the U.S. economy, depressing U.S. Treasuries. The NAPM index read 55.0 in March against 53.1 in February and above forecasts of 53.6.</p>
<p>&quot;I think players now accept that we're in a bear phase - the question is, how long will it last?&quot; one dealer said. &quot;All eyes will be looking to U.S. data for clues, especially the non-farm payroll numbers due on Friday.&quot;</p>
<p>The market was resigned to a strong figure, with a rise of around 180,000 expected, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The average earnings figure will be important - if it drops back it may be enough to stabilize things, if it goes up, we could be looking at a severe sell-off,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said bond yields had risen by five to seven basis points across the curve in response to international gloom on markets fearing that a further rate hike may be deemed necessary to rein in a surging U.S. economy.</p>
<p>By 1600 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was down 15 pence from Thursday's close at 100.88 to yield 6.26 percent while the key benchmark eight percent bond due 2006 was down 37 pence from the close at 106.88 to yield 6.96 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market had been quiet since some light selling early in the session.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, dealers said, domestic borrowing figures for the first quarter, due from the Department of Finance later this week, could be interesting.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the figures) may not be market-moving but it'll be interesting to see whether the borrowing requirement has fallen and whether the department says anything about what they suggest,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The market is also awaiting monetary statistics from the Central Bank on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The size of forex reserves will tell us the degree of central bank intervention in February, always a useful indicator,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
