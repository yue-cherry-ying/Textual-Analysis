<title>HUNGARY: HUNGARY TO BUY BACK MORE GE-CONTROLLED BANK ASSETS.</title>
<headline>HUNGARY TO BUY BACK MORE GE-CONTROLLED BANK ASSETS.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Hungary said on Thursday it had agreed to buy back 2.6 billion forints worth of assets of Budapest Bank, in which GE Capital and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have stakes.</p>
<p>The buyback stems from an agreement in the 1995 privatisation contract with GE and EBRD which gave the new investors the right to sell back up to 8.2 billion forints worth of assets to the state in recognition of the high risk involved in GE not conducting a thorough screening of the bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Budapest Bank has made use of the (sellback) opportunity and has offered for repurchase a portfolio worth 2.6 billion forints,&quot; Hungarian government spokesman Elemer Kiss told reporters.</p>
<p>The sellback clause states that the assets for resale are to be selected by the new owners and are calculated at the December 1995 dollar/forint exchange rate.</p>
<p>Kiss said GE had not said precisely which assets would be sold in this second buyback but added that the government would consider whether the value of the portfolio offered had changed.</p>
<p>&quot;The question is whether the value of the assets has declined through the operations of the new owners,&quot; he said. &quot;If so, the government should not be disadvantaged.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that the government would commission Fakultas Kft, owned outright by Reorg Rt, a state interest, to technically carry out the repurchase and is providing a state guarantee on the deal.</p>
<p>The privatisation of the Budapest Bank was forced through ahead of a December 1995 deadline by which the bank was obliged to repay 12 billion forints worth of government loans if it did not find a buyer.</p>
<p>The bank's registered capital amounts to 20.04 billion forints, of which GE Capital owns 27.4 percent, the EBRD 32.4 percent and the Hungarian state 22.8 percent.</p>
<p>GE controls Budapest Bank by agreement with the other shareholders and first took advantage of the sellback clause, which is valid for 1997 and 1998, in December last year when it sold back to the Hungarian government a subsidiary, Polgari Bank, for its net value, estimated at 1.1 billion forints.</p>
<p>The state then sold on Polgari Bank to the Hungarian Penzintezeti Kozpont Bank for an estimated 500 million forints.</p>
