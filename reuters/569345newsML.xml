<p>Key June Japanese government bond (JGB) futures ended Thursday's Tokyo session lower following poor six-year government bond auction results.</p>
<p>June closed down 0.40 at 124.05, after trading between 124.01 and 124.76. Turnover was 51,233 lots.</p>
<p>The benchmark contract slipped into negative territory in the mid-afternoon on fears that the six-year bond auction would produce poor results.</p>
<p>&quot;Dealers sold futures for hedging purposes as investor interest for the new 6-year bond was scant,&quot; said a brokerage house trader.  </p>
<p>Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) said the 1.8 percent 20th six-year government bond auction produced a lowest price of 99.06 and an average price of 99.12.</p>
<p>&quot;There was disappointment among some dealers after MOF set the coupon for the six-year bond at 1.8 percent in the morning,&quot; said a trader at another brokerage house.</p>
<p>&quot;People were hoping for a 1.9 percent coupon,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The yield of the 1.6 percent 19th six-year government bond issued in March rose to 1.90 percent after MOF announced the coupon for the 20th bond, up from levels of slightly above 1.80 percent on late Wednesday, the second trader said.  </p>
<p>Today's auction confirmed investors' cautious stance, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are in no hurry to buy. They seem to prefer to wait for bargain-hunting opportunities,&quot; said the first trader.</p>
<p>Traders said selling pressure intensified towards the close as the June contract fell below 124.20, which had been seen as a key level.</p>
<p>The Tokyo stock market's resilience, despite of sharp falls overnight in New York stocks, also limited JGBs' upside, traders said.  </p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 stock average ended up 12.91 points, or 0.06 percent, at 20,061.81.</p>
<p>In the cash JGB market, sporadic selling by investors was seen at the long-end of the yield curve, particularly in the 190th to 194th JGBs, traders said.</p>
<p>The yield of the benchmark cash 182nd JGB stood at 2.510 percent as of 4.25 p.m. (0725 GMT), up from Wednesday's close of 2.425 percent.</p>
<p>A high level of open interest in June JGB futures put options with a strike price of 123.00, also remains as a source of concern, traders said.  </p>
<p>Open interest in the 123.00 put options, which is the largest of all June JGB put options listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, increased by 207 billion yen to 1.3943 trillion yen on Thursday after falling by 955 billion yen on Wednesday.</p>
<p>June put options expire on May 30.</p>
<p>A vague rumour that a major foreign newspaper carried an article about a rise in Japan's interest rate also led to weakness in the afternoon, traders said.</p>
<p>The impact, however, was short-lived as the rumour proved to be groundless, they said.</p>
