<p>Buffets Inc said Thursday that same-store sales and profits in the second quarter could be hurt by a decline in television advertising compared with a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Since advertising is not expected to begin in earnest until the third quarter '97, that could have an adverse impact on same store sales, and on second quarter profitability,&quot; Roe Hatlen, chairman, said in a statement.  &quot;The company's enhancements to restaurant operations, including training efforts, the new menu roll-out and restaurant conversions could have a similar effect.&quot;  </p>
<p>He added that operational improvements made in the first and second quarters should &quot;put us in an excellent position to capitalize on the third-quarter marketing campaign.</p>
<p>Buffets also said it plans to open about 15 additional restaurants in 1997, and currently expects to convert an additional 15 to 20 units, primarily Old Country Buffet restaurants, to HomeTown Buffets.</p>
<p>The company opened 10 new restaurants during the first quarter and converted eight Old Country Buffet units to HomeTown Buffet.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our new stores generated average weekly sales of $59,417 during the first quarter, well above our company average,&quot; Hatlen said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Buffets reported earnings for the first quarter ended April 24 of $0.14 a share, down from $0.16 a year ago. Restaurant sales in the quarter rose 10.7 percent to $240.7 million from $217.5 million.</p>
<p>Hatlen said the company tested a new menu that will be rolled out systemwide in June.  The new menu will be less labor intensive, easier to produce and will add variety for customers, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our new labor forecasting model was also tested during the first quarter and will be rolled out systemwide in the second quarter and again should serve to improve the productivity of our restaurant staff,&quot; he said.</p>
