<p>Mali's constitutional court on Thursday rejected an opposition request for a delay in Sunday's presidential election.</p>
<p>Court president Abdoulaye Dicko announced the ruling as opposition parties staged an authorised protest march in the capital Bamako.</p>
<p>&quot;The opposition petition is inadmissable,&quot; Dicko told a news conference at the court.</p>
<p>The opposition had called for the poll to be delayed after severe organisational problems marred an April 13 parliamentary election. The court has scrapped those results.</p>
<p>It had argued that a one-week delay announced by President Alpha Oumar Konare could create confusion. The court did not accept this argument.</p>
<p>Mali, praised for its 1992 democratic transition, has run into trouble with this year's second multi-party national elections.</p>
<p>Malians turned out in force on April 13 only to find that problems with voter cards, lists or ballot materials prevented them from voting.</p>
<p>The main opposition parties have said they will boycott the presidential poll leaving Konare, a historian, with just one challenger -- businessman Hamadou Maribatrou Diaby.</p>
<p>The government has closed schools and colleges after they threw stones and burned Konare campaign posters on Monday.</p>
<p>The presidential poll is the impoverished West African country's second since independence from France in 1960 and seen as a key test of democracy.</p>
<p>Representatives of 15 non-political interest groups, among them the main Islamic body, unions and the business association, condemned both government and opposition politicians for failing to reach an agreement on holding the election.</p>
<p>Political analysts in Bamako compare a wave of student demonstrations, power and water strikes with the tension which gripped the city before the 1991 overthrow of former one-party ruler General Moussa Traore by the military.</p>
<p>Konare, a historian elected in 1992, has steered the country on a course of economic liberalisation. He has won praise from the World Bank and the United States for his efforts.</p>
