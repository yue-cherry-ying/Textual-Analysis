<headline>Options-Coffee vols unchanged but activity perks up.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>LIFFE coffee options volatilities were barely moved this holiday-shortened week but activity picked up slightly as futures staged a rally on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders said July coffee options volatility hovered unchanged at around 37-39 percent and at-the-money September puts at 37-38 percent and calls at 43 percent.</p>
<p>Coffee futures jumped by nearly four percent on Wednesday on fund and industry buying after benchmark July triggered buy-stops at above $1,730.</p>
<p>Further advances to above $1,750 triggered option-related short-covering. Locals sold around the $1,750 calls and hedged on the futures as the market advanced.</p>
<p>The futures market rose further this morning on follow-through fund buying. News Brazil's portworkers in Santos stopped work on Thursday due to salary delay helped values in the afternoon.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, option volume totalled a hefty 2,499 lots. Traders noted November $2,000 calls were traded at $77 against November $1,500 puts.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously, it's difficult to say what people are doing in terms of strategy,&quot; said one trader. Volatility traders were seen as sellers and, some traders said, buyers were probably taking a punt.</p>
<p>This morning, there was further interest in November $2,000 puts, trading at $85.</p>
<p>Holders of July options are taking a protection against the Brazilian frost as the cold season nears.</p>
<p>June and July are the frost danger months and the last severe frosts in 1994 damaged coffee trees and sent prices spiralling.</p>
<p>But one trader said: &quot;People seem to be discounting it (the frost) at the moment. Vols are still reasonably cheap coming into that period.&quot;</p>
<p>Cocoa futures were hardly traded. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 5424985</p>
