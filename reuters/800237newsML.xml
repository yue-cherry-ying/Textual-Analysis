<title>UK: Khan offers to take blood test in &quot;love child&quot; case.</title>
<headline>Khan offers to take blood test in &quot;love child&quot; case.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-14</dateline>

<p>Pakistani cricket hero turned politician Imran Khan, ruled by a U.S. judge to be the father of an illegitimate five-year-old girl, on Thursday offered to take a blood test.</p>
<p>He also pledged to abide by any decision of a Pakistani court on the paternity issue.</p>
<p>&quot;Imran Khan is the father of the child,&quot; Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner (judge) Anthony Jones ruled on Wednesday after hearing evidence from the child's mother, Sita White, daughter of the late British industrialist Lord Gordon White.</p>
<p>Khan, defeated in his bid to become prime minister of Pakistan in February, did not appear in court but issued a statement through a London publicist.</p>
<p>&quot;As I do not live in California or in England, my response is to welcome Sita White to Pakistan, where I live,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;And I would more than welcome the opportunity to present my side of the story in a Pakistani court rather than conducting an undignified trial by media.</p>
<p>&quot;I will of course be prepared to submit to a blood test in Pakistan and will fully stand by the decision of the competent Pakistani courts.&quot;</p>
<p>White testified that she met Khan, then captain of the Pakistan cricket team, in 1988, and conceived a child by him in 1991. The girl, referred to in court only by her first and middle names, Tyrian Jade, was born on June 15, 1992.</p>
<p>White, who lives with her daughter in Beverly Hills, was also granted sole custody of the child, but indicated in court that she would be willing to allow Khan to visit the girl if he chose to.</p>
<p>Khan, who has one son from his marriage to Jemima Goldsmith, daughter of the late tycoon Sir James Goldsmith, has steadfastly denied being the father of the girl. He married Jemima in 1995.</p>
<p>In his statement, he said: &quot;It is simply not possible for me to travel the world fighting court cases in every country. My work is in politics and with my (cancer) hospital in Pakistan.&quot;</p>
