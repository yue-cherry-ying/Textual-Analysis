<p>Pacificorp Kentucky Energy Co (corrects name), a subsidiary of PacifiCorp  said Thursday it submitted a new proposal to Big Rivers Electric Co that it said was valued $75 million more than a bid submitted by LG&amp;E Energy Corp in in March.</p>
<p>Big Rivers, a generation and transmision cooperative based in Henderson, Ky., is in bankruptcy proceedings.  </p>
<p>The PacifiCorp unit said it would also waive a claim of about $25 million against Big Rivers.</p>
<p>PacifiCorp and Big Rivers signed an omnibus agreement in August under which Pacificorp Kentucky would lease and operate Big Rivers' generation facilities for an annual lease payment of $30.1 million a year for 25 years and Big Rivers would buy power from the PacifiCorp unit for its four cooperative members.</p>
<p>Don Furman, president of PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc, said the new PacifiCorp proposal adds $125 million over its previous offer.  </p>
<p>The enhanced proposal includes $72 million in reductions on the price Big Rivers would pay for power bought from PacifiCorp Kentucky and $53 million by contracting with SIGCORP Inc to handle dispatching, transmission, supervision, maintenance and billing functions.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, SIGCORP would give hiring preference to Big Rivers employees or those displaced because of the company's financial problems.</p>
<p>PacifiCorp won in a bidding in 1995 for the leasing and operation of Big Rivers' generating facilities. However, a new auction was ordered by the bankruptcy court earlier this year and LG&amp;E, a Louisville, Ky.,-based energy services holding company, was the lone bidder.</p>
<p>Furman said PacifiCorp and other bidders did not submit any proposals in the new auction because they were unwilling and should not have been required to waive their legal rights.</p>
<p>&quot;Our proposal today is timely because it appears from the new plan of reorganization and disclosure statement submitted by Big Rivers that no agreement has been reached between Big Rivers and LG&amp;E on terms of the new transaction,&quot; he said.</p>
