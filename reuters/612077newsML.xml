<p>Economic growth in Asia has huge potential and is expected to show a slight increase this year before gradually picking up the pace in 1998, the Japanese government said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, the Asian region continues to have a strong labour base, capital has been growing with the support of foreign investment and productivity gains made on the back of technological progress can be foreseen -- it is difficult to see limits to growth,&quot; the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said in its annual report on Asian economies.</p>
<p>The report, which excludes Japan, said a drop-off in exports reduced growth in the Asian region in 1996 to 7.4 percent from 8.2 percent in 1995, but the fall was likely to be temporary.</p>
<p>Export values suffered last year partly due to foreign exchange movements and to a slump in semiconductor prices, but the Asian region has yet to reach its potential in terms of exporting power, an Economic Planning Agency (EPA) official said.</p>
<p>The report said that in 1997, the newly industrialised economies of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea were expected to show slightly faster growth on average, while growth in China and ASEAN countries was expected to be flat overall.</p>
<p>ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Focusing on East Asia, the EPA said in its summary that &quot;it was difficult to see any obstacles to sustained growth&quot; in the region.</p>
<p>It added that East Asian countries continued to make technological progress after having taken measures to liberalise investment in trade and by emphasising market mechanisms.</p>
<p>Companies in the newly industrialised economies were buying U.S. and Japanese companies, and research and development (R&amp;D) standards were not far behind those of industrialised countries, it said, adding that investment in R&amp;D was growing rapidly.</p>
<p>But it noted that there was still a large gap between newly industrialised economies and ASEAN economies, most of which continue to lag behind and some of which suffer from a critical shortage of technically skilled people.</p>
