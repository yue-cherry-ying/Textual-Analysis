<title>USA: Coastal's Wyatt sees widening futures probe.</title>

<p>Coastal Corp Chairman Oscar Wyatt, set to step down from that position on July 15, said federal investigators have likely widened a probe of futures trading irregularities at several energy firms following Coastal's firing of three traders in February.</p>
<p>Wyatt said Coastal fired its traders because they &quot;stepped in front&quot; of the company in trading futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).</p>
<p>&quot;You will ultimately see several other companies that have suffered at the hands of the same groups,&quot; he told reporters after the company's annual meeting.</p>
<p>Wyatt stopped short of alleging the traders were front-running, or buying and selling futures contracts ahead of a trade by the company and making profits on the spread.</p>
<p>NYMEX, federal regulators and the FBI have opened investigations into alleged diversion of millions of dollars in Coastal trading profits, the Wall Street Letter newsletter reported in March.</p>
<p>On January 27, Coastal said it had initiated an internal investigation into possible violations of corporate policy.</p>
<p>But Wyatt said the probe has moved well beyond the initial focus on Coastal. &quot;This thing will result in a long story, and ours will be one of the little things when this is all over,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Coastal executives said any trading losses resulting from the irregularities would be immaterial to the company's earnings.</p>
<p>A NYMEX spokeswoman said the exchange had no comment Thursday.</p>
