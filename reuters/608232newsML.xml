<text>
<p>President Clinton has nominated a Democrat and a Republican to fill two vacancies at the five member Federal Communications Commission, government officials said Friday.</p>
<p>The White House has yet to officially announce the nominations of Democrat William Kennard and Republican Harold Furchtgott-Roth. But the Clinton administration has forwarded the names to the Senate, which must confirm the nominees, the government officials said.  </p>
<p>Kennard, 40, is currently the FCC's general counsel, a post he has held since December 1993.</p>
<p>Under his stewardship, the FCC has been winning more than 80 percent of its cases before the U.S. appeals court in Washington. That's up from a bit under 60 percent before Kennard became general counsel.</p>
<p>Previously, Kennard was a partner and member of the board of directors of the Washington law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand. He specialized in communications law.</p>
