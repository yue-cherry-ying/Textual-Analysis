<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, once sacked as premier by the president, introduced constitutional amendments in parliament on Tuesday to curb the president's powers, winning unanimous Senate approval.</p>
<p>The bill undoes clauses of the controversial Eighth Amendment, a relic from military rule used by the late General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq to sack four prime ministers in eight years.</p>
<p>Sharif on Monday said his move had the approval of President Farooq Leghari, who used his Eighth Amendment powers in November to sack former prime minister Benazir Bhutto on disputed charges of corruption and misrule and dissolve the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The bill was to be moved in the 217-seat National Assembly (lower house) later on Tuesday and is believed certain to pass because Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (PML) party and its allies have the two-thirds majority needed for constitutional amendments.</p>
<p>Members of Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) voted for the bill in the Senate (upper house), party sources said. The PPP deputies in the National Assembly are also likely to back the bill.</p>
<p>Under the amendments, a dissolution of the National Assembly and subsequent sacking of a prime minister, and the appointment of armed forces chiefs and provincial governors by the president will be subject to mandatory advice from the prime minister.</p>
<p>One amendment also bars provincial governors from dissolving provincial parliaments without mandatory advice from the provincial chief ministers.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very good day for us,&quot; Sharif said in a speech to the senate after it passed the bill.</p>
<p>&quot;I promise that insha-Allah (God-willing) the government and opposition will work together on national issues and there would be no victimisation of the opposition,&quot; he said as Bhutto, now the main opposition figure, watched the proceedings from the visitors' gallery.</p>
<p>Sharif, who won a landslide victory in February 3 elections, said he met Leghari at the president's home village in Punjab province on Monday and &quot;he willingly agreed to this decision&quot;.</p>
<p>The late Zia, who introduced the Eighth Amendment as part of a bargain to end martial law, used it to sack his own hand-picked prime minister Mohammad Khan Junejo in May 1988 before being killed in a mysterious plane crash.</p>
<p>Bhutto was sacked first by president Ishaq Khan in 1990 and then by Leghari last November. Sharif was sacked by Ishaq Khan in 1993.</p>
<p>Bhutto accuses Leghari and the caretaker government he appointed of rigging the February 3 vote to deal a crushing defeat to her party.</p>
<p>She says will be back Sharif in repealing the Eighth Amendment.</p>
