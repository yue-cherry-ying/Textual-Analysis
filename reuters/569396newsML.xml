<p>Finnish telecommunications giant Nokia Oy is eying a 25 percent earnings contribution from Asia Pacific by next year compared to 22 percent in 1996, president and chief executive officer Jorma Ollila said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Today, Asia Pacific is the fastest growing part of our business, generating 22 percent of the group's revenue in 1996. By 1998, we expect the share to grow to 25 percent,&quot; Ollila told Reuters in an interview.  </p>
<p>For the quarter ended March 31, 1997 Nokia's pre-tax profit surged to 1.45 billion markka ($278.7 million) from 399 million int he same period of 1996, while sales grew to 11.33 billion from 7.93 billion.</p>
<p>Ollila said the region's growth, which had been evenly spread, would continue to be propelled by China, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
<p>While telecommunications infrastructure and mobile phone sales had been the growth engines for Nokia, Ollila said digitalisation in telecommunications would drive growth further.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are strong in digital mobile phones. Technology-wise, we are very strong in Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and Digital Cellular System (DCS),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The group plans to increase investments in research and development (R&amp;D) and expand its manufacturing in the region.</p>
<p>Ollila declined to reveal the investment budget or Nokia's investment commitment in the region to date, but said:</p>
<p>&quot;If we have 25 percent of our sales from the region, we would look forward to having 25 percent of our investment in the area.&quot;.  </p>
<p>Ollila said Nokia's growth would be organic and it had no plans to join any global alliance to spur growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Nokia's growth has been through its own R&amp;D and marketing capability with no broad global alliances. We intend to continue that way,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time, we are looking at opportunities to complement that basic strategy with local or business units or corporation alliances to strengthen our position,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But, he said, Nokia was not in any major discussions at the moment.  </p>
<p>The company, awarded a Singapore $50 million supply contract for its GSM network by MobileOne of Singapore last year, looks forward to expand the network's capacity, Ollila said.</p>
<p>It was also looking to contribute, possibly in wireless multimedia projects in Singapore ONE, the government's plan to link the whole island on one high capacity telecommunications cable system.</p>
<p>The network is intended to deliver multimedia services like films, video-conferencing and the Internet to every Signapore home.</p>
