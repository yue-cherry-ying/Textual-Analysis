<title>USA: Lakehead to go ahead with Illinois pipeline.</title>

<p>Lakehead Pipe Line Co, the U.S. affiliate of Interprovincial Pipe Line Inc, said late Wednesday it will continue with plans to build a crude oil pipeline into Chicago despite an Illinois decision to reject the request.</p>
<p>The proposed 24-inch line is part of an expansion program by Lakehead and Interprovincial that will add another 170,000 barrels per day (bpd) to its 1.7 million bpd system.</p>
<p>&quot;Lakehead is disappointed with the decision by the Illinois Commerce Commission. We will move to have this ruling reconsidered and if need be go to the Illinois appellate court,&quot; said company spokeswoman Denise Hamsher.</p>
<p>The commission narrowly rejected Lakehead's request earlier Wednesday on the ground the company did not prove there was sufficient need for the 455-mile line that will run from Lake Superior, Wisconsin, to refineries near Chicago.</p>
<p>The pipeline is connected to the Canadian portion of Interprovincial, which runs from Edmonton, Alberta to Lake Superior. The lines form the world's longest crude oil and liquids pipeline system, which is overseen by IPL Energy Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;The commission's conclusion is that since there are some other pipelines serving Chicago this extension is not needed,&quot; said Hamsher, adding those lines are not economically viable for many of the Chicago refineries.</p>
<p>Hamsher said Lakehead will continue to negotiate easements with landowners and secure the route required for construction, expected to begin later this year. The company has already secured more than 50 percent of the right-of-way through Illinois.</p>
<p>The proposed pipeline is to run mostly parallel to an already existing Lakehead pipeline.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company increased capacity on that line by 120,000 bpd through new and improved pumping stations.</p>
