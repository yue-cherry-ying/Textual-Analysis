<p>Taiwan had a trade surplus of US$1.599 billion in May, down 10.4 percent from May 1996's surplus of US$1.784 billion, the finance ministry said on Saturday.  </p>
<p>Exports in May totalled $10.16 billion, up 6.4 percent from May 1996, the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Taiwan's May imports rose an annual 10.2 percent to $8.56 billion, it said.</p>
<p>The May trade surplus of $1.599 billion was higher than the average forecast for a surplus of $1.1325 billion compiled from a Reuters Poll of Taiwan economists on June 4.</p>
<p>Hong Kong surpassed the United States in May to become Taiwan's top export market -- one of the clearest indications to date of communist China's growing importance to rival Taiwan's economy. Much of Hong Kong's imports are destined for China.  </p>
<p>May exports to Hong Kong accounted for 24.1 percent of Taiwan's total exports and a 9.3 percent increase from May 1996 to $2.444 billion.</p>
<p>Hsu Kuo-chung, the ministry's chief statistician, said Hong Kong's ouster of the United States as an export destination would be short-lived.</p>
<p>&quot;It will only be a temporary phenomenon for Hong Kong to be Taiwan's top export market,&quot; Hsu told reporters after the trade data announcement. &quot;For all of 1997, we expect the United States will still be Taiwan's biggest export destination.&quot;  </p>
<p>Hsu said he did not expect the British colony's July 1 handover to China to have a major impact on Taiwan's trade with Hong Kong. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Nationalist Taiwan, viewed by Beijing as a renegade province since a civil war split them in 1949, has allowed indirect trade and other indirect ties since a late 1980s political thaw. Flows of Taiwan trade and investment into the mainland have surged.</p>
<p>Taiwan's May exports to the United States totalled $2.35 billion, accounting for 23.2 percent of the total exports or 9.7 percent rise from a year ago. Exports to Europe stood at $1.52 billion in May, representing 15 percent of the total.  </p>
<p>Japan remained Taiwan's top import source, accounting for $2.12 billion or 24.8 percent of the total, followed by the United States at $1.83 billion (21.3 percent) and Europe at $1.55 billion (18.1 percent).</p>
<p>Taiwan expects to see higher import growth due to persistent and strong domestic demand in the recovering economy, Hsu said.</p>
<p>&quot;This year's import growth will be higher than that of exports. As a result, our trade surplus will shrink,&quot; Hsu said.</p>
<p>Taiwan's May trade surplus with the United States was down 5.9 percent at $520 million from the same month a year ago.  </p>
<p>Its trade surplus with Hong Kong, as always the main conduit for Taiwan's lucrative and growing unofficial trade with rival China, increased 9.3 percent at $2.29 billion.</p>
<p>Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan was $1.11 billion, up 27.4 percent from May 1996.</p>
