<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - UK shares ended a quiet and cautious week with a whimper, despite a robust performance on Wall Street. The FTSE 100 index closed up 11.6 points at 4,310.5, for a net gain of just 39.8 points for the week as worries over the strong pound, politics, and interest rates kept many institutional investors on the sidelines.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German shares trailed to a lower bourse session close as trading volumes remain thin and overall direction lacking, expiry of options on the DAX and DAX shares dampened activity, with the outlook for little change as the weekend approaches. The DAX index ended down 38.86 points to 3,344.39, up 4.34 on the week. In post-bourse trade the DAX index stood at 3,361.20.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares closed down sharply on political uncertainty stirred by growing speculation of an early parliamentary election. The blue-chip CAC-40 index ended 67.62 points or 2.59 percent lower at 2,547.56, down 27 from Friday week.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares ended firm after a weak opening, recovering after declines in Roche stocks pressured the overall market during the morning. The broad Swiss Performance Index closed up 16.97 points or 0.57 percent at 2,969.22. This was up 51.08 on the week.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks closed with solid gains, as raw-material issues such as steel and chemicals backed by firm earnings continued to attract investors, a rebound in long-strapped financial issues also helped the index. The 225-share Nikkei average climbed 258.73 points or 1.43 percent to end at 18,352.14, a rise of 505.16 from seven days ago.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks closed modestly higher, with investors focusing on China plays and shunning the market's big blue chips. &quot;It is difficult without anything new to get investors interested in blue chips,&quot; said Janet Gillies, sales director at OCBC Securities. The Hang Seng Index closed 24.95 points higher at 12,541.18, rising 24.58 on the week.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The Australian share market finished a strong week on a surprising up-note with investors disregarding a lack of firm leads from offshore markets and snapping up a large range of blue chip issues. The benchmark All Ordinaries index closed up 29.2 points at 2,442.4, up 61.9 from last Friday.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Heavy volumes propelled South African shares to a stronger close after a cagey start on Wall Street's overnight fall, volumes were exceptionally exciting, about 928 million rands worth of shares went through,&quot; one trader said, with market sentiment was overwhelmingly positive and much hunger was seen for heavyweight stocks.</p>
<p>Industrial shares added 77.6 points to 8,316.3, a rise of 102 from last week, All-shares were up 46.2 points at 7,022.2, up from last weeks 7,022.0 and Golds were off 3.1 points to 1,247.3, a drop of 59.5 from last Friday.</p>
