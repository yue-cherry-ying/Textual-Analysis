<p>Beijing on Saturday dismissed reports that jailed veteran dissident Wei Jingsheng was in poor health and accused the man considered a father of China's pro-democracy movement of attacking a fellow inmate.</p>
<p>&quot;Wei's health in prison is in normal condition,&quot; the state-run Xinhua news agency quoted an official of the Ministry of Justice as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Reports that 'Wei was beaten up in prison' and 'Wei did not receive medical care for his illness' are sheer fabrications by certain individuals,&quot; the official said, adding that reports that Wei had been punished by prison staff were also incorrect.</p>
<p>Members of Wei's family said this week that authorities at the Nanpu salt farm labour camp in the northern province of Hebei had slapped new punishments on China's most famous dissident after accusing him of brawling with another inmate.</p>
<p>Prison guards shut off the electricity supply to Wei's cell and banned him from shopping at the prison canteen, denying him the chance to buy mecidinal liquor for his back problems, said a family member who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>The veteran pro-democracy activist, who is serving a 14-year jail term for subversion, blamed his deteriorating situation on a softening of the stance taken by Western governments on Beijing's human rights record, the relative said.</p>
<p>Xinhua said Wei had attacked another inmate who tried to stop him breaking into the prison warehouse on May 29, but denied the dissident had been punished in any way.</p>
<p>&quot;Wei flew into a rage, damaged the door by kicking it and beat up the inmate,&quot; it quoted the justice official as saying, adding that the other prisoner had not fought back.</p>
<p>&quot;Later Wei not only admitted his mistake but also said that he would not make such a mistake again in the future,&quot; the official said. &quot;Considering Wei Jingsheng's improved attitude...the prison authorities decided not to give him any penalty.&quot;</p>
<p>Concerns over Wei's condition prompted the United States to approach China's Foreign Ministry on Friday for information on the situation of the former electrician turned dissident.</p>
<p>Beijing had assured U.S. officials that it was taking no further punitive action Wei after Secretary of State Madeleine Albright voiced concern, the U.S. State Department said.</p>
<p>Wei was jailed in 1979 for &quot;counter-revolutionary incitement&quot;, advocating democratic change and passing military secrets to a foreign reporter. He served all but the last six months of a 15-year jail term.</p>
<p>Paroled in September 1993, Wei was detained again in April 1994 and sentenced to 14 years in prison in December, 1995 on charges of conspiring to subvert the government.</p>
<p>His conviction was a major blow to China's tiny and struggling pro-democracy movement, which has seen almost all its active members jailed, detained or driven into exile over the last two years.</p>
<p>Despite his status as the nation's most famous detainee, Wei believed a softening of Western condemnation of Chinese human rights abuse had left him vulnerable, and that the state was encouraging inmates to pick fights with him, his relative said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese government feels the world environment has changed and the situation is to its advantage. The United States and other Western countries have succumbed and stopped criticising China,&quot; the relative quoted Wei as saying.</p>
