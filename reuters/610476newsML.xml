<p>COSTELLO REACTION TO RATES CUT; LENDERS FOLLOW</p>
<p>Federal Treasurer, Peter Costello, has welcomed the cut in offical interest rates, saying it should help reduce unemployment.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank announced a half-a-percent cut to the official cash rate, to five-and-a-half per cent.</p>
<p>Mr Costello's called on all banks to pass on the interest rate cut immediately, in full, to homebuyers and business.</p>
<p>He says nothing helps small business more than low interest rates, and that will impact on unemployment.</p>
<p>And the Treasurer says today's cut means the average homebuyer has saved 290 dollars a month in repayments, since the Coalition came to power.</p>
<p>Already Aussie Home Loans has passed on the full half per cent cut to borrowers, while the Commonwealth Bank has announced a point-three-five per cent drop in it's variable home loan rate.</p>

<p>MINISTER SAYS POLITICS STYMIES TAX REFORM ATTEMPTS</p>
<p>The Federal Industry Minister says for the past 20 years, politics has stymied attempts to reform Australia's tax system.</p>
<p>John Moore says in the 70s John Howard pushed for tax reform, later it was Paul Keating, and in the early 90s it was the Liberals again, and they were all knocked back.</p>
<p>Mr Moore says what's needed is a bi-partisan, non-political approach.</p>
<p>He says every area of industry and business is interested in tax reform and especially what form changes will take.</p>
<p>The Minister says its not simply a question of the GST.</p>

<p>DON'T DRINK THEN WALK! MINISTER WARNS</p>
<p>The Federal Transport Minister, John Sharp, has warned pedestrians about the dangers of drinking.</p>
<p>He says alcohol and the road are a fatal combination whether people are walking or driving.</p>
<p>The latest figures show intoxicated pedestrians account for 45 percent of all youth and adult pedestrian deaths.</p>
<p>Mr Sharp says it's a major concern that the pedestrians aren't just slightly inebriated, they had an average blood alcohol level of point-two-two per cent.</p>
<p>He says the popular image of a drunk driver running down an innocent pedestrian is a relatively rare event.</p>
<p>The Minister says what's more common is a drunk pedestrian stepping directly in front of a car driven by a sober driver travelling within the legal speed limit.</p>

<p>PRIVATISATION OF ELECTRICITY</p>
<p>The privatisation of the electricity industry is creating debate in two states.</p>
<p>In New South Wales, investors are already sizing up the potential opportunities offered by the privatisation of the state's electricity assets.</p>
<p>The Treasurer, Michael Egan, has released a discussion paper proposing the sale of the state's seven power stations, six distributors, and transmission lines, as well as a 58 per cent share of the Snowy Mountains Hyrdo-Electric Authority.</p>
<p>Macquarie Bank's Head of projects and structured finance, Nicholas Moore, says the Government estimate of raising 22-billion dollars from the sale is achievable, and possibly conservative.</p>
<p>He says overseas and local investors will be very interested in the sale, including his bank.</p>
<p>But in Tasmania, the Opposition has labelled as ridiculous any thought the State should follow New South Wales and privatise its electricity industry.</p>
<p>The Shadow Energy Minister, David Llewellyn, says for Tasmania to take the same approach would be madness.</p>
