<p>Britain's purchasing managers reported their tenth consecutive month of expansion in March with strong growth of output and new orders, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But the purchasing managers' index (PMI) slipped slightly to a seasonally adjusted 52.9 from 53.4 in February, largely because of a drop in manufacturing employment. A figure above 50 indicates a generally growing manufacturing economy.</p>
<p>The main source of new orders growth came from the domestic market, the CIPS said. Export orders, although they rose faster than in February, remain hampered by the pound's charge higher over the last eight months.</p>
<p>The PMI new orders index edged up to 55.7 in March from 55.2 in February. The pound has shot up about 15 percent on a trade-weighted basis since August last year. Stronger economic growth in Europe has only partially offset sterling's strength.</p>
<p>&quot;The impact of the recent increase in the value of the pound continued to subdue export orders compared to the strong performance recorded in the latter half of last year,&quot; the CIPS said.</p>
<p>The positive side of the pound's strength was that it depressed imported raw materials and components prices. &quot;This led to a sharp fall in manufacturers' average input prices in March -- the 17th consecutive monthly decline,&quot; the report said.  </p>
<p>Suppliers' delivery times lengthened for the seventh month running as demand continued to increase, but the incidence of delays and shortages remained relatively low. &quot;This suggests that any inflationary effects associated with capacity constraints remain suppressed,&quot; the CIPS said.</p>
<p>Stocks of both purchases and finished goods fell again, the latter dropping largely because sales outstripped output for the third month in a row.</p>
<p>Continuing pressure to cut costs led to a slight fall in employment for the first time in 10 months. &quot;A slightly higher number of firms cut staffing levels as part of efficiency-boosting rationalisation programmes, such as downsizing, than recruited new staff.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This drop in employment was a prime cause of a slight fall in the rate of growth of the PMI. Overall, the survey indicates a continuation of growth of manufacturing activity at sustainable levels,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>    (seasonally adjusted)		MARCH	 FEBRUARY</p>
<p>    Purchasing Managers' Index	 52.9	  53.4     (53.5)</p>
<p>    Output				   56.5	  57.5     (57.7)</p>
<p>    New orders			     55.7	  55.2     (55.2)</p>
<p>    Quantity of purchases		55.6	  54.6     (54.3)</p>
<p>    Prices				   40.6	  39.7     (39.7)</p>
<p>    Suppliers' Delivery Times	  47.6	  47.9     (48.3)</p>
<p>    Stocks of Purchases		  43.3	  45.2     (45.5)</p>
<p>    Stocks of Finished Goods	   46.6	  46.8     (46.8)</p>
<p>    Employment			     49.4	  50.9     (51.2)</p>
<p>NOTE: The PMI is based on a weighted average of seasonally adjusted measures of output, new orders, suppliers' delivery times, stocks of items purchased and employment. A reading above 50 indicates that manufacturing is generally expanding, below 50 that it is generally declining.</p>
