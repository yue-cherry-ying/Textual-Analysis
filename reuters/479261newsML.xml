<headline>Countdown runs smoothly for shuttle launch.</headline>
<dateline>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>The countdown was proceeding smoothly for Thursday's planned blastoff of the space shuttle Columbia on a 16-day science mission, NASA officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Only two minor problems had cropped up since the shuttle's three-day countdown began on Monday. A gas sensor in the shuttle's fuselage had failed and one of the cockpit displays was flickering occasionally. Neither should delay the launch, NASA test director Doug Lyons said.</p>
<p>Columbia, which made the first shuttle flight in 1981, was scheduled for a rare afternoon liftoff from Florida's Kennedy Space Centre at 2:01 p.m. EST (1901 GMT) on Thursday.</p>
<p>Meteorologists were confidently predicting fair weather for the shuttle's 2-1/2 hour launch window. They gave the shuttle an 80 percent chance of blasting off on time.</p>
<p>Columbia's crew of seven were to operate a microgravity laboratory around the clock, performing combustion research and materials processing.</p>
