<p>Rescue teams scrambled to evacuate people from inundated areas throughout the eastern Czech Republic on Tuesday as the worst flooding this century worsened.</p>
<p>Torrential rains began battering the Northern Moravia region on Saturday and showed no signs of relenting as flood waters from the Morava and Opava rivers and tributaries pushed downstream, forcing thousands from their homes.</p>
<p>The Czech news agency CTK said that 19 people were either missing or presumed drowned in the floods. The number of districts under a state of emergency grew and rescue officials redoubled calls for humanitarian aid, including drinking water.</p>
<p>Television footage from various locations throughout the area showed cars floating away in some villages and water reaching up to the ubiquitous ceramic-tiled roofs.</p>
<p>Forecasts said heavy rain would continue into Tuesday night, and the first respite might come on Wednesday when the storms from a static weather pattern were expected to ease.</p>
<p>Skoda Automobilova a.s., the Czech unit of Germany's Volkswagen AG, said on Tuesday it would shut down production of its flagship Felicia compact model on Wednesday due to flooding of some crucial part suppliers.</p>
<p>The largest insurer, Ceska Pojistovna a.s., said that damage from floods marked its biggest catastrophe in recent memory.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear today already that the extent of damage does not have a comparison in the modern history of the Czech Republic,&quot; the company said in a statement, adding that it was too early to give a more precise damage estimate.</p>
<p>Floods resulting from relentless rain have swept away houses, roads and railways. Pojistovna said that in just two out of about a dozen districts hit by the disaster, more than 10,000 buildings have been reported damaged.</p>
<p>More than 50,000 phone lines had been cut, and many more outages were expected, the Czech phone company said.</p>
<p>The second city of Brno in the southeast started seeing the brunt of the flooding, which had already forced evacuations in parts of other cities such as Ostrava and Opava.</p>
<p>Parts of southern Poland, Slovakia, and Austria have also been swamped by the midsummer rain.</p>
<p>Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and parliamentary chairman Milos Zeman, usually strident political enemies, flew together over the flooded zone to survey the damage.</p>
<p>They said that they agreed the first priority was to provide what was necessary to protect lives and then look for long-term help for displaced residents.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a disaster of an extent unknown in our country,&quot; Klaus told Czech television.</p>
<p>The government on Monday dispatched helicopters, soldiers, police and fire units to aid in rescue efforts, and begin housing evacuees in hotels and dormatories.</p>
<p>Parliament agreed on Tuesday to provide 900 million crowns ($27.7 million) from state financial reserves to help citizens in distress.</p>
<p>In Litovel, a town of about 10,000 residents north of the city of Olomouc, utility trucks brought in rubber dinghies to ferry people to safety. By mid-afternoon the water was still rising at chest level in the worst places.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people from the higher floors don't want to leave their homes, but many are leaving,&quot; Jiri Vrba, a rescue worker, told Reuters as he made another attempt to get to stranded residents in Litovel.</p>
<p>&quot;One old man we were evacuating said he has never seen so much water around in the last 70 years he's been living in the same place.&quot;</p>
<p>The flooding was believed to have been responsible for destabilising a bridge which caused the derailing on Monday of a Vienna-to-Warsaw express train near the Czech city of Ostrava. Sixty-four people were injured, 10 seriously. ($ = 32.54 Czech Crowns)</p>
