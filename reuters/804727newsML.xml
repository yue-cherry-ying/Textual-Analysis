<title>FRANCE: Pollution alerts again for Paris and Strasbourg.</title>
<headline>Pollution alerts again for Paris and Strasbourg.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-08-17</dateline>

<p>Officials issued new pollution alerts for Paris and Strasbourg on Sunday, only days after an earlier wave of heat, sunlight and car exhausts sparked off a debate about France's environmental policies.</p>
<p>Public health officials said the two cities registered pollution levels at &quot;level two,&quot; the midpoint on the official scale and one step below the &quot;level three&quot; alert requiring curbs on private cars and free public transport in the large cities.</p>
<p>Paris officials said the alert would probably last through Monday, when hundreds of thousands of young Roman Catholics are expected to converge on the capital for the World Youth Days including a visit by Pope John Paul II later in the week.</p>
<p>Young pilgrims from around the world were due to arrive in Paris by bus and train from early Monday.</p>
<p>Police lowered speed limits last week and urged drivers to leave cars at home when the last alert was issued. They also urged the elderly, small children and people with respiratory problems to limit their physical activity during the alert.</p>
<p>The pollution alert triggered a debate about environmental policy between the new Socialist government and the former conservative administration.</p>
<p>Corinne Lepage, the former environment minister, said she hoped her leftist successor, Greens leader Dominique Voynet, would &quot;have the political courage&quot; to restrict private cars although level three had not been reached.</p>
<p>Lepage wants to allow private cars only on alternate days, according to the numbers on their licence plates, but Voynet wants an &quot;eco-tax&quot; and a &quot;green vignette&quot; allowing low-polluting cars to circulate.</p>
