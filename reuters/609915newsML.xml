<headline>OPTIONS -FTSE puts sold in volatility trades.</headline>

<p>UK equity options traders took the opportunity to establish volatility trades in the FTSE 100 index on Friday as share prices bounced around then drifted, dealers said.</p>
<p>One of the larger deals was to sell 1,250 June 4525 puts at prices around 21p against selling June FTSE futures at 4685, which if properly hedged, will make money if market volatility falls.</p>
<p>Similarly, there was a seller of 500 June 4625 puts against futures at 4685 and a seller of 500 December 4225 puts at 52 hedged by the sale of FTSE futures at 4657.</p>
<p>By 1255 cash FTSE was up 7.9 at 4659.7 and June futures were nine points to the good at 4674.</p>
<p>Among the larger deals in stock options was a long strangle in the recently floated banking group Alliance &amp; Leicester. The deal was to buy 300 July 600 puts at 19p as well as 300 July 650 calls at 19-1/2p.</p>
<p>Dealers said the deal was inspired ahead of floation of the Halifax Building Society when it converts to a bank on June 2 so that the sector may be volatile over the next few weeks -- to the benefit of the long strangle trade.</p>
<p>Alliance &amp; Leicester shares soared 29-1/2p to 628-1/2p.</p>
<p>If the strangle is held to expiry, Alliance &amp; Leicester shares need to either drop below 561-1/2p or go above 688-1/2p.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, profit-taking may have been behind the main deals in supermarket chain Asda Group and in glass-maker Pilkington.</p>
<p>For Asda, this concerned selling 500 July 120 calls at 4p and in Pilkington it was to sell 400 August 120 calls at 9p.</p>
<p>Asda shares slipped 3/4p to 118-1/4p while those of Pilkington added 3p to 128p.</p>
