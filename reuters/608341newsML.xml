<title>UK: GOLF-DARCY AND CLARKE HOLD OFF CLASSY FIELD.</title>
<headline>GOLF-DARCY AND CLARKE HOLD OFF CLASSY FIELD.</headline>
<dateline>WENTWORTH, England 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Irishmen Eamonn Darcy and Darren Clarke shot early six-under-par 66s that resisted the best efforts of a classy international field at the British PGA Championship on Friday.</p>
<p>But the big names were lining up behind with Bernhard Langer, winner of the Italian Open and Benson and Hedges International titles already this month, and Ian Woosnam level with four others on 67.</p>
<p>Woosnam sank a 55-foot putt for an eagle three at the last hole -- the second eagle of his round.</p>
<p>He and Langer shared third place with Englishmen David Gilford and Andrew Sherborne, Scotsman Gary Orr and giant Swede Robert Karlsson.</p>
<p>Frank Nobilo of New Zealand and Denmark's 1996 European Rookie of the Year Thomas Bjorn were among those on 68 while those on 69 included Colin Montgomerie and Ernie Els, the South African who won the World Matchplay title on this same Wentworth course the last three years.</p>
<p>Nick Faldo, titleholder Costantino Rocca of Italy, Swede Jesper Parnevik and Fijian Vijay Singh were in a big group on 70.</p>
<p>There were two holes-in-one with South African Jeff Hawkes acing the 155-yard second hole and Greg Turner of New Zealand holing out the 191-yard fifth.</p>
<p>Darcy, a 44-year-old former Ryder Cup hero from south of the border, and Clarke, from the north and seeking a Cup debut this year, scorched over the 6,957-yard layout early in the day.</p>
<p>Darcy, who takes painkillers every day he plays for back trouble which threatened three years ago to end his career, made his round with four birdies in the first six holes and after three-putting the eighth picked up three more birdies on the back nine.</p>
<p>&quot;Three years ago I thought I was gone,&quot; he said of his back trouble, which improved after manipulation just when he thought fusion therapy would be necessary.</p>
<p>The genial Irishman is best known for sinking a tricky downhill putt against Ben Crenshaw for a crucial point at Muirfield Village in 1987 as Europe scored their first victory on American soil to retain the Ryder Cup.</p>
<p>Clarke, a burly 28-year-old, had an erratic round and suffered for some overly bold tee shots that went astray.</p>
<p>But his luck was in at the long 12th where his drive hit a tree and bounced out to the centre of the fairway. He then struck a four-iron approach to 30 feet and holed the putt for an eagle three.</p>
<p>He birdied the other three par-fives holes including the tough 571-yard 17th with a 20-footer.</p>
<p>Clarke is eighth on the Ryder Cup table after finishing third, seventh and 12th over the last three weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;I keep my head a little better than I used to,&quot; he said of his new-found consistency. &quot;I'm better at grinding out scores and I accept the bad shots better.&quot;</p>
<p>Langer, the German who lost his streak of 68 European Tour events without missing a halfway cut here last year, is seeking a fourth title to go with those he won here in 1987, 1993 and 1995.</p>
