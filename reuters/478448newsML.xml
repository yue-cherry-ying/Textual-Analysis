<headline>LIFFE coffee pulls back futher, May nears $1,600.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Origin offers knocked LIFFE robusta coffee futures to close broadly lower on Tuesday in generally quiet post-Easter holiday trade.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a re-emergence of origin sellers as the market came back after a four-week weekend,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Prices started much higher as expected but producer selling soon emerged to pare most of the gains by lunchtime. In the afernoon, a fresh wave of origin selling, particularly from Africa, then pushed values into the minus column.</p>
<p>By the close, new spot month May, London's benchmark, stood $23 lower at $1,612 a tonne, the session's low and near the closely-watched $1,600 level. Its intraday high was $1,660.</p>
<p>Easier New York market also dented sentiment. But the day's volume of 3,359 lots was rather modest as some players were still away for an extended Easter break.</p>
<p>The London market was closed on Friday and Monday.</p>
<p>There were no fresh fundamental inputs.</p>
<p>U.S. trader Merrill Lynch said in its latest bi-weekly market commentary published on March 27 that the coffee market seemed poised to resume the uptrend on renewed concerns about a tight physical market.</p>
