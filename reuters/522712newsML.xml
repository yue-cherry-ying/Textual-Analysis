<headline>Malaysian PM says rival party obsessed with itself.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-04-19</dateline>

<p>Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has accused the fundamentalist Moslem party which controls the country's sole opposition-run state of having narrow views, and of being obsessed with itself.</p>
<p>Mahathir was responding to comments by Kelantan state's Chief Minister, Nik Aziz Nik Mat, who said on Friday that his Parti Islam se-Malaysia (PAS) was unable to work politically with Mahathir's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) since the groups had different goals.</p>
<p>The state's Chief Minister's comments &quot;reflected the party's narrow views and obsession with the party. When we are obsessed with our own group, we are in no position at all to think any more,&quot; Bernama news agency quoted Mahathir as saying to reporters while in northern Kedah state on Saturday.</p>
<p>Nik Aziz said UMNO focused on nationalism, while his PAS strove to uphold Islamic principles.</p>
<p>Asked to respond, Mahathir said: &quot;Nik Aziz is more nationalistic than we...he is actually not only nationalistic but more inclined towards parochialism... everything to him is Kelantan, talks only about Kelantan,&quot; Bernama reported.</p>
<p>Mahathir, who is president of UMNO, said Nik Aziz had divided Moslems in the country.</p>
<p>Nik Aziz said on Friday that ties between the two parties would be confined to collaboration in economic and social fields, as PAS would continue its role as an opposition party.</p>
<p>PAS, which has controlled Kelantan since 1990, has laid down measures to create a more Islamic society, including bans on gambling and amusement parks. It has also mandated separate supermarket lines for men and women and warned women against wearing too much make-up.</p>
<p>The stance is at odds with Mahathir's government, which calls for a more tolerant brand of Islam in multi-racial Malaysia.</p>
<p>Mahathir has said he is open to forming a coalition government in Kelantan with PAS but that the rival party should not make too many demands of his government.</p>
