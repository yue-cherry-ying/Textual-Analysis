<p>Sporting said they would punish striker Ricardo Sa Pinto severely after his attack against Portugal's soccer coach Artur Jorge last week.</p>
<p>Bola newspaper said on Tuesday the club would fine Sa Pinto between five and seven million escudos ($29,000-$41,000).</p>
<p>Witnesses said Sa Pinto turned up at the Lisbon training ground on Wednesday, when the national team was preparing for a World Cup qualifier against Northern Ireland, and demanded to speak to the trainer.</p>
<p>Sa Pinto then struck Jorge, knocking him down. The striker later said he hit Jorge because he was angry with the coach for saying that he had excluded him from the national side because of disciplinary problems.</p>
<p>A statement released by Sporting on Monday night said: &quot;Following an inquiry, Sporting decided to punish Sa Pinto severely for failing to control his emotions despite strongly attenuating circumstances.</p>
<p>&quot;The sanction that was expressly accepted by Sa Pinto is exclusively an internal matter for the club.&quot;</p>
<p>Sa Pinto apologised for his act but did not mention Jorge by name.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish to apologise to Sporting and to the country because, despite the aggressions of which I was a victim, I should not have reacted in the way I did,&quot; he told reporters on Monday night, reading from a prepared statement.</p>
<p>The board of Sporting also apologised to the Portuguese Soccer Federation.</p>
