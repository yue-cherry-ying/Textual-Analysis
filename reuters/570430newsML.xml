<p>A renegade former Turkish minister said on Thursday he was confident of forming an alliance with other secularist politicians to oust Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's Islamist-led government.</p>
<p>&quot;What is important is that I have no more worries about the formation of an alternative government,&quot; Yalim Erez, from the True Path Party coalition partner, told reporters after meeting opposition leaders.</p>
<p>Erez has been trying to drum up support for a secularist pact since he resigned as trade and industry minister last month over the government's reluctance to comply with army demands for a crackdown on Islamist activism.</p>
<p>Bitter personal rivalries have often obstructed secularist unity. Erbakan became Turkey's first Islamist leader in modern times last year after narrowly winning general elections with only 21 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>But his coalition has shown cracks under fierce pressure from the secularist generals after he proposed mild Islamist reforms earlier this year.</p>
<p>Leftist leader Bulent Ecevit said he believed in the need for a strong shadow government to force the Islamists out but he fell short of full endorsement for Erez.</p>
<p>&quot;We agree that this government has to go as soon as possible. We also agree with each other that an alternative government has to be found beforehand,&quot; he said after talks with the former minister.</p>
