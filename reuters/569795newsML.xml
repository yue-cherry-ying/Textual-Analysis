<title>USA: Sour crudes cheapen against surging U.S. benchmark.</title>
<headline>Sour crudes cheapen against surging U.S. benchmark.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. cash crudes gained strength throughout Thursday morning, supported by active short covering and refinery troubles in the U.S. Gulf.</p>
<p>Persistent talk that Amoco's Texas City, Texas and Conoco's Lake Charles, Louisiana refineries are experiencing production problems aided outright benchmark values.</p>
<p>Cash dealers said pronouncements by OPEC leaders that the group will hold members' production quotas at current levels was absorbed without fanfare.</p>
<p>OPEC President Libyan Oil Minister Abdullah Salem al-Badri, said he expected the 25.03 million barrels per day (bpd) ceiling to be rolled over when the group meets in June. He spoke at an OPEC ministerial meeting in Isfahan, Iran.</p>
<p>June West Texas Intermediate/Cushing advanced 50 cents to talk at $20.10-20 a barrel, pulling even to July.</p>
<p>Current talk put the June/July WTI roll at minus 3 cents to flat, traders said.</p>
<p>At the same time June WTI rallied, domestic sours lost value on the refinery snags, turning around Wednesday's gains.</p>
<p>West Texas Sour/Midland sold at a $1.60 discount to June WTI/Cushing, losing around 20 cents from deals confirmed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a panic yesterday and refiners started buying it (WTS/Midland) up. Today, we're drifting lower, with the talk of Amoco troubles and less demand,&quot; said a Texas cash broker.</p>
<p>Other grades saw Eugene Island discussed at $1.50-$1.40 under the marker, with no fresh trades heard.</p>
<p>Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James was sold at a 3 cents premium to the benchmark, and was now talked at flat to 5 cents over June WTI.</p>
<p>LLS, ever-sensitive to foreign crude competition, found underlying support from a lack of North Sea grades fixed for May delivery to the Gulf.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no Brent coming over, but there are barrels backed-up in the Bahamas and they're not moving out,&quot; noted a physical trader.</p>
<p>Midland/WTI was sold at its seemingly unmovable price at 30 cents under June WTI, with Heavy Louisiana Sweet/Empire sold at 40 cents below the benchmark.</p>
