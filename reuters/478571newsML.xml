<p>Hungary will stick to the middle road between maintaining fiscal prudence and securing growth, while working on new anti-inflationary moves for 1998, Finance Minister Peter Medgyessy said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Speaking to stockbrokers and journalists during his visit to the Budapest Stock Exchange, Medgyessy made clear the government would not bow to critics either urging the government to ease up austerity or turn the screw.</p>
<p>&quot;Any softening in economic stabilisation could harm sustainable, long-term economic growth,&quot; he said. &quot;There is agreement on economic stabilisation within the government.&quot;</p>
<p>Hungary cut its budget and current account deficits substantially with an economic stabilisation programme launched in March 1995, while real wages dropped more than 10 percent.</p>
<p>The government expects living standards to rise slightly this year, while growth of two to three percent in gross economic product (GDP) is targeted for this year after stagnation in 1996.</p>
<p>Medgyessy added that the anti-inflationary programme for 1998, being prepared by the Finance Ministry and the National Bank of Hungary (NBH), would not bring back strongly restrictive policies.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot imagine (anti-inflationary) measures so drastic as to harm the beginning of economic growth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The programme, the details of which have not been published yet, would replace the current plans, which target a cut of five percentage points in inflation in 1998.</p>
<p>The government forecasts average CPI of some 17 percent for this year, down from 23.6 percent in 1996 and said the new anti-inflation programme could bring the rate down to single-digit figures in 1998.</p>
<p>However, any more radical anti-inflationary programme could be carried out only if a wide-scale price and wage agreement with employees and the trade unions was reached, Medgyessy said.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the government would return to its previous plans of a moderate reduction in the inflation rate, he added</p>
