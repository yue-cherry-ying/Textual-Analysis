<p>Mohamed Sahnoun, the key U.N. negotiator in talks to end Zaire's civil war, arrived in South Africa suffering from an undefined illness but is said to be recovering, U.N. officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said they believed he was suffering from a virus, compounded by a trip in a small 25-year-old plane from Lome, Togo, where he attended an African summit on Zaire last week.</p>
<p>Sahnoun, an Algerian diplomat, was resting at a health spa near Stellenbosch on Tuesday and was expected to go to Pretoria on Wednesday for talks with South African officials. The talks, expected this weekend, may be held in Pretoria.</p>
<p>One official refuted earlier reports from Cape Town that Sahnoun was marking time resting from his trip. They said he needed treatment on his weekend arrival in South Africa.</p>
<p>The officials said talks between representatives of Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko and the rebel movement of Laurent Kabila would probably be held on Saturday but they would not be announced until both delegations were in South Africa.</p>
<p>Sahnoun, who also represents the Organisation of African Unity, brought representatives from Mobutu's embattled government and rebel forces together in Togo last week after visiting Kabila in Kisingani, Zaire.</p>
<p>Kabila's rebels have been fighting Mobutu's forces since October and now control a quarter of the country from the east. A ceasefire date and the agenda remain to be worked out by the two sides.</p>
<p>A rebel spokesman has said the talks in South Africa should prepare for a meeting between Mobutu and Kabila to discuss Mobutu's departure.</p>
