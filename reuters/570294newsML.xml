<headline>OPTIONS -UK traders focus on BTR as stock falls.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>A profits warning from industrial holdings company BTR, which sent its shares reeling, was enough to generate activity in its traded options on Thursday, dealers said.</p>
<p>One of the larger deals was the purchase of 545 Augaust 280 puts at prices of 39p and 40p. But some traders, believing the drop in the share price was overdone, took small bullish positions.</p>
<p>One trader bought 100 August 280 calls at 19p. Another sold 250 August 260 puts at 12p. By 1440 GMT, BTR shares had slumped 41p to 226-1/2p.</p>
<p>Telecomms group Cable and Wireless was busy following a strong performance by Hong Kong Telecom, in which C&amp;W has a 58.5 percent stake.</p>
<p>The main deal came from a seller of 1,000 July 500 puts at around 23p. If this was an opening deal, it implies the trader is willing buy the shares at 500p -- if exercised -- but stands to collect 23p from selling the puts, or effectively buying the shares at 477p.</p>
<p>There was also a buyer of 250 July 550 calls at 8p. C&amp;W shares were up 2-1/2p to 499p.</p>
<p>Over in supermarket group Safeway, a number of diagonal spreads were established and all involved the same options series.</p>
<p>The biggest deal was the sale of 500 July 360 calls at 4p along with the purchase of 500 October 330 calls at 23p for a net debit of 19p.</p>
<p>This is essentially bullish but has an element of hedging in case the share price does not advance by July expiry. Other traders established the same strategy in lot sizes of 250 contracts. Safeway shares added 11p to 344p.</p>
