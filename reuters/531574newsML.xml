<headline>Russia warns of &quot;sharp&quot; action in U.S. jewel dispute.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-04-23</dateline>

<p>Russia will act &quot;quickly and sharply&quot; to bring home a priceless collection of imperial jewels on an exhibition tour of the United States if a row with organisers is not resolved soon, a government official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;If an agreement is not reached between the two sides to continue the exhibition, we will have to act fairly quickly and sharply and bring the items back to Russia,&quot; Deputy Culture Minister Pavel Khoroshilov told Reuters.</p>
<p>The collection, including art works, costumes and some of the world's biggest gems, was due to be shown in several U.S. cities this year. The first show, at Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art, has just ended.</p>
<p>But a contract dispute has left the exhibition in limbo with Russian officials and the U.S. organisers arguing about what to do next with the jewels.</p>
<p>Another deputy Russian cultural minister was due to begin talks in Washington on Wednesday at the U.S. State Department and with local exhibition organisers, Khoroshilov said.</p>
<p>He said he expected the official, Mikhail Shvydkoy, to stay in Washington until the issue was decided.</p>
<p>Khoroshilov said the dispute arose after U.S. organisers failed to exchange a series of documents related to the exhibition, including on financial matters.</p>
<p>The Corcoran Gallery says Russia wants the goods back for Moscow's 850th birthday celebration in May. Other American officials say the squabble is really about money.</p>
<p>&quot;The Russian Embassy says numerous efforts to get the Americans to the negotiating table have failed,&quot; Khoroshilov said. &quot;The Ministry of Culture is now worried about a situation which could to a certain extent jeopordise the security of these items.&quot;</p>
