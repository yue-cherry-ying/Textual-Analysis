<title>INDIA: Rajiv Gandhi's widow joins India Congress-deputies.</title>
<headline>Rajiv Gandhi's widow joins India Congress-deputies.</headline>
<dateline>NEW DELHI 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow of former Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, has decided to join his Congress party after refusing membership for years, members of parliament said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Mrs Gandhi has decided to join the Indian National Congress, accepting the membership,&quot; Priya Ranjan Dasmunshi, a member of the lower house of parliament, told Reuters in the Indian capital.  </p>
<p>Neither Sonia Gandhi nor her spokesman could be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Rajiv Gandhi was killed by a suicide bomber in May 1991. His mother, Indira Gandhi, served as prime minister from 1966 to 1977 and again from 1980 to 1984 before she was assassinated.</p>
<p>Sonia Gandhi has led a reclusive life since her husband's assassination, but she yields important influence within Congress, whose leaders regularly seek her support in the party's periodic factional battles.</p>
<p>The current party president, Sitaram Kesri, has been keen to see her play a more active and public role in the politics of the party, which suffered its worst ever defeat in general elections last year.</p>
