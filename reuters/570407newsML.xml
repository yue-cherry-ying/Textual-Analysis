<p>The franchising director of Britain's Office of Passenger Rail (OPRAF) said on Thursday that UK's South West Trains had met its performance target in April but it would remain under scrutiny of the regulatory body.</p>
<p>SW Trains, the rail franchise owned by UK transport group Stagecoach Holdings, will not be fined one million pounds, which it would have had to pay if it had fallen short of its performance target, OPRAF's director John O' Brien said.  </p>
<p>South West Trains (SWT), which operates in the south west of the UK, recently faced flak when it cancelled numerous services in February and March, after job reductions left it with too few drivers to operate new shift schedules.</p>
<p>O'Brien said he monitored SWT's services carefully throughout April as it reported 99.6 percent of services running, higher than 98.5 percent which OPRAF had desired at the start of the month.</p>
<p>&quot;I can assure passengers on SWT that I will continue to protect their interests. If cancellations rise again above 1.5 percent in any month I would expect to make a further order threatening SWT with financial penalties and further serious sanctions,&quot; O'Brien said.</p>
