<headline>NY precious metals seen opening mostly weaker.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures were seen opening mostly lower Tuesday, with spot gold bullion testing the $350 support level overnight and spot silver testing $5.00 on the downside for the first time since mid-February.</p>
<p>Trading in the London interbank bullion market resumed Tuesday, after the Easter holidays, for the first time since last Thursday.</p>
<p>However, further falls in world equity markets this week may yet provide some support for precious metals, traders said.  </p>
<p>COMEX June gold, now the active contract with the April contract in delivery, was seen opening unchanged to down 50 cents an ounce from Monday's close at $353.80, after trading a $354.40-352.60 range in overnight ACCESS trade.</p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold was quoted $349.50/00 early, compared to the London morning fix Tuesday at $349.85 and the New York close Monday around $350.70/20.</p>
<p>COMEX warehouse gold stocks rose 16,889 ounces Monday to 1,000,125 ounces.</p>
<p>COMEX May silver was seen opening down 3.00 to 4.00 cents from the previous close at $5.070, after a slide on light volumes as funds liquidated long positions was seen Monday.</p>
<p>COMEX silver stocks rose 641,466 ounces Monday to 191,711,478 ounces.</p>
<p>But NYMEX July platinum, which now has more open interest than the April contract, was seen opening unchanged to up 50 cents from the previous close at $372.50.</p>
<p>NYMEX June palladium was seen opening little changed from Monday's close at $148.00 an ounce.</p>
