<p>Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, has joined his Congress party, giving a boost to the scandal-scarred organisation, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;By becoming a primary member, she has joined hands with millions of Congress workers,&quot; party president Sitaram Kesri told a news conference.</p>
<p>Since her husband's assassination in 1991, Sonia, 50, had spurned repeated offers to enter politics. But she enrolled in late March and her membership was finalised on Thursday, party officials said.</p>
<p>Sonia's entry was seen as galvanising Congress but also raising fresh questions about its relationship with Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's United Front coalition.</p>
<p>Sonia derives her influence from her husband's family, whose members have led India for 38 of its 50 years since independence from Britain in 1947. Congress has ruled India for all but five of these years.</p>
<p>But hobbled by corruption scandals, the 112-year-old party suffered its worst electoral humiliation last year.</p>
<p>&quot;In that context, it (Sonia's joining) would definitely strengthen the party,&quot; a former government minister from Congress told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Gandhi family has for decades been the cementing factor in Congress, which has various factions defined along ideological, regional and personality lines.</p>
<p>Sonia Gandhi has led a reclusive life since her husband's assassination in May 1991, staying in the political shadows, but her name is invariably invoked by party leaders during power struggles.</p>
<p>&quot;Her participation will enthuse, galvanise and electrify the rank and file of grassroot workers,&quot; Congress spokesman Vithal Gadgil told a news conference. Party general secretary Oscar Fernandes called her move a &quot;symbolic gesture&quot;.</p>
<p>Rajiv Gandhi was killed by a suicide bomber, while his mother, Indira Gandhi, was assassinated by her guards after serving as prime minister from 1966 to 1977 and again from 1980 to 1984.</p>
<p>Indira's father, Jawaharlal Nehru, was India's first prime minister and the political heir to modern India's spiritual founder, Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi was no relation to Nehru, but by a coincidence, Indira married journalist Feroze Gandhi, perpetuating India's most celebrated surname.</p>
<p>Asked if Sonia Gandhi would get fresh offers to lead the party, party president Kesri said: &quot;We have already invited her as early as 1991. In today's context, to ask that question is not right, and to answer that is also not right.&quot;</p>
<p>Helped by a wave of sympathy following Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, Congress rebounded in 1991 to recapture control after 18 months on the sidelines.</p>
<p>But despite broad support for the foreign policies and free-market economics of former prime minister Narasimha Rao, the corruption-tainted Congress was thrown out of office in May last year following its worst ever election performance.</p>
<p>Congress, with 140 members in the 545-seat lower house of parliament, lends vital support to Prime Minister Gujral's 15-party United Front, which controls 178 votes.</p>
<p>Congress offered that support to the alliance last June to keep the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of government. But in March, Kesri shocked India by withdrawing support to then prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda.</p>
