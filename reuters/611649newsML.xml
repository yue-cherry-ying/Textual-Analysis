<p>Hong Kong on Friday hailed two extradition victories as a Western confidence vote that its independent legal system will survive under China's rule.</p>
<p>A Hong Kong fugitive was returned from the United States on Thursday to face multi-million dollar bribery and conspiracy charges.</p>
<p>As he landed in the British colony, law lords in Britain reinstated an extradition order against a former Hong Kong banker also wanted on corruption charges.</p>
<p>Both men had argued they could not expect a fair trial -- and might even face execution -- in Hong Kong after the British colony reverts to China at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>Jurists say the territory ranks high in Asia for a justice system free of political interference and the decisions reflect assurances of a hands-off attitude on courts by Beijing.</p>
<p>The cases of former tobacco executive Jerry Lui Kin-hong, who fought an 18-month battle in the U.S. courts, and former banker Ewan Lauder, struck a very raw nerve in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Hong Kong people harbour many concerns about the future. Yet few seriously expect to see the formal machinery of British-style impartial judges replaced by show-trials dispensing summary justice from the benches of the high court.</p>
<p>But that was the prospect painted by Boston District Court Judge Joseph Tauro in January when he accepted Lui's argument. Executions are widespread in China.</p>
<p>Capital punishment has been abolished in Hong Kong where no executions have been carried out since 1966.</p>
<p>Lui, 42, was returned after Acting U.S. Secretary of State Strobe Talbot endorsed an order for his extradition and was arrested by Hong Kong's anti-corruption bureau on his arrival.</p>
<p>He faces charges of accepting bribes of HK$33 million (US$4.27 million) in connection with a cigarette smuggling syndicate.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Hong Kong's graft-busting police, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, said 42-year-old Lui would appear in court later on Friday accused of nine corruption offences.</p>
<p>Lauder, who was chief executive of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd's former merchant banking arm, Wardley Ltd, is accused of taking HK$46 million in bribes ($5.9 million) in connection with the collapse of the Carrian Group in the early 1980s, Hong Kong's largest bankruptcy.</p>
<p>&quot;Following the British ruling, and the decision to return Lui, other foreign jurisdictions may note the fact that Hong Kong remains firmly under the common law,&quot; the South China Morning Post said in an editorial.</p>
<p>If there is one thing that Hong Kong people cling to in the countdown to the handover at midnight on June 30, 1997, it is that Beijing will largely honour its pledge that Hong Kong will continue to enjoy freedoms unheard of on the mainland.</p>
<p>The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration governing the handover binds China to permitting Hong Kong's 6.4 million people to maintaining their freewheeling capitalist way of life intact for 50 years.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's social, political and, importantly, its legal system based on English common law, would continue to prevail.</p>
