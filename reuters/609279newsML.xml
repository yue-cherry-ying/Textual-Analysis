<title>USA: Last charges dropped in N. Carolina daycare scandal.</title>

<p>Prosecutors dropped the last charges pending in the Little Rascals sex abuse case Friday, saying it was time to put to rest the trauma that began eight years ago at a North Carolina daycare centre.</p>
<p>Ninety-nine charges against Robert Kelly Jr, the former owner of the Little Rascals daycare centre in Edenton, and seven charges against the center's cook, Kathryn Wilson, were dropped, prosecutors announced at a news conference.</p>
<p>Both had been found guilty of sex-abuse charges but their convictions and life prison sentences were overturned by a state appeals court that ruled their separate trials in 1992 and 1993 had been riddled with mistakes.</p>
<p>&quot;We decided to withdraw the charges for the emotional benefit of the children who attended Little Rascals,&quot; prosecutor Nancy Lamb said.</p>
<p>But authorities said that Kelly, now free on bail and a pay-phone repairman, would still be prosecuted on eight new sex-abuse charges filed last year involving a girl who had not attended Little Rascals.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't tell you how much I've dreamed about standing up in a courtroom and hearing the jury say, 'Not guilty on all counts',&quot; Kelly said Friday.</p>
<p>In all, seven people were accused of sex crimes against children in the case and defended themselves by saying they were targets of a witch hunt carried out by hysterical parents and overzealous prosecutors.</p>
<p>Last December, charges were dropped against two women who had worked at Little Rascals and another woman linked to the scandal. Two other defendants, Kelly's wife Elizabeth and Willard Privott, accepted plea bargains five years ago and are now free.</p>
