<headline>INSIGHT - FTSE to seek support near the 4,510 area.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>The attacking stance adopted by the London stock market will be swapped for something more defensive on Thursday so that the FTSE 100 index may seek support around 4,510, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>With only two FTSE stocks advancing to every one stock declining on Wednesday, there would be insufficient breadth to allow the market's upward pace since the start of the week to be maintained although the medium-term uptrend still remains in place, they added.</p>
<p>By 0723 GMT, at the pre-market open, the FTSE was indicated down 13.4 at 4,524.1.  </p>
<p>Some too-ing and fro-ing of share prices is to be expected as the market ventures into record territory, owing to investors adjusting their portfolios as well as taking profits.</p>
<p>Such rapid changes in direction on a day-to-day basis by the FTSE would give the impression of a market that has lost control, but when viewed on a timeframe of several weeks it can be seen the market has been carving out an upward channel.</p>
<p>This channel is about 50 points wide and connects the FTSE's intra-day highs and lows since April 16. A 50 point move by the index on any given day is therefore possible before it hits an extreme point and has to turn back.  </p>
<p>There may be times when the market will overshoot the 50 point limit -- such as on Tuesday when it raced up by 63 points -- but without other external forces from political or economic data the market will soon revert to its steady state as such information is absorbed.</p>
