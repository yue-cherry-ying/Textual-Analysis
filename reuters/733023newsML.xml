<p>Pakistan aims to cut its trade gap to $2.33 billion in fiscal 1997/98 (July-June) or 30.86 percent less tyhasn the $3.37 billion of 1996/97, Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dar, announcing a new trade policy for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government in a televised speech, said Pakistan wanted exports to grow 15 percent to $9.575 billion in 1997/98 from the last year's $8.26 billion and keep imports at $11.9 billion against 11.63 billion in 1996/97.</p>
<p>&quot;Export-led growth is the cornerstone of this government's economic strategy,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Larger and high value added exports will not only help improve the balance of payments but will also provide employment opportunities,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;To lay the foundations of a robust outward-oriented economy, it is now imperative to reverse the anti-export bias in the economic structure evolved over the last 50 years.&quot;</p>
<p>He announced a large number of measures aimed at boosting exports, including a provision of adequate export finance to small- and medium-sized exporters via commercial banks and bringing down the general mark-up (interest) rate.  </p>
<p>Dar said 50 percent of the duty drawback to exporters would now be paid within three days of the presentation of documents and the balance after verification of customs authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;Machinery (not manufactured locally) imported by engineering units for export-related production (will) be subject to zero rate of tariff upto 200 percent of the export value during the preceding financial year of claimant unit,&quot; he said. &quot;This facility would be available on annual basis up to 30th June, 2000.&quot;</p>
<p>Local assemblers and manufacturerss of vehicles have been allowed duty-free import of assembly kits, corresponding to the number of their exported units, Dar said.</p>
<p>&quot;There would be no sales tax on imported raw materials, components required for manufacturing goods to be supplied against international tenders,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Dar said exporters would also be allowed to import duty free textile designs, artwork and transparencies upto 0.5 percent of the value of exports.</p>
<p>He also announced duty-free import of raw sugar for further exports after refining. &quot;This would save foreign exchange, utilise idle capacity of sugar mills and result in value addition,&quot; Dar added.</p>
<p>Pakistan will also open up the import of gold and silver, which is only allowed to three companiess at present.</p>
<p>&quot;However, foreign exchange for such imports will be privately arranged by the importer as per existing practice,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said most measures would be effective in a month, hoping the export of non-traditional itemss would register an increase of $500 million in 1997/98 and the traditional exports based on cotton and textiles to contribute an additional $815 million.</p>
