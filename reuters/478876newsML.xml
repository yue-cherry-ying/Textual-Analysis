<p>A U.N. human rights official on Tuesday denounced a deadly weekend grenade attack in Phnom Penh as an attempt to wipe out the leadership of the main opposition party.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a clear attempt to assassinate the leadership of an opposition political party who was conducting a legal and peaceful political demonstration,&quot; said Thomas Hammarberg, special U.N. representative for Human Rights in Cambodia.</p>
<p>Hammarberg, who said Khmer Nation Party (KNP) leader Sam Rainsy was the target of Sunday's attack outside parliament, added in a statement that he had &quot;serious concerns about the possibility of a serious, professional investigation in this matter&quot;.</p>
<p>The U.N. official said he feared the killings and other violence had created an environment that could make the holding of free and fair elections next year difficult.</p>
<p>Amnesty International condemned the attack.</p>
<p>&quot;The incident appears to be part of a pattern of increasing political tension and violence, and is an extremely worrying development,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The London-based human rights group said as many as 19 people had been killed and more than 100 wounded by four grenade blasts. Other reports put the number of dead at anything from 14 to 20, with Hammarberg citing a figure of at least 16.</p>
<p>Amnesty said it feared for the safety of the former finance minister Sam Rainsy, who narrowly escaped injury.</p>
<p>Shock turned to anger as Cambodians reflected on the tragedy. In markets and streets, people expressed outrage.</p>
<p>At Wat Langka in the city centre, Sam Rainsy opened a book of condolences on Tuesday morning and received distraught relatives of the victims.</p>
<p>The family members sat with the remains of six of the dead. Many wept as they stared at the portraits of the victims on display, mounted in the centre of flowered wreaths.</p>
<p>The six were Sam Rainsy's bodyguard, Han Mony, a KNP member, three young women garment factory workers and a 13-year-old girl who had come to watch Sunday's rally.</p>
<p>Cremation services were to be held on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sam Rainsy later on Tuesday visited the scene of the attack and laid a wreath at the site. Monks chanted as he knelt at a makeshift shrine.</p>
<p>After praying, Sam Rainsy held up signs that demonstrators had waved on Sunday, one of which said &quot;Down with the corrupt judiciary&quot;.</p>
<p>Members of First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh's cabinet earlier laid a wreath at the site after police briefly tried to stop them.</p>
