<title>BOSNIA: Sarajevo police block sale of magazine -- editor.</title>
<headline>Sarajevo police block sale of magazine -- editor.</headline>
<dateline>SARAJEVO 1997-06-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bosnian journalists said on Saturday that Sarajevo police had tried to ban the sale of an independent magazine which has portrayed the ruling Moslem party with biting and often lewd satire.</p>
<p>Police had seized issues of the bi-monthly Polikita over the past two days from street vendors, Samir Sestan, the magazine's editor, said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first time we have had a problem like this,&quot; Sestan told Reuters. &quot;But we had heard that the police in some parts of Sarajevo had warned our people to stop selling Polikita on the street.&quot;</p>
<p>The independent union of Bosnian journalists issued a letter of protest to the Moslem-Croat federation's ministry of interior, saying the move was a threat to press freedom.</p>
<p>The union accused police of illegally preventing the distribution of the magazine and of reviving &quot;the most rigorous censorship appropriate only for non-deomocratic and totalitarian regimes&quot;, said a letter quoted by the independent newspaper Oslobodjenje.</p>
<p>Bosnian police were unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>The magazine is based near the northeast town of Tuzla, where an opposition party controls the municipal government. Sestan said Polikita has not faced any harassment in Tuzla but federation authoriteis have imposed a steep sales tax on the magazine.</p>
<p>The apparent crackdown in Sarajevo came after the magazine published a lampoon of Moslem politicians in the ruling party's coalition for municipal elections in September.</p>
<p>Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of the country's collective presidency, and candidates in allied parties were described as &quot;little green riding hood and the three toy whores&quot;.</p>
<p>This week's issue compared Izetbegovic to the former communist leader Josip Broz Tito, who ruled the old Yugoslav federation for more than four decades.</p>
<p>Bosnia is dominated by Moslem, Croat and Serb nationalist parties which keep tight control of police and official television stations in areas under their control.</p>
<p>But human rights workers say Moslem authorities in Sarajevo had tended to show more tolerance toward dissent and independent media than ruling parties in Serb or Croat-controlled territory.</p>
