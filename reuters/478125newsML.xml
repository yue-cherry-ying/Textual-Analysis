<title>USA: ITT's Caesars Palace names Hornbuckle COO.</title>
<headline>ITT's Caesars Palace names Hornbuckle COO.</headline>
<dateline>LAS VEGAS 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>ITT Corp's Caesars Palace hotel and casino in Las Vegas on Tuesday said it named William Hornbuckle as its president and chief operating officer, taking him away from his job as president of ITT's hotel and casino joint venture with Planet Hollywood International Inc.</p>
<p>In a statement Caesars said Peter Boynton, president and chief executive officer of ITT unit Caesars World Inc, will assume oversight of the Planet Hollywood project.  </p>
<p>Since ITT rejected Hilton Hotels Corp's $6.5 billion bid in February and said it would focus on core businesses in gambling and hotels, analysts have speculated ITT would withdraw from its venture with Planet Hollywood.</p>
<p>In June last year, the two companies unveiled plans to spend as much as $1.3 billion on hotel and casino projects in Las Vegas and Atlantic City.  ITT had planned to fund the projects for an 80 percent interest.</p>
<p>An ITT spokesman was not immediately available to discuss the ITT/Planet Hollywood joint venture, and a Planet Hollywood spokesman declined to comment.  </p>
<p>Hornbuckle joined Caesars World on December 1, 1996 to head up the Planet Hollywood venture.  Prior to joining Caesars, he had been executive vice president and chief operating officer of Mirage Resorts Inc's Treasure Island hotel and casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Hornbuckle, 39, also has been president and chief executive officer of the Golden Nugget in Laughlin, Nev., and he has served as an executive at several other gaming and hotel establishments.</p>
