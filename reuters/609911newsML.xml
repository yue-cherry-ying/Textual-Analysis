<p>The Japan Credit Rating Agency (JCR) on Friday reaffirmed its BB-plus rating for Romania's National Bank central bank (BNR), officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The agency has reaffirmed a BB-plus rating for Romania's BNR&quot; Romania's ambassador to Japan Eugen Dijmarescu told Reuters by telephone from Tokyo.</p>
<p>A JCR statement said Romania's new centrist government, which took power after last November's elections, had been practising tight monetary policy, budget deficits cuts and acceleration of structural reform.</p>
<p>&quot;However, taking the very difficult economic situation into consideration, JCR considers cautious watch is necessary concerning the progress of the reform programme,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>In April, the International Monetary Fund approved a $430 million stand-by loan for Romania. The World Bank also pledged another $630 million in credits, subject to board approval next month.</p>
<p>Tough steps under the new programme agreed with international lenders pushed Romanian inflation up earlier this year after fuel, food and energy prices were liberalised. Monthly inflation slowed last month to 6.9 percent after a record-high of 30.7 percent in March.</p>
<p>Romania aims to cut the monthly consummer price rises to 2.2 percent by the end of 1997 after implementation of reforms, including restructuring of communist-era industries and faster privatisation.</p>
<p>Romania won its first ratings from major credit rating agencies in 1996 with a BB-plus from the JCR, a BB-minus from Standard and Poor's and IBCA and Ba3 from Moody's Investor Service.</p>
<p>The Balkan country rejoined world capital markets in 1995 after more than a decade of absence with syndicated loans followed by Samurai and Eurobond rasings.</p>
<p>Next week Romania's Finance Ministry will start road shows in three European financial centres in a bid to raise up to 700 million in the country's first mark-denominated bonds. -- Mirela Eremia, London Newsroom +44 171 542 6414</p>
