<title>UK: Britain deplores excessive force in Kenyan clashes.</title>
<headline>Britain deplores excessive force in Kenyan clashes.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-08</dateline>

<p>Britain criticised the Kenyan authorities on Tuesday for using excessive force in clashes with opposition parties that left nine people dead and urged them to ensure that elections later this year take place peacefully.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the forthcoming election to be conducted without violence so the Kenyan people can express their democratic verdict,&quot; Foreign Office minister Tony Lloyd told parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;The events over the weekend are yet one further serious blow to that process,&quot; he said at question time.</p>
<p>Lloyd said he deplored reports that the Kenyan police had used excessive force in Monday's clashes, the most violent in seven years.</p>
<p>Britain's newspapers on Tuesday carried graphic photographs and eye-witness accounts of the clashes.</p>
<p>One pro-democracy activist, Presbyterian preacher Rev. Timothy Njoya, was pictured outside Nairobi cathedral with blood streaming from wounds to his head and face after he was beaten by police.</p>
<p>In a thundering editorial, The Times said the police &quot;atrocities&quot; confirmed the urgent need for political and social reform in Kenya.</p>
<p>&quot;This was no riot, until the government made it one. It was a case of unprovoked and unconscionable brutality, ordered by the State, against people assembled to pray for such elementary things as free speech and accountable government,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The paper said President Daniel arap Moi had shown contempt for law as well as for life and was willing to destroy the last vestiges of public trust in authority rather than give way to legitimate calls for constitutional reform.</p>
<p>With the new Labour government intent to put human rights at the heart of its foreign policy, The Times said the lead on Kenya by Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was eagerly awaited.</p>
<p>Cook is in Madrid for a NATO summit, but in a statement earlier Lloyd said a peaceful environment was essential for the conduct of free and fair elections.</p>
<p>&quot;All parties in Kenya have a responsibility to refrain from confrontation. We are urging them to resolve their differences by means of dialogue,&quot; Lloyd said.</p>
<p>No date has been set for the parliamentary and presidential polls in which Moi, 73, is widely expected to win another five-year term because of squabbling among opposition leaders.</p>
