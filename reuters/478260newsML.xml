<p>France's Villeurbanne fought back from four points down at half-time to beat Efes Pilsen Istanbul 80-70 on Tuesday and keep alive their hopes of making it to the Final Four of the men's basketball EuroLeague.</p>
<p>Their hard-fought win owed more to nerves than skill but allowed the French outsiders to return to Turkey on Thursday for a decisive third leg in front of Istanbul's vociferous fans.</p>
<p>It was an uphill battle led by French international Jim Bilba, who scored 19 points, as the Turks, who won the first leg 87-71, led from the start.</p>
<p>But Villeurbanne, who have repeatedly upset the favourites in their march to the quarter-finals, hauled themselves back into the match and edged ahead 51-50 after 27 minutes.</p>
<p>Georgy Adams stepped in for the inefficient American Delaney Rudd to lead the game on the half-hour but there was still much to do.</p>
<p>The Turks brought the scores level at 61-61 with eight minutes left but the home side stayed calm.</p>
<p>Istanbul tired in the closing minutes and, despite another fine showing by Russia's Vassili Karassev, who scored 14 points, were eventually over-run.</p>
