<p>Vojvodjanska Banka, one of Yugoslavia's top banks, has charged the international firm Deloitte &amp; Touche with drawing up a project for its rehabilitation, Belgrade daily Politika reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We insist on the project's compatibility with the legislation and solutions of the central bank, finance ministry and other competent bodies,&quot; Mirko Tisma, acting director of the bank's main Belgrade branch, was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The project is to be completed within two months.</p>
<p>The bank decided to start rehabilitation plans ahead of the adoption of a programme for the overall reconstruction of Yugoslavia's ailing banking system.</p>
<p>&quot;When we complete the project we will create conditions for Vojvodjanska banka to be a first class bank by its organisation, personnel and capital, both in the country and in the world,&quot; Tisma said.</p>
<p>Fast and spectacular results cannot be expected and there will be some problems along the way, including necessary job cuts and additional investments in new technology, he added.</p>
<p>The bank currently employs around 4,000 people.</p>
<p>On the positive side, Tisma said debts of firms linked to Vojvodjanska banka did not exceed 20 percent of its total foreign exchange potential.</p>
<p>While the bank carried less than two percent of the old foreign currency savings debt, it participated with over 20 percent in overall Yugoslav banking on the basis of other indicators, such as its capital, Tisma said.</p>
<p>Large international banks and financial institutions are showing interest in Vojvodjanska Bank's rehabilitation and will probably soon express it by investing in Yugoslav firms dealing with the bank, he said. -- Beti Bilandzic, Belgrade newsroom +381 11 222 4305</p>
