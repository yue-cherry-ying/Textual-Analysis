<headline>UK gives Gokal 14-year sentence for BCCI fraud.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>A British court on Thursday sentenced Abbas Gokal to 14 years in prison for his part in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) failure, the biggest fraud in banking history.</p>
<p>Gokal, former head of the biggest single borrower from BCCI, was given four years for conspiring to account falsely and 10 years for conspiracy to defraud. Gokal was earlier on Thursday fined 2.94 million pounds ($4.8 million). Gokal was found guilty in April following a trial lasting nearly five months.</p>
<p>BCCI collapsed in 1991 with debts of more than $12 billion after evidence emerged of widespread money laundering. Thousands of people lost their savings in the affair.</p>
<p>Gokal, 61, had with BCCI officials been found to have masterminded a massive fraud totalling around $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>There are civil cases pending against both Gokal and his Gulf shipping and trading group and further action is expected against him in Pakistan.</p>
<p>So far creditors of BCCI have received some $2.65 billion, around one quarter of their claims, and a further 10 percent is expected to be paid within the next year.</p>
