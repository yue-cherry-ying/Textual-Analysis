<title>GABON: Mobutu and friends in Gabon to discuss Zaire war.</title>
<headline>Mobutu and friends in Gabon to discuss Zaire war.</headline>
<dateline>LIBREVILLE 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>A handful of French-speaking African presidents gathered in Gabon on Thursday for a mini-summit to help Zaire's embattled President Mobutu Sese Seko find a peaceful end to the civil war threatening his capital.</p>
<p>Gabonese officials said that the Libreville meeting, bringing together Mobutu with Gabon's president Omar Bongo and the presidents of Chad, Congo and the Central African Republic, would begin later on Thursday.</p>
<p>One Zairean opposition newspaper, the Potentiel, dubbed the meeting Mobutu's &quot;Goodbye summit&quot;.</p>
<p>But Zaire's government, in the person of Information Minister Kin-Kiey Mulumba, rejected suggestions that Mobutu's departure for Gabon was a veiled flight into exile and said the veteran leader would return to his capital after the meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no question of the president fleeing the country,&quot; Mulumba told Radio France International on Thursday.</p>
<p>He said that the only thing that would prevent Mobutu from returning immediately would be another meeting. &quot;He is coming back after the summit, unless there is another meeting. There is no reason why the president should flee the country no reason.&quot;</p>
<p>South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, who brought Mobutu and rebel leader Laurent Kabila together on board a South African ship in Congo's port of Pointe Noire on Sunday said at the time he would organise a fresh meeting within 10 days.</p>
<p>On the war front, hundreds of civilians and fighters from both sides were reported dead after a battle for Kenge, a town 200 km (125 miles) east of Kinshasa. Church and humanitarian sources hoped to establish whether massacres had taken place.</p>
<p>Mobutu, 66 and struggling with cancer, has dominated Africa's third largest country for more than three decades.</p>
<p>He has seen his hold over three quarters of the mineral-rich nation broken by Kabila and his rebels, who took up arms in October demanding Zairean nationality for ethnic Tutsis.</p>
<p>A spokesman in the Gabonese president's office, Vincent Mavungu, said Thursday's mini-summit aimed to find a negotiated settlement after the weekend meeting between Mobutu and Kabila.</p>
<p>&quot;It is therefore normal that consultations take place at all levels to try and find this solution, that is what explains the presence of a certain number of heads of state,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One U.N. source said he doubted very much whether there would be another face-to-face meeting between Mobutu and Kabila. &quot;They (the Central African presidents) will try to get Mobutu to withdraw in a dignified way,&quot; the source added.</p>
<p>Gabon's Bongo indicated that Mobutu's poor health had prevented the veteran president from meeting other heads of state on Wednesday. &quot;You know his state of health,&quot; Bongo said.</p>
<p>The Mobutu-Kabila weekend talks ended inconclusively.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said they believed his return might be unwise. &quot;If he comes back, it's at great risk,&quot; one U.S. official said.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, senior Foreign Ministry official Ryuichi Shoji said he met Kabila last week in the rebel-held city of Goma and urged him to avoid violence in Kinshasa. It was the first formal contact by the Japanese government with the rebel leader.</p>
<p>Residents of Kenge, in radio contact with Kinshasa, said the rebels were in control of the town on Wednesday after Mobutu's forces recaptured it briefly on Sunday night. They said at least 200 civilians, 106 government troops and 15 rebels were killed.</p>
<p>Kinshasa was reported calm on Thursday but residents of the city of five million people remain apprehensive -- a mood reflected in the capital's newspapers.</p>
<p>The independent Reference Plus quoted Mobutu's security adviser Honore Ngbanda as saying the city was a powder-keg and any fire lit there could be very difficult to put out.</p>
