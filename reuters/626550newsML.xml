<p>Cuban-born free diver Francisco &quot;Pipin&quot; Ferreras will make a controversial attempt on Saturday at a record dive to 600 feet (183 metres), organisers said.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Ferreras was rushed to a hospital and placed in a recompression chamber after passing out on a dive boat shortly after making a 450-foot (137-metre) practice free dive followed by a scuba dive.</p>
<p>The Cayman Ministry of Health issued a statement saying it did not support Saturday's free dive attempt. Minister of Tourism Tom Jefferson also said he would not support it.</p>
<p>Members of the Cayman watersports industry also expressed concern about the safety of the dive. The Cayman Islands, a British territory in the western Caribbean, are renowned as a scuba diving mecca.</p>
<p>Ferreras, who holds the world free-drive record of 439 feet (134 metres) on one breath, will make the attempt on two breaths of air and will use a sled to carry him down into the water, organiser Mitch Skaggs said. The dive will be made at a wreck just off George Town harbour.</p>
<p>Ferreras, who lives in Miami, will have a NASA-developed computer attached to his back that will send signals on his medical condition to a physician on the surface.</p>
<p>Doctors at a Miami hospital gave Ferreras a clean bill of health following the incident two weeks ago, Skaggs said.</p>
<p>The diver went ahead with the scuba dive immediately after the free dive despite being advised not to do so. He passed out on the dive boat as it headed to shore.</p>
<p>A team of divers and underwater photographers will monitor and record Saturday's record attempt.</p>
