<p>Pope John Paul said on Tuesday a new wall of economic and political selfishness had arisen in Europe, threatening the unity of the continent as seriously as the Berlin Wall before communism's fall.</p>
<p>&quot; After the collapse of one wall, the visible one, another, invisible wall was discovered, one that continues to divide our continent -- the wall that exists in people's hearts?&quot; he said in a sermon at a big open air mass.</p>
<p>The Pope chose Gniezno, Poland's first capital, to deliver his forceful message on European unity at a ceremony marking the 1,000th anniversary of the martyrdom of St Adalbert, a missionary from Bohemia who helped Christianise Poland and other countries.</p>
<p>A rapturous crowd of some 250,000 people on a rolling hillside below the 14th century Gniezno cathedral, traditional seat of Polish Catholicism, turned out to see the 77-year-old Pontiff, who is on the fourth day of an 11-day pilgrimage to his homeland.</p>
<p>He spoke in a strong clear voice and one pilgrim in the crowd said: &quot;This is like the Pope of old, the Pope of 10 years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Since the emotional trip began on Saturday, the Pope has attracted almost a million people who have flocked to his masses to hear his calls for a spiritual renewal in post-communist Poland as it embraces economic and politcal freedom.</p>
<p>The presidents of countries whose Christian roots were affected by St Adalbert's evangelisation -- Poland, Germany, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Lithuania and Ukraine -- attended the service and were due to have a private meeting with the Pope later.</p>
<p>While thanking God for the &quot;great gift of freedom&quot; granted to the nations of Europe with the fall of communism after decades of repression, the Pope declared: &quot;The recovery of the right to self-determination and growth of political and economic freedom are not sufficient to rebuild European unity.&quot;</p>
<p>He suggested the new invisible wall was no less insidious than the old one which physically divided the continent.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a wall made out of fear and aggressiveness, of a lack of understanding for people of different origins, different colour, different religious convictions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the wall of political and economic selfishness, of the weakening of sensitivity for the value of human life and the dignity of every human being.&quot;</p>
<p>He continued: &quot;Even the undeniable achievements of recent years in the economic, political and social fields do not hide the fact that this wall exists,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>This invisible wall, the Pope said, was casting a shadow over all of Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;The goal of the authentic unity of the European continent is still distant. There will be no European unity until it is based on unity of the spirit,&quot; the Pontiff said.</p>
<p>Before the mass, the Pope prayed before the relics of St Adalbert in a tomb in the cathedral.</p>
<p>John Paul, who has suffered a series of health problems in recent years, has been holding up relatively well since he started the gruelling trip which will take him to 12 cities and towns before he returns to Rome on June 10.</p>
<p>He seems to have gathered strength from the big crowds of his countrymen and has spoken emotionally of the countryside that he says remains in his heart even when he is in Rome.</p>
<p>Vatican officials say that as the Pope gets older, every time he visits Poland he does so with the realisation that the trip could be his last.</p>
