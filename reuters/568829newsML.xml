<headline>IPE Brent ends sharply up on US led technical rally.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Brent crude futures closed sharply firmer on Thursday after U.S. markets spearheaded a robust technical rally.</p>
<p>June Brent closed a hefty 53 cents up at $18.67 a barrel, off a session high of $18.78.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a healthy day. I thought it was a good performance, mostly technically led with some minor fundamental factors as well,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed talk of refinery snags in the U.S. Gulf helped push NYMEX unleaded gasoline through key resistance levels, triggering technical buying stops.</p>
<p>NYMEX crude meanwhile sailed through key resistance at $19.90 and the psychologically important $20.00 level, and Brent breached initial resistance at $18.40. IPE May gas oil closed $1.50 a tonne higher at $169.00.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected to see follow-through trading on SIMEX and ACCESS.</p>
<p>&quot;It's certainly been a good performance and we'd expect to see some follow-through and maybe opening up again tomorrow,&quot; a said one.</p>
<p>But some were wary of more longer term bearish market sentiment: &quot;We saw some gains like this last week but then they were all eroded later on,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The rally was in part triggered by talk of operational problems in the gasoline production units at Amoco's Texas City, Texas refinery and Conoco's Lake Charles Louisiana plant. The companies declined to comment o the speculation.</p>
<p>Dealers said that the market regarded news that OPEC was likely to leave it output ceiling unchanged as fairly neutral.</p>
<p>&quot;It's overproduction that is the key issue,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>OPEC President Libyan Oil Minister Abdullah Salem al-Badri told Reuters on Thursday that he expected to group to stick with its 25.03 million barrels per day (bpd) output quota when it meets in June.</p>
<p>Seven OPEC oil ministers have scheduled talks in Isfahan in Iran for Thursday to discuss quota violations which have helped knock $7 a barrel off oil prices since the start of the year.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey on Thursday estimated OPEC's April output at 27.05 million bpd.</p>
<p>Kuwaiti oil minister Isa al-Mazeedi sent a warning to OPEC members who flout their output quotas saying they should stick by official allocations or risk a further fall in oil prices which have shed almost $7 a barrel since the turn of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Self-discipline is still exercised by a few key members but if this discipline is not maintained I don't dare speculate what prices will do,&quot; he said.</p>
