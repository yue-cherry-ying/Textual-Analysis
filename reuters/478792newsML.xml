<p>Cuba, which has made cautious economic openings in the last four years, is not currently planning to allow small and medium private enterprises, a senior government official said in remarks published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Vice-President Carlos Lage told a meeting on Monday of the Economy and Planning Ministry that small or medium-sized businesses were important to any country's economy, but they did not have to be private enterprises. In Cuba's case, some 80-90 percent of state firms were small or medium-sized, he said, and the priority was to make these more efficient.</p>
<p>&quot;The possibility of a private participation in small and medium enterprises is not an immediate matter for various reasons,&quot; said Lage, whose remarks were published by the ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma.</p>
<p>Foreign observers and economists have suggested for some time that Cuba, which began cautious reforms in 1993 during the worst of its economic crisis, should start allowing some private small and medium enterprises.</p>
<p>However authorities insist the state will continue to play a dominant role in the economy. The private sector is currently limited to foreign enterprises operating in joint ventures with the Cuban state, and Cubans who are self-employed.</p>
<p>Self-employment in goods and services has been allowed since 1993 and there are currently about 180,000 Cubans with licenses to work on such a basis.</p>
<p>Lage justified recent moves by authorities in Havana to ensure observance of rules governing small private restaurants, which come under the category of self-employment.</p>
<p>&quot;Regrettably many of these small businesses break the established rules,&quot; Lage said. &quot;When a paladar (private restaurant) is checked, you generally find violations, and on quite a few occasions, the purchase of stolen goods.&quot;</p>
<p>Known as paladars, private restaurants may employ only family members, have a seating limit of 12, have to provide receipts for purchases of some raw materials and are barred from selling certain foods such as lobster. Many of the more popular haunts break some or all of these rules.</p>
<p>Some paladar owners in Havana have complained in recent weeks thay are being fined, having equipment confiscated or having their licenses removed as a result of more stringent checkups by authorities.</p>
<p>Lage said some international press reports had suggested Cuba was clamping down on paladars. &quot;Repressing paladars, no, repressing thieves,&quot; he said.</p>
