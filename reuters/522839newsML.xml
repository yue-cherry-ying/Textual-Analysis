<p>Saudi Arabia said on Saturday at least 31 Pakistani nationals, most of them women, died in this week's fire and stampede during the annual Moslem Haj pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>
<p>Pakistan's official news agency APP said Saudi authorities had provided a tentative list of 31 Pakistanis killed in Tuesday's tragedy at Mina, outside Mecca.</p>
<p>APP said the Saudis had informed Pakistani officials that 184 Pakistanis had been injured, including six being treated in Mecca with serious burns.</p>
<p>It said the fatality list, prepared on the basis of identification tags and other evidence available in the Pakistani camps and surrounding areas, was not final.</p>
<p>Relatives of Pakistani pilgrims have had a long wait for definite information since the fire swept through the encampment, killing 343 people and injuring 1,537.</p>
<p>&quot;We have received about 80,000 calls in the past three days,&quot; said an official at an emergency information centre set up near Islamabad. &quot;We are working 24 hours a day.&quot;</p>
<p>Diplomats in Saudi Arabia said most of the dead were from the Indian subcontinent. The fire also engulfed the Iranian, Syrian, Lebanese, Egyptian, Sudanese, Yemeni and Moroccan sections of the encampment at Mina, near Mecca.</p>
