<p>Gunmen killed at least six Shi'ite Moslems while they slept on the street in Pakistan's Punjab province on Saturday, hospital sources said.</p>
<p>They said the unidentified attackers swept through the village of Mondka, in Khangarh district, on motorcycles at 4 a.m. (2300 GMT Friday), firing at residents who were sleeping outside to escape the summer heat.  </p>
<p>The dead included the local head of the Shi'ite Tehrik-i-Jafria group, identified only as Mushtaq, and several of his relatives, the sources said.</p>
<p>One person was critically wounded and taken to hospital in the city of Multan, about 28 miles (45 km) east of Mondka.</p>
<p>His son, Sayed Asif Shah, who witnessed the assault but escaped unhurt, told Reuters that four gunmen on motorcycles had selected their victims before shooting them in the head.</p>
<p>The attack appeared to part of a long-running feud between Sunni and Shi'ite militants in populous Punjab province which has cost more than 136 lives this year.</p>
