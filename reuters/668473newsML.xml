<headline>Japan panel calls for new entity to take over PNC.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-06-17</dateline>

<p>A government advisory panel said on Tuesday that the operations of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp (PNC), troubled operator of experimental nuclear reactors and a reprocessing plant in Japan, should be taken over by a new entity.  </p>
<p>&quot;The PNC should be restructured drastically, and a new body should be formed to take over its operations,&quot; said Hiroyuki Yoshikawa, chairman of the panel.</p>
<p>The Science and Technology Agency set up the panel in April to discuss plans for the reform of PNC, which has had its credibility damaged by a series of accidents and ensuing cover-up attempts.</p>
<p>The PNC's prototype fast-breeder nuclear reactor Monju has been shut since a 1995 sodium coolant leakage accident at the plant.</p>
<p>Following the accident, it was revealed that plant officials edited video footage of the accident before making it public, in an effort to conceal the extent of the damage.  </p>
<p>In March this year, a fire and explosion at Japan's sole nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, operated by PNC, exposed 37 workers to low levels of radiation.</p>
<p>The accident was followed by revelations that an original report on the accident was falsified.</p>
<p>About a month after the accident, the Science and Technology Agency ordered PNC to halt operations of its &quot;Fugen&quot; prototype nuclear reactor after learning the state-run firm had waited 30 hours before reporting a radiation leak at the plant, which had occured the previous day.  </p>
<p>Yoshikawa said that the lack of proper management at the PNC was largely responsible for the string of accidents, and called for strong management at the new entity.</p>
<p>Yoshikawa, as well as some panelists, said that in the new firm a section in charge of safety operations of nuclear facilities should be somewhat independent from the rest of the organisation to ensure effective supervision.</p>
<p>Yoshikawa also said PNC's existing projects, including exploration and enrichment of uranium, operations of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant and development of advanced nuclear reactors, should be streamlined before being taken over by the new body.</p>
<p>Preliminary plans concerning which of the PNC's projects should be transferred to the private sector or abolished will be ready for the next panel meeting, slated for July 7, he said.</p>
