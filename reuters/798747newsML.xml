<p>Russian diamond monopoly Almazy Rossii-Sakha (ARS) and South Africa's De Beers said on Thursday they would hold high-level talks soon to mull the next step along the winding road to an elusive trade deal.</p>
<p>Top of the agenda will be President Boris Yeltsin's recent decree on the diamond market, which suggested the Kremlin was looking to impose more control on the lucrative diamond export market.</p>
<p>&quot;We plan to hold talks in Moscow with De Beers for the preliminary discussion of documents including the recent government decree,&quot; said ARS spokesman Georgy Minayev. &quot;Realistically it will be at the beginning of September.&quot;</p>
<p>ARS president Vyacheslav Shtyrov warned both sides should brace themselves for unexpected changes ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to be prepared for changes which may happen independently of our wish or knowledge,&quot; he was quoted by Itar-Tass news agency as saying earlier this week.</p>
<p>One such change, not totally unexpected but likely to be unpopular with the two companies, was the appearance of state precious metals and stones export agency, Almazjuvelirexport (Almaz), in the presidential decree on gem exports.</p>
<p>The decree, signed last month, said Almaz could export gems of ten carats or greater as well as export unspecified volumes to assess the market independently.</p>
<p>&quot;We were aware there was going to be a greater degree of government control in the diamond business, as Almaz is an arm of the Finance Ministry,&quot; said Raymond Clarke, head of De Beers' Moscow representation.</p>
<p>&quot;We had had hints from ARS that Almaz would be involved. This now seems to be becoming a reality.&quot;</p>
<p>Clarke said the exact role of Almaz in any revamped Russian gem export system was still unclear, and would be the subject of discussions between De Beers, ARS and state representatives.</p>
<p>ARS has finally received a state export license covering deliveries abroad until the end of the year, but soon may be forced to divide the spoils with the state exporter -- a prospect the group clearly does not relish.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly, the appearance of two exporters is a question,&quot; Minayev said. &quot;I don't see how Alrosa could gain anything by this...I do see that Alrosa could lose something by it.&quot;</p>
<p>Almaz already exports all of Russia's palladium and platinum, but its track record this year raises questions about how beneficial its marketing experience may be for the country's gem industry in general.</p>
<p>Russian supplies of platinum and palladium to Japan, the world's biggest consumer of both rare white metals, were delayed for six months this year, sending world prices soaring and raising questions over reliability of supply from Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;There may be some concern, given Almaz's performance in the platinum and palladium market,&quot; said Raj Kohli, metals analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London.</p>
<p>De Beers' Clarke said the presidential decree was a step in the right direction towards a full trade agreement with ARS, but was far from being the conclusive measure.</p>
<p>Both firms must now decide how the draft trade deal, first submitted late last year, fits in with the presidential order.</p>
<p>In the meantime De Beers would continue to buy Russian gems from ARS and operate as normally as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;ARS can export their diamonds to whomever they wish. We obviously hope we will get the lion's share,&quot; Clarke said, adding that a full trade deal was still the preference, because it was good for the stability of the gem industry worldwide.</p>
<p>ARS is also keen to thrash out a deal after extended delays that have robbed it of export earnings this year.</p>
<p>The South African gem giant sharply curtailed the amount of diamonds it bought from Russia when the last deal, extended for a year, expired at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>The deal was worth around $1.2 billion to Russia annually. --Moscow Newsroom +7095 941 8520</p>
