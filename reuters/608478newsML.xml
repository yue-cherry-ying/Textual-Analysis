<title>CZECH REPUBLIC: CZECH CEN BANK ON MKT TO SUPPORT CROWN - DEALER.</title>
<headline>CZECH CEN BANK ON MKT TO SUPPORT CROWN - DEALER.</headline>
<dateline>PRAGUE 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Czech National Bank (CNB) has entered the market to support the crown after it fell below the five percent level on the depreciation side of its dollar/mark basket midpoint.</p>
<p>&quot;They have just been in the market, it happened after the index hit -5.0 percent,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Breta Tichanek of ING bank in Prague said he had also seen the CNB on the market, but had concluded no deals.</p>
<p>Neither would comment on the volumes they were seeing from the CNB.  </p>
<p>After holding steady at around -4.5 percent below basket parity the crown fell to below -5.00 percent against parity.</p>
<p>But the central bank's intervention pulled the crown back up, with it  trading at around -3.3 percent 1330 GMT, just after the intervention.  </p>
<p>The CNB has been waging a war against investors to keep the crown from crashing since last week when a wave of short-selling pushed the currency to recrod lows against the mid-point of the dollar/mark basket, which the central bank uses to fix the crown's exchange rate daily.</p>
<p>Central bank and government officials to date have adamantly ruled out a devaluation of the currency.</p>
<p>Last Friday the CNB raised the Lombard rate from 14 percent to 50 percent in a move bolster the crown, once regarded as the most stable currency in post-communist central Europe.</p>
<p>The CNB through the course of the week has gradually restricted access to the Lombard facility, the last resort lending facility for banks, squeezing market liquidity and further boosting the crown.</p>
<p>The central bank fixed the crown at 30.824 to the dollar and 18.220 to the mark on Friday, implying a deviation against basket parity of -3.74 percent after a fixing of -3.00 percent on Thursday.</p>
