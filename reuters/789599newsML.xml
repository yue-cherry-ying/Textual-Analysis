<p>Graham Thorpe and Adam Hollioake took their fifth wicket partnership beyond 100, then fell in successive overs as England were pegged back again in the fifth test at Trent Bridge on Saturday.</p>
<p>At lunch on the third day they were 272 for seven, still 155 behind Australia on first innings. Thorpe, dropped by Steve Waugh on 31, was caught at short leg off Shane Warne for 53.</p>
<p>In the previous over Hollioake edged Paul Reiffel and Mark Taylor took a fine catch low at first slip.</p>
<p>Although the Hollioake brothers were denied the opportunity of batting together on their test debut, 19-year-old Ben began confidently and was 11 not out at the interval.</p>
<p>Robert Croft struck Warne for a straight six but was caught in the last over before lunch off Glenn McGrath for 18.</p>
