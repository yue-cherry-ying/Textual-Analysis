<p>National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) said on Friday it would reduce its standard variable mortgage rate to 7.20 percent from 7.55 percent following today's 0.5 percentage point cut in official interest rates by the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>The bank said it would also reduce its prime business lending rate to 9.10 percent from 9.40 percent.  </p>
<p>NAB said the mortgage reduction was available to new customers from May 26 and to existing customers from July 28.</p>
<p>The reduction in the benchmark reference rate for business would take effect from May 26.</p>
<p>NAB, Australia's largest bank by measures of profits and assets, also said it had reduced its base reference rate for small and medium sized business customers by the full 50 basis points to 9.25 percent, effective from June 30.  </p>
<p>NAB chief general manager Frank Cicutto said the decision to cut small-medium corporate loan rates by 50 basis points should help business boost growth and investment opportunities.</p>
<p>It also said it had cut rates on a number of deposit rates by between 0.15 percentage points and 0.50 percentage points.</p>
<p>NAB is the third of Australia's big four banks to reduce its standard variable mortgage rates and the prime business rate following the central bank's easing of monetary policy earlier on Thursday. Westpac Banking Corp said it would not announce any rate changes on Friday.</p>
