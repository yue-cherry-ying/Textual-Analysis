<p>The fate of Israel's government could depend on a decision by state prosecutors on Sunday on whether to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on corruption charges.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, 47, elected 11 months ago, has described the influence-peddling scandal as &quot;nonsense&quot; and rejected calls to resign.</p>
<p>But Israel's attorney-general was expected to announce whether Netanyahu and three other top officials would be indicted in a government corruption scandal, as recommended by police last week.</p>
<p>&quot;State prosecutors continued to work overnight to try to determine by Sunday whether to issue indictments and to whom,&quot; said Orit Shemesh, a Justice Ministry spokeswoman.</p>
<p>An indictment against Netanyahu, the first for an Israeli prime minister, could topple his Likud-led coalition of mainly right-wing and religious parties.</p>
<p>Prosecutors could ignore the police recommendation, made in a 995-page report after an inquiry into the short-lived appointment in January of Likud activist Roni Bar-On as attorney-general.</p>
<p>The investigation was sparked by a Channel One television report which alleged that a Netanyahu ally on trial for corruption, politician Aryeh Deri, promoted Bar-On for the job in the hope of winning a plea bargain.</p>
<p>Even if Netanyahu is not indicted, his government could be brought down by a scathing report by the attorney-general.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if no one is charged, should it become clear that very serious things were done from a public and democratic standpoint, we'll not be able to go on backing such a government and will want early elections,&quot; said Yehuda Harel of the four-member Third Way party in the coalition.</p>
<p>Some cabinet ministers, including Natan Sharansky of the Yisrael ba-Aliya (Israel of Immigration) party, have said they will resign if the allegations prove true.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, if indicted, would be under no legal obligation to quit. High Court judges have ruled in the past that ministers under indictment must step down and opposition legislators say said they would press for a similar ruling.</p>
<p>Opposition Labour party leader Shimon Peres, who lost last year's election to Netanyahu, has ruled out the possibility of forming a national unity government to deal with the crisis.</p>
<p>Peres had said in the past that he believed a unity government was the only way to revive peace negotiations with the Palestinians and neighbouring Arab states.</p>
<p>But he said on Friday: &quot;As the situation stands today, there is no basis for a national unity government. If the conclusions are that this government stays put, then in my opinion the peace process will have almost lost its chance.&quot;</p>
