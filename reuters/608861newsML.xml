<p>Russian shares eased in early trade on Friday with most blue chips slipping on low volume, but traders said they did not expect a major retrenchment.</p>
<p>&quot;I am thinking positive and under today's circumstances I would open a long position rather than sell,&quot; said Pavel Gronbjerg of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>&quot;I only expect a limited downside today as investors are not only selling but also buying. They are even buying a bit more by switching from highly liquid stocks to less liquid ones.&quot;</p>
<p>Andrei Ippolitov, head of securities trading at IK Prospekt, said Friday's market would be similar to Thursday's -- a gentle fall in the morning, followed by a slightly bigger slip by the end of the day when New York opens.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a price correction on the market. By the end of the day the fall may be up two or three percent only,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gazprom rose on more active demand to $0.635 at 0930 GMT from Thursday's closing $0.628.</p>
<p>&quot;Gazprom is in demand again... I think yesterday's order for Gazprom has not yet been closed,&quot; Ippolitov said.</p>
<p>Unified Energy Systems fell to $0.3115 from Thursday's $0.3180. Mosenergo utility stood at $1.268 after $1.280, while Norilsk Nickel fell to $7.30 from Thursday's $7.49.</p>
