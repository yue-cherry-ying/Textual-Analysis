<p>Officer Kenneth Cantamout plans to appeal an order to trim his 13-inch (32.5 cms) moustache to conform to police department rules, his attorney said on Friday.</p>
<p>Cantamount, a 12-year veteran of the San Francisco Police Department, went to court after his commanding officer ordered him to trim his moustache.</p>
<p>San Francisco Superior Court Judge William Cahill refused to issue a preliminary injunction preventing the trim at a hearing on Friday.</p>
<p>When stretched out to its full length, Cantamout's moustache measures 13 inches (32.5 cms) but when on duty he keeps it tightly curled so that it does not protrude more than a quarter inch (0.625 cms) on either side, his attorney, Robert Noel, said.</p>
<p>Department rules say officers' moustaches must not extend more than a quarter inch (0.625 cms) each side of the mouth.</p>
<p>Cantamout said the public seemed to like his moustache and said it has helped him get acting parts in movies and modelling jobs in his spare time. &quot;One of my most valuable tools is my moustache,&quot; he told the court.</p>
<p>Cantamout said he appeared in the recent movie &quot;The Rock&quot; under his stage name, Peter Stachio, and could be seen &quot;wearing a big cowboy hat in the scene where the tourists are taken hostage.&quot;</p>
<p>Noel said Cantamout was disappointed with the judge's ruling. He said he planned to appeal and would seek a stay of the trim order pending the outcome of the appeal.</p>
