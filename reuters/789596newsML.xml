<headline>CRICKET-ENGLAND'S LAST SIX WICKETS TUMBLE FOR 70.</headline>

<p>Australian pace pair Glenn McGrath and Paul Reiffel shared five of the wickets as England's last six tumbled for 70 in the fifth Ashes test on Saturday.</p>
<p>England slumped from 243 for four to 313 all out, in reply to Australia's first innings of 427, on the third day at Trent Bridge.</p>
<p>The touring team lost Matthew Elliott for 37 on their way to 56 for one in their second innings at tea, when they led by 170.</p>
<p>England, 188 for four overnight, prospered initially as Graham Thorpe and test debutant Adam Hollioake, his Surrey team mate, took their fifth wicket stand to 102.</p>
<p>Thorpe (53) and Hollioake (45) then both fell in the space of five balls.</p>
<p>Hollioake edged Reiffel and Mark Taylor took a fine catch low at first slip.</p>
<p>Thorpe, dropped by Steve Waugh on 31, was caught at short leg off leg-spinner Shane Warne.</p>
<p>Adam Hollioake did not have the opportunity to bat with his 19-year-old brother and fellow debutant Ben, who played confidently in making 28 before he also fell to Reiffel.</p>
<p>McGrath removed Robert Croft and Andy Caddick in quick succession and ended a last-wicket stand of 23 between Dean Headley and Devon Malcolm by bowling the latter.</p>
<p>McGrath finished with four for 71 and Warne ended with four for 86.</p>
<p>Elliott, Australia's leading run-scorer in the series, was out to a brilliant catch on the square-leg boundary by John Crawley just before tea after making his 37 from 40 balls.</p>
<p>Australia lead the six-test series 2-1 and need only draw here to keep the Ashes, of which they are holders.</p>
