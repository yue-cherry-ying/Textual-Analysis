<p>Former Austrian chancellor Franz Vranitzky accepted an award from the nation's Jewish community on Friday in recognition of his efforts to atone for crimes committed by Austrians during the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Vranitzky, who in 1991 became the first chancellor to pay an official visit to Israel, received a Gold Medal dedicated to &quot;Fighters for Justice, Reconciliation and Human Dignity&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Vranitzky was the first to accept publicly that Austria must bear some guilt for the Shoah. He made a commitment to come to terms with the past,&quot; community leader Paul Grosz said.</p>
<p>He thanked the former chancellor for paving the way to last year's Mauerbach auction of Jewish art treasures seized by the Nazis. The auction raised more than 155 million schillings ($13 million) for a Holocaust survivor fund.</p>
<p>&quot;Vranitzky recognised the moral imperative of this sale, which marked a political turning point in Austria,&quot; Grosz said.</p>
<p>Receiving the award, Vranitzky said he had always condemned fascism in all its guises. &quot;And that in a country where one can get ahead without exactly opposing fascism,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Vranitzky resigned as chancellor in January and is currently the European envoy to Albania. ($ = 11.89 Austrian Schillings)</p>
