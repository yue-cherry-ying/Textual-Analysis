<p>Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok has raised the possibility of introducing a capital gains tax to be levied on increases in the value of shares or other assets.</p>
<p>Kok -- speaking on Dutch television late on Friday after the weekly cabinet meeting -- said the current government would not introduce a capital gains tax but that it could form part of a new broader-based tax system for the next century.</p>
<p>&quot;If we are to work on the outlines of a tax system for the 21st century, and it's only a few years away, then we should seriously consider taxing capital gains, including those brought about by (share) price gains,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kok said a capital gains tax should be aimed at &quot;big fish&quot; and should not affect the small investor.</p>
<p>At present Dutch personal income tax is not levied on capital gains which result from rising share prices.</p>
<p>Kok noted that Deputy Finance Minister Willem Vermeend was currently preparing a discussion paper on tax reform, adding that this was likely to include proposals to tax capital gains.</p>
<p>He said he expected Vermeend's proposals to form a basis for discussions on tax reform within the next government which takes office after elections scheduled for May 1998.</p>
<p>Kok's comments on introduction of a capital gains tax were made in response to an interviewer's remarks about recent media reports of top Dutch managers receiving large pay rises and lucrative share option deals which are only lightly taxed.</p>
<p>The prime minister said such deals set a poor example, adding that Dutch workers' acceptance of wage restraint had played a key role in reducing unemployment in recent years.</p>
