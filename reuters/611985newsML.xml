<p>European Union leaders, eager to complete negotiations on a new treaty to allow their bloc to expand eastwards, arrived in the Dutch resort of Noordwijk on Friday to sound each other out on the future.</p>
<p>The half-day summit was billed as an informal get-together that would pave the way for a treaty to be signed at a second summit in Amsterdam on June 16-17.</p>
<p>Early attention was being paid to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who arrived in the sunny coastal town for his first EU meeting since his Labour party took office after winning the May 1 general election.</p>
<p>Blair's victory over the Euro-sceptic Conservative party was considered crucial to the inter-governmental conference (IGC) treaty negotiations, which have been stymied by British objections to further EU integration.</p>
<p>The new government has pledged to work with its EU partners and lifted Conservtive threats of a veto on various parts of the new treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;We will...make sure that Europe refocuses, that Europe is looking at the things that really matter, like jobs, competitiveness, the environment, consumer rights, the basic things that matter to the person in the street,&quot; Blair said as he arrived for meeting with fellow socialist leaders.</p>
<p>The new treaty is designed to prepare the bloc for enlargement into eastern Europe. Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic are expected to join within the next decade, along with as many as seven others from Estonia to Cyprus.</p>
<p>Negotiations among foreign ministers have been running since March 1996, but Friday's meeting marked the beginning of a new phase in which the leaders themselves would take control.</p>
<p>Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said earlier in the week that it was time for the leaders to step in because the foreign ministers' talks appeared to be languishing.</p>
<p>Some leaders have said that ambitions must be scaled back by those countries seeking a bold new step towards political union and that the new treaty should simply deal with what has to be done to ensure the Union works over the next few years.</p>
<p>That includes moving to more majority voting and streamlining some EU institutons.</p>
<p>The centrepiece of the treaty is expected to be the creation of a freedom and security zone across the Continent by early in the next century, lifting internal borders and strengthening the bloc ability to fight crime.</p>
<p>Job creation is also expected to feature prominently with the leaders keen to show their voters that they are doing something about the bloc's double-digit unemployment.</p>
<p>The treaty is likely to include language legally binding the bloc to consider employment in its decisions.</p>
