<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>China's B share indices ended slightly down on Tuesday on profit-taking after sharp gains in the past week, but the A indices were up on selective insitutional buying, brokers said.</p>
<p>Shanghai's B index fell 0.341 points, or 0.46 percent, to 73.186 on volume of 17.2 million shares worth $7.8 million.</p>
<p>Brokers said domestic investors had become cautious after the sharp gains of the past week and falls in the world's major markets made foreign investors wary, resulting in minor profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;Technical charts show the market needs a period of consolidation around the current level to digest profit-taking,&quot; a broker said. &quot;But the index will continue to move up after the correction given the good market fundamentals.&quot;</p>
<p>Shanghai Dazhong Taxi was the biggest loser on profit-taking, falling $0.070, or 6.03 percent, to $1.090 on volume of 287,000 shares.</p>
<p>Real estate developer Shanghai Lujiazui Finance &amp; Trade Zone Development traded the most on domestic buying, up $0.014, or 1.40 percent, to $1.010 on volume of 1.3 million shares.</p>
<p>Shenzhen's B index edged down 0.07 points, or 0.04 percent, to 162.50 on thin turnover of HK$73.3 million compared with HK$88.4 million last Thursday before the market closed in line with Hong Kong's Easter holiday.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors were reluctant to place large orders ahead of the April 30 deadline for listed companies to publish their 1996 annual reports.</p>
<p>Only three out of 44 B share companies listed in Shenzhen have so far made their results public.</p>
<p>Shenzhen Tellus Machinery &amp; Electronics was the worst performer and hit its 10 percent limit-down at HK$3.38 on volume of 690,000 shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai's A share index gained on speculative institutional buying in selective stocks, but market sentiment had become cautious after sharp gains in the past few weeks, brokers said.</p>
<p>The A index added 7.033 points, or 0.54 percent, to 1,300.395 on volume of 773.8 million shares worth 8.3 billion yuan. The SSE 30 blue chip index ended up 4.233 points, or 0.12 percent, to 3,422.511 points.</p>
<p>Shanghai Dragon Head was the star on speculative buying, surging 0.80 yuan, or 10 percent, to its daily limit-up of 8.80 yuan on volume of 3.1 million shares.</p>
<p>Shenzhen's A share index gained 1.28 points, or 0.28 percent, to 459.76 points on turnover of 10.1 billion yuan against Monday's 10.8 billion yuan.</p>
