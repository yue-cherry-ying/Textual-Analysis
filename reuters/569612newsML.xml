<title>USA: U.S. Spring/White Wheat - Spring wheat bids firmer.</title>
<headline>U.S. Spring/White Wheat - Spring wheat bids firmer.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dark northern spring wheat cash bids were higher on Thursday, powered by gains in MGE spring wheat futures, and movement was slow as clear weather allowed farmers to plant, cash dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;They're just cleaning, treating and seeding,&quot; one Montana dealer said. &quot;You couldn't get a farmer on the phone today if you tried. We've had good weather and it looks like we're going to have a good weekend.&quot;</p>
<p>He estimated Montana's spring wheat seedings would be 40 percent complete as of Sunday. The state statistics service said 29 percent of the crop was planted last week.</p>
<p>White wheat sales were also said to be quiet as prices firmed and farmers held on to supplies.</p>
<p>&quot;The market goes up a little bit like this and they (farmers) get kind of greedy,&quot; one Oregon source said.</p>
<p>Trade sources said exporters had purchased enough white wheat to ship to Pakistan and were not bidding as aggressively as they had on Wednesday.  </p>
