<p>Amnex Inc said Tuesday it expects to report non-cash charges of $7.5 million in the 1996 fourth quarter, resulting in a pre-tax loss for the full year of $5.7 million.</p>
<p>The fourth quarter charges are due largely to the impairment of receivables, intangible assets and investments caused primarily by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other year-end regulatory actions, the company said.</p>
<p>Amnex also said it sees additional charges in the first quarter of between $1 million and $2 million, related to the restructuring of its operations.  </p>
<p>The restructuring includes the closure of some facilities, severance payments to employees, and the realignment and outsourcing of certain core operating functions, the company said.</p>
<p>Amnex said that as a result of its diversification strategy, begun 18 months ago, its domestic operator services business, which generated over 90 percent of revenues in 1995, is expected to generate less than 50 percent of revenue in 1997.</p>
<p>The company also said that it was able to complete &quot;several&quot; acquisitions and joint ventures in 1996 that will contribute new revenue and speed up EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortization) growth, which is expected to &quot;more than double&quot; in 1997.</p>
