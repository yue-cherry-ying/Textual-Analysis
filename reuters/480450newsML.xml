<p>Philippine Airlines (PAL) is negotiating with foreign companies to take up the 12 percent unsubscribed portion of its new capital stock, PAL chief finance officer Jaime Bautista said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are inviting third parties ... We're talking to a lot of interested investors from the United States, Hong Kong and Japan,&quot; Bautista told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Bautista declined to identify the prospective buyers, but said their subscriptions should be paid for before the end of June, the deadline for the subscription.  </p>
<p>PAL has offered five billion pesos worth of new shares to its shareholders, as part of a fund-raising campaign to shore up its finances and support its re-fleeting programme.</p>
<p>&quot;Not all existing stockholders subscribed to the capital increase; we have to look for some other people who are willing to take the position of the government,&quot; Bautista said.</p>
<p>Five government institutions, which collectively owned the minority stake in PAL, decided to waive their right to subscribe, leaving 1.8 billion pesos ($64 million) worth of new shares, or 12 percent of the outstanding shares, unsubscribed.  </p>
<p>PAL had extended the deadline for subscription which originally lapsed on March 31 after the existing shareholders failed to raise the whole five billion pesos in less than two months.</p>
<p>Bautista said majority owner Lucio Tan was willing to take on the unsubscribed shares, but that he did not want to dilute the stake of other shareholders.</p>
<p>At the same time, Bautista said the company denies it would use inflight catering firm MacroAsia Corp as a vehicle for a &quot;backdoor listing&quot; as had been speculated in the market.  </p>
<p>The airline bought 70 percent of MacroAsia last week, fuelling talk that PAL would use the company to gain access to the stock market, instead of going through the cumbersome procedures for a new listing.</p>
<p>Bautista said PAL would use MacroAsia as its subsidiary to operate its auxillary businesses, such as catering and helicopter chartering services.</p>
