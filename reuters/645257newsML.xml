<p>Indonesia's Moslem-backed minority party said on Saturday the country's recent general elections suffered from &quot;vote buying, intimidation&quot; and &quot;physical and mental terror&quot;.</p>
<p>But it stopped short of rejecting the poll.</p>
<p>The United Development Party (PPP) said its central executive would discuss the issue at an unspecified date.</p>
<p>The PPP won just under 23 percent of the vote in the May 29 elections, which the ruling Golkar swept with a majority of over 74 percent after the most violent campaign in three decades.</p>
<p>&quot;Vote buying, intimidation, physical and mental terror which is done openly and without shame is not only against the ethics of Pancasila democracy but also hampers the people's efforts to become mature in politics,&quot; the party said in a statement at a news conference.</p>
<p>Pancasila is the state ideology which advocates belief in one God, humanism, unity of the state, consensus and social justice.</p>
<p>The PPP statement said many party witnesses for polling booths were intimidated and terrorised to the point where they could not do their job and alleged students were forced to vote for a &quot;certain political party&quot; or fail their examinations.</p>
<p>Much of the election violence involved Golkar and PPP supporters, and many observers have been awaiting the PPP's decision on accepting or rejecting the vote to see if violence will resume.</p>
<p>Asked if the party might reject the results, PPP chairman Ismail Hasan Metareum said: &quot;It is not impossible that we will reject the outcome of the election. The central executive board will make a decision on the issue.&quot;</p>
<p>He declined to say whether a decision would be made before the country's election commission issues the final results on June 23.</p>
<p>PPP leaders had met in a central Jakarta hotel for the past two days to review the election and hear reports from party branches in the 27 provinces.</p>
<p>The statement said the party had recorded widespread violations during the 27-day campaign period, polling day and ballot counting. About 90 percent of 125 million eligible voters went to the polls.</p>
<p>&quot;Generally, the quality of the 1997 general elections was no better than previous elections,&quot; said the statement read by the party's secretary-general Tosari Widjaja.</p>
<p>&quot;There was vote buying from civil servants and the people for a certain political party. This included promises of bonuses for electoral officials or village heads who managed to improve the votes of a certain political party,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Asked if the party was Golkar, Metareum replied: &quot;It is up to you to say it.&quot;</p>
<p>Golkar, in power for most of President's Suharto's 30-year rule, won 68 percent of the vote in the last elections in 1992 and had been assured of victory before a ballot was cast in the latest poll.</p>
<p>The only other party permitted to contest the election, the fragmented Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), won only three percent of the vote, down from 15 percent in 1992. The PPP won 17 percent in 1992.</p>
<p>Both minority parties and independent observers charged there had been irregularities in the election.</p>
