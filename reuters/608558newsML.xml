<headline>FOCUS-Holiday mood holds world commodities static. [CORRECTED 19:00 GMT]</headline>

<p>The price of commodities across the world hovered in tight ranges on Friday as markets in Britain and the United States prepared to shut up shop for the long weekend.</p>
<p>The price of coffee, base metals and precious metals gave a little in early trading but recovered later to finish around Thursday's closing levels.</p>
<p>One London-based gold dealer summed up the day .</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's done for the day,&quot; the dealer said in the early afternoon. &quot;With London and New York closed on Monday, people are going to head home early today.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. and U.K. markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial day and Spring holiday respectively.</p>
<p>Gold eased on the open to a low of $341.65 an ounce before a rally in silver dragged it back up 50 cents on the previous close to the $343 area. Dealers said it would spend the day in the $340-$345 range.</p>
<p>Silver raced ahead in the afternoon on fund and physical buying to a high of $4.79 an ounce before easing to hover around the $4.76 level, roughly five cents ahead of Thursday's close.</p>
<p>The platinum group metals were off the day's lows after suffering from selling overnight but sentiment was still bearish, traders said.</p>
<p>The price of coffee futures meandered around Thursday's closing figures.</p>
<p>The July New York traded arabica contract hit a high of 262.25 cents per pound compared to Thursday's close of 260.30 cents, only to drop a couple of cents later.</p>
<p>The London based July robusta contract hit a high of $2,110 a tonne but fell later to sit a few dollars below Thursday's close of $2,082.</p>
<p>With tight South American supply and low stocks in consumer countries the fundamental outlook for coffee prices was still bullish, dealers said.</p>
<p>The recent rally has been the longest for two decades and has pushed some contracts to 20-year highs.</p>
<p>Earlier this week prices received another boost when producer countries agreed to maintain cartel-style export quotas to lock in the gains.</p>
<p>Prices are likely to get more support as Brazil, the world's biggest producer, heads into the winter season with its potentially crop damaging frosts.</p>
<p>Coffee drinkers around the world are already feeling the pinch as roasters raise retail prices, and consumer groups have warned that consumption will suffer as people turn to cheaper substitutes.</p>
<p>Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) hovered around the $2,510-$2,525 a tonne level on Friday with dealings largely reflecting book squaring ahead of the three-day weekend.</p>
<p>The red metal mounted several attempts to scale to Thursday's one-year peak of $2,530 in the afternoon but fell back to the range every time.</p>
<p>Despite technical signals showing copper is over extended, physical shortages lent support. LME warehouses have stood empty of copper since March 24.</p>
<p>Benchmark IPE North Sea Brent crude hovered around Thursday's close of $20.18 a barrel in quiet pre-holiday trading.</p>
<p>Wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade were a few cents lower again under pressure from favourable rainy growing conditions on the U.S. Great Plains.</p>
