<p>Indonesian police on Tuesday freed 33 East Timorese youths who spent several days in custody after they broke into the Austrian Embassy in Jakarta last week as part of a successful bid to meet a visiting U.N. envoy.</p>
<p>&quot;All 33 have been released...earlier today. They have left for Semarang, Surabaya and Yogyakarta using public transport,&quot; a policewoman at the metropolitan police headquarters said.</p>
<p>&quot;They will not be charged or taken to court. There are no conditions for their release,&quot; she told Reuters.</p>
<p>East Timorese sources said they had confirmed that eight members of the group who were being held in cells at South Jakarta police headquarters had telephoned from a bus station on their way home to Yogyakarta in Central Java.</p>
<p>They added they had not yet heard from the remaining 25.</p>
<p>The youths entered the embassy compound last Tuesday and demanded to see Jamsheed Marker, the U.N. secretary-general's special envoy on East Timor who was in Jakarta on a familiarisation trip to Indonesia and East Timor.</p>
<p>Only hours after the break-in, three of the youths were taken to meet Marker at United Nations offices in Jakarta.</p>
<p>Austrian Ambassador Hans Demel said the youths left the embassy early last Thursday after an agreement with senior officials of the Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Demel had said he expected the youths to be held for only a few hours.</p>
<p>&quot;They were held for so long as the police tried to get them to sign a statement recognising East Timor as an integrated part of Indonesia. They refused to sign the statements and in the end the police had to let them go,&quot; an East Timorese source said.</p>
<p>In a similar protest in December 1995 at the Dutch Embassy, police held about 50 mostly East Timorese protesters for 24 hours before they were released. A similar number who entered the Russian Embassy were held for the same amount of time.</p>
<p>Since September 1995, 108 East Timorese have entered foreign embassies in Jakarta and asked for political asylum, always granted by Portugal, the former colonial ruler of East Timor.</p>
<p>Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year in a move not recognised by the United Nations.</p>
