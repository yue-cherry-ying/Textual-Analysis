<headline>RTRS-RBA says room for lower local bond yields.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Ian Macfarlane said on Thursday that he agreed there was room for Australian long bond yields to fall further and for the spread between United States and Australian yields to contract further.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, but I wouldn't want to say by how much,&quot; Macfarlane said when asked at a federal parliamentary committee hearing whether there was room for these rates to fall.  </p>
<p>The yield on the local 10-year government bond was at 7.83 percent on Thursday and has recently swung from 7.70 percent to 8.15 percent.</p>
<p>The fluctuation has been partly driven by changed interest rate differentials due to the recent hike in the Fed funds rate in the United States along with monetary and economic policy deliberations in Australia. The yield on the 30-year long bond in the United States ended at 6.96 percent in New York and has been in the low sevens in recent weeks.</p>
