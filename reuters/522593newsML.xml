<p>A remarkable pitch shot at the last hole helped Stuart Cage of Britain to a closing birdie and a three-stroke lead in the third round of the Cannes Open on Saturday.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old Englishman, a former Walker Cup amateur, set up his chance for his maiden European Tour victory by atoning for an errant second shot with a superb 108-yard, nine-iron pitch from the side of a bank two fairways away and over a lake at the long 18th at Royal Mougins.</p>
<p>He then sank a five-foot birdie putt for a two-under-par round of 69 and a nine-under total of 204 to lead by three strokes from compatriots Paul Broadhurst and Paul Eales.</p>
<p>Sweden's Mathias Gronberg is another shot behind, one ahead of first round leader Santiago Luna of Spain and and Irish Ryder Cup player Philip Walton.</p>
<p>Cage, who relaxed by whistling and humming  his favourite tune from a new recording he bought last week, had built a five-stroke lead after birdies at the 12th and 13th before Broadhurst and Eales closed in with good finishes.</p>
<p>But he responded magnificently to give himself a fine chance of Sunday on improving on his best previous finish, a playoff defeat in the 1995 Irish Open.</p>
<p>&quot;I reckon I could only hope to pull that off once in every 10 times,&quot; Cage said of his final pitch. &quot;The shot was almost blind, I could just see the top of the flag if I jumped up and down and I took aim on one of the course houses.</p>
<p>&quot;I was lucky enough to land the ball on the slope in just the right place.</p>
<p>&quot;When I'd got to five clear I wanted to make it six or seven and was determined not to play defensively, just sensibly. But it put the pressure on when the gap got narrowed.&quot;</p>
<p>He contributed to the situation by shooting bogey at the short 17th after finding a bunker.</p>
<p>Broadhurst, in contention for a  return to the Ryder Cup team, birdied four of the last six holes for a 69 while Eales carded a 70 with four birdies over the closing seven holes, two of them huge putts.</p>
