<title>CROATIA: Hilton may expand hotel chain into Croatia.</title>

<p>Representatives of Hilton hotels have visited Croatia's capital and famous walled coastal city of Dubrovnik and are expected to expand into the Croatian market soon, Tourism Ministry hotel expert Davor Njiric said.</p>
<p>Hilton's director in charge of development Raymond Pierre Chigot visited Dubrovnik on Wednesday and met directors of the Imperial and Libertas hotels, Njiric told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;This would be a big jump for our hotel industry. Where big names go, smaller investors follow, drawing in more capital,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Libertas, a mostly state-owned 700-bed beach hotel outside Dubrovnik's city walls was home to refugees during the Bosnian war, though it is now closed.</p>
<p>Plans were drawn up for radical reconstruction of the site, involving the demolition of 60 percent of the hotel and construction of a dozen smaller Mediterranean-style villas.</p>
<p>Libertas director Miho Blitvic said Hilton had seen the plans and he considered it to be a serious partner. &quot;We are pleased with this first step and in some two weeks we expect a group of (Hilton) architects.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that other international hotel chains had shown interest in the Dubrovnik area.</p>
<p>The Imperial is a smaller century-old building, but its sensitive position next to the mediaeval city walls may render more difficult readjustments needed to fit Hilton standards.</p>
<p>In Zagreb, Chigot inspected several possible building sites for a new hotel.</p>
<p>&quot;He decided that Zagreb had good marketing potential, regardless of the fact that we already have Sheraton and Intercontinental,&quot; Njiric said.</p>
<p>Sheraton is Croatia's only five-star hotel.</p>
