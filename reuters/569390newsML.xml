<p>Singapore gasoline were stable while naphtha slipped with traders concerned that the length in the current bearish market will persist in the near term.</p>
<p>&quot;There are just too much naphtha,&quot; said a trader. Talk was heard that there are distressed cargoes near Japan that are seeking homes.</p>
<p>Some traders have estimated that about 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes of naphtha have been shipped to Asia since the arbitrage window from Europe opened in March.</p>
<p>Traders said the arbitrage remained open to the distress of sellers.</p>
<p>Singapore's June naphtha slipped to $20.75/$20.85 per barrel down from $21.00/$21.20.</p>
<p>The fall led to a widening of the June and July contango suggesting that the bearish market have extended to the forward months, said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;Japanese end users are very laid back, they know they can take their time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Market attention is also on the Saudi Aramco term naphtha talks to be held in Singapore on Monday.</p>
<p>In the mogas market, a bid was seen for 92-octane supplies at $23.75 against no offers.</p>
<p>Traders said the market remained long with buyers unhurried to cover their requirements.</p>
<p>Singapore weekly stocks for light distillates which comprises gasoline, naphtha, reformate were up from a week ago.</p>
<p>Stocks rose by 291,000 barrels to 7.557 million barrels. Traders said the rise in stocks were within expectations.</p>
<p>(Prices are in dollars per barrel)</p>
