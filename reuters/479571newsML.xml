<p>State-owned Air France Europe limped into Europe's new &quot;open skies&quot; on Tuesday, hobbled half the day by strikes by ground staff and pilots in protest at its merger with big brother Air France.</p>
<p>The domestic airline had to cancel almost all flights from Paris' Orly airport on Tuesday morning, the day deregulation took effect on European Union domestic routes.</p>
<p>Normal services were eventually restored in the afternoon after wage negotiations began, the company said.</p>
<p>The stoppage highlighted labour disputes dogging French airlines on the day that Air France took a key step towards a full merger with the former Air Inter, set for September, leasing the domestic carrier's activities and staff.</p>
<p>&quot;The French airlines' domestic problems run deep, and deregulation in Europe will come as a painful eye-opener. Industrial unrest is likely to continue,&quot; said Chris Avery, airline analyst at Paribas Capital Markets.</p>
<p>The strike, blamed by unions on the absence of negotiations on unifying Air France Europe's more generous pay and employment terms with those of parent company Air France, caused misery for thousands of travellers on the busy Easter weekend.</p>
<p>Management says terms need to be brought more into line with those of lower-cost competitors such as British Airways.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately the strike is the only form of labour dialogue we can have with our management. For the past four months management has said 'no' to all our proposals,&quot; said trade union official Marcel Thibault.</p>
<p>Air travel was also disrupted by a one-day strike by staff at the city's airport authority, Aeroports de Paris, against planned job cuts which blanked out flight information screens and caused delays in baggage handling and departures.</p>
<p>Ground staff strikes forced Air France Europe to cancel all flights on Friday and Saturday, and some on Sunday.</p>
<p>Junior Transport Minister Anne-Marie Idrac said the wave of strikes jeopardised the state airlines' future as French air space opened up to competition.</p>
<p>With more than 20 million passengers a year, France has the lion's share of EU air travel but experts say that a sea change is unlikely in the short term at least.</p>
<p>Orly, the main French airport likely to attract European companies for domestic flights, is saturated. Traffic already exceeds the ceiling of 250,000 flights a year which the government set in 1993, leaving no slots free for new operators.</p>
<p>Asked whether deregulation would have an impact in France, Avery said: &quot;In the medium term, yes. On Day One it's unlikely there will be any unleashing as occurred in the United States in 1978. But deregulation will continue to come and it's a tide that cannot be reversed.&quot;</p>
<p>Air France plans to test the open skies rules from May 5, challenging a Lufthansa bastion with the launch of a Frankfurt-Berlin service. It also plans a British domestic link-up, possibly in partnership with Jersey European.</p>
<p>Lufthansa is so far the only foreign airline operating a French domestic route between Bordeaux and Marseille.</p>
<p>Air France is slated for privatisation but no date has been set. Chairman Christian Blanc said in January he wanted to hold the sale later this year or early in 1998, with employees owning between 20 to 30 percent of the shares.</p>
<p>Jean-Claude Baumgarten, his special adviser, told Reuters on Friday that the group was on track for break-even in late 1997.</p>
