<title>MEXICO: Mexico labor leader to leave hospital soon - doctor.</title>
<headline>Mexico labor leader to leave hospital soon - doctor.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-06-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexico's powerful labor leader Fidel Velazquez will remain in the hospital until the middle of the week, but is mainly in good health, his doctor said on Monday.</p>
<p>The 97-year old labor baron, leader of the six million-strong Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), was admitted to hospital on June 5 with a urinary tract infection.</p>
<p>&quot;He is improving, but his sodium and potassium levels are low. He will stay in hospital two or three more days,&quot; his doctor, Salomon Jasqui, told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>The frail labor leader had lost 22 pounds (10 kg) over the last six months as a result of a series of illnesses. But Jasqui said that with the help of a nutritionist he had regained about four pounds (two kg).</p>
<p>&quot;He is doing well and he is following the (July 6) elections very closely and says he intends to vote,&quot; Jasqui added.</p>
<p>Velazquez has been a pillar of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party for more than half a century, repeatedly key swinging labour support behind the government.</p>
