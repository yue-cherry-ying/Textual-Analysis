<title>GERMANY: Language test slows Russia's ethnic German exodus.</title>

<p>The number of ethnic Germans emigrating from Russia and eastern Europe has fallen sharply since Bonn began insisting they must be able to speak German, the Bonn Interior Ministry said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the first three months of 1997, 38,898 ethnic Germans applied to come to Germany compared with 55,592 in the same period last year. The number of new applications fell to 33,797 from 40,944.</p>
<p>In an effort to limit the burden on the welfare state at a time of high unemployment, and ensure that the immigrants integrate quickly, Bonn has started insisting that they pass a German language test before they are allowed to come.</p>
<p>&quot;The government's language offensive has had the effect that ethnic Germans in the former Soviet Union accept the need to speak better German, whether they stay in their current homeland or want to emigrate to Germany,&quot; said Horst Waffenschmidt, the ministry official responsible for the immigrants.</p>
<p>Since 1988 Germany has taken in well over 1.5 million ethnic German immigrants, mostly from Russia and Kazakhstan, despite paying millions of marks in development programmes to try to encourage them to stay where they are.</p>
<p>All are entitled to German nationality if they can prove German descent.</p>
