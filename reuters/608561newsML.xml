<headline>Man jailed for 6 months for mobile phone car crash.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>A 35-year-old banking executive was sentenced to six months in prison by a British court on Friday for causing a fatal car accident while talking on his mobile phone.</p>
<p>Peter Mill had been listening to his messages as he approached a bend in the road. His Rover veered into the other lane and smashed into an oncoming van, killing its driver.</p>
<p>Earlier this week the British government announced it would not introduce legislation banning motorists from using mobile phones at the wheel, despite growing demands for such a ban from safety groups.</p>
<p>Car phone-related deaths have attracted widespread attention in Britain recently after a string of fatal crashes. Last month a man was fined 250 pounds ($400) for careless driving when he caused an accident in which an 11-year-old girl died while he was making a call to his wife.</p>
<p>A jury in Texas on Tuesday ordered an 18-year-old girl to pay about $7 million in damages to the family of a boy killed when she lost control of her vehicle while answering a mobile phone.</p>
