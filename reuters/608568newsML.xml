<headline>UK Conservative leaders back members' votes call.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Two of the six contenders for the leadership of Britain's opposition Conservatives bowed on Friday to demands for a bigger say for grassroots members in deciding who should head the party.</p>
<p>But William Hague and Stephen Dorrell said they accepted a decision taken on Thursday by the party's 164 MPs that they alone should vote in the current contest to decide who should take over from John Major.</p>
<p>Hague, the frontrunner according to the bookmakers, said in a speech in Bristol that if he became leader he would call a special party conference at which he would seek endorsement in a secret ballot.</p>
<p>&quot;Without that endorsement I would not continue to serve. A new leader has to have the support of the whole party,&quot; Hague said.</p>
<p>Dorrell, a moderate outsider in the leadership contest, said it must be the last at which MPs alone took the decision.</p>
<p>He published in advance comments he will make to a news conference in Scotland on Saturday.</p>
<p>In them, he says: &quot;Future leadership elections must give every member of the party a right to vote on the basis of one-member, one-vote within an electoral college.&quot;</p>
<p>There have been howls of protest from party figures at the decision to restrict voting in the June 10 election to MPs.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a huge disappointment. It shows an arrogance on the part of the parliamentary party, of the kind which lost us the last election,&quot; said John Strafford, a member of the party's National Executive. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7950</p>
