<p>Ireland's voters have dumped Prime Minister John Bruton's government and chosen the opposition Fianna Fail party to find allies to form a new administration, according to early estimates on Saturday.</p>
<p>An Irish Times opinion poll and counts by party officials showed that Bertie Ahern's Fianna Fail (FF) would emerge the strongest party with around 44 percent of votes but would need support from small parties to form a government.</p>
<p>Support for his electoral ally, the Progressive Democrats (PD) of Mary Harney, was weaker than expected and could point to a hung parliament with Fianna Fail seeking to forge a pact with one of Ireland's smaller parties to control the 166-seat house.</p>
<p>The Times' exit poll showed the right wing PD's polling only four per cent of votes against an expected five per cent. They had eight seats in the outgoing assembly and could lose half of those if the trend is confirmed.</p>
<p>The survey showed that Bruton's Christian Democrat Fine Gael would win 27 percent of the vote, its Labour party ally eight per cent and the small Democratic Left three percent.</p>
<p>The main casualty in the election appeared to be the Labour party of outgoing deputy prime minister and foreign minister Dick Spring, who is in a three-party centre-left &quot;Rainbow coalition&quot; with Bruton's Fine Gael and Democratic Left.</p>
<p>&quot;The Spring tide is on the way out,&quot; said a Tallyman, a party official allowed to monitor the count and produce early indications of how the result is shaping.</p>
<p>Labour has held the balance of power in parliament for 10 out of the last 15 years and polled almost 20 percent of votes in the last election in 1992.</p>
<p>Labour held 32 seats in the outgoing parliament but opinion polls say this could be slashed to 20 because of a backlash against Spring for ditching Fianna Fail.</p>
<p>Spring helped build, shape and pursue an Anglo-Irish peace initiative for Northern Ireland in partnership with Britain and, as foreign minister, was vocal in defending the rights of small nations during Ireland's six-month tenure of the EU presidency.</p>
<p>Irish financial markets say an inconclusive result to the election is the one they fear most because any period of uncertainty could unsettle trading and put a brief question mark over one of Europe's most succesful economies.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Bertie Ahern is poised to became Taoiseach (Prime Minister) and to head a Fianna Fail-led government into the new Dail (parliament),&quot; The Irish Times said.</p>
<p>It said that Bruton's three-party left-right coalition, known as the Rainbow because of its political mix, stood no chance of getting back into power.</p>
<p>&quot;The outgoing Rainbow government has no chance of being reelected, even it were to coalesce with the Green party to form a four-party coalition,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>If the result were confirmed, it would confirm a 30-year trend in Irish electoral history in which no sitting government has been returned to office.</p>
<p>Among small parties that Fianna Fail might have to court to secure a majority are the Green party, which has one member of parliament at present but fielded more than 20 candidates.</p>
<p>Others include two anti-abortion so-called &quot;Family Value&quot; parties and Sinn Fein, the political wing of Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas fighting British rule of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>But both of the rival coalitions have ruled out any electoral deal with Sinn Fein because of continuing IRA violence. Most mainstream Irish political parties have frozen contact with the party altogether.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein is tipped to win and take its first seat in the Irish parliament in modern history if its candidate in Monaghan/Cavan, Caoimghin O'Caolain is returned.</p>
