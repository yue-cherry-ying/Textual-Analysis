<title>USA: Southern U.S. fish, poultry firms test for dioxin.</title>

<p>Catfish and poultry producers in Arkansas and Mississippi were testing for dioxin levels this week to comply with a federal order on tainted livestock feed as some state officials fumed about regulatory overkill.</p>
<p>Tyson Foods Inc, the nation's biggest poultry producer, said Wednesday it would suspend slaughter operations at two of its poultry plants in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, until it was certain its products met dioxin standards.  </p>
<p>Tyson said &quot;trace amounts&quot; of dioxin in products from the plants had been discovered almost two months ago, with health and environmental authorities last month tracing the cause to feed containing &quot;ball clay&quot; as an anti-caking agent.</p>
<p>Dioxin is a potent carcinogen once used as a herbicide but banned years ago. But soil samples continue to register its presence, as in the clay used in the soymeal feed produced at two Arkansas feed plants.  </p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration and the Food Safety and Inspection Service last week ordered poultry, egg, meat and fish producers handling animals exposed to the feed to make sure dioxin levels were below the federal allowable level of one part per trillion before product sales.</p>
<p>&quot;This level was undetectable until relatively recently and is still only measurable in the country's most sophisticated laboratories,&quot; Tyson said in a statement. &quot;None of our plants that produce fresh chicken for the retail marketplace are among those affected by the recent government actions.&quot;  </p>
<p>Some 1.3 million chickens are produced each week at the Pine Bluff facility, Tyson spokesman Ed Nicholson said. Tyson produces some 35 million chickens every week.</p>
<p>Another poultry producer, Conagra Inc, said it briefly closed its Batesville, Arkansas, poultry plant on Monday for checks. The company said it ensured that a second Arkansas plant processed only chickens that were not fed the dioxin-contaminated feed.</p>
<p>Arkansas Governer Mike Huckabee criticized the forced testing, claiming it threatened the state's $2.1 billion poultry industry and $52.2 million catfish industry.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is obviously regulatory overkill,&quot; Huckabee said in a statement. &quot;What they are going to end up doing without scientific data to support them is put thousands of Arkansans out of work.&quot;</p>
<p>Bill Allen, president of the Catfish Institute which represents the U.S. farm-raised catfish industry, said catfish producers exposed to the targeted feeds were also testing.</p>
<p>&quot;We worked out an agreement with the FDA this afternoon whereby we are starting sampling immediately,&quot; Allen said Wednesday. &quot;Hopefully we will have a minimum disruption.&quot;</p>
<p>Mississippi produces 70 percent of the nation's catfish.</p>
<p>The U.S. Agriculture Department said the contaminated feed was traced to Riceland Foods Inc and Quincy Soybean Co, both in Arkansas, and represents less than one percent of the national production of such feeds. ((--Bob Burgdorfer, Chicago newsdesk 312 408-8720))</p>
