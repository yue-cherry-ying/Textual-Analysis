<p>Increasingly competitive retail markets are spurring owners of brand-name products to zealously protect their brands, and marketing experts say no brand can afford to drop its guard.</p>
<p>&quot;Brands have to be constantly nourished,&quot; Alan Watson, chairman of marketing and communication firm Burson-Marsteller Europe, told Reuters. &quot;The moment you've established a brand, you are on a treadmill. You have to promote it, innovate it.&quot;</p>
<p>Levi Strauss' sharp reaction to a recent move by British grocery chain Tesco Plc to sell Levi's blue jeans underscores just what is at stake -- even for a brand-name product that is a household world around the world.</p>
<p>Tesco in late March started selling Levi's 501 jeans at a discount price in some of its grocery stores, charging 30 pounds per pair compared to more than 50 pounds in Levi's own stores. Levi's reacted by saying it was investigating Tesco's sale of its product. Levi's it said the discount price was not the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;We're investigating a lot of the issues raised by the Tesco situation,&quot; a spokeswoman for U.S.-based Levi Strauss told Reuters. She declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said Levi's does not recommend retail prices. But stores must meet certain criteria in order to be authorised stockists. The criteria include stocking a broad range of styles and sizes, having trained staff to offer service, and making sure product is properly presented.</p>
<p>Levi Strauss last December had rejected Tesco's request to become an authorised stockist, the spokeswoman said. One issue was the grocer's lack of a distinct department for displaying casualwear.</p>
<p>Branding experts agreed that the strength of a brand image is derived from many things -- including the stores where a product is sold.</p>
<p>&quot;Building a brand is about building a whole range of things,&quot; John Noble, director of the British Brands Group, a trade association, told Reuters. &quot;You have the product itself, you have the brand name, you have the package, you have the way it is promoted, and you have the it is distributed.&quot;</p>
<p>Pauline Amphlett, director of intellectual property for DDG Brand Guardians, a branding strategy firm, noted the integral relationship between a brand's image and the stores where it is sold: &quot;The perfume department at Harvey Nichols (an upscale London department store), it's like theatre, it's luxurious.&quot;</p>
<p>Britain's Superdrug chain had battled for years against some of the world's top perfume manufacturers, who were opposed to the sale of their products outside department stores. Superdrug finally won its battle after Yves Saint-Laurent Groupe Saint Laurent in November 1994 agreed to supply Superdrug with a full range of its products.</p>
<p>One industry source said there are close parallels between the Levi's issue with Tesco and the past dispute between Superdrug and the perfume manufacturers. &quot;It's all about what is the appropriate distribution channel for certain products,&quot; the source said. &quot;The perfume people, Levi's spend a lot of money developing a premium image ... building it up as a sort of fashion item.&quot;</p>
<p>In fact, Amphlett noted, &quot;The definition of a successful brand is, in theory, that it enables you to charge a premium.&quot;</p>
