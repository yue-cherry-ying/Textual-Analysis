<p>The OSCE, which monitored Albania's elections, said on Tuesday they had been acceptable but told Albanian politicians to honour the outcome and seek reconciliation or risk missing out on international aid.</p>
<p>&quot;Without such reconciliation, there will be no basis for defining the terms of international aid, and the continued support of the international community,&quot; the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said in a final report on the June 29-July 6 polls.  </p>
<p>&quot;We believe...we can say the elections can be deemed as acceptable, given the prevailing circumstances,&quot; the statement said, pointing to a high 73 percent turnout. It said most voters had been able to cast ballots without fear or intimidation and most electoral commissions had behaved impartially.</p>
<p>After two rounds of voting, Albania's ex-communist Socialists and their leftist allies looked set for a two-thirds majority over President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Javier Ruperez, Spanish president of the 54-nation OSCE's Parliamentary Assembly meeting in Warsaw, told a news conference: &quot;Probably the Albanians don't deserve their own political elites...I can tell you frankly we were at times utterly fed up with the show of unreliability of those political elites, both of the left and right. They should learn a hard lesson....&quot;</p>
<p>He said the head of the OSCE Albania mission, former Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, would submit conclusions to OSCE leaders who would decide on future international aid to Albania.</p>
