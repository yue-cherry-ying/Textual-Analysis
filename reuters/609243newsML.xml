<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright insisted on Friday there were no plans to keep U.S. troops in Bosnia after June 1998 and denied she disagreed with the Pentagon on the question.</p>
<p>But her carefully formulated language was anything but categorical, leaving open the possibility the administration could decide at a later date that a military presence was still required to secure the hard-won but ragged Bosnia peace.</p>
<p>&quot;We envision that civilian assistance and an international presence will be required after June 1998, but there are no plans for any American forces to be in Bosnia after June 1998,&quot; Albright told a State Department news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;There is not a disagreement between me and the Pentagon. ... We have no plans for any lengthening of the role of American forces,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Defence Secretary William Cohen has repeatedly said American troops would be out of Bosnia by June 1998.</p>
<p>Albright's statement was prompted by a controversy reignited on Thursday by a senior State Department official who briefed reporters at the department's request on Albright's initiative to reinvigorate peace efforts in Bosnia.</p>
<p>Under repeated questioning, the senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, left open the possibility that U.S. troops could remain in Bosnia past June 1998.</p>
<p>U.S. troops are the biggest part of the NATO-led stabilisation force (SFOR), whose mandate expires on that date.</p>
<p>Asked if U.S. troops would be out of Bosnia by June 1998, the senior official said: &quot;I'm not making any commitment. The president has not yet made any commitment.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if the SFOR might emerge later in another form, the official said: &quot;That is an issue that the president will be addressing at a future time, I'm sure. What has been decided is a statement of fact: The SFOR mandate ends in June 1998, and the future still has to be decided.&quot;</p>
<p>The official also said the issue of possible future troop deployments was not addressed in a just-completed six-week review of U.S. Bosnia policy.</p>
<p>At her news conference, Albright skirted the question of whether she was &quot;flat ruling something like (continued U.S. troop presence in Bosnia) out in case the situation should get worse.&quot;</p>
<p>She replied: &quot;SFOR ends June 1998. We have made that very clear. And we have no plans for any lengthening of the role of American forces.&quot;</p>
<p>As part of its agreement with Russia on NATO enlargement, the Western alliance has used similar rhetoric, saying it had &quot;no plans, no intention and no reason&quot; to station nuclear weapons on the territory of new NATO member states.</p>
<p>But in that case, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott made clear in a recent speech that NATO's pledge could be changed if a new threat developed.</p>
<p>By using the same phrase for Bosnia, Albright appeared at the least to be preserving Washington's options.</p>
<p>Albright was one of the leading proponents of U.S. military intervention in Bosnia when she was U.N. ambassador.</p>
<p>In her first policy speech on Bosnia since becoming secretary of state, Albright said on Wednesday the United States had a vital interest in preserving peace in Bosnia and would not permit the resurgence of ethnic warfare there. She also reaffirmed a long-term U.S. commitment to Bosnia's future.</p>
<p>At her news conference, Albright reiterated U.S. concerns that civilian implementation of the U.S.-brokered Dayton peace accords for Bosnia were &quot;lagging&quot; and needed to be stepped up in conjunction with SFOR. She is to make her first visit to the Balkans as secretary of state next week.</p>
