<p>India's main opposition Congress party said on Thursday it would move up elections for a new party president to June 9.</p>
<p>The decision complied with a new deadline to hold internal party elections set by India's Election Commission. Earlier, it had set July 11 for the vote for the leader of Congress.</p>
<p>Current interim Congress president Sitaram Kesri was chosen last September by the party's Working Committee after the resignation of former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.</p>
<p>The Electoral Commission earlier asked Congress to hold elections by May 31 but agreed to an extension request by the party, Congress officials said.</p>
<p>Cadre voting is scheduled between May 16 and 20 to pick district level leaders forming an electoral college of 6,500 delegates to choose a national Congress president.</p>
<p>Congress, which has ruled India for all but five years since independence from Britain in 1947, suffered its worst electoral defeat last year.</p>
<p>But it retains clout through its make-or-break support for the ruling United Front coalition.</p>
