<p>Rubbermaid Inc said Thursday it will sell its office products business to Newell Co and record a one-time gain of about $78 million after taxes, or $0.52 per share, from the sale.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid said in a release that it reached a definitive agreement to sell its Tennessee-based office products business to Illinois-based Newell Co for $246.5 million.</p>
<p>In a separate action, Rubbermaid said it will take a $61 million after-tax, or $0.41 cents per share, write-off on certain intangible assets, primarily related to acquisitions now integrated into its four core businesses.  </p>
<p>The company said it expects the transaction to close in the second quarter, subject to filings, and plans to record both the gain and write-off in the second quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid said the sale includes the unit's manufacturing and distribution facilities, related equipment and inventory, and the Eldon and MicroComputer Accessories brands.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid said it will combine its home and seasonal units into one business to &quot;further focus on competitive strengths and better align operations to meet customer needs.&quot;</p>
<p>Rubbermaid said the structural changes are the last in the company's two-year realignment plan.  </p>
<p>The company said it is now centered on four leading, brand-driven core businesses: Rubbermaid for its Home Products and Commercial Products businesses; Little Tikes for juvenile products; and Graco for infant products.</p>
<p>With the implementation of organizational changes to achieve this structure, Rubbermaid said it will revise its realignment cost estimate by an additional $16 million pre-tax or $9 million after taxes, amounting to $0.06 per share.</p>
<p>The company said that in &quot;going forward, (it) will proceed with plans to expand (its) key businesses, pursue strategic acquisitions and continue (its) share-repurchase program.&quot;</p>
