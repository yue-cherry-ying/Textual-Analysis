<p>AMLC COMMENTARY: Handy falls of rain of between 25 mm and 50 mm have taken place across parts of southern Western Australia and most districts of New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland. In Queensland and NSW this enticed some feedlotter and restocker interest which combined with processor buying to increase competition for the reduced supplies available. At saleyards throughout these states, bullock prices gained three cents to eight cents a kg and cows between four cents and eight cents a kg.  </p>
<p>In the southern states, prices for cattle generally slipped. This was attributed to changes in the composition of yardings brought about by the recent rain. Offerings in the saleyards were dominated by very plain stock which producers are resigned to not being able to finish. Average quality stock, the bulk of offerings before the rain, are now being withheld for finishing.</p>
<p>An improvement for lean manufacturing beef in the U.S. market assisted cow prices this week and may help to overcome the slide in the price of plain quality stock. The stronger market was the result of spot buying by retailers for the Memorial Day Holiday, May 26, and tighter offerings from  </p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, offerings of product from Australia and New Zealand should tighten. Prices for lean beef should also benefit from an expected weakening in the price of fatty trimmings (generally inversely correlated to lean beef trimmings) as slaughterings of U.S. lot fed cattle accelerate. However, higher fed slaughter rates may also price fed cattle chucks into grinding mixes, limiting to some extent the possible rises in the prices of lean manufacturing beef.  </p>
<p>The May cattle on feed report, released by the USDA last week, confirmed heavy feedlot supplies, nine percent higher than a year ago at May 1.</p>
<p>Recent slaughter activity suggests that the U.S. feedlot industry is committed to present patterns. Since the beginning of May weekly cattle slaughter in the U.S. had comprised an increased proportion of grainfed steers and heifers at around 600,000 head a week. Last year steer and heifer slaughter rose above this level only four times. This has seen fed cattle prices in the U.S. drop by around three U.S. cents a lb over the period to 66 US cents a lb.  </p>
<p>This price pattern will be encouraging feedlotters to continue selling to avoid having to sell heavier cattle at lower prices in the future.</p>
<p>Buying interest from Japan showed some improvement in the week in response to generally lower beef stocks. Overall, however, consumer demand has remained subdued as Japan moves into the summer months.</p>
<p>Australia's Agricultural Census, meanwhile, shows cattle and calf inventories of 26.3 million at March 31, slightly down on the revised 1996 final estimate of 26.4 million. Total beef cattle supplies are down nearly 300,000 head at 23.3 million.  </p>
<p>Reflecting increased industry profitability, dairy cattle rose 200,000 head to just under three million head.</p>
