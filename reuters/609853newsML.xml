<p>Shares ended almost one percent stronger on the HEX all share index in record-high territory above 3,100 points on Friday, but off an intra-day life-high peak after telecoms group Nokia came off its all-time highs.</p>
<p>Nokia denied market rumours that it was buying its own stock, or that it was buying a Swedish phone equipment maker. It closed at 355.00 markka, up 7.00 markka, but off an all-time high 357.00 markka. The HEX touched 3,123.73 -- up 24.2 points on its previous record, and 25 percent higher than at end-1996.</p>
<p>Brokers said shares were expected to remain firm, but trade would be thin on Monday with U.S. markets closed for a holiday.  </p>
<p>&quot;These (share price) levels will hold next week, depending on Wall Street,&quot; one broker said. U.S. stocks were up in early trade on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade could be somewhat calmer on Monday because of the U.S. banking holiday,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Operators said stock market activity had been relatively lively on Friday, with volumes boosted by the rumours around the rise in Nokia. At the end of official hours, Nokia accounted for 43 percent of the bourse's nearly 600 million markka turnover.</p>
<p>Forestries eased, with UPM-Kymmene down 0.20 markka at 123.80 and Enso down 0.20 markka at 47.80. Among banks, Merita staged a late come-back, closing 0.10 markka up at 18.00 markka.</p>
