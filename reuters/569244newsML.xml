<p>Brazilian portworkers at public terminals in Santos port will only return to work when they have been given written confirmation the port authority has paid their full April salary, a union official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The industrial action will continue until we are absolutely sure all the money has been paid,&quot; said a director from the local port operators' union.</p>
<p>Workers stopped work as of 0700 local/1000 GMT today because the CODESP port authority had only deposited 65 percent of the workers' April salary.</p>
<p>CODESP says its cash-flow problems are due to a four-day strike by stevedores in April.</p>
<p>A CODESP spokeswoman said the remaining 35 percent was expected to be deposited today but the union director said he had been told the money would only be transfered on Friday.</p>
<p>Union members are to protest outside the CODESP building at 1700 local/2000 GMT today but should workers receive confirmation today the money is in the bank, they would return to work immediately, he added.</p>
<p>Some 10 ships in public terminals at the port have been hit by the stoppage, a port spokeswoman said earlier today.</p>
<p>These include a soybean vessel and two wheat ships.</p>
<p>Santos is also Brazil's key coffee loading port, accounting for just under one million bags of the 1.2 million bags covered so far by bills of lading for April shipment.</p>
<p>Given that coffee is loaded in containers, the port authority did not have details of how much coffee may have been hit by the stoppage.</p>
<p>Private terminals have not been affected. ((-Caroline Bulloch, Rio de Janeiro newsroom, 5521 5074151))</p>
