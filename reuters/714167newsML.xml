<p>Iran, battling U.S. efforts to cut foreign arms sales to it, on Tuesday opened a plant that will produce a locally designed battle tank, Tehran radio said.</p>
<p>Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani inaugurated the first phase of the factory, which will produce main battle tanks designed in Iran, the radio said.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of our country's defence priorities, the military industrial sector is one of the most competent technical and industrial sectors of the Islamic Republic of Iran,&quot; Rafsanjani said at the ceremony, the radio reported.</p>
<p>Some 60 Iranian firms cooperated in setting up the plant in Dorud, 300 km (190 miles) southwest of Tehran, to produce the &quot;T-72 tank&quot;, the radio. It gave no further details.</p>
<p>The London-based Jane's Defence Weekly said in October 1996 the designation was that of a tank rebuilt from older tanks. The designation referred to the tank's original production date in the Iranian calender, and not to the Russian T-72 tank, it said.</p>
<p>Iran said in late 1994 it had started mass producing its first locally built battle tank.</p>
<p>Iran has said local experts had designed and developed the tank. It was not clear if they had received Russian help.</p>
<p>Russia is a major arms supplier to Iran, providing it with a wide range of arms in the past few years including sophisticated fighter planes and three submarines, the first to be deployed in the Gulf by a regional state.</p>
<p>Tehran launched a major self-sufficiency campaign in various branches of its military during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war to copy weapons components that could not be easily obtained because of a Western arms embargo and to design and build new weapons.</p>
<p>Washington has repeatedly urged Beijing, Moscow and others to halt arms sales to Tehran.</p>
<p>The Iranian army has more than 1,400 main battle tanks, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Some military experts said only half are in fighting condition and the rest need repairs and overhaul.</p>
