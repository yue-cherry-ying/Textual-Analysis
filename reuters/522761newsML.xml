<p>Israeli opposition leader Shimon Peres ruled out on Saturday a national unity government following a police recommendation to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a government corruption scandal.</p>
<p>&quot;As the situation stands today, there is no basis for a national unity government,&quot; the head of the Labour party told Israel Army radio.</p>
<p>Israel's attorney-general is expected to announce on Sunday whether Netanyahu and three other top officials will be indicted as recommended by police earlier in the week.</p>
<p>An indictment against Netanyahu, the first for an Israeli prime minister, could topple his government. Prosecutors could ignore the police recommendations made after a probe over a failed appointment in January of an attorney-general.</p>
<p>Peres, who helped engineer the PLO peace deals but lost last year's election to Netanyahu, has said in the past he would consider joining a national unity government.</p>
<p>Peres believes a unity government is the only way to save faltering Israeli peace moves with the Palestinians and other Arab partners.</p>
<p>&quot;If the conclusions are that this government stays put then in my opinion the peace process will have almost lost its chance,&quot; Peres said.</p>
