<p>The German Defence Ministry said on Monday it was sacking a soldier who staged mock executions and rapes on video with his colleagues during breaks in training for peacekeeping in former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The ministry spokesman said Bonn was also filing charges in the civil courts against the soldiers who made the video, which has provoked shock and stirred memories of Nazi atrocities since pictures were published in a weekend newspaper.</p>
<p>The sacked soldier was the only one of the seven who made the film last year who was still in the army, the ministry said.</p>
<p>&quot;Investigations are also taking place with urgency into soldiers who knew of the film in early 1996 or later and did not report this,&quot; a ministry spokesman added. &quot;They may also have violated their obligations.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldiers -- many of them young conscripts -- who made the video are accused of illegal use of army weapons, glorifying violence and bringing the armed forces into disrepute.</p>
<p>In scenes from the film already published in newspapers, a youthful recruit in a German army uniform is shown holding a pistol in the mouth of another recruit.</p>
<p>Another photograph showed a German soldier wearing battle fatigues pretending to rape a recruit acting as a woman civilian, later shown being marched to execution by soldiers.</p>
<p>Other photos from the video, which was shot at Hammelburg training ground in southern Germany in April 1996, show enactments of &quot;civilians&quot; being tortured and hanging from trees.</p>
<p>The Defence Ministry says it has no evidence that the soldiers' actions had been politically motivated.</p>
<p>The private broadcaster which obtained the tape has promised to pass it later this week to the ministry, which has only seen extracts of the film so far.</p>
