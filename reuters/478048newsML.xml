<title>USA: Convest Energy reserves delined in 1996.</title>
<headline>Convest Energy reserves delined in 1996.</headline>
<dateline>HOUSTON 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Convest Energy Corp said Tuesday it had proved reserves at the end of 1996 of 6.3 million barrels of crude oil and 37.58 billion cubic feet of natural gas.</p>
<p>This represents a decline from the company's reserves at December 31, 1995, of 6.5 million barrels of crude oil and 40.55 billion cubic Mmcf of natural gas, it said.</p>
<p>Production during 1996 was 960,000 barrels of crude oil and 13.16 billion cubic feet of natural gas.  </p>
<p>The company said its capital expenditure budget for 1997 will be about $16 million, up from 1996's total spending of $10.9 million that included a &quot;very active&quot; drilling program.</p>
<p>Eleven of the fifteen wells drilled in 1996 were successful, it said, noting only one of the 11 successful wells was quantified in the year-end 1995 reserve report as proved reserves. Therefore, ten of these wells represent new additions to the Company's reserves in 1996.</p>
<p>Convest said its drilling success in late 1995 and 1996 has mitigated the steep production decline from the company's offshore gas properties.</p>
<p>As previously announced, the company and its majority shareholder, Edisto Resources Corp, have jointly engaged the investment banking firm of Petrie Parkman &amp; Co Inc to make recommendations for strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value for both Edisto and Convest.</p>
<p>Petrie Parkman's engagement will include identifying and evaluating potential strategic partners in the oil and natural gas industry for a sale or merger of Edisto and Convest.</p>
