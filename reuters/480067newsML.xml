<p>A cross-continental beer brawl turned out to be a storm in a beer glass on Tuesday when Austrian brewer BBAG rejected a &quot;takeover&quot; bid which South African Breweries (SAB) said it had never made.</p>
<p>The confusion arose when Austrian mass daily Kronenzeitung reported on Friday that SAB, the world's fourth largest brewer, had made a five billion schilling ($425 million) bid for BBAG.</p>
<p>BBAG controls about two thirds of the Austrian beer market through its Brau Union unit.</p>
<p>A clearly irritated BBAG immediately said it had no intention of selling out and insisted that Austrian beer would remain purely Austrian.</p>
<p>&quot;The controlling shareholders, who met today at short notice because of rumours in several media, have unanimously rejected the takeover designs by South African Breweries,&quot; BBAG said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But SAB hinted that BBAG may have got it wrong. &quot;There was no formal bid, no formal negotiations,&quot; an SAB spokesman said. &quot;We have not made any takeover bid.&quot;</p>
<p>SAB admitted, however, that it had informally approached one of BBAG's controlling shareholders about a range of issues. One of them was the possibility of buying shares in BBAG's ultimate holding firm.</p>
<p>BBAG, one of Europe's top 10 brewers, has a complicated structure that is effectively controlled by five families from the province of Upper Austria, known as the &quot;beer dynasty&quot;.</p>
<p>The clan controls a non-operative holding company, called Getraenke Holding (Drinks Holding), which through a series of further holdings owns the majority in Brau Union.</p>
<p>SAB has recently expanded rapidly in central and eastern Europe, gobbling up up businesses in Poland, Hungary and Romania. BBAG controls the Hungarian breweries Sopron and Martfu, Starobrno in the Czech Republic and Romania's Arbema.</p>
<p>BBAG said it had rejected the bid for &quot;strategic reasons&quot; and put the South African interest down to its strong peformance in the hotly contested eastern European markets.</p>
<p>&quot;While BBAG group managed to raise its market share for example in Hungary by nine percent, competitors lost 10 percent market share,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The repeated interest of international groups mirrors the great appreciation of BBAG, which today is the leading brewery group in central Europe,&quot; the statement added.</p>
