<p>The Clinton administration is considering dropping its insistence that labour and environmental issues be part of a so-called fast track trade negotiation authority, an administration official said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The official said no decisions have been made. But dropping explicit authority to negotiate labour and environmental issues from the proposed legislation is one of the options being considered by the administration as it prepares proposed legislation to send to Congress.</p>
<p>&quot;The only way fast track is going to move is to have some flexibility,&quot; the official said. &quot;The climate in Congress among Republicans is a little more receptive to that and hopefully there is a little more flexibility among Democrats to find a position that will work.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky in testimony last month to the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over fast track legislation, said that the dispute over labour and environment issues should not be allowed to derail fast track legislation.</p>
<p>Fast track authority allows U.S. trade officials to negotiate trade deals without fear Congress will change them. Lawmakers would be able to either vote for agreements or against them, but not amend them. Legislation was put on hold during the 1996 presidential election campaign after the White House and Congress failed to compromise on labour and environment.</p>
<p>Republicans who control Congress strongly oppose including labour and environmental issues as part of the fast track authority. But Republican leaders, who generally have been supportive of free trade agreements, have told the White House that at least some Democrats in Congress need to support fast track in order to muster the votes needed to pass the legislation.</p>
<p>At the same time, key Democrats, including House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. and House Minority Whip David Bonior, have said they will not support fast track authority without labour and environment included.</p>
<p>Barshefsky urged lawmakers last month to be flexible on the legislation she said was needed to continue working to open more markets to U.S. goods.</p>
<p>The administration is considering proposing legislation that would be silent on the issue. That would give trade officials leeway to negotiate those issues in side agreements as was the case with Mexico and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the official said.</p>
<p>The legislation would provide fast track authority for four years with a provision to reauthorize it for another four years, the trade official, who asked not to be identified, said.</p>
<p>The administration needs the fast track authority to negotiate an expansion of NAFTA to include Chile. Official said they expected to send proposed legislation to Congress by the end of the month.</p>
