<p>Thousands of frenzied Congress party activists on Saturday erupted in a demonstration of support for the Italian-born widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.</p>
<p>Excited party activists shouted, stamped and applauded when Sonia Gandhi, the inheritor of the Nehru-Gandhi mantle, entered a stadium in the eastern city of Calcutta where a Congress convention was being held.</p>
<p>&quot;Long Live Sonia Gandhi! Long Live Rajiv Gandhi! Long Live Indira Gandhi!&quot; they shouted for 10 minutes as Sonia Gandhi, 50, waved before taking a seat below the stage.</p>
<p>As soon as party president Sitaram Kesri began his speech, the crowd of about 10,000 clamoured for Sonia Gandhi to be brought on the dais, preventing Kesri from speaking.</p>
<p>After five minutes of din, the party president stepped off the platform and led Sonia Gandhi on to the stage, where she took a seat.</p>
<p>The outpouring of support underscored the popularity of Sonia Gandhi, who has played a behind-the-scenes role in party politics since her husband was killed in 1991.</p>
<p>But in May she formally joined Congress, stirring speculation that she was prepared to bow to the demands of a powerful faction in the nation's oldest party which had long pressed her to assume a leadership role.</p>
<p>The daughter of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi was prime minister for 16 years, between 1966 and 1977, and again from 1980 to 1984, when whe was shot by her Sikh bodyguards.</p>
<p>Rajiv was blown up by a suicide bomber while campaigning in southern India in 1991.</p>
