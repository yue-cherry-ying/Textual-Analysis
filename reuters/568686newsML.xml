<title>USA: NBA BASKETBALL-EDDIE JORDAN TO REMAIN AS SACRAMENTO KINGS HEAD COACH.</title>
<headline>NBA BASKETBALL-EDDIE JORDAN TO REMAIN AS SACRAMENTO KINGS HEAD COACH.</headline>
<dateline>SACRAMENTO, California 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Eddie Jordan, who served as interim head coach of the Sacramento Kings for the final 15 games of the season, on Thursday was given a two-year contract to remain on the job.</p>
<p>Vice president of basketball operations Geoff Petrie elected to retain Jordan even though the Kings won just six of 15 games following the firing of Garry St. Jean on March 20 and failed to make the playoffs.</p>
<p>&quot;He has been to the front lines and has proven he is more than capable of firing the gun,&quot; Petrie said of the 42-year-old Jordan, who served as an assistant coach for the last five years at Sacramento before being promoted.</p>
<p>&quot;The last 15 games of the season was a sampling of the direction this club will take,&quot; said Jordan, whose team won five of its final eight contests. &quot;We played unselfishly, and with enthusiasm and intelligence in those 15 games.&quot;</p>
<p>Jordan had a seven-year NBA playing career with Cleveland, New Jersey, the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland and was a member of the Lakers' 1982 championship squad. He also served as an assistant coach at the college level at Rutgers, Old Dominion and Boston College before joining the Kings.</p>
<p>St. Jean guided the Kings to their first playoff berth in 10 years a season ago, but never finished above .500 in four-plus seasons in Sacramento.</p>
