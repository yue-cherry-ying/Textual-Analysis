<p>Peru's Interior Minister Juan Briones and police chief Ketin Vidal resigned on Saturday under mounting criticism for security lapses that led to the takeover by Marxist rebels of the Japanese ambassador's home in Lima.</p>
<p>Briones, who said his resignation had been accepted by President Alberto Fujimori, made the announcement shortly after swearing in a new police chief following the surprise resignation of Vidal earlier Saturday.</p>
<p>Briones acknowledged that the Dec. 17 storming of the Japanese ambassador's residence by Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) gunmen had been a serious setback for Peru's security forces.</p>
<p>&quot;We recognise that there were security lapses in the takeover of the Japanese residence,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Vidal, who was one of the police officers responsible for the 1992 capture of Maoist Shining Path guerrilla leader Abimael Guzman, was replaced by Gen. Fernando Dianderas.</p>
<p>A successor for Briones has not yet been named.</p>
<p>Fujimori hinted that those found responsible for the MRTA attack would lose their jobs once the hostage crisis was resolved.</p>
<p>The 20-odd MRTA rebels still hold 72 hostages 123-days after their spectacular assault on the diplomatic residence. They are demanding the release of some 400 jailed comrades in exchange for their captives.</p>
<p>The resignations came just a day after Fujimori pledged his full support for his cabinet of ministers.</p>
<p>&quot;Why should a cabinet of ministers which works for the Peruvian people resign?&quot; Fujimori said during one of his routine trips to the interior of the country.</p>
<p>Fujimori was travelling again on Saturday and made no immediate comment on the resignations.</p>
<p>Briones and Vidal also came under pressure in recent weeks over accusations of torture and politically-motivated attacks by security forces.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a very strong campaign against the government,&quot; Briones said. &quot;The most serious thing is the attacks on institutions and we who have positions of responsibility cannot allow that.&quot;</p>
