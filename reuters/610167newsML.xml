<headline>German court convicts Bosnian Serb of war crimes.</headline>

<p>A 34-year-old Bosnian Serb was found guilty on Friday of taking part in the mass murder of Moslems during the Bosnian war and sentenced by a German court to five years in jail.</p>
<p>Novislav Djajic was found guilty by a Bavarian state court of 14 counts of acting as accomplice to murder and attempted murder. It was the first war crimes trial in Germany since the Nuremberg tribunal on Nazi war crimes more than 50 years ago.</p>
<p>German federal prosecutors, who took on the case because of an overload at the United Nations war crimes tribunal in the Hague, said Djajic took part in a June 1992 raid in which 14 Moslem men were killed and 15 others taken prisoner.</p>
<p>The 15 were never seen again. Prosecutors told the court Djajic had known the Moslems would be shot.</p>
<p>But the court said it could not be sure he intended to kill them as representatives of a specific ethnic group and stopped short of convicting him of genocide and complicity in genocide.</p>
<p>Djajic's German lawyer Wolfgang Bingfelder said he would appeal against the conviction, arguing that the German court had no right to try his client because the 1992-95 Bosnian conflict was &quot;an internal civil war&quot; and not an international conflict.</p>
<p>In his verdict, Judge Ermin Briessmann recalled how Djajic along with other Bosnian Serb troops had lined a number of Moslems up on a bridge over a river and shot them in revenge after their fellow troops had been killed by a mine.</p>
<p>&quot;One can accuse Djajic of carrying out a reprisal attack in which he did not know he was supposed to shoot (the Moslems),&quot; Briessmann told the court.</p>
<p>&quot;But it was not possible to prove that Djajic had acted on an intention to destroy an (ethnic) group. It was however doubts about this that had led to the charges against him of genocide and complicity in genocide,&quot; Briessmann said.</p>
<p>Djajic, who entered Germany in 1993, was arrested in January 1996. Much of the prosecution's case was based on the testimony of one survivor of the massacre.</p>
<p>Although the alleged offences were not committed in Germany, Djajic was tried in Germany under a section of international law which says the perpetrators of genocide should not receive shelter anywhere and can be tried abroad.</p>
<p>Djajic's lawyer Bingfelder said the trial should not have started in the first place because the conflict was not international but a civil war.</p>
<p>&quot;I will appeal against the verdict. The court failed to recognise the limitations of its knowledge. We are not dealing with an internatinal conflict but with an international civil war and nothing else,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>The court however accepted prosecutors' argument that neighbouring Serbia, now part of Yugoslavia along with the smaller Montenegro, was involved in the Bosnian war and this placed it in the category of an international conflict.</p>
<p>German prosecutors are investigating 48 other people suspected of war crimes in former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Germany's Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders was conducted by judges and prosecutors from the four Allied victors.</p>
