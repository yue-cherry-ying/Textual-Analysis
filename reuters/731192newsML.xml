<p>Guidant Corp said Wednesday it expects the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to grant marketing approval to its Ventak AV implantable defibrillator this quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;We have an expectation that we will get approval in the third quarter here in the U.S....for the AV. So we expect very positive things out of that,&quot; said chief executive Ronald Dollens in an interview with Reuters.  </p>
<p>The launch of the Ventak AV is expected to boost Guidant's presence in the fast-growing market for implantable defibrillators, or ICDs, in which the company holds a roughly 43 percent market share worldwide.</p>
<p>Another key introduction will be Guidant's Ventak Mini III ICD, which Dollens said the company expects to launch in Europe in the fourth quarter and in the United States in the first quarter of 1998.  </p>
<p>An ICD is a small electronic device implanted in the body and connected by wires to the heart to keep it from beating too fast. Wall Street analysts estimate the worldwide ICD market will reach $1 billion in sales this year and is growing 20 to 25 percent annually.</p>
<p>Besides Guidant, dominant players in the ICD market are Medtronic Inc and St. Jude Medical Inc, which recently acquired number-three player Ventritex Inc.</p>
<p>Indianapolis-based Guidant on Wednesday reported second quarter earnings of $0.63 per share, up from $0.53 per share a year ago. Quarterly sales were up six percent to $281 million.  </p>
<p>Shares in the company closed Wednesday up 1-1/6 at 88 on the New York Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>Of total quarterly sales, about 58.5 percent was generated by Guidant's cardiac rhythm management group. The group includes ICDs, as well as pacemakers -- electronic implants wired to the heart to keep it from beating too slowly.</p>
<p>Guidant has about nine percent of the roughly $2.3 billion world pacemaker market and expects to launch a new line of pacemakers in Europe in the fourth quarter, Dollens said.</p>
<p>Cardiac rhythm management sales were up solidly in the second quarter versus a year ago, but sales in Guidant's other key segment -- vascular intervention -- were down to $101.1 million from $109.1 million in the second quarter of 1996.  </p>
<p>The Multi-Link coronary stent and its rapid-exchange delivery system remain important to turning around the vascular intervention business, Dollens said.</p>
<p>Guidant submitted an application for marketing approval to the FDA for the Multi-Link on June 12. Dollens declined to speculate on when the stent may be approved for marketing, but analysts said it will likely be this year.</p>
<p>&quot;If they were to approve this product early, we can supply 60 percent of the worldwide demand by August. We've got no indication of when that approval would happen,&quot; Dollens said.</p>
