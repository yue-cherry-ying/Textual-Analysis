<p>Equitable Banking Corp's eagerly-awaited initial public offering (IPO) could debut with a bang on Thursday if grey market prices of 120 to 125 pesos ($4.50-4.75) hold true, brokers and traders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The bank's offering involves 85,412,820 shares priced at 113.30 pesos each.</p>
<p>Some brokers said last month they were put off by the offering's high price, which is slightly over 19 times the bank's 1997 projected earnings. But interest had been building in recent weeks, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It has stabilised at done deals of 120 to 125 pesos. But it hit a high of 135 pesos,&quot; said Spencer Yap, analyst at BPI Securities Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;I've heard deals done at 124 pesos,&quot; said Poch Zamora, dealer at Peregrine Securities. Another broker said he sold his shares for 124 pesos.</p>
<p>Equitable's IPO valuation is based on the assumption that all warrant holders will buy their allotted shares within the year.</p>
<p>The 19 times price/earnings ratio was on a par with industry leaders Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co and Philippine Commercial International Bank, analysts said.</p>
<p>Still, some analysts said the price might be acceptable considering the bank's forecast that it would nearly double its earnings in 1997 to 2.011 billion pesos from 1.046 billion pesos a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The fundamentals are good even if the pricing may be aggressive,&quot; said BPI's Yap.</p>
<p>&quot;One may be paying premium but considering its solid earnings and a forecast that the bank will double its earnings this year, it should be seen as a long-term buy. I think a lot of institutional buyers will hold on to the stock,&quot; said Guoco Securities research head Saturnino Mejia.</p>
<p>Mejia said there was earlier talk that the issue would debut at 135 pesos.</p>
<p>&quot;But since the market is in a consolidation phase right now, it could affect the listing and the market may not be as bullish as expected,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Philippine stock market's main index closed sharply lower on Tuesday, losing 51.19 points, or 1.59 percent, to 3,171.79 points.</p>
<p>The listing of Equitable was also keenly anticipated for the liquidity it might usher back into the market, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be additional liquidity but it does not follow that the funds will be transferred to index-linked issues. The allure of the speculative issues is still there especially in this kind of market,&quot; said Yap.</p>
<p>Traders said the U.S. stock market, which suffered steep falls in the past two trading days, would continue to dictate the local bourse's pace.</p>
<p>Sun Hung Kai Securities said in its daily market report on Tuesday that Equitable shares were still being actively traded over-the-counter and that its debut would mean increased value turnover.</p>
