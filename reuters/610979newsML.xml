<headline>SIMEX Nikkei futures end higher, gains precarious.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>SIMEX Nikkei futures were lifted by pre-weekend short-covering to end just above the 20,000 points level on Friday, but dealers said the gains could prove short lived.</p>
<p>The lead Nikkei 225 June contract added 195 points to end at 20,005 on low volume of 12,245 lots.</p>
<p>After opening firmer, the contract touched an early high of 20,140 but failed to sustain the rise.  </p>
<p>&quot;With it being Friday and the dollar/yen going higher, maybe some people were just trying to lock in their profits because the market fell quite a bit this week,&quot; a trader with a Japanese futures house said.</p>
<p>He said the market had largely shrugged off reports that Yamaichi Securities had decided to stop providing financial assistance to troubled Ogawa Securities as most participants were already aware of the news.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment we should trade in a range with support at 19,800 and the topside at 20,300 unless there are fresh factors,&quot; a senior trader with an Asian institution said.  </p>
<p>The May MSCI Taiwan index contract ended at 349.5 against its opening 352.0 on volume of 800 lots. Players continued to roll over their positions to the June contract, which ended at 347.3 against 349.0 on 552 lots.</p>
