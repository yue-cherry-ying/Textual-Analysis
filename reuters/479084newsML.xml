<text>
<p>A deadly fire swept through an apartment complex in Earlington, Kentucky, Tuesday causing the top floor of the three-story building to collapse and knocking out phone services to the town, authorities said.</p>
<p>&quot;We do know that there were fatalities but we don't know how many, and we won't know until the building cools and we can get in there,&quot; Trooper Bryan Pitney of the Kentucky State police post at Madisonville said.</p>
<p>He told Reuters initial reports that five had died could not be confirmed and speculation that arson was involved was not correct. &quot;We have no idea what started the fire and at this moment we are not looking at arson as the cause,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the state fire marshal's office said the blaze, which caused the third floor to collapse, continued to burn several hours after it was first reported.</p>
<p>The fire along Earlington's Main Street knocked out phone service to the town of 1,800, 140 miles southwest of Louisville, fire marshal's spokeswoman Carol Czirr said.</p>
