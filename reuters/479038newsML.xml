<text>
<p>Qatar's state-owned telecommunications agency on Tuesday announced a &quot;record&quot; profit in 1996, thanks to more mobile telephone users.</p>
<p>Izzat al-Rashid, general manager of the Qatar Public Telecommunications Corp (Q-Tel), told reporters that profit rose 16 percent to 402 million riyals ($110 million) last year. He said 100 million riyals would be spent on improving customer services.  </p>
<p>Rashid said Q-Tel had a good year in 1996 because the number of mobile telephone users in the tiny Gulf Arab state jumped to 25,000 in 1996 from 15,000 in 1995 while radio-pager users rose to 58,000 from 46,000 during the same period.</p>
<p>He said 60 percent of net revenue came from international telephone calls made from Qatar, which has 26 telephone lines for every 100 people. Qatar has a population of 560,000 people, some 440,000 of whom are expatriates.</p>
<p>Rashid said the corporation planned to reduce telephone call rates every two years to encourage more calls and to speed up the installation of new telephones.  </p>
<p>Work was also underway to expand the mobile telephone network to increase capacity to 50,000 lines in 1997 and 70,000 lines next year.</p>
<p>Rashid said Q-Tel was considering increasing its 10 percent stake in a United Arab Emirates-based shareholding company formed earlier this year to operate and own a major new satellite project for mobile communications.</p>
<p>He gave no further details.</p>
<p>The satellite project, called al-Thurayya, is due to be operational by the turn of the century at a total cost of $800 million.</p>
<p>It will provide services to UAE users of mobile telephones compatible with the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM).</p>
<p>Etisalat, the UAE's telecommunications heavyweight, holds a 26 percent stake in al-Thurayya and the Arab Satellite Communications Organisation (Arabsat) owns 10 percent. Other shareholders include Bahrain Telecommunications Co (10 percent).</p>
