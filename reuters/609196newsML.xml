<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Shanghai B share index ended down slightly on Friday on weak sentiment, dampened by Thursday's sharp falls and fears of further crackdown measures in the short term, brokers said.</p>
<p>The B index fell 0.196 points or 0.24 percent to 82.387 points on volume of 21.332 million shares worth $16.194 million.</p>
<p>With Beijing imposing new curbs on the trading of shares by the state-owned enterprises, barring them from making &quot;speculative&quot; deals, investors are eager to offset their positions, which hurt sentiment, brokers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Institutions are not willing to build positions under such unfavourable conditions, because more clampdown news is expected in the near-term,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;The index will consolidate at current levels early next week after the recent falls if there is no further crackdown news,&quot; another broker said. &quot;Otherwise the market will break down below 80 points with 75 points the next likely support.&quot;</p>
<p>Of 43 B shares, 40 traded, with 14 down, eight flat and 18 up.  </p>
<p>Shanghai Rubber Belt was the biggest loser on poor prospects, plunging $0.020 or 8.84 percent to $0.206 on volume of 50,000 shares.</p>
<p>Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere was the most actively traded with its 100 million new shares listed today, slipping $0.060 or 6.55 percent to $0.856 on volume of 5.3 million shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai's A share index staged a technical rebound thanks to some institutional support for stocks with a heavy index weighting, but market sentiment was still weak, broker said.  </p>
<p>The index gained 20.514 points or 1.59 percent to 1,310.627 points on volume of 497.3 million shares worth 7.5 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The SSE30 blue chip index closed up 107.946 points or 2.86 percent to 3,881.928 points.</p>
<p>Beijing Double Crane Pharmaceutical  600062.SS was the biggest winner on bargain-hunting, soaring 1.38 yuan or 9.96 percent to 15.23 yuan on volume of 15.8 million shares.</p>
