<p>International experts started talks on Tuesday in Oman on an ambitious project to cut the cost of desalinated water in the Middle East and North Africa and ease the region's growing water shortage.</p>
<p>A group of 20 experts who make up the Research Advisory Council (RAC) formed in May by the Middle East Desalination Research Centre (MEDRC) -- one of many projects spawned by the Middle East peace process -- are expected to drum up ideas on how to produce cheaper water in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;Water is the most important issue in the Middle East whether in peace or war times and we think the RAC will be able to come up with sound recommendations on means of reducing the cost of desalinating water,&quot; said Eric Jankel, director of the Muscat-based MEDRC which was established in December 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Such recommendations when approved...will be implemented by the centre and we expect to make the first research awards in December 1997,&quot; he told Reuters. The centre plans to issue tenders for research proposals in September and October.</p>
<p>The meeting, expected to end on Thursday, is the first held by the experts from Oman, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Italy, Kuwait, the Palestinian Authority, the United States, Jordan, Israel, France, Japan, South Korea and Germany.</p>
<p>Water, one of the region's most precious resources, is not only scarce but a bitter point of contention between Israelis and Palestinians as well as between other regional states.</p>
<p>Water desalination is vital for the largely arid countries of the Middle East, but its costs are prohibitive for most. Many governments bear most of the cost of desalination, which experts say accounts for just 5.75 percent of regional water resources.</p>
<p>Middle East countries largely depend on scarce rainfall and non-renewable underground water, they say.</p>
<p>The United States, Oman, Japan and Israel have committed $3 million each to MEDRC. South Korea has contributed $600,000. The European Union is planning to donate $3.6 million.</p>
<p>Oman and its fellow Gulf Arab state of Qatar have forged ahead of other Gulf states in establishing economic ties with Israel after its 1993 peace deal with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Israel's representative was attending Tuesday's meeting.</p>
<p>Israelis were told to stay away from several exhibitions and conferences in Oman and Qatar this year due to objections from other Gulf states, especially Saudi Arabia, angered by the stalled peace process and what they see as hardline policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
