<p>Rail traffic in trailers and containers on major U.S. railroads grew by 8.2 percent in the week ended May 3 from the same week a year ago, while carloads were down 2.0 percent and a total volume of ton-miles were off 1.9 percent, the Association of American Railroads said Thursday.</p>
<p>Traffic in the latest week included 169,689 trailers and containers, 345,846 carloads, and ton-miles of 26.2 billion. A ton-mile is equal to a ton of freight hauled one mile.</p>
<p>The AAR also said that volume on two Canadian-based railroads in the current week totaled 56,333 carloads, up 0.2 percent from last year, and 25,456 trailers and containers, up 13.0 percent.</p>
<p>During April, trailer and container traffic on major U.S. railroads grew at a robust 8.3 percent, continuing an accelerated rate of growth over last year that began in January.</p>
<p>Carload freight, though, was down 1.0 percent in April. Haulings of chemicals, metallic ores and minerals, and forest products grew faster in April than they did in the first quarter, while grain, coal and non-metallic minerals and product loadings fell.</p>
<p>&quot;Spring flooding, soft export demand and a tentative domestic grain market have hampered grain volume,&quot; AAR official Craig Rockey said.</p>
<p>&quot;Upper Midwest flooding, a moderate climate in much of the U.S. during early 1997 and limited pressure on coal stockpiles have combined to suppress coal shipments,&quot; Rockey said. &quot;U.S. movements of motor vehicles and equipment were also lower than 1996 due primarily to scattered automobile work shortages.&quot;</p>
<p>Combined U.S. and Canadian April rail movement included a 9.2 percent increase in trailer and container traffic and a 0.7 percent decline in carload traffic.</p>
