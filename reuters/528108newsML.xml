<p>The United States said on Tuesday it would not stop Iraq's helicopter movement of Moslem pilgrims through a &quot;no-fly&quot; zone in southern Iraq, but warned Baghdad against building up its military forces in the area.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton and a senior U.S. defence official spoke as Iraq sent several military helicopters to its border with Saudi Arabia to pick up about 100 Iraqi Moslems returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not prepared to stop what appear to be small-scale and humanitarian operations,&quot; Defence Department spokesman Ken Bacon said at the Pentagon. But he said U.S. and allied warplanes would not allow President Saddam Hussein to increase his military forces in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>The area was designated as a &quot;no-fly&quot; zone and placed off limits to Iraqi aircraft by Washington and western allies in 1992 to protect Iraqi Shi'ites who mounted a failed rebellion against Saddam following the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>Clinton, who spoke to reporters at the White House, and Bacon stressed that the United States was not changing its policy against allowing military flights that would threaten Shi'ites or increase Iraqi military strength in the area.</p>
<p>&quot;My message is that we support people in exercising their religious liberties and in living out their religious convictions everywhere in the world ... But we don't want to see religion in effect used and distorted in a way to try to avoid international obligations,&quot; Clinton told reporters during a brief question-and-answer session.</p>
<p>&quot;We intend to continue to observe the no-fly zone and continue to support the embargo until he (Saddam) lives up to the conditions of United Nations resolutions,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a change in our policy,&quot; said Bacon, adding, &quot;We are not planning to make widespread exceptions for helicopters in the area.&quot;</p>
<p>In defiance of other Gulf War sanctions, Iraq flew a civilian plane to Saudi Arabia on April 9 carrying 104 elderly and sick pilgrims to Mecca for the haj pilgrimage.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council issued a statement calling on Iraq not to fly more planes without its consent, but stopped short of terming the April 9 flight a breach of the embargo.</p>
<p>Clinton had been asked whether he had a message for Saddam in light of Baghdad's decision to enter the no-fly zone. The Iraqi move raised a question as to whether the United States would attempt some sort of retribution for the defiance.</p>
<p>U.S. allies in the Gulf War have taken a more flexible stance on such issues recently and have been less insistent than Washington on strict enforcement of post-war sanctions.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said that if Baghdad was genuinely interested in the pilgrims, it would have sought a U.N. exemption to to travel through the no-fly zone.</p>
