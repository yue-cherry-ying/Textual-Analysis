<p>Sri Lanka vice captain Aravinda de Silva was unbeaten on 91 and looking for his 13th test century at tea on the first day of the second test against India on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka, put into bat, had made 216 for four with India's 21-year-old test debutant Debashis Mohanty claiming two wickets for 51.</p>
<p>De Silva, who compiled a masterly century in the drawn first test, was in a murderous mood. He drove, hooked and pulled Indian seamers for 15 boundaries to become only the second Sri Lankan to make 4,000 runs in test cricket after captain Arjuna Ranatunga.</p>
<p>He completed his half-century off 65 balls in 110 minutes with seven fours.</p>
<p>De Silva's past four test innings at home have produced scores of 168, 138 not out and 103 not out against Pakistan and, 126 against India earlier this week.</p>
<p>Mohanty did his country proud by capturing the wickets of world record partnership, Sanath Jayasuriya, who scored 32 and Roshan Mahanama, 37.</p>
<p>Both batsmen got outside edges to balls that were well pitched and moved slightly off the seam.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka also lost skipper Arjuna Ranatunga for 14, when he edged a delivery from part-time medium-pacer Saurav Gangly to wicket-keeper Nayan Mongia.</p>
<p>Ranatunga's dismissal ended a 71-run stand for the fourth wicket in 74 minutes with De Silva.</p>
<p>Mahela Jayawardena playing in his second test was undefeated on 15 at tea.</p>
