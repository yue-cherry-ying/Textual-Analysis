<p>June U.S. Treasury bond futures continued to tread water Friday above the previous day's low of 108-30, and technical analysts predicted more range-bound price action for next week.</p>
<p>&quot;This market is just going no place fast right now,&quot; said Steven Poser, senior technical analyst for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Poser said the 1-3/4-point range June bond futures had established so far this month was the narrowest monthly range since November 1989, when prices also kept within a span of just 1-3/4 points.  </p>
<p>So far in May, June bond futures have traded between 108-30, the low first reached on May 8, and 110-22, the high set on May 13.</p>
<p>Late in Friday's abbreviated session, June was trading 3/32 higher at 109-05.</p>
<p>Activity was hushed heading into the three-day Memorial Day holiday weekend. The market will close at 1210 CDT (1710 GMT) today and is shut on Monday.  </p>
<p>As June futures tested 108-30 several times on Thursday, intraday momentum indicators leaned to oversold, facilitating a slight bounce. With such tight trading ranges, market participants increasingly are focused on intraday signals, technicians said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are becoming much more sensitive to small moves,&quot; said Poser.</p>
<p>Rick Santelli, analyst with Rand Financial, said the critical area around 108-30 corresponds with a seven percent yield on the 30-year cash Treasury bond, which comes in roughly at 108-28.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is by far the key level, especially on a closing basis,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Poser said he looked for futures to press lower next week, to test channel support at 108-20 and below that support at 108-17. The latter level is the 50 percent retracement of the rise from April 11 low of 106-12 up to 110-22.</p>
<p>But the downturn also will be short-lived, he predicted, as daily stochastics, which are neutral now, shift to oversold around midweek, setting the stage for prices to zig back toward 109-12, today's session high, in the latter half of the week.  </p>
<p>&quot;It looks like we're setting ourselves up for a really slow period,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Santelli said the rapid drop in bond futures open interest over the past week, in conjunction with Federal Open Market Committee's decision to leave interest rates steady, suggests institutional hedgers are now looking for a range trade and therefore exiting their positions in derivatives.</p>
<p>Money managers are likely targeting a bond yield range between 6.80 percent and 7.10 percent to possibly 7.25 percent, Santelli added.</p>
