<headline>Lawyers ask military court to throw out sex case.</headline>

<p>The lawyer for an Army sergeant charged with rape urged a military court Tuesday to throw out his case because of what they said was undue influence by top military officials.</p>
<p>&quot;It would send a message to the Army leaders that there is a process and you have violated it,&quot; Maj. Mike Sawyers said in the second day of pre-trial hearings in the case of Staff Sgt. Delmar Simpson, who is charged with several counts of misconduct including rape, forcible sodomy and battery.</p>
<p>Simpson, whose trial is scheduled to begin April 7, would be the first of 10 soldiers charged with sexual misconduct at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground to go to trial.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, Army Trial Judge Col. Paul Johnston rejected a request by Simpson's attorneys to question top military officials such as Army Secretary Togo West and Chief of Staff Dennis Reimer about their public comments on the case. The hearing then recessed until Thursday.</p>
<p>Simpson's attorneys have also asked in pre-trial hearings that began Monday that charges against him be dismissed due to heavy pre-trial publicity, excess influence by higher-ups on the case, and lack of a speedy trial.</p>
<p>&quot;What we're trying to do is show an atmophere of undue influence,&quot; Sawyers said. He said rejection of the interview request could be a possible ground for appeal if Simpson is convicted.</p>
<p>Simpson's attorneys have been seeking to show that public comments by West and others in disclosing the sexual harassment scandal at Aberdeen last November prejucided the case and placed undue pressure on the investigation.</p>
<p>West and others made statements condemning the alleged acts, calling for &quot;zero tolerance&quot; of harassment in the military and pledging an aggressive probe.</p>
<p>The Army's investigation at Aberdeen has been marred by charges that investigators tried to coerce witnesses into making false allegations of rape and that the probe has unfairly targeted African American soldiers.</p>
<p>All 10 soldiers charged at Aberdeen are black. Army officials have denied the charges of racism and improper investigative techniques.</p>
<p>Sawyers said the comments by West and others reflected a military overly concerned with preserving its reputation from the type of damage that it sustained in the Navy's 1991 Tailhook sexual harassment scandal.</p>
<p>But Maj. Gen. John Longhouser, commander of the proving ground, denied in testimony that the Army's concern with sexual harassment had unduly influenced the investigation.</p>
<p>The Army's prosecutor, Capt. Theresa Gallagher, told the court publicity in the case made no difference in the decision to press charges against Simpson.</p>
<p>Of the 10 soldiers charged, four cases have been resolved, with the terms ranging from four months in prison to dismissal from the service. One soldier has appealed his conviction.</p>
