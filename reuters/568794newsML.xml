<p>The three leading Baltic business newspapers are to launch a pan-Baltic index of 30 leading shares on May 19, Estonia's business daily Aripaev said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The index will be called the Baltic 30 and has been calculated on a test basis since May 5, a spokesman for Aripaev told Reuters. Latvia's Dienas Bizness and Lithuania's Verslo Zinios are also involved in the compilation of the index.</p>
<p>He would not say which shares were in the index but that the choice had been made to represent various sectors.</p>
<p>Of the stocks only three were bank shares although the top five shares on the stock exchange are banks. Free market companies were also included in the list.</p>
<p>The newspaper index is the first pan-Baltic index. The Estonian and Lithuanian stock exchanges already have their own indices while local banks have calculated them for Latvia.</p>
