<p>NATO opened an historic summit on Tuesday with alliance leaders immediately locking horns over how far and how fast to go in embracing new members from the former communist bloc.</p>
<p>After negotiators moved close to an agreement overnight that would limit the first wave of newcomers to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, NATO leaders sat down behind closed doors to thrash out their remaining differences.</p>
<p>In what was shaping up as the most contentious NATO summit in years, U.S. President Bill Clinton came under fire from European allies incensed at his attempt to unilaterally dictate that the first round of expansion be restricted to the three favoured countries.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac pressed hard for admitting Romania and Slovenia, saying bluntly: &quot;Let us not take the risk of breaching the allies' cohesion or undermining the credibility of the alliance by excluding today two countries which meet the criteria which we ourselves set.&quot;</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi also expressed strong support for Slovenia, and Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis made a strong plea for Bulgaria, diplomatic sources said.</p>
<p>With leaders seated at a large round table, each had a chance to state his position. No consensus was reached, so the meeting was suspended and then reconvened in a restricted session with each leader accompanied by only his foreign minister and two aides.</p>
<p>A senior NATO diplomat said top negotiators made &quot;considerable progress&quot; overnight towards a deal to take in only the three candidates favoured by the United States in exchange for a strong commitment keep the alliance doors open to others.</p>
<p>NATO, formed nearly five decades ago as a bulwark against Soviet communism, was ready to open a new era in alliance history by accepting former foes from the now-defunct Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's meeting is the defining moment for NATO,&quot; alliance Secretary-General Javier Solana declared as he inaugurated the two-day summit at Madrid's Municipal Congress Centre. &quot;We will open the doors of this alliance to the first new members from central and eastern Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our alliance will emerge strong from Madrid and ready to assume all of the new tasks we have set ourselves,&quot; Solana said.</p>
<p>Following weeks of open bickering, Clinton was expected to come under strong pressure from European allies after unilaterally declaring he would accept no more than three new members in the first round.</p>
<p>NATO diplomats said the debate would give Chirac and Prodi a chance to vent their resentment over what they see as American heavy-handedness. But it was nonetheless all but certain to yield a consensus in support of Clinton's position, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an emerging consensus on three in return for a statement on the 'open door' and strong support for firm language on that 'open door',&quot; the NATO official said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's only going to be three new members because the U.S. wants three and they'll get it,&quot; a Spanish NATO diplomat said.</p>
<p>The French government, which had led a European charge to have Romania and Slovenia included in the first round, wants a strong statement from the alliance to give encouragement to future NATO aspirants.</p>
<p>But the Clinton administration, mindful of the opposition it will face when the Republican-led Congress begins debating NATO expansion, wants to avoid specific promises beyond pledging that the alliance will take in new members at some future date.</p>
<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who had bitterly opposed NATO's expansion but admitted he was powerless to stop it, chose not to attend. His signing of a landmark Russia-NATO cooperation treaty in May paved the way for enlargement while giving Moscow a voice -- but not a veto -- in alliance affairs.</p>
<p>Invitations to even three ex-communist states would be the biggest expansion in NATO history. Only once, in 1952, was more than than one new country admitted at once, when Greece and Turkey joined.</p>
<p>It would be the first push into the former East Bloc by a Western defence organization that was created out of the ashes of World War Two to contain the spread of Soviet communism.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters after a meeting with a bipartisan congressional delegation in Madrid for the summit, Clinton said he faced a challenge at home to win support for NATO expansion.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Clinton has dug in his heels about limiting NATO's growth, saying Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were the only applicants ready politically, militarily and economically to join the 16-member alliance.</p>
