<p>Human rights group Amnesty International has appealed to Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe to acknowledge that his army murdered thousands of civilians during an anti-government rebellion in the 1980s.</p>
<p>In a letter, a copy of which was faxed to news agencies on Friday, Amnesty also urged Mugabe to allow free debate on the alleged killings and gross human rights violations, saying this would help national reconciliation.</p>
<p>Mugabe, in his first public response this month to a church report alleging that an army unit he deployed in the 1980s against an armed rebellion murdered 3,000 innocent civilians and committed grisly atrocities, charged that the report was meant to cause trouble.</p>
<p>The report was submitted to him earlier this year by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. It called on the government to acknowledge that its North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade committed &quot;genocide&quot; in Zimbabwe's Midlands and Matebeleland regions between 1982 and 1987 while trying to crush rebels aligned to the then main opposition ZAPU party.</p>
<p>It also urged the government to compensate surviving victims of the alleged atrocities, which many local political analysts say were intended to punish Ndebele people who formed the backbone of political opposition to Mugabe's rule.</p>
<p>&quot;In this organisation's experience, when a state continues to deny its responsibility for atrocities committed by its security forces and suppresses open dialogue about human rights violations, a sense of impunity is created as the members of state agencies feel that they can abuse human rights without being punished,&quot; Amnesty said in its letter to the Zimbabwean president.</p>
<p>&quot;The survivors and the relatives of the dead or missing have the undeniable right to a full search for the truth, public identification of those responsible and compensation for their suffering and loss,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Amnesty International believes that true reconciliation comes from a process of justice being seen to be done, and from forgiveness based on a complete understanding by all the people of the abuses that have been committed and the wrongs suffered,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The London-based organisation made similar allegations to those of the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in 1989, which Mugabe's government also dismissed as a pack of lies.</p>
<p>In its letter to Mugabe, Amnesty said it should now be a lot easier for the government &quot;to acknowledge the truth&quot; because its human rights record had improved considerably in the last five years.</p>
<p>&quot;By taking decisive action, we believe that you could set Zimbabwe as an example for other countries where massive human rights violations were committed in a transitional period,&quot; it said, reminding Mugabe that he had vowed to ensure that wrongs of the past were never repeated.</p>
