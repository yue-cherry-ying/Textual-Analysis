<p>Precious metal markets were effectively marking time on Thursday until New York opened, although no fireworks were expected then either, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Ascension Day holiday in most of Europe ensured that early business was thin but the weaker dollar against the mark and yen brought in some interest, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $342.40 per ounce against $341.10 on Wednesday afternoon and a London close of $340.60/$341.10.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been a bit of customer business around this morning and the lower dollar brought some buying in from Japan,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>But the professionals were continuing to try to push gold lower, reflecting the bullion market's bearish feel, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The most we can expect today is to see gold back to the top end of its new range at around $343.50. There seems to be a slightly more positive feel in New York,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The authoritative Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd's (GFMS) Gold 1997 report published on Wednesday noted physical demand for gold was at very high levels.</p>
<p>But it also said the market was right to be cautious about selling from central banks and other institutions in the run-up to European Monetary Union.</p>
<p>&quot;Physical demand is good enough to take the market higher,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The potential impact from speculators was also likely to be to the upside, some dealers said. They noted that the funds had made money in gold earlier in the year and were not running unusually deep open positions now.</p>
<p>&quot;They tried to push it lower. Without a huge open position, the risk next time could be to the upside,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>In contrast, another dealer held that any move towards the top of the trading range had to be seen as a sell and a chance to increase short positions.</p>
<p>Silver was very quiet and rangebound, having been ignored since its bounce late last week. It was indicated at $4.75/$4.77, up three cents from the close.</p>
<p>&quot;The dealers are a bit wary about silver. You have to be spot on or you come a cropper here and most people this year have come a cropper,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Platinum and palladium were both firmer, at $375.25/$376.25 and $156.50/$157.50, up $3.50 and $1.50 respectively.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was concerned about the levels of backwardation in both metals which augured for volatile prices.</p>
