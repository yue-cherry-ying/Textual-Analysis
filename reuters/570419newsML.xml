<headline>35 dead in Turkey's Kurd rebel clashes.</headline>

<p>Turkey's security forces said on Thursday that 35 people, mostly Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas, had died in separate clashes.</p>
<p>The regional governor's office in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir said the fiercest clashes had taken place in Hakkari, near the rugged border with Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, where 25 rebels were killed.</p>
<p>Four other guerrillas died in Bitlis province, to the north, the statement said. Three PKK fighters and three members of an anti-rebel village militia died on Wednesday night when the rebels attacked a settlement in Silopi district.</p>
<p>More than 100 people died in two days of fighting between Turkish troops and Kurdish guerrillas that spilled just across the border into northern Iraq earlier this week.</p>
<p>A high-ranking security official said troops had entered Iraqi territory in the earlier fighting in pinprick raids but had later withdrawn.</p>
<p>More than 22,000 people have lost their lives in 12 years of conflict between troops and the PKK, fighting for Kurdish self rule in southeast Turkey.</p>
<p>The office said three policemen had been seriously wounded on Tuesday night when the rebels opened fire with automatic weapons on their car in the town of Sirnak, one of the region's main population centres.</p>
