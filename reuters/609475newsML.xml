<title>FRANCE: Consumer nations worry about oil supplies.</title>
<headline>Consumer nations worry about oil supplies.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS</dateline>
<text>
<p>Industrial nations said Friday they have &quot;serious concern&quot; about the security of oil supplies and urged governments to hold on to the spare stocks needed to guard against crisis.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency of 24 mainly Western nations said security also remained a priority, despite having to face fewer emergencies since it was founded to cope with a dramatic surge in producer prices in the 1970s.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the evolution of the oil markets towards greater competition, transparency and efficiency, oil security remains a serious concern, particularly given the prospect of increasing import dependence...and the increasing concentration of remaining oil reserves in the Middle East,&quot; said a communique issued by the IEA after high level talks.</p>
<p>The warning follows controversy over recent sales of U.S. government stocks and a drop in supplies held by private oil companies in an effort to economise.</p>
<p>IEA Executive Director Robert Priddle said the United States had reiterated recent pledges not to sell any more oil from its emergency Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>
<p>The communique urged IEA nations to maintain and improve emergency stocks.</p>
<p>The IEA requires members to hold oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net oil imports and release stocks in the event of serious market turmoil. The IEA only used the weapon once, at the start of the Gulf War in January 1991.</p>
<p>An IEA official said the United States has the equivalent of 75 days of imports in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve and, when including industry stocks that Washington partly controls, meets the IEA standard.</p>
