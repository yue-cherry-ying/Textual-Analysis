<p>Arsonists attacked the homes of three Protestants and set fire to a Protestant church on Tuesday in a spate of sectarian attacks at the start of Northern Ireland's annual &quot;marching season.&quot;</p>
<p>Police said Joel Patton, leader of a hardline Orange Order group, was one of three Protestants targeted in East Tyrone province, along the border with Ireland.</p>
<p>Arsonists poured petrol through the door of his home and then set light to it. No major damage was reported. In the other two attacks cars owned by Protestants were torched.</p>
<p>Patton has been at the forefront of moves to refuse to negotiate new routes for disputed Orange Order parades through Catholic, Irish nationalist areas.</p>
<p>The faction believes that to reroute marches is a concession to Irish republicans which will erode Protestant tradititions and dilute the province's British nature.</p>
<p>He accused the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which is fighting British rule of Northern Ireland, for the attack.</p>
<p>The marching season, during which Protestant orders display their pro-British loyalty through city centre parades, started on Monday with a peaceful parade which was voluntarily rerouted by the Orange Order to avoid passing through a Catholic area.</p>
<p>Police said they were treating as arson an attack on the Belfast Mount Pottinger Baptist Tabernacle in North Belfast which gutted the roof and caused severe damage.</p>
<p>The firebombing follows rising tension in the province after Protestant Loyalist guerrillas ended an October, 1994 truce and tried to bomb the Belfast offices of Sinn Fein, political wing of the IRA.</p>
<p>A Loyalist source told the media that the bomb attempt, which failed, was a &quot;measured response&quot; to a wave of IRA attacks including the bombing of a British railway line.</p>
