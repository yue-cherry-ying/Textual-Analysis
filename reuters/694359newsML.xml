<p>Angry soldiers loyal to Congo Republic President Pascal Lissouba prevented France's ambassador leaving Brazzaville's embattled city centre on Saturday, effectively trapping him in his embassy.</p>
<p>The soldiers, who were manning a roadblock, refused to let Ambassador Raymond Cesaire, other French diplomats and journalists leave the area in a convoy for the comparative safety of the ambassador's residence.</p>
<p>On the warfront, shelling subsided in the divided capital on Saturday, the day after after military commanders of the warring sides agreed a new week-long ceasefire.</p>
<p>But as during previous truces in a three-week showdown between Lissouba and his predecessor, former Marxist military ruler Denis Sassou Nguesso, some shooting continued as the rival forces jockeyed for position.</p>
<p>French diplomats played down the roadblock incident, which took place despite the presence of an official Congolese escort.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be going a bit far to say we are being prevented from leaving officially,&quot; one said, noting that the soldiers did not appear to be under full government control. &quot;It does not seem to be a deliberate attempt to keep us here.&quot;</p>
<p>The soldiers appeared to have no commander and an anti-French attitude. Journalists later made it out of the area.</p>
<p>Neutral mediators under mayor Bernard Kolelas, having seen previous accords fall apart, were cautious about the truce.</p>
<p>&quot;This was agreed orally but not in writing because we prefer that the population should be the ones who decide if the ceasefire really takes hold,&quot; an aide to Kolelas, whose own fighters have kept out of the conflict to date, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The ceasefires here are like fish -- good when fresh, then they go off,&quot; one French official in the city commented.</p>
<p>Cesaire tried to take advantage of Saturday's lull to make a dash to his residence, a former home of General Charles de Gaulle, in the calmer southern Bacongo suburb.</p>
<p>Former colonial power France protested to Lissouba last week after his men assaulted Cesaire, beat up his bodyguard and fired shots at his escort after a visit to the presidency.</p>
<p>Medical workers estimate that 1,000 to 3,000 people, mostly civilians caught in crossfire, have died since the clashes began on June 5 when Lissouba moved to disarm Sassou's &quot;Cobra&quot; militia in the run-up to a now suspended July 27 presidential election.</p>
<p>Civilians, fearing for their lives after battles in which the indiscriminate use of rockets and mortars has made anyone and everyone a target, jostled on Saturday to take trucks or buses out of the relatively unscathed southern suburbs.</p>
<p>This week dozens of shells, presumably strays, landed there.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands fled the city on Thursday and Friday after a battle to control the international airport ignited the heaviest artillery exchanges so far. Both sides claimed victory but a Western security official said the battle changed little.</p>
<p>&quot;I flew into the airport two days ago and have been there today. It is fully under Lissouba's control, as before, and the runway is usable -- if you can find anyone to fly in here,&quot; he told Reuters in the centre of the devastated city.</p>
<p>French diplomats confirmed the report.</p>
<p>Lissouba has pleaded for immediate military help from France via his ambassador in Paris.</p>
<p>Paris pulled out some 1,250 soldiers over a week ago after evacuating almost 6,000 foreign nationals, and has declined to supply troops for a proposed U.N. peacekeeping force.</p>
