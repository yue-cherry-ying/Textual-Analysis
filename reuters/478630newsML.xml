<p>Russia has introduced new aviation regulations which will improve passenger safety and assure Russian majority stakes in joint ventures with foreign partners, a Federal Aviation Service (FAS) official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Karl Ruppel, an aide to FAS director Gennady Zaitsev, told Reuters the new rules would regulate relations and services by all Russian companies involved in passenger and cargo aviation.</p>
<p>&quot;The main point of the rules is to guarantee safety for passengers who travel by air,&quot; Ruppel said.</p>
<p>The Air Code (Vozdushny Kodeks) consists of 137 articles.</p>
<p>Ruppel said the code, which replaces a Soviet version adopted in 1983, would bar majority foreign ownership in new joint ventures. The old rules did not allow foreign majority ownership either.</p>
<p>&quot;The new rules guarantee the Russian side will have 51 percent of shares if they set up a joint venture with foreign partners,&quot; Ruppel said.</p>
<p>He said the new code had been based on internationally-agreed standards.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this code could be called the constitution of Russian civil aviation,&quot; Ruppel said, adding Russia needed the rules to improve its position on international markets.</p>
<p>&quot;The rules are similar to international regulations,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Russia becomes the eighth country in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) to adopt its own aviation rules.</p>
