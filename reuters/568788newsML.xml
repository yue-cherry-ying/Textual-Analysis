<p>Low liquidity and a loss of faith among domestic investors have steadily been taking a bite out of Lithuanian shares but the bears may soon be attacked by bulls, an investment conference was told on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;For the short-term, the market will stay bearish...but in the long-term, it will certainly become bullish,&quot; Tomas Andrejauskas of Lithuanian broker Suprema told a conference on fund management and investment in the Baltics.</p>
<p>Lithuania's market, like Latvia and Estonia, has been volatile since the start of the year.</p>
<p>Prices soared to record highs in January but the trend, with a few hicups, has been downhill ever since.</p>
<p>Andrejauskas said that there were three main factors behind the market's volatility: low liquidity, a loss of confidence on the part of domestic investors and the bourse's order-driven system which fixes one price per day.</p>
<p>&quot;There is not enough liquidity in the market and confidence by domestic investors is down from earlier this year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts say January's bull run was speculative and fuelled by domestic investors, some of whom were in for a quick return.</p>
<p>But Andrejauskas said that things looked set to get better.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some very good opportunities right now while prices are undervalued,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are great opportunities to take part in the privatisation of large-scale companies...which will be listed on the bourse,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He also noted that macroeconomic factors bode well for the market's future.</p>
<p>&quot;Political instability is a thing of the past,&quot; he said, noting all major political parties were committed to reform.</p>
<p>He also noted that the country's economy was expanding while inflation was falling.</p>
<p>Lithuania's economy is believed to have grown by around 3.6 percent last year and the government predicts that it will increase a further five percent this year.</p>
