<headline>US 30-yr mortgage rate falls below eight pct.</headline>

<p>The average commitment rate on U.S. 30-year fixed rate mortgages in the week ending May 9 fell below eight percent for the first time since the end of March, Freddie Mac said Thursday.</p>
<p>Thirty-year mortgages averaged 7.94 percent in the May 9 week. The last time they dipped below eight percent was in the week ended March 28 when they stood at 7.97 percent, it said.</p>
<p>It was also a third consecutive weekly drop for 30-year rates. Last week the 30-year averaged 8.01 percent.  </p>
<p>Fifteen-year fixed rate mortgages also fell for the third week in a row to 7.47 percent from 7.53 percent the prior week, while one-year adjustable rate mortgages inched down a fourth consecutive week to 5.82 percent from 5.84 percent.</p>
<p>A year ago, the 30-year rate averaged 8.24 percent, the 15-year 7.75 percent and the ARM 5.80 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The markets reacted this week to the news of a balanced budget agreement between the White House and Congress,&quot; said Robert Van Order, Freddie Mac chief economist.  </p>
<p>&quot;The prospect of less government borrowing in the future takes pressure off interest rates, which accounts for the decline we see in these figures this week,&quot; Van Order added.</p>
<p>But many analysts expect another rise in interest rates when the Federal Open Market Committee meets May 20.</p>
<p>Last Friday the Labor Department reported a U.S. April unemployment rate of 4.9 percent, the lowest since an identical rate in December 1973.</p>
<p>Lenders charged an average 1.6 percent in fees and points on both 30- and 15-year loans, down from 1.7 percent last week. They charged 1.4 percent on ARM loans, unchanged from last week.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac is a corporation chartered by Congress that buys mortgages from lenders and packages them into securities for investors.</p>
