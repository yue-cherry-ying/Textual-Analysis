<p>NATO leaders have traced the borders of a new Europe by inviting Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to join the Western alliance, but doubts remain about their commitment to extend their zone of security and prosperity further to the east.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton, who prevailed over European allies who wanted a broader enlargement, hailed the dawn of &quot;a new Europe that is undivided, democratic and peaceful&quot;.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was born in Czechoslovakia and whose family fled the Nazi German invasion, was particularly emotional about seeing her former homeland invited to join NATO following the fall of communist rule.</p>
<p>NATO leaders vowed in a communique their door would remain open to other former communist states and they would review the expansion process in 1999, giving a special mention to Romania and Slovenia as deserving cases.</p>
<p>Completing their embrace of former Warsaw Pact adversaries and neutral states, the 16 leaders will sign a charter with Ukraine on Wednesday and hold the first session of a Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council with 27 partner nations.</p>
<p>The jubilant Polish, Czech and Hungarian leaders embraced and raised clasped arms in triumph at the NATO summit conference centre after receiving their invitations to join the defence alliance that won the Cold War.</p>
<p>Ironically, two of them -- Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski and Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn -- were once communists, although both now espouse democracy and the market economy. Czech President Vaclav Havel was a dissident author jailed by a Soviet-backed regime.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac, who with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi had led the campaign to bring Romania and Slovenia into the first wave, said those states had been given a clear perspective.</p>
<p>But diplomats questioned whether, despite the encouraging language, NATO would really be willing to admit more members in two years' time, when it celebrates its 50th birthday.</p>
<p>&quot;It may depend on the success of the first enlargement, and on how the European Union's parallel but slower moves towards enlargement are going,&quot; one alliance diplomat said.</p>
<p>EU officials said on Monday the executive European Commission plans to recommend next week opening membership talks with five eastern European countries along with Cyprus.</p>
<p>That group would include the same three who are to join NATO, plus Slovenia and Baltic state Estonia, but not Romania, deemed too economically backward, they said.</p>
<p>Uncertainty factors in the NATO expansion include the mood of a new U.S. Congress in 1999, whether Western leaders will be willing to upset Russia again by moving further east and whether Germany, once it is comfortably surrounded by new NATO allies, will be so keen to spend money on a further enlargement.</p>
<p>Diplomats noted that those allies pushing hardest for a more costly, broader NATO enlargement happened to contribute least to the alliance budget, of which the United States, Germany and Britain together pay well over half.</p>
<p>NATO officials say the lure of eventual membership is having a stabilising effect deep into eastern Europe, spurring old enemies to settle nagging border and minority issues and bring their armed forces under democratic civilian control.</p>
<p>They cited Romania's recent agreements with Ukraine and Hungary as examples of the &quot;virtuous circle&quot; created by the prospect of NATO and European Union enlargement.</p>
<p>The counter-argument is that foreign investors may be drawn only to those countries sure of being in the first wave of NATO and EU enlargement, widening the prosperity gap between the happy few and the other east European states.</p>
<p>NATO praised the growth of stability and cooperation among the states of the Baltic region but, to avoid angering Russia, stopped short of naming former Soviet republics Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia as potential alliance members.</p>
<p>Moscow, which grudgingly accepted the first enlargement when it signed the Founding Act of a new cooperative relationship with NATO in May, has since warned that any attempt to extend the Western alliance onto former Soviet soil would force it to rethink its entire attitude to the West.</p>
