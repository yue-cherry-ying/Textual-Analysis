<p>Dutch football authorities, politicians and police will meet on Wednesday to discuss a national strategy to combat resurgent soccer hooliganism, but the problem is already being tackled hard at local level.</p>
<p>The Home Affairs, Justice and Sports ministers will sit down with the Dutch soccer association (KNVB), regional police chiefs and mayors over an action plan aimed at curbing soccer violence, a home affairs ministry spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Police arrested around 100 supporters of first division clubs ADO Den Haag and Den Bosch on Monday to prevent a repeat of the organised battle between Ajax Amsterdam and Feyenoord supporters on March 23, which left one Ajax gang leader dead.</p>
<p>The killing stirred nationwide debate, with calls to tackle hardcore supporters, like Ajax's &quot;F-side&quot; and Feyenoord's &quot;Row S&quot;, as organised criminal gangs.</p>
<p>The Easter Monday match in Den Bosch was seen as the first high-risk clash since the incident.</p>
<p>&quot;We wanted to set an example. Fighting had to be avoided at any cost and we succeeded,&quot; Den Bosch mayor Ton Rombouts said. &quot;I'm glad our team won 2-1, but even more that the police beat the hooligans 5-0.&quot;</p>
<p>Dutch media reported that the teams' fans had posted challenges for a confrontation on the Internet last week.</p>
<p>Suspected Den Bosch ringleaders were arrested in pre-emptive dawn raids on Sunday, with weapons including knives, baseball bats and ice-picks found. Ten were still in jail on Tuesday suspected of membership of a criminal organisation, police said.</p>
<p>Hague police cancelled a special train scheduled to carry around 300 fans to the game after scuffles in the city's central station. Forty-three supporters were arrested, with 20 still in jail on public violence charges.</p>
<p>Travelling fans were stopped and searched at checkpoints on major roads into Den Bosch, with 65 arrested for possession of weapons or drugs, or failure to identify themselves under emergency regulations passed by the town council.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important difference in our strategy on this occasion was the greater cooperation between our forces,&quot; a Hague police spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There were Hague officers in Den Bosch who were able to recognise troublemakers from our side.&quot;</p>
<p>Pictures of the match showed a handful of ADO fans watching from an almost empty visitors stand, under the eyes of a much larger contingent of white-helmeted riot police.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that most of those who misbehaved were arrested,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;We hope they realise now how difficult things can be for them.&quot;</p>
