<headline>WMX, angry shareholders to square off at meeting.</headline>

<p>After trading charges in the media for months, WMX Technologies Inc. and dissatisfied major shareholders are scheduled to face off Friday at the company's long-awaited annual meeting.</p>
<p>Angry investors in the largest U.S. garbage hauling concern said they plan to attend the afternoon gathering in Oak Brook, Ill., and to press management on several issues.</p>
<p>Whether a floor battle will result appeared uncertain, however, due to recent defensive moves by the company, Wall Street analysts say.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it will be uneventful,&quot; said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell industry analyst Mari Bari.</p>
<p>After months of demands from investors for better returns, WMX on Feb.4 announced a sweeping restructuring plan. Two weeks later, Chief Executive Phillip Rooney resigned under pressure. On April 18, Chairman Dean Buntrock said he would quit the company upon appointment of a new CEO.</p>
<p>&quot;All this doesn't mean there won't be some angry presentations (at the meeting), but there's going to be a lot less bite in it,&quot; said Argus Research analyst James Kelleher.</p>
<p>Shares in WMX rose $1.125 to $31.25 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.</p>
<p>Perhaps in vain, analysts said they hoped WMX would use the meeting as a timely forum for naming a new CEO. &quot;The timing would be great. It seems, though, that it's early ... I'm not hearing a thing on it,&quot; said Smith Barney analyst Leone Young.</p>
<p>In the vaccum created by Rooney's surprise departure more than six weeks ago, analysts said employee morale at WMX has suffered and key mid-level managers are restless. &quot;The resumes on other companies' desks are a foot thick,&quot; Bari said.</p>
<p>The stock has moved off nine-month lows since an April 21 first-quarter earnings report which, although flat on a year-over-year basis, at least met Wall Street expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;We do think the stock could go up some when they announce the CEO,&quot; Bari said. &quot;But we find the shares fairly valued on a fundamental basis over the long term.&quot;</p>
<p>Major investors who said they plan to attend Friday's meeting include a group led by U.S. financier George Soros, as well as Lens Fund, a Washington, D.C.-based investment group.</p>
