<p>Legislation aimed at barring unauthorised South African mercenary activities abroad is expected to be tabled in parliament before year end, foreign minister Alfred Nzo said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Replying to a question in parliament on the issue, Nzo said he was working with other ministries and the National Conventional Arms Control Committee to prepare the legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;The Department of Foreign Affairs has, on a number of occasions, strongly expressed its concern at the activities of South African-based companies involved in activities of a para-military nature elsewhere on our continent and abroad,&quot; Nzo said.</p>
<p>Cabinet in April said it would rush through the legislation which will include a penalty of up to 10 years or a fine of one million rand ($225,000) for any group or individual found to be operating mercenary activities abroad, without authorisation from the government.</p>
<p>It said companies and individuals wanting to offer any military-related services abroad -- the best-known is Pretoria-based Executive Outcomes -- must in future seek government approval and receive the authorisation before entering into contracts.</p>
<p>South African courts will have the jurisdiction to enforce the law, regardless of where an offence is committed. Asmal said a public register would be drawn up, and even universities offering advice abroad were not exempt.</p>
