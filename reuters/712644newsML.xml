<p>Congo's President Laurent Kabila signed cooperation and trade agreements with Namibia's leader Sam Nujoma in Windhoek on Tuesday at the end of his first state visit to the country.</p>
<p>The agreements are the first bilateral accords between Namibia and the new rulers of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire.</p>
<p>Kabila, accompanied by his ministers of economy, mining, finance and national reconstruction, said future relationships between the two countries would focus on economics.</p>
<p>&quot;The main objective is cooperation and integration of our economies,&quot; Kabila told reporters.</p>
<p>He said he had discussed with the Namibian government the possibility of tapping water from Zaire's Congo River to drought-ridden Namibia.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't reached agreement, but I think it is possible it can be achieved in a few months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The new Congo's leader said his country was eager to join the 12-member Southern African Development Community (SADC) trading bloc including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia, Malawi, Angola, Namibia, Mozambique, Mauritius, Swaziland, Lesotho and Tanzania.</p>
<p>He did not say if his country had officially requested membership of the SADC.</p>
<p>&quot;By joining the SADC we will put our country in a position to assist other countries in development, and also to have a big market with 55 million people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Congo's new government is keen to foster good relations with its neighbours in southern Africa to help rebuild the country left bankrupt by its former ruler Mobutu Sese Seko, desposed in May after a seven-month military campaign against Kabila's rebels.</p>
