<p>A radiation leak at a Russian research centre that makes nuclear weapons badly injured a worker on Tuesday, the Nuclear Energy ministry said.</p>
<p>The Communist Party said its leader Gennady Zyuganov had been touring the centre at the time and had to cut short his visit.</p>
<p>The ministry denied anyone had been evacuated apart from the victim and said radiation levels outside the room where he was working were normal, but a spokeswoman for the emergencies ministry said the area nearby had been cleared.</p>
<p>&quot;At 10.50 (0650 GMT) on June 17, a serious violation of regulations in one of the pieces of equipment in section number eight of Arzamas-16, caused an irregular radiation situation involving the emission of neutron rays,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;One man who worked there, he was taken to the local clinic,&quot; ministry spokesman Vitaly Nosonov said by telephone. &quot;He's not in a good way. He received a pretty big dose, a high dose and a high dose is 600 roentgen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As for the rest, given that there is a certain level of radiation in the room, they are now de-contaminating it and a commission has left (Moscow) which will deal with this issue,&quot; Nosonov added, saying he did not know what caused the incident.</p>
<p>The statement said radiation levels outside the room and in the town, which is about 50 km (30 miles) from Nizhny Novgorod on the Volga River, were normal.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the authorities in Nizhny Novgorod said she had not heard about the incident.</p>
<p>At Communist Party headquarters in Moscow, an official said Zyuganov had been campaigning at Arzamas on behalf of a local candidate for a June 29 gubernatorial election in Nizhny Novgorod, 350 km (220 miles) from Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;He was in Arzamas-16, not far from the site of the incident and he was asked to leave the town, cutting off his visit, which he did,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>An official working for State Atomic Inspectorate said the plant was not under its control since it was a mainly military research centre, one of two in Russia which designs and builds nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The town, closed to foreigners, has a population of about 80,000. &quot;There was no evacuation of the city as a whole, there was a partial evacuation of the centre itself,&quot; the emergencies ministry spokeswoman said.</p>
