<p>Singapore gas oil swaps were steady at midday on Thursday after strong support in the physical market amid firmer crude prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Gas oil is holding its own at this level after the new buying interest late yesterday,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>May gas oil swaps were last quoted $25.30/$25.40 per barrel, largely unchanged from Wednesday, brokers said.</p>
<p>June was quoted down 10 cents at $24.80/$24.90. June traded earlier in the day at $24.85, they said.</p>
<p>The May/June spread is narrowing in line with the flat physical market with the backwardation now valued at about 50 cents with 50 cents traded on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the physical market, a European refiner sold to a local trader one cargo at $25.25 per barrel for June 2-6 lifting, and another European trader sold to a Japanese trader at $25.20 for May 22-26 lifting, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders' willingness to buy cargoes at these levels gave the swaps fresh impetus to strengthen after drifting sideways early week.</p>
<p>Traders said the firmer sentiment was also due to stronger overnight crude with June Brent closing up nine cents to $18.16 per barrel.</p>
<p>The jet fuel/gas oil spread or regrade edged down on market expectations of sustained selling from refiners in the face of weak enduser demand.</p>
<p>June regrade was last quoted at 40/60 cents down from Tuesday's 50/60 cents, brokers said.</p>
<p>Fuel oil swaps were steady with May last quoted unchanged from Wednesday at $100.00/$101.00 per tonne.</p>
