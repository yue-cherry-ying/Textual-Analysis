<p>The National Bank of Poland may again tighten its monetary policy because commercial banks are not sufficiently raising credit and deposit rates after last week's official interest rate increase, a NBP official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still waiting for the reaction of (the state savings bank) PKO BP, but basically we already know that the hitherto (rate) increases in commercial banks are too small,&quot; the Rzeczpospolita daily quoted NBP monetary policy head Jerzy Stopyra as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;We may use other (monetary policy) instruments,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Stopyra said the central bank could open deposit accounts for the public, create credit ceilings for commercial banks, increase obligatory reserves or further up intersest rates.</p>
<p>On August 4 the NBP increased its lombard rate by two points to 27 percent and discount by 2.5 to 24.5 percent.</p>
<p>He said that as a result of the official rate rise commercial banks increased their credit rates by between one and 1.5 points but that they barely changed their deposit rates, which was alarming.</p>
<p>He said the reaction has so far been too small to curb credit expansion ahead of the upcoming wave of cash outflow caused by flood-relief credits.</p>
<p>&quot;In the nearest several months funds for people hit by the flood will be paid out and (flood) credits will start. So the worst may still be ahead,&quot; the daily quoted Stopyra as saying.</p>
<p>Stopyra said that according to very preliminary NBP estimates broad money supply in July increased by 6.2 billion zlotys or four percent. Troublesome credit action grew about 2.3 billion, or 2.5 percent, last month, he added.</p>
