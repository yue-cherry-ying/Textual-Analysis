<p>An earthquake measuring up to 6.2 on the Richter scale hit northern Chile and southern Peru on Tuesday, causing landslides and startling residents but there were no reported injuries, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;People were frightened and telephone service was interrupted but we have not received any reports of any damage,&quot; said Emilio Lorca, head of the seismology department at the Universidad de Chile.</p>
<p>Local radio also reported that the tremor had caused brief power cuts in several towns.</p>
<p>The tremor, which struck at 2:33 p.m. local time (1833 GMT), measured 6.2 and had its epicentre in the Atacama Desert east of the port of Arica, Lorca told Reuters.</p>
<p>An official at the Geophysical Institute of Peru said the quake and two aftershocks ranged in magnitude from 4.6 to five on the Richter scale.</p>
<p>The first quake was centred in the Pacific Ocean 20 miles (30 kms) southwest of Tacna, and the epicentre of the second, measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale, was 6 miles (10 kms) east of the city, he said. Tacna is about 840 miles (1,350 kms) south of Lima.</p>
<p>Valentin Quinones, a Peruvian civil defence official in Tacna, said the city suffered no major damage.</p>
<p>Peruvian radio dispatches said there were no immediate reports of injuries in the region.</p>
<p>The area is near two mines owned by U.S.-based Southern Peru Copper Corp., Peru's largest copper producer, where floods interrupted production early this year.</p>
<p>Southern officials said they were unsure if its operations in the region, including the Cuajone and Toquepala open-pit copper mines, had been affected. They said they had not received reports of damage or assessed the situation.</p>
