<p>Resolute Samantha Ltd was planning to bring its new Trident gold deposit in central Western Australia into production within a year, chief executive officer Michael Carrick said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The deposit, located in the long standing Marymia Venture, 200 km north east of Meekatharra, was one of several new deposits the company was actively examining, Carrick told the Bell Securities Emerging Gold Conference.  </p>
<p>Also under active development investigation are a &quot;brother or sister&quot; deposit at the Chalice mine, 60 km north west of Norseman in Western Australia, and the Gawler deposit in South Australia.</p>
<p>Carrick disclosed the near term time frame on possible production from the deposits in response to questions at the conference.</p>
<p>Exploration director Ross Kennedy spoke highly of the orebodies in each area.</p>
<p>Gawler a 50/50 joint venture with Dominion Mining was producing &quot;beautiful grades&quot;, he said.  </p>
<p>Resolutes development staff were examining the projects now, Carrick said.</p>
<p>Drilling at Gawler in the past quarter had changed the complexion of the deposit, Carrick said.</p>
<p>A series of other companies with interest in the Gawler area also spoke highly of recent drilling results.</p>
<p>Resolute's Marymia project is a joint venture between Resolute, 75 percent and Titan Resources NL, 25 percent.  </p>
<p>Kennedy said there was little doubt that the company's Obotan project in Ghana would produce an underground gold mine at some stage in the future.</p>
<p>Production from the area would commence in a month's time from &quot;magnificant&quot; Orebodies.</p>
<p>Construction of the plant was now virtually complete.</p>
<p>The Golden Pride prospect in Tanzinia was also producing &quot;real dream&quot; grades, he said.</p>
<p>Carrick said that Resolute's cash costs would decline in the current quarter to an anticipated US$220 an ounce.  </p>
<p>High cash costs in the last quarter were the result of once-off factors, he said.</p>
