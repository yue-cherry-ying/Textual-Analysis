<p>A New York glazier and one of his employees were indicted Monday for smashing store-front windows to drum up business, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Jason Harte, 28, of New Rochelle, N.Y., president of Crystal Glass Co., and salesman Gerry Montello, 34, of Brooklyn, N.Y., are charged with conspiracy, grand larceny and criminal mischief.</p>
<p>&quot;He was smashing glass, now he'll be smashing rocks in prison,&quot; Assistant District Attorney Daniel Castleman said in announcing the charges against Harte.</p>
<p>The two men are accused of breaking storefront windows worth more than $155,000 in some of Manhattan's premier shopping areas. The pair allegedly used hammers, slingshots and rocks in a window-smashing campaign that lasted from September 1996 until last month.</p>
<p>Another salesman, Gene Terrance Jones, 24, pleaded guilty June 3 to criminal mischief for breaking a window at a Madison Avenue salon.</p>
<p>Last July, Harte pleaded guilty to breaking more than $1 million worth of windows at such tony Manhattan stores as Cartier and Chanel, law enforcement sources said. He was sentenced to five years probation.</p>
<p>Authorities said the most expensive window broken in the most recent campaign was at a record store in midtown Manhattan. The damage was $91,000.</p>
<p>Harte and Montello face up to seven years in prison if convicted of the charges.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Harte's seven family glass companies had contracts with the victimised businesses to replace smashed windows.</p>
