<title>USA: Crews battle fire at Gulf of Mexico platform.</title>

<p>Crews on two supply boats equipped with water cannons were battling a fire from a well blowout at a Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas platform off the coast of Louisiana, officials said.</p>
<p>A drilling rig and production platform caught fire and a derrick collapsed in the blowout shortly after midnight Tuesday involving a cluster of wells operated by American Exploration Co. of Houston, a company spokesman said.</p>
<p>The blowout sent flames shooting 30 feet into the sky over several wells producing oil and natural gas in shallow waters about 115 miles off the coast of Cameron, La., American Exploration spokesman Frank Murphy said.</p>
<p>Fifty one workers were evacuated safely and crews from the company, along with federal regulators and firefighters from International Well Control were at the scene, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess right now people are assesing how to put the fire out and how to go from here,&quot; Murphy said.</p>
<p>A mile-long oil sheen from the blowout was dissipating, and little environmental damage was expected from the clean-burning, largely natural gas-fed fire, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;My understanding is there is considerable damage to the drilling rig and probably going to be significant damage to the production platform,&quot; Murphy said.</p>
<p>American Exploration acquired the field last year and had completed three in a series of production wells. The platform was producing 7 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and recently began production of 350 barrels of oil per day, which was expected to rise to 1,000 barrels per day, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The impact on us will be in delaying what we expected to be good oil production,&quot; Murphy said. &quot;What this event will do is delay what we had hoped will be a fairly substantial increase in oil and gas production in the second quarter.&quot;</p>
