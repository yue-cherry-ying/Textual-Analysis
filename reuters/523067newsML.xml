<p>Roman Catholic bishops from Africa ended a week-long meeting in Nairobi with a call to African leaders to intensify a search for a lasting solution to the crises in Zaire, Rwanda, and Burundi.</p>
<p>&quot;Despotic, corrupt and military regimes must be done away with if this continent is to regain its lost glory and reclaim its position among the civilised world community,&quot; they said in a statement on Saturday after the Symposium of the Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar.</p>
<p>&quot;In this direction the church in Africa will play its part.&quot;</p>
<p>Two cardinals, 10 archbishops and 33 bishops from all parts of Africa, chaired by Cardinal Bernadin Gantin of Benin, took part in the conference called to review and search for a solution to the ethnic crisis in Rwanda and Burundi and the civil war in Zaire.</p>
<p>They said they would send six bishops to Rwanda and Burundi, the centre of large-scale ethnic killings, to consult with church, religious and social bodies with a view to helping to solve the conflicts there.</p>
<p>&quot;We denounce and condemn ethnicity as an ideology that has brought untold suffering and misery to the sons and daughters of our beloved continent of Africa through genocide,&quot; the bishops said.</p>
<p>The statement made no reference to allegations that Rwanda's Catholic bishops failed to protect the victims when Hutu militias, soldiers and mobs massacred an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994.</p>
<p>The statement said African governments should cut spending on arms and instead use the money for education, health and other social services.</p>
<p>But the bishops said the Western world could not bury its head in the sand pretending not to see what is happening. &quot;They are solely to blame for the social strife in the Great Lakes region,&quot; they added, an apparent reference to the legacy of the colonial period in the region.</p>
<p>The statement also criticised the &quot;African elite&quot;, saying it had failed to find solutions to the continent's woes.</p>
