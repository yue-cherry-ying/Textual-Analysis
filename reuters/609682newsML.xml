<p>Indian call money was quoted in the 1.5-1.75 percent range in early trade Friday, the fortnightly reporting day for banks.</p>
<p>Banks do not normally borrow on reporting days as it increases reserve rquirements for the next fortnight.</p>
<p>Call money ended Wednesday at 4.75-5.0 percent.</p>
<p>The money market was largely inactive on Thursday as banks in the commercial capital of Bombay, where most of the money market business is done, and some other centres were closed for a local holiday.</p>
<p>Dealers said three-day money was quoted in a 3.0-5.0 percent range but no deals had been done.</p>
<p>&quot;Lenders are quoting around 5.0 percent and borrowers 3.0-3.5 percent,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank. &quot;We expect call money to open slightly higher, around 5.0-6.0 percent because of the bond auction.&quot;</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India auctions 30 billion rupees of three-year federal government bonds on May 28 and dealers fear outflows towards the issue will drain liquidity from the banking system and push call money rates up.</p>
