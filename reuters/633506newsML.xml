<p>Former Italian member of parliament and porn queen Cicciolina arrived in Rio de Janeiro on Tuesday to play the role of an adventuress who pretends to be a princess in a Brazilian soap opera.</p>
<p>&quot;I love to be here. This place is paradise on earth,&quot; the peroxide blonde sex symbol told reporters after posing for pictures atop a conference table in a long transparent pink gown with no underwear.</p>
<p>&quot;The people interest me. I've heard the men are real bullfighters and the women wear tanga bikinis that show the bum.&quot;</p>
<p>Hungarian-born Cicciolina (cuddles), whose real name is Ilona Staller, will be staying in Rio until June 10 for four days of filming for the &quot;Xica da Silva&quot; soap opera set in 18th century Brazil. She is acting in a soap opera for the first time.</p>
<p>&quot;She will play the part of the false Italian princess Ludovica, an adventuress who comes to Brazil pretending to raise money for a convent when all she really wants is too steal the money and run away,&quot; said soap opera director Walter Avancini. &quot;There will definitely be semi-nude scenes, maybe more.&quot;</p>
<p>Xica da Silva tells the true story of a slave girl by the same name who ends up marrying an aristocrat and representative of the Portuguese crown when Brazil was still a Portuguese colony.</p>
<p>Cicciolina, 45, who managed to get herself elected to the Italian parliament from 1987 until 1992 as a member of the Radical Party, said she wants to run for public office again in Italian parliamentary elections in two year's time.</p>
<p>Cicciolina, who once claimed that sex and orgasms could solve all the problems of the world, said she would promote the protection of children against abuse and raise the issue of child kidnappings by parents who had separated and lived in different countries.</p>
