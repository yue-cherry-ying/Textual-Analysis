<headline>China ship in Taiwan port after historic crossing.</headline>

<p>The first ship to sail directly to Taiwan from rival China in 48 years steamed into Kaohsiung port on Saturday, completing a historic crossing of one of the world's great political divides.</p>
<p>&quot;The Sheng Da is here,&quot; port tower control manager David Wu pronounced as the mainland-owned, Saint Vincent-registered Sheng Da passed a buoy marking the port's Taiwan strait boundary.</p>
<p>The fresh-painted 6,000-tonne ship briefly flew the flag of the Nationalist Republic of China that rules Taiwan. But the flag was removed as the ship berthed.</p>
<p>No other flags were visible, including the red and yellow five-star of the communist People's Republic of China.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm happy to be here,&quot; Sheng Da captain Xu Yaofeng said from a gangway as Taiwan port, customs and police officials clambered aboard to inspect its cargo, greeting some of the ship's 22 yellow-suited mainland crew.</p>
<p>The ship took 17 hours to sail the 300 km (185 miles) from the southeastern Chinese port of Xiamen and would spend just six hours in Taiwan, regarded by Beijing as a renegade province that must eventually be brought under its sovereignty.</p>
<p>The voyage was the first authorised crossing of the heavily-militarised ideological divide since 1949, when a civil war put communists in control of the Chinese mainland and the defeated Nationalists in exile on island Taiwan.</p>
<p>Within 90 minutes the Sheng Da was unloading its light load of containers, which must be forwarded to third countries.</p>
<p>Under Taiwan's longstanding rules banning direct links with its communist rival, the cargo could not enter Taiwan customs.</p>
<p>Taipei in mid-April gave a green light for five mainland carriers to start cross-straits service. Beijing reciprocated on Thursday with unprecedented approvals for six Taiwan firms.</p>
<p>A second mainland ship was due in Kaohsiung on Sunday, while the first Taiwan ship was not expected to cross until April 24, Taiwan and mainland port officials told Reuters.</p>
<p>The passage came amid deep uncertainty about the fate of far more important existing routes between Taiwan and Hong Kong after July 1, when Hong Kong returns to Beijing's control after a century and a half as a British colony.</p>
<p>Negotiators have yet to meet to sort out prickly sovereignty issues -- including whether Chinese-administered Hong Kong will give berth to ships flying Taiwan's Republic of China flag.</p>
<p>Taipei maintains that Taiwan-Hong Kong links should continue unchanged, warning that any interruption would have painful consequences for Taiwan and China.</p>
<p>Despite its symbolic importance, analysts called Saturday's crossing a timid first step with little economic impact but said it would increase pressure on Taipei to fully abandon its ban on direct shipping, aviation, communications and trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Because both sides are quite constrained by political tensions, neither side seems willing to make the first necessary concessions to establish true direct shipping links,&quot; said Chung Chin, a China-watcher at Taipei's Chunghua Institution for Economic Research.</p>
<p>Mainland cargoes must be processed for onward passage to third countries at Kaohsiung's new &quot;offshore transshipment centre&quot;. Similarly, Taiwan cargoes cannot be put aboard ships for direct passage to the mainland.</p>
<p>Taiwan has said warmer ties were needed before direct links could begin and has urged Taiwan firms to slow their huge investments in China, already valued at some US$30 billion.</p>
<p>Some 30,000 Taiwan firms that now have mainland projects say direct links would pare away what they call the needless extra costs of routing business &quot;indirectly&quot; via Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shipping analysts estimate that because of the restrictions, only about 200,000 20-foot equivalent units (TEU) of China transshipment cargo would enter Kaohsiung per year -- tiny when compared to the port's five million TEU annual throughput.</p>
