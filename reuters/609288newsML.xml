<title>USA: Great Lakes Aviation to resume flights.</title>
<headline>Great Lakes Aviation to resume flights.</headline>

<p>Great Lakes Aviation Ltd. said it will resume limited service Friday to five cities in Iowa and Illinois, operating as United Express, ending the airline's week-long voluntary suspension of service.</p>
<p>Great Lakes voluntarily suspended service May 16 when the Federal Aviation Administration told the carrier it faced a suspension of its operating authority due to flying &quot;unairworthy aircraft.&quot;</p>
<p>The carrier also said it plans to expand service into Lansing, Michigan, as early as Saturday.</p>
<p>Using two Beechcraft 1900Ds, Great Lakes is resuming service Friday afternoon with a round-trip flight from Spencer, Iowa, to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport with an intermediate stop in Waterloo, Iowa. The return flight will also stop in Mason City, Iowa. In addition, round-trip service will resume between Springfield and O'Hare, the carrier said.</p>
<p>The airline, which operates as United Express in the Midwest, as Midway Connection in the Southeast and as Great Lakes Airlines regionally, expects to gradually increase service as the company completes its inspections of the airline's fleet, which are monitored by the FAA, the company said.</p>
<p>Great Lakes shares closed down 2/16 at 1-1/16 Friday.</p>
