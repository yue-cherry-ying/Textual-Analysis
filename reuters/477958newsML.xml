<p>*Includes a loss of $1,430,885 as a result of a write-off due to a reserve established for a receivable from ServiceMax Tire &amp; Auto Centers, Inc. (&quot;ServiceMax&quot;), a portfolio company.</p>
<p>Stephen A. Ollendorff, Chief Executive Officer of Acorn, stated that the net asset value increased during the year from $2.56 to $2.91 per share, due primarily to the increase in the fair market value of Recticon from $12,500,000 to $13,900,000. He noted, however, that the fair market value of Recticon had been reduced from $15,000,000 to $13,900,000 during the last quarter because of the deferral of certain customer orders of four-inch wafers to the latter half of 1997.  However it was noted that Recticon was using its new equipment to solicit orders for five- and six-inch wafers.  Shipments could potentially commence in June of 1997.</p>
<p>Mr. Ollendorff stated that the profit of Automotive for 1996 was largely due to a settlement with a third party and tax benefit allocation and that Automotive incurred losses from operations of approximately $250,000 for the 1996 fiscal year.  Mr. Ollendorff added, however, that as a result of certain additional management changes, Automotive's goal was to achieve profitable operations in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Safe Harbor&quot; statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:  From time to time in both written reports and oral statements by Acorn's senior management, we may express our expectations regarding future performance of Acorn.  These &quot;forward-looking statements&quot; are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could turn out to be other than what senior management expected.
