<p>Western defence firms, scenting lucrative contracts from prospective new NATO members, have recently moved in force into central and eastern Europe, but defence analysts say they are likely to be disappointed.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no pot of gold out east, these countries are too poor,&quot; said one senior alliance official, responsible for arms purchases.</p>
<p>NATO defence procurement experts say they are sceptical of estimates by leading U.S. and European defence companies of a potential market in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary of between $5 billion and $10 billion over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>They say for political reasons NATO has emphasised these countries, set to be invited to join the alliance at a summit in Madrid on Tuesday, do not have to upgrade their armed forces to ensure membership.</p>
<p>&quot;The impact of enlargement will be absolutely minimal, these countries are too poor and are not being asked to embark on major rearmament programmes,&quot; the official added.</p>
<p>Last year, Poland's entire defence budget totalled only $3.1 billion. Recent estimates for replacing the country's air communications system put the cost at $1.3 billion over 15 years.</p>
<p>Hungary's military budget has decreased steadily over the 1990s and now stands at 98 billion forints ($520 million).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, defence experts say there are business opportunities in former communist Europe which the European defence industry, facing fierce competition from a spate of mergers by U.S. companies, desperately hopes to win.</p>
<p>The biggest immediate prizes are looming fighter aircraft purchases.</p>
<p>Hungary has said it plans to replace its fleet of ageing Soviet-built MiG-21 and MiG-23 fighters with some 30 new fighter planes at a cost of about $1 billion.</p>
<p>A consortium of SAAB and British Aerospace is trying to offer the JAS 39 Gripen, but U.S. giants Lockheed Martin Corp and McDonnell Douglas Corp and France's Dassault Aviation are also chasing the contract with F16/Cs, F18 Hornets, and Mirage 2000-5s respectively.</p>
<p>Recently, however, both Russia and Israel have entered the fray, offering a far cheaper alternative of upgrading 30 MiG- 21s for $150-$200 million.</p>
<p>Defence industry experts say that what few nuggets there are in the new members are likely to go to U.S. companies who have once again seized the initiative from European companies by offering small initial deals on the cheap.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Defence recently offered 11 former Warsaw Pact states financial support to set up new &quot;air sovereignty operations centres&quot; (ASOCs) to co-manage their civil and military airspace.</p>
<p>Last month Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic chose Lockheed-Martin to install the first centres.</p>
<p>&quot;The contract is small -- $10.5 million -- but the ASOCs are widely viewed as the central node out of which these countries' whole future air defence systems will grow,&quot; noted a report by independent defence analysts issued earlier this month on the future of Europe's industry.</p>
<p>It added that all five countries wanted to join NATO and were now likely to stick with products compatible with U.S. systems for future upgrades.</p>
