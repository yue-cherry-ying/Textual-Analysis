<headline>AAPC says unhappy with return on assets.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Hotel operator AAPC Ltd said on Thurday it was unhappy with the current return on assets and was looking at ways to improve returns.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not happy with the return on assets and investments are being reviewed to see that returns are maximised, and not just being used to grow the network,&quot; chairman David Baffsky told shareholders at the annual general meeting.</p>
<p>Baffsky said the focus must be on profitability rather than market share.</p>
<p>&quot;Market share at the expense of profit is not an option.&quot;  </p>
<p>The New South Wales state government's surprise introduction in its May 6 budget of a 10 percent accommodation levy - the so-called bed tax - came under fire with managing director Raymond Capdevila saying the tax was discriminatory and likely to see non-Sydney hotels reap considerable benefits.</p>
<p>The bed tax would apply from September 1 only on hotels, motels and guest houses in Sydney's central business district and nearby North Sydney just across Sydney Harbour.</p>
<p>&quot;It benefits hotels not in the Sydney area and was marked by a total lack of industry consultation,&quot; Capdevila said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is certain to divert some traffic to other centres. (Victoria state premier) Jeff Kennett will be licking his lips,&quot; Capdevila said.</p>
<p>Responding to a shareholder question about AAPC's dividend payout ratio, which dropped to 44 percent in 1996 from 85 percent in 1995, Baffsky said the ratio had been reduced to better balance the competing demands of institutional and private shareholders.  </p>
<p>&quot;The directors have, at this stage, said we will continue the dividend policy but have reduced (the payout ratio) to achieve a balance between the large and small shareholders,&quot; Baffsky said.</p>
<p>&quot;We recognise the importance of dividends to small shareholders but some of our institutional shareholders would prefer we don't pay dividends at all.&quot;</p>
<p>AAPC is owned about 22 percent by Accor SA of France.</p>
<p>By 12.20 p.m (0220 GMT), AAPC shares were a cent lower at 77 cents on light turnover of 42,471 shares.  </p>
