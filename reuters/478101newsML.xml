<p>A Wall Street truism dictates that high interest rates hurt stock prices, and with rates now on the climb, investors are about to face their most serious test of will in years.</p>
<p>Of course, no one knows how high the Federal Reserve will ultimately drive short-term rates or what effect the actions will have on long-term rates.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, analysts said stock prices are likely to face a growing multitude of perils, as each step up the rate ladder adds pressure on both earnings and price multiples.  </p>
<p>First, said Fahnestock &amp; Co chief investment strategist Joseph Barthel, there is plenty of evidence that Fed tightenings represent a market drag in and of themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;On a historic basis, the relative performance of the market has roughly halved during periods of rising Fed funds rates,&quot; Barthel said.</p>
<p>Since 1954, he said, the average six-month Standard &amp; Poor's 500 increase has fallen to two percent during such periods from an average of four percent when short-term rates were not rising.  </p>
<p>&quot;But it doesn't mean we're necessarily headed for a bear market,&quot; he added.  &quot;Perhaps the more profound point is that during rising interest rates, the market tends to separate the wheat from the chaff.&quot;</p>
<p>In fact, analysts said, higher long-term rates may well pose the more serious threat to the market, particularly when those rates stay stubbornly high.</p>
<p>Then, the situation becomes much more problematic, as slower economic activity cuts into corporate sales growth and higher rate expenses erode earnings at the cost level.</p>
<p>The problems do not end there.  </p>
<p>&quot;If you think in terms of using a discounted rate of return, higher rates mean you get a lower present value placed on future earnings,&quot; said Melissa Brown, director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;We view the relationship as being roughly for every percentage point move in rates, that gives you about a 90 basis point move (in the opposite direction) in price-to-earnings ratios,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Always counterbalancing investor decisions based on current rate levels is the market's shifting attitude about the future of rates.  </p>
<p>&quot;We know the sensitivity of P/E ratios to rates as such is negative,&quot; said Arun Kumar, strategist at Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>&quot;But right now, for example, the market is priced for another two interest-rate increases by the Fed,&quot; he said, &quot;and if those don't occur, the market will have room to improve.&quot;</p>
<p>Also, not every rate move is created equal, Brown noted, because reactions vary at different rate levels.</p>
<p>&quot;We know if you go from five to six percent it's different than when you go from six to seven percent,&quot; Brown said.  &quot;At seven percent, that could be a point where individuals feel they're getting a decent enough return&quot; to shift to bonds.</p>
<p>The burdens of high long-term rates explain why stocks sometimes tolerate higher short-term rates, because those can quell inflation fears and pull down rates at the long end.</p>
<p>So seems to be the case with increases in the Fed's discount rate.  Looking at 21 instances of initial increases to the discount rate since 1917, Barthel said the early impact of the moves has, as might be expected, tended to be negative.</p>
<p>&quot;But if you stretch out your time horizon, over the next 16 months, the returns on the S&amp;P have been 22 percent on average,&quot; he said. &quot;So despite the initial pressure, long-term they have proved to be constructive events for the market.&quot;</p>
