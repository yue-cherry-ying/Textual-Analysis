<p>Hong Kong on Tuesday unveiled plans for its first legislative election under Chinese rule which will adopt proportional representation and cut the voting population for some polls.</p>
<p>Under the plan, formulated by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa's cabinet, 20 seats of the 60-strong legislature will be directly elected from geographical constituencies by proportional representation, secretary for Constitutional Affairs Nicholas Ng said.</p>
<p>&quot;We anticipate that the first Legislative Council election will be held in the second quarter of next year,&quot; he said. Hong Kong will be divided into five constituencies, each with three to five seats depending on the size of population, he told a news conference.</p>
<p>This contrasted with arrangements in the last legislative election in 1995 where the territory was divided into 20 smaller geographical consistencies, each with one seat.</p>
<p>Under the new system, pro-democracy parties are unlikely to repeat their strong 1995 showing in which they won the largest bloc of seats in the ousted colonial assembly, which was replaced by a provisional chamber upon Hong Kong's handover.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party condemned the proposals as &quot;targeted at democrats&quot;.</p>
<p>In a statement, party chairman Martin Lee said: &quot;Broadly speaking, it is clear that the entire point of all of the changes is to ensure that the Democratic Party -- which won the largest number of seats in the 1991 and 1995 legislative elections -- will be reduced to a tiny minority in the council. This represents the beginning of the 'Singaporisation' of Hong Kong, where there are so-called 'elections' -- but the results are always what the government wants.&quot;</p>
<p>A recent poll conducted by the party last month showed 41.4 percent of Hong Kong people indicated they do not want to change the existing voting system, the statement said.</p>
<p>But Ng defended the plan, saying there had been criticism the former system yielded results that could not reflect the public's view.</p>
<p>&quot;The basic idea for the proportional representation system is that electors' views can be fairly reflected in the election results and thereby in the allocation of seats,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that this particular method will be able to yield fair and open results,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>China recovered Hong Kong at midnight on June 30, ending 156 years of British colonial rule.</p>
<p>It scrapped the territory's legislature that was elected in 1995 and replaced it with an appointed provisional chamber which operates until the new legislature is elected.</p>
<p>Under the new electoral plans, functional constituencies will return 30 seats, of which 21 will be for the 21 existing functional constituencies and the remaining nine for new ones.</p>
<p>Voters in most functional constituencies will be corporate bodies instead of employees of companies in those sectors, as in the 1995 elections.</p>
<p>&quot;Reshaping of the functional constituencies, particularly the nine new functional constituencies in the current makeup, would confine the voters...to the corporation-based or organisation-based (system) or membership of professional bodies,&quot; Ng said.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the new arrangements would mean a reduction in the number of voters in the functional constituency polls.</p>
<p>But he added the largest number of voters would fall in the geographical constituencies, where electors were expected to increase. &quot;Every year, we have additional voters registered under the geographic set-up,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the new electoral plan, another 10 legislators will be elected from an election committee formed with 800 permanent Hong Kong residents from different sectors, Ng said.</p>
<p>The elective college will include all provisional legislators and Hong Kong deputies to China's National People's Congress, or the Chinese parliament.</p>
<p>Ng said he aimed to submit a bill covering the electoral arrangements into the provisional legislature for first reading before the end of August.</p>
