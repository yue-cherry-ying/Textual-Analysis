<title>CROATIA: Croatian stocks lower, seen slipping further.</title>
<headline>Croatian stocks lower, seen slipping further.</headline>
<dateline>ZAGREB 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Most Croatian stocks hit lower levels in lacklustre activity on Thursday and traders said prices were bound to slip further amid little buying interest.</p>
<p>&quot;The market looks pessimistic and there is no sign of any wind of change,&quot; said Marko Nikolac of Metroholding brokerage.</p>
<p>Another trader, Nenad Pavletic at the second most active brokerage Auctor, also said the most heavily-traded stocks that could pull the market up were not poised for growth.</p>
<p>&quot;It would not be logical for (drugs firm) Pliva and Zagrebacka Banka to rise, since their Zagreb prices are the same or even higher than in London,&quot; Pavletic said.</p>
<p>Pliva edged down six kuna at 472 on volume of 717 shares and Zagrebacka lost 20 kuna to 2,100, trading 1,308 units.</p>
<p>Pliva nudged lower to $15.95 and Zagrebacka to $35.125 in London.</p>
<p>Traders said Zagrebacka had more chances to reverse the downward trend before the bank closes the shareholder register ahead of its dividend payment.</p>
<p>The most active issue, food processor Podravka, edged down five kuna to 295 with 1,894 units sold. Traders attributed its steady slippage to disturbing rumours about 1996 results.</p>
<p>But Nikolac could not foresee new losses for either Podravka or confectioner Kras and hotelier Laguna, since their current prices were already &quot;pretty low&quot;.</p>
<p>Ten of 17 active issues fell, two rose and five were flat on Thursday. Volume was slightly lower at 6,850 units, while turnover was flat at 5.7 million kuna.</p>
<p>Kras inched down five kuna to 410, with 289 units sold. Laguna lost five kuna to 1,430, with 227 shares changing hands.</p>
<p>Biggest gainer electric manufacturer Koncar added 50 kuna or four percent to 1,300 on volume of 106 shares.</p>
<p>Top decliner textile firm Varteks lost 10 kuna or 11 percent to 80 kuna, selling 220 shares. Traders said the stock was unlikely to pierce the psychological barrier of 90 kuna despite a recent announcement about winning a new production licence for Levi's jeans.</p>
<p>Fully-listed Varazdinska Banka ordinary shares dipped 100 kuna to 44,400 on volume of 15. Its bearer stock was flat at 1,200 kuna with 36 units sold.</p>
