<p>Top seed Richard Krajicek and outsider Lionel Roux won hard fought victories on Saturday to earn places in the men's singles final of the $1.22 million Japan Open.</p>
<p>A ruffled Krajicek said his 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 victory over Australian Patrick Rafter had been been a struggle against an improved Rafter service.</p>
<p>&quot;I really had a tough time today. I remember the last time I played him I broke him four or five times. This time I only broke him once,&quot; the world number six said. &quot;Except for the tiebreak I didn't really think I was getting on to his serve. I wasn't reading it well and he was mixing it up very well,&quot; Krajicek added.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old from Rotterdam, who broke Rafter's serve at 4-3 in the second set, had to fight hard against an opponent who shares a similar style of powerful serve and volley play. &quot;I think we have a similar game and this may sound a bit arrogant but I think I play it better than he does... My only strategy was to try to pass him and look for the backhand,&quot; Krajicek said.</p>
<p>In Saturday's second men's singles semifinal, 16th seeded Frenchman Lionel Roux beat fifth seed Thomas Johansson 4-6 7-5 6-3 in an aceless and gruelling baseline match. &quot;If Krajicek is serving at his best it will be very difficult. But in every match there is a chance to break the serve of even the best server,&quot; Roux said.</p>
<p>In the last women's semifinal match, fourth seeded local favourite Ai Sugiyama knocked out second seed American Kimberley Po 5-7, 6-4, 6-1.</p>
<p>Sugiyama said Po's precise baseline style had spurred her on to produce winners.</p>
<p>&quot;I wait until I'm under pressure for the winners to come out. For that I have Po to thank,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Po said she was less in control than the two previous times the pair have faced each other. &quot;Ai was a little more aggressive today, definitely dictating more of the points than I would have liked. I think I made too many errors today but I just noticed her shots were more angled than the previous times we've played and she returned a lot better today,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Sugiyama goes on to play Po's close friend and top seed Amy Frazier in the women's singles at Ariake Tennis Park near Tokyo Bay on Sunday.</p>
