<title>UK: LONDON PRECIOUS METALS POP HIGHER, LED BY SILVER.</title>
<headline>LONDON PRECIOUS METALS POP HIGHER, LED BY SILVER.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Silver raced higher on Friday afternoon, catching most of Europe short ahead of the long holiday weekend and giving a modest boost to the other precious metals.</p>
<p>A spate of physical and fund buying at silver's lows around $4.66 an ounce triggered technical &quot;buy stops&quot; around $4.72, traders said.</p>
<p>The white metal shot up to as high as $4.79, before coming off the boil. It was last trading somewhat off the highs at $4.75/$4.77, but still up seven cents from Thursday's London close.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like people were caught in a bear trap,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sentiment has been terrible with the PGMs (Platinum Group Metals) coming off this week, but people were also short gold and silver without the same fundamental backing,&quot; another added.</p>
<p>Last Friday silver prices had moved sharply in the opposite direction when speculative selling hit the market.</p>
<p>But over the past three days it had moved in a relatively tight range, holding above the $4.66 support level.</p>
<p>In the other precious metals markets, gold firmed slightly with silver and fixed at $342.55 an ounce, from $341.65 in the morning.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected gold prices to mark time in a narrow band within the $340-$345 range for the rest of Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's done for the day. With London and New York closed on Monday people are going to head home early today,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>U.S. and U.K. markets will reopen on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Platinum and palladium were also off the day's lows after sharp tumbles in the Far East and early Europe, although sentiment was still bearish.</p>
<p>&quot;Frankly they still look ghastly,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Palladium picked up off its nadir of around $167 and was last trading at $170.75/$171.75, down $4.00.</p>
<p>It had come under intense selling pressure in the Far East due to a weaker yen and news this week that long-delayed talks between Russian suppliers and Japanese consumers were due to start next month.</p>
<p>Platinum similarly was last at $388.00/$389.00, off $1.25. --Lida Poletz, London newsroom +44 171 542 2936</p>
