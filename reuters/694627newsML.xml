<p>An Australian firm is to build a $1 billion hydroelectric dam in Nepal, making it the Himalayan kingdom's biggest-ever foreign investment project, Nepali officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>They said the Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation (SMEC) based in Cooma, New South Wales, would build the 750-megawatt (MW) West Seti dam in west Nepal.</p>
<p>When complete it would be the largest hydro dam in Nepal, SMEC's managing director Bill Bultitude.</p>
<p>Nepal will receive 10 percent of the electricity generated free, or the equivalent amount of gross revenue, and royalties on gross power generation from the Australian company. The rest of the electricity will be exported to India.</p>
<p>Two of India's biggest states, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, face an acute shortage of electricity and share a 1,500 km (930 mile) border with Nepal.</p>
<p>&quot;We are negotiating with state electricity boards in India for export,&quot; Bultitude said.</p>
<p>He told Reuters that his company would tap international financial institutions to fund the project.</p>
<p>The plant would tap only 0.5 percent of the country's total hydroelectric potential of 83,000 MW.</p>
<p>Nepali officials said exporting electricity to India was the kingdom's only hope of bridging a $380 million trade deficit with New Delhi.</p>
<p>India and Nepal signed an agreement on private electricity sales early this month in Kathmandu during a visit by Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral.</p>
<p>&quot;This opens the door for the export of electricity to India,&quot; said Bijay Shankar Shrestha, executive director of Nepal's Electricity Development Centre.</p>
<p>Nepali officials said West Seti will begin operating in 2004, and its ownership will revert to Nepal after 30 years.</p>
<p>Officials added that the Australian firm will be the single largest investor in Nepal, and its progress will determine the future of other foreign investment in Nepal.</p>
<p>Nepal is one of the world's 10 poorest countries, and tourism and hydropower are two key areas in which the government is trying to attract foreign investment.</p>
