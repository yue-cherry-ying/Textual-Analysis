<p>French stocks firmed on Friday, the last trading day before the first round of the legislative elections, as equities investors bet on the conservatives.</p>
<p>Most traders expect the bourse to rise to new highs if the centre-right wins or slide as much as 10 percent if the Socialists and their allies get control of the parliament.</p>
<p>They also cautioned that, whatever the final outcome, there may be bumpy moments between Sunday's first round and the runoff vote on June 1. &quot;If the Socialists' share of the vote is high on Sunday, we'll see a negative knee-jerk reaction,&quot; said Merrill Lynch strategist David Bowers.  </p>
<p>On Friday the blue-chip CAC-40 index finished up 21.25 points, or 0.78 percent, at 2,762.90, recouping half its fall on Thursday. The futures contract rose 25 points to 2,759. Traders said the bourse was helped by higher bond prices.</p>
<p>Volume was 8.79 billion francs, swollen by trades related to the monthly settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;Our view is that the conservatives will squeak home in the second ballot,&quot; Bowers said. &quot;The first ballot can be highly misleading. Fewer than 10 percent of the seats will be decided this weekend. We're advising clients to hold their fire until the second round. It's the second round that's all-important.&quot;  </p>
<p>The results of Sunday's vote may obscure the picture, say political analysts. They predict that the combined left will win the highest first-round score, but lose to the centre-right in the runoff. They say the shift occurs because supporters of the far-right National Front tend to switch to conservative candidates in runoffs where Front candidates are absent.</p>
<p>Jacques Chahine, who heads his own market consulting firm Jacques Chahine Finance, estimates the CAC may rally to 3,000 points if the conservatives win the two-round election. &quot;People have partly priced in a victory for the Right,&quot; he said. If the conservatives lose, the CAC could fall to 2,400-2,450 points.  </p>
<p>Some brokers told clients to protect themselves against a possible shock on Monday, when thin liquidity due to the closure of U.S. and British markets is expected to heighten volatility.</p>
<p>Credit Lyonnais senior bond analyst Iain Lindsay told Reuters, &quot;In percentage terms, 37 percent or less for the centre-right in the first round would be dangerous territory and a real cause for concern for the markets.&quot;</p>
<p>Opinion polls released prior to a blackout suggested the centre-right would take between 37.5 and 40 percent, neck and neck with the Socialists and their allies, while the National Front would pick up 13-15 percent.  </p>
<p>Official results will not be known until early on Monday, but polling firms are expected to begin projecting first-round scores after 2000 local (1800 GMT).</p>
<p>Among the active shares on Friday, Elf-Aquitaine rose 1.63 percent to 623 francs after announcing it would buy back a 0.7 percent stake sold by insurer Axa's UAP-Vie subsidiary. Elf said on Thursday it would buy back a 0.9 percent stake sold by Renault. Traders said the stock rose on short-covering.</p>
<p>Renault and Michelin bounced back after sharp falls on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Renault shares rose 4.13 percent to 153.90 francs, and Michelin rose 4.47 percent to 348.50.</p>
<p>Certificates in Credit Lyonnais jumped 5.24 percent to 233.10 francs after the state-owned bank said first-quarter pre-exceptional results rose and Prime Minister Alain Juppe said the bank's privatisation could be accelerated, brokers said.</p>
<p>The CAC index finished down 0.77 percent for the week but gained 9.05 percent for the monthly account.</p>
