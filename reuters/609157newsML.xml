<p>Japan has rejected North Korean demands that Tokyo provide one million tonnes of food aid in exchange for allowing Japanese wives of North Koreans to visit their homeland, Jiji news agency reported on Friday.</p>
<p>The Japanese news agency said that the demand for the aid came in unofficial talks between Japan and North Korea held in Beijing on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry officials said they could not confirm that the talks took place and refused to comment on report.</p>
<p>Jiji said the Japanese official in the talks rejected the North Korean demand for food, saying it was not appropriate for Pyongyang to link food aid with the wives' issue.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Japan's top government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama said Tokyo would press North Korea to allow all of the estimated 1,800 Japanese women who moved to North Korea with their Korean husbands from the late 1950s to the early 1980s to visit their homeland.</p>
<p>&quot;The government strongly hopes that North Korea will respond to these problems,&quot; Kajiyama told reporters, listing the Japanese wives issue among Tokyo's other grievances with its Stalinist neighbour and former colony.</p>
<p>Tokyo has cited the issue of the wives, suspicions that North Korean agents have abducted at least 10 Japanese, and the recent seizure by Japan of a North Korean ship laden with illegal drugs as reasons why it has not responded to appeals for food aid to famine-stricken North Korea.</p>
<p>The issues have also kept Japan from establishing diplomatic ties with North Korea which Japan ruled from 1910-45. Japan and South Korea normalised ties in 1965.</p>
<p>Most of the Japanese women, whose husbands are descendants of Koreans who moved or were brought to Japan before World War Two, have not been heard from for years, and North Korea has not allowed the women to visit their families in Japan.</p>
<p>Widespread reports of serious food shortages in North Korea have added urgency to a long campaign by relatives for news of the women.</p>
