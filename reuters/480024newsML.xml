<p>Some spectators, including a famous lawyer, struggled to stay awake in the courtroom and the chief defence lawyer jokingly told a potential juror: &quot;You understand this is not the O.J. case.&quot;</p>
<p>Outside the courthouse, a lone demonstator paraded with a sign that could not be read, spouting a mumbo-jumbo of grievances that could not be understood, and there were rumours that a salesman had been shooed away for selling t-shirts without a license.</p>
<p>Everything and everyone seemed as civil and low-key as possible on Monday as 28-year-old disillusioned Army veteran Timothy McVeigh went on trial for his life, accused of planting the bomb that destroyed the federal building in Oklahoma City almost two years ago killing 168 people.</p>
<p>Colorado officials prepared for the trial as if for war. Concrete barriers surrounded the Federal courthouse --  a moat to keep out the enemy. Old-fashioned garbage bins disappeared so no one would be tempted to drop a bomb in them. Metal detectors seemed to sprout up everywhere.</p>
<p>The sign outside the courthouse said &quot;Spectators for USA Vs. McVeigh line up at this door.&quot; But there was no line. A couple of Denver militia members handed out pamphlets telling jurors how to set up their own courts, but there were few takers.</p>
<p>Inside the well-lit, windowless second floor courtroom where jurors were being selected for McVeigh's trial, the lawyers exhibited none of the hostility that marked the murder trial of O.J. Simpson.</p>
<p>And prospective jurors admitted under oath that they paid more attention to the Simpson trial than they did to the legal manoeuvrings that followed the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building, an event that shattered the illusion that Americans were safe from terrorism at home.</p>
<p>Barry Scheck, the DNA specialist for the Simpson defence team, was in court as a commentator for a TV network. He closed his eyes as if he was dozing or perhaps recalling the headier days of the &quot;Trial of the Century&quot;.</p>
<p>Chief defence lawyer Stephen Jones told one juror, &quot;You understand this is not the O.J. trial. What Judge Ito did, Judge Matsch might not do.&quot; Federal Judge Richard Matsch, known for running a court with an iron fist, did not laugh, but it seemed like everyone else in the court did, including McVeigh.</p>
<p>But a glimmer of a smile did cross the judge's face when Jones later told a juror that her stress was not unusual. &quot;You are not the only one to have heart palpitations and shortness of breath before Judge Matsch,&quot; he assured the woman, who said she had two nervous breakdowns in 22 years.</p>
<p>McVeigh seemed relaxed and smiled often for a man on trial for his life. One courtroom sketch artist called it his &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; smile. Another called his close cut haircut &quot;the Heaven's Gate&quot; look -- a reference to the cult whose members committed mass suicide last week.</p>
<p>Despite the calmness of the legal proceedings, many jurors did not seem eager to serve in a trial that could take four months and could have tension-filled moments.</p>
<p>An unemployed pipe fitter told the judge he could not serve because he believed only God could judge people. &quot;In order to be perfect you have to have God come down and tell you what you should do. I don't think I can make a judgment on a person. I am not supposed to.&quot;</p>
<p>Nor, he added, did he believe in the death penalty, &quot;unless my life was in danger.&quot;</p>
