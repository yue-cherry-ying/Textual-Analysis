<title>JAPAN: Japan firms seek more spent nuclear fuel storage.</title>
<headline>Japan firms seek more spent nuclear fuel storage.</headline>

<p>Faced with a growing stockpile of spent radioactive material, two Japanese power companies said on Tuesday that they have asked local governments for permission to expand their current storage facilities.</p>
<p>The two companies, Kansai Electric Power Co Inc and Japan Atomic Power Co, cannot expand their spent nuclear fuel storage facilities without local government approval.</p>
<p>Japan Atomic Power said it has applied to the city and prefectural authorities of Tsuruga, Fukui prefecture on the Sea of Japan coast for permission to expand two storage facilities.</p>
<p>The company said it hoped to expand capacity at one nuclear fuel storage facility to 1,217 fuel bundles from the current 790 fuel bundles.</p>
<p>A fuel bundle is a collection of dozens of fuel rods.</p>
<p>A second facility would be boosted to hold 1,734 fuel bundles from the current 987.  </p>
<p>It hopes to carry out the construction work between October 1998 and September 2000.</p>
<p>Japan Atomic's Tsuruga nuclear plant, which is suffering the most serious storage shortage among Japan's power companies, has said its existing storage facility in Tsuruga will be filled by 2002.</p>
<p>In a similar step, Kansai Electric has filed a request with the local authorities of Oimachi, Fukui prefecture for an expansion.</p>
<p>Kansai Electric's expansion plans call for boosting the capacity of two storage facilities to enable them to each hold 2,129 fuel bundles from the current 974 fuel bundles.</p>
<p>Construction work is due to take place between October 1999 and March 2002.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for both Japan Atomic and Kansai Electric said they had not yet estimated the cost of the expansion project.</p>
<p>The credibility of Japan's nuclear industry has been undermined by a series of accidents at nuclear power plants and other nuclear power facilities.</p>
<p>In March a fire and explosion at Japan's only spent nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in Tokaimura, northeast of Tokyo, exposed dozens of workers to low levels of radiation.</p>
<p>The accident has stalled progress at a new recycling and storage plant in northern Japan, which was due to start receiving spent nuclear fuel from June.</p>
