<p>Chile's Supreme Court ordered a judge on Friday to investigate the disappearance of 112 people arrested by Gen. Augusto Pinochet's secret police and believed to have been held in a German colony.</p>
<p>The court instructed magistrate Hernan Gonzalez, who is already investigating child abuse at Colonia Dignidad (Dignity Colony), to probe the disappearance of political prisoners at the enclave, said Socialist deputy Camilo Escalona.</p>
<p>Local radio said this was the first time a senior magistrate had been ordered to probe the detention of prisoners by the now-disbanded DINA secret police at the colony, which is 200 miles (320 kms) south of Santiago.</p>
<p>A former intelligence agent, Samuel Fuenzalida, has said that the DINA -- the most feared of Pinochet's security services -- sent dozens of detainees for interrogation and torture at the heavily-guarded colony.</p>
<p>Prisoners believed to have been held at Colonia Dignidad included socialist leaders Carlos Lorca and Exequiel Ponce who were arrested by the DINA in June 1975, said Escalona.</p>
<p>&quot;With all the impact produced in the country by the strange goings-on at this place, the magistrate should carry out the searches, excavations and exhumations necessary to investigate these criminal accusations,&quot; said Escalona.</p>
<p>A government report in 1991 said about 3,000 people died or &quot;disappeared&quot; during the military regime. &quot;Disappeared&quot; means no trace was found of a person after his arrest by the security forces.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court decision is a tightening of the legal screws against the colony, whose leaders already face charges of child molestation, kidnapping and tax fraud.</p>
<p>The colony's fugitive leader, Paul Schaefer, is the subject of an international arrest warrant following allegations he sexually abused at least five Chilean boys at a boarding school run by the settlers.</p>
<p>Repeated police raids at the settlement failed to find any trace of Schaefer, but two men who escaped from the colony last month said he was hiding in tunnels in the enclave.</p>
<p>Schaefer, a corporal in the Nazi army in the Second World War, founded the colony in 1961 after fleeing from Germany following accusations he fondled youngsters at an orphanage he ran in Bonn.</p>
