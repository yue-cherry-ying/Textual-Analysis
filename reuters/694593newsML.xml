<p>Gerhard Schroeder, the leading Social Democratic (SPD) challenger to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, was reported on Saturday saying he did not expect cross-party agreement on broad tax reform before the next general election.</p>
<p>Schroeder, premier of Lower Saxony state, said in an interview with the Koelner Stadtanzeiger daily he did not think the SPD would be able to support the government's plan to sharply reduce income tax rates.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't believe that it is possible to carry out a broad tax reform before the next general election,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Polls show Schroeder is the SPD politician best-placed to oust Kohl, but the party has not chosen its candidate for chancellor yet.</p>
<p>The SPD-controlled Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, is expected to reject the centre-right government's tax reform bills covering 1998 and 1999 when it meets next Friday. The legislation will then go to a parliamentary committee.</p>
<p>The SPD has repeatedly rejected Finance Minister Theo Waigel's plan to run up the budget deficit to finance lower tax rates. Waigel's aim is to stimulate consumer spending and investment and jump-start the domestic economy.</p>
<p>&quot;This no longer has anything to do with serious budget policies,&quot; Schroeder said.</p>
<p>Schroeder indicated that before the SPD can seriously begin to discuss the substance of a tax reform it should wait and see if it can follow leftist victories in Britain and France and sweep to power in September 1998 elections.</p>
<p>&quot;If a SPD-led government had the opportunity to fully examine state finances, it would have to tell people what was possible and what was not. Only then could we set political priorities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He added that an SPD tax reform would have neither reducing the top tax rate nor raising the minimum tax free income level as priorities.</p>
<p>Instead, it would provide tax relief for the millions with annual incomes of between 60,000 marks and 120,000 marks ($34,400-68,900) &quot;who every day create our gross national product&quot;, he said.</p>
