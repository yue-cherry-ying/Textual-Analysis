<p>- A warm spring and Europe's diversification of energy supplies have caused a reduction in Russian gas exports to Europe via Ukraine this year, Ukraine's senior gas officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;About 3.3 billion cubic meters (bcm) of Russian gas were not taken by European customers since the spring months -- they didn't want more because of warm weather,&quot; Myroslav Khymko, head of dispatching at Ukrgazprom, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Ivan Diyak, Ukrgazprom's deputy chairman, said diversification also played a role.</p>
<p>&quot;European customers -- especially in Central and Eastern Europe -- even want to buy more expensive gas from non-Russian sources in order to diversify supplies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under initial plans, 129.2 bcms of Russian were to cross Ukraine this year on their way to Europe. But the figure will be reduced to 126 bcms. Last year, Ukraine pumped 117 bcms of Russian gas to European customers.</p>
<p>Khymko said Ukrgazprom had sent a $200,000 bill to Russian gas monopoly RAO Gazprom  GAZP.RTS asking for compensation for oversupply in its system.</p>
<p>&quot;It creates additional pressure in the pipelines -- we can't send this gas in opposite direction back to Russia,&quot; Khymko said.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;Of course we are intrested in pumping more Russian gas through our territory to Europe because it automatically means more gas for ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Ukraine is one of the world's biggest conveyors and customers of Russian gas -- about 53 bcms of Russian gas were due to be imported by Ukraine for domestic needs.</p>
<p>Altogether the country of 51 million consumes 86 bcms each year -- including 18 bcms produced at home, with the rest imported from the Central Asian states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Kiev and Moscow agreed last year a tariff of $1.75 per 1,000 cubic metres per hundred km (62 miles) of Russian gas carried via Ukraine, but Russia pays the fee in gas.</p>
<p>Thus, Ukraine each year gets 32 bcms, worth around $2.2 billion, for its own needs. Ukraine pays Russia $80 per 1,000 cubic metres of imported gas -- below world prices -- as part of the deal.</p>
