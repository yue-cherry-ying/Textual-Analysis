<p>The defence in the Oklahoma City bombing trial has launched an all-out attack on the government's evidence against Timothy McVeigh, suggesting that the real bomber may have died in the blast.</p>
<p>The defence called nine witnesses on the first day of its case on Thursday, casting doubt on the prosecution's time line and implying other unidentified people may have been involved in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building that killed 168 people.</p>
<p>The prosecution, which rested its case on Wednesday after calling 137 witnesses, says McVeigh, 29, is an extreme right-winger who bombed the federal building to avenge the deaths of 80 Branch Davidian cult members in a confrontation with federal agents at Waco, Texas, in 1993.</p>
<p>The decorated Gulf War veteran has pleaded not guilty to murder and conspiracy charges but could face the death penalty if convicted.</p>
<p>After the Oklahoma state medical examiner testified that an unidentified leg was found in the rubble of the Murrah building, a British forensic expert said it was possible for someone close to a bomb to disintegrate when it blew up.</p>
<p>&quot;One must assume ... that the rest of that body must have been disintegrated,&quot; said Thomas Marshall, a former state pathologist for Northern Ireland who conducted many autopsies on bombing victims before he retired in 1989.</p>
<p>The testimony of Marshall, now a consultant, backed up the defence theory that the bomber may have died in the huge blast that destroyed the Murrah building.</p>
<p>People killed in bombings were usually missed by someone, so &quot;when nobody misses them, it reinforces the suggestion that the deceased is involved in the bombing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>However, Marshall conceded under questioning by the prosecution that he had not personally examined the leg and did not know where it was found.</p>
<p>Denver defence attorney and trial analyst David Japha was not impressed by the defence's opening and found unbelievable its suggestion that the unidentified leg belonged to the bomber.</p>
<p>&quot;The strength of the government's case is now coming out. We see after the first day of the defence case just how difficult it is going to be for the defence to convince these jurors of anything,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Vicki Beemer, a clerk at Elliott's Body Shop in Junction City, Kansas, said a man calling himself Robert Kling was with another man when he came to pick up a Ryder rental truck two days before the bombing.</p>
<p>But she could not remember what either man looked like. Asked in turn by defence and prosecution lawyers, Beemer could not say whether McVeigh, sitting in the courtroom, was or was not Kling.</p>
<p>The government says the Ryder truck, packed with ammonium nitrate and fuel oil, was used to bomb the Murrah building and that Kling was really McVeigh. After the blast, the FBI launched a nationwide manhunt for another suspect, dubbed &quot;John Doe No. 2,&quot; but never found him.</p>
<p>Kling wanted a truck that would carry 5,000 pounds (2,270 kgs) of cargo, Beemer said. An expert witness for the prosecution had estimated that the bomb probably contained between 3,000 and 6,000 pounds (1,360 and 2,720 kgs) of explosives.</p>
<p>Jeff Davis, who worked for a Chinese restaurant in Junction City, told how he delivered food to the motel room the prosecution says McVeigh was using a few days before the bombing. Davis said he did not believe the man he delivered the food to was McVeigh and there was no one else in the room.</p>
<p>Two other witnesses testified they saw a Ryder truck at the motel three days before the bombing -- a day before the prosecution maintains McVeigh rented it.</p>
<p>The defence has formally asked Federal Judge Richard Matsch to accept into evidence a recent Department of Justice report criticising the work of some forensic scientists at the FBI's Washington D.C. laboratory in the Oklahoma City and other explosives cases. It was not immediately known if Matsch had ruled on the motion, made public on Thursday.</p>
<p>The defence could use the report to back its contention that FBI lab tests showing traces of explosives on McVeigh's clothes could have been contaminated by sloppy handling.</p>
