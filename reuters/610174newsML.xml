<headline>Retail subscriptions for Dutch Nutreco close early.</headline>

<p>Retail subscriptions for shares in feeds group Nutreco both in the Netherlands and abroad will close earlier than planned because of high retail demand, a spokesman for Rabobank Nederland said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest among retail investors has been extremely high and we do not want to disappoint applicants,&quot; said Jan van Schaik, a spokesman for Rabobank Nederland.</p>
<p>He said interest from institutional investors had also been satisfactory. He declined to give details on subscription levels or say how many shares would be reserved for retail buyers.</p>
<p>Joint issue global co-ordinators Rabo Securities and Goldman Sachs International said in a statement retail investors could subscribe until 0900 GMT on Monday May 26, bringing forward an anticipated subscription closure date from June 2.</p>
<p>Institutional investors and employees of Nutreco can subscribe until Monday June 2, although this subscription period could also close earlier, they said.</p>
<p>The statement said allocations for all subscribers were expected to be made on June 3, date on which the shares are expected to start trading on the Amsterdam Stock Exchanges. The issue price will be between 33 and 37 guilders per share.</p>
<p>Nutreco, which manufactures animal and fish feeds, said earlier this month it planned to issue 14,811,000 shares, of which 9,525,000 would be sold by existing shareholders and the remainder by Nutreco.</p>
<p>Under a greenshoe option, certain selling shareholders have granted the lead managers the option to buy up to an additional 2,221,650 shares within 30 days of the pricing date.</p>
<p>Nutreco said the offering would enable it to expand its shareholder base and secure access to the capital markets in order to finance future growth.</p>
<p>In addition, the listing would provide a liquid trading market for Nutreco shareholders, the company said.</p>
<p>Nutreco unveiled 1996 profits of 40.4 million guilders in April, up 50 percent from the previous year.</p>
<p>Operating income rose 13.3 percent to 128 million guilders and Nutreco said it expected 1997 operating results to show a further improvement if current market conditions persisted.</p>
<p>It employs 5,500 people in 60 locations in 15 countries. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040</p>
