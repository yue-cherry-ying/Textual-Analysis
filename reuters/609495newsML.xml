<title>FRANCE: Arianespace board names Luton chairman.</title>
<headline>Arianespace board names Luton chairman.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>The board of European space group Arianespace said on Friday it planned to name Jean-Marie Luton as chairman to replace Charles Bigot from July 1.</p>
<p>The organisation charged Luton with preparing a profound study on a European space transport system and make detailed proposals before April 1998.</p>
<p>The board decided to end the contract with managing director Francis Avanzi, who had beeen hired in January 1996 with an eye to succeeding Bigot, 65, as chairman.</p>
<p>Luton, a former head of the European Space Agency (ESA), had already been named head of holding group Ariannespace Participation on April 17.</p>
<p>The board will ask a general meeting of shareholders on June 16 to name Luton as head of the Arianespace SA company which commercialises the Ariane rockets, using the Kourou launching site in French Guiana.</p>
<p>Luton's appointment follows a power struggle among the company shareholders, with the French government backing Luton in order to get a strong European agency capable of taking on competition by merged U.S. giants.</p>
<p>Avanzi, a former head of aeroengine company CFM International, had been hired by Bigot himself as heir apparent.</p>
<p>French interests control 55 percent of Arianespace shares, with the space study centre CNES having 32 percent.</p>
<p>Germany holds 18.5 percent and Italy 8.11 percent while other shareholders are mainly within the European Union.</p>
<p>In a statement, Arianespace's board said that Avanzi, 43, had done &quot;excellent work&quot; and that the decision to name Luton was &quot;independent of his own qualities which are unanimously recognised.&quot;</p>
<p>Luton, 55, has been head of the 14 nation ESA since 1990. Before that he has been at CNES and Aerospatiale.</p>
<p>Arianespace, which controls more than half of the world's commercial satellite launch market, faces strong competition from the planned purchase of McDonnell Douglas Corp by Boeing Co.</p>
<p>Arianespace is set to re-try launching its newest Ariane-5 rocket after a previous trial ended a few minutes after launch in an explosion.</p>
