<p>Qatar has yet to decide whether to close Israel's trade mission in Doha following Arab League resolutions recommending Arab states freeze the normalisation of ties with Israel, a foreign ministry official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything is possible in light of the Cairo decision but so far no decision has been made,&quot; the official, who declined to be named, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Arab foreign ministers recommended on Monday after a two-day meeting in Cairo that Arab states stop normalising ties with Israel and restore their economic boycott of the Jewish state.</p>
<p>They also urged closing down Israeli trade missions and withdrawing from multilateral talks on Middle East peace.</p>
<p>The recommendations were triggered by the Israeli government's decision to go ahead with a Jewish housing settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Qatar and Oman have forged ahead of other Gulf Arab states in establishing economic ties with Israel after the Jewish state signed a peace deal with the Palestine Liberation Organisation in 1993.</p>
<p>They have stopped short of full diplomatic relations pending a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace but are the only countries in the Gulf region to have allowed Israel to start trade missions.</p>
<p>Qatar had supported a project by U.S. Enron Corp to sell Qatari liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Israel and Jordan but the project unravelled this year as Israeli authorities turned to possible alternative gas supplies from Egypt.</p>
<p>Enron has continued to pursue its LNG project in Qatar but will concentrate sales of its gas to India rather than Israel.</p>
<p>Oman and Qatar have said they have frozen ties with Israel following what they see as hardline policies by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.    Neither country has</p>
<p>specified how it would respond to the call to freeze ties with the Jewish state.</p>
<p>An Omani foreign ministry official on Tuesday said his country &quot;was totally committed to the decision of the Arab League in this regard&quot; when asked whether Muscat would close Israel's trade office. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Asked whether Oman would reinstate the secondary and tertiary boycott on Israel, he said: &quot;It is not useful to contemplate this at the current time.&quot;</p>
<p>Gulf Arab states have lifted a decades-old boycott of firms and institutions that deal with Israel, the so-called secondary and tertiary boycott.</p>
<p>The head of the Israeli trade office in Doha, Sammy Ravel, said: &quot;We have not heard anything from Qatar's foreign ministry&quot; in response to the call to shut down trade offices.</p>
<p>&quot;But our stand is to support the continuation of dialogue and encourage others to reinstate the peace process. We want all countries to...calm the atmosphere,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia on Monday said it supported the Arab League resolutions and King Fahd, after a weekly cabinet meeting, reiterated condemnation of Israel's settlement policy.</p>
