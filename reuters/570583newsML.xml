<p>The New York Times reported the following stories on its front page on Thursday:</p>
<p>* The U.S. Federal Communications Commission approved a landmark restructuring of telephone charges that would raise prices for some services and lower them for others.</p>
<p>* The U.S. Army charged its highest-ranking enlisted soldier with adultery and indecent assault in a case involving four military women.</p>
<p>* Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko flew to neighboring Gabon on an official visit, but Zairians saw the trip as his last exit from a country he ruled for almost 32 years.</p>
<p>* A U.S. report said the Swiss government failed to honor an agreement to return hundreds of millions of dollars in assets that Nazis looted from Holocaust victims and European banks. The study also criticized the U.S. government for not pushing the Swiss hard enough at the end of the war to account for the gold.</p>
<p>* A United Nations war crimes tribunal convicted a Bosnian Serb of persecuting and torturing Moslem civilians in Bosnia in 1992, and of killing two policemen.</p>
<p>* Israel has tried to legally justify the use of violence in interrogations and the Israeli Supreme Court has condoned the process.</p>
<p>* A rift is growing between Attorney General Janet Reno and Federal Bureau of Investigation head Louis Freeh over whether a special prosecutor is needed to probe Democratic fundraising for President Clinton's re-election.</p>
