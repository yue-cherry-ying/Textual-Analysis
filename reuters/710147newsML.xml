<p>Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro said on Monday Italy continued to support Slovenia's bid to join NATO in the first round of its expansion, despite U.S. opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;Geographically Slovenia should be included in NATO (in the first round) as inclusion of Hungary without Slovenia would form a gap,&quot; Scalfaro told a news conference during his one-day visit to Slovenia.</p>
<p>Slovenia, which borders Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia, is expected to be left out of the first round of NATO expansion, candidates for which will be determined at the NATO summit in Madrid on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Although Slovenia's membership enjoys support of nine out of 16 NATO members, with Italy being its strongest backer, the U.S. said only the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary (corrects from Slovakia) ashould be included in the first wave.</p>
<p>Scalfaro also said Italy supported Slovenia's bid to join the European Union as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Slovenian president Milan Kucan reiterated membership in the European Union and NATO was of vital interest to Slovenia.</p>
<p>&quot;Italy exposed itself a lot with its stand (regarding Slovenia's membership in NATO and the EU) and we appreciate it very much,&quot; Kucan said.</p>
<p>&quot;However, we realise the main duty is ours as we have to overcome legal and political obstacles (to the EU membership),&quot; Kucan added.</p>
<p>Slovenia's Constitutional Court said in June that parliament needed to change the constitution to enable foreigners to own land before it could ratify the association agreement with the EU.</p>
<p>The European Commission said ratification of the agreement, which was signed in June last year, was a precondition for Slovenia becoming an EU member.</p>
<p>Slovenian parliamentary parties on Friday signed a cross-party agreement according to which they would change the constitution and ratify the EU accord by July 15.</p>
