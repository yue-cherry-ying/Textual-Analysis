<p>Three Icelanders have reached the summit of Mount Everest to become the first from their country to conquer the world's tallest peak, Nepal's Ministry of Tourism announced on Friday.</p>
<p>It said Bjorn Olafsson, a 30-year-old computer programmer, Einar Kristjan Stefansson, a 31-year-old engineer and Hallgrimur Magnusson, a rescue worker who celebrates his 34th birthday on Saturday, reached the summit on Wednesday afternoon. All three are from the Icelandic capital Reykjavik.</p>
<p>Another member of the British-Icelandic-Mexican expedition, Nikola Kekus, a 40-year-old engineer from Cumbria in Britain, also made it to the top with the Icelanders, along with two Nepali Sherpas, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Two climbers from a Canadian expedition reached the summit of the 8,848 metre (29,029 foot) Everest, called Sagarmatha by Nepalis, on Friday, the tourism ministry said.</p>
<p>Jamie Clarke, 29, and Alan Hobson, 39, both from Calgary, led four Sherpas in two successful assaults on the peak early on Friday, it said.</p>
<p>A ministry official said: &quot;More climbers are expected to reach the summit today.&quot;</p>
<p>Malaysian television showed live coverage of two Malaysian climbers, M. Magendran and N. Mohandas, who planted their nation's flag on the summit of Everest on Friday.</p>
<p>Two people have died this spring on the Nepali side of Everest and five have died on the Tibetan side.</p>
