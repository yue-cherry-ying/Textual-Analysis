<p>McDonald's Corp is taking off the gloves and taking on its main competitor in a television advertising campaign to promote its french fries.</p>
<p>McDonald's launched a national television advertisement in late March targeting french fries made by competitor Burger King. The commercial shows a crew supposedly filming a bag of Burger King french fries while munching on McDonald's fries.</p>
<p>&quot;We consider our fries to be the gold standard in the industry,&quot; McDonald's spokeswoman Anna Rozenich said. &quot;No one can match them.&quot;  </p>
<p>The french fry ad, created by advertising agency Leo Burnett Co in Chicago, is a departure for McDonald's. By its estimate, the fast-food company has not directly mentioned a competitor in its advertising for at least 10 years.</p>
<p>While McDonald's often promotes a particular product, its ads often have more of a &quot;touchy, feely&quot; quality to them, featuring happy families or its Ronald McDonald clown mascot, said Dennis Lombardi, director of restaurant consulting for Technomic Inc of Chicago.  </p>
<p>&quot;Burger King is the one, from a competitive perspective, that has had the biggest impact on McDonald's for two years,&quot; Dean Witter analyst David Adelman said.</p>
<p>By featuring its french fries, Adelman added, McDonald's is promoting a high-volume, high-margin product.</p>
<p>&quot;For years and years and years, McDonald's fries had been one of its signature products,&quot; Lombardi said.</p>
<p>Advertising targeting a specific competitor, such as the french fry commercial, can be effective, as long as consumers do not consider them to be too mean-spirited, said Satya Menon, assistant professor of marketing at the University of Chicago.  </p>
<p>&quot;The information that they're getting out of the comparison is useful information,&quot; Menon said.</p>
<p>But the risk is that, while promoting its own brand, McDonald's is also putting its competitor in the consumer's mind, said John Lister, chief executive officer of Lister Butler Inc, a New York-based brand identity consultant.</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot continue to run (this kind of) commercial. You are doing as much good for Burger King as you are for McDonald's,&quot; Lister said. &quot;Why do you want to bring up the largest competitor's brand name?&quot;</p>
