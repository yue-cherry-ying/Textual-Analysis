<p>Singapore jet fuel eased on Thursday as refiners took advantage of the buying support from a local trader to off load their cargoes at a time of seasonal low demand, traders said.</p>
<p>The local trader has so far this week bought 500,000 barrels of jet fuel, purchasing another two 100,000 barrel cargoes late Thursday.</p>
<p>A European major sold the cargoes at $24.90 per barrel for May 23-27 lifting and at $25.10 for June 3-7 lifting, down between 10 and 20 cents from Wednesday's traded levels.</p>
<p>The local trader has already amassed more than three million barrels of jet fuel since March 3 when the buying spree began.</p>
<p>Industry sources said the trader's support gave Singapore refiners an easy outlet for the output at a time when jet fuel is under strong downward pressure.</p>
<p>Traders said the jet fuel purchased were either headed to China or dumped in the gas oil pool as was the case in April when jet fuel was trading at more than $1.00 per barrel discount to gas oil.</p>
<p>The weaker prices was also reflected in the swaps market where June regrade was last quoted at 40/50 cents down 10 cents from Wednesday.</p>
<p>Gas oil also firmed with fewer sellers emerging on concerns that supplies in June might tighten as the arbitrage from the West is now closed.</p>
<p>There were six offers with all but one at above the $25.50 per barrel mark as sellers retreated to the higher level on expectations of firmer prices.</p>
<p>The offer by a European major at $25.30 for June 1-5 lifting was sold to a Japanese trader.</p>
<p>Reflective of the tightening June physical market, June swaps firmed to $24.95/$25.05 with the May/June spread narrowing to value at around 45 cents.</p>
<p>Several tender news were heard on Thursday, with state-owned Nepal Oil Corp awading a 30,000 tonnes of 0.5 percent diesel to Shell Singapore at $185.73 per tonne c-and-f Indian east coast basis for June 1-10 delivery.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka's state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corp issued a tender to buy 250,000 barrels of gas oil and 50,000 barrels of jet fuel for June 1-2 delivery closing on May 14.</p>
<p>State-owned Indian Oil Corp issued a tender to buy 1,800 tonnes aviation gasoline and 18,000 tonnes superior kerosene for cargoes to be lifted not further than the Mediterranean which must be able to arrive at the Indian east coast port of Budge Budge on July 10-15.</p>
<p>The tender closes on May 14.</p>
