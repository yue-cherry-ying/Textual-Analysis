<p>An Indian playwright on Thursday called the partition of British India 50 years ago and the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people that followed possibly the greatest tragedy in history.</p>
<p>&quot;The partition of India in 1947 remains perhaps the greatest tragedy in world history,&quot; Gursharan Singh, a left- wing Sikh Punjabi writer, told Reuters in this northern city as India and Pakistan celebrated a half century of freedom from colonial rule.</p>
<p>Singh was an 18-year-old in the Pakistani city of Multan on August 15, 1947, when largely Hindu India won independence.</p>
<p>Moslems had formed Pakistan a day earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;Communal riots were going on. While my father decided  to stay on in Multan, my mother, elder sister and I moved to Amritsar in a caravan of buses,&quot; Singh said.</p>
<p>At the city of Amritsar, just 100 km (62 miles) from the Pakistani city of Lahore, Hindus and Sikhs helped each other, but Moslems still remaining behind were targeted for attack.</p>
<p>&quot;I was eyewitness to an incident when Moslem girls were forced to remove their clothes and paraded on the street at the instance of some Sikh leaders,&quot; Singh said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was only when a group of Hindu and Sikh women lodged a strong protest that the Moslem girls were allowed to wear their clothes and return to their places.&quot;</p>
<p>As jam-packed trains ferried hundreds of thousands of people back and forth across the border, there were tales from both sides of religious bigotry and terrible deeds.</p>
<p>Historians say hundreds of thousands died during the partition that saw six million people cross a newly formed border. Many left for a new homeland carrying nothing but mournful memories.</p>
<p>Counting the dead was considered futile.</p>
<p>Conservative estimates put the number of killed in partition riots at 500,000. Others believe up to a million may have died.</p>
<p>At a refugee camp, young inhabitants in an unfamiliar city helped old people whose children had gone looking for a livelihood to faraway cities like Delhi, Singh recalled.</p>
<p>&quot;Imagine, more than one million people were killed in the name of religion just because a small group of political leaders decided that there should be two countries instead of one united India,&quot; Singh said.</p>
