<p>Borussia Dortmund coach Ottmar Hitzfeld often has the look of a subtle, seasoned spy as he stands on the touchline wearing his long raincoat.</p>
<p>When the 48-year-old popped up without a great deal of fuss to take his first Bundesliga job at Dortmund in 1991, many people underestimated him because he did not have a high profile.</p>
<p>They could not have been more wrong.</p>
<p>Within six years, Hitzfeld, a qualified mathematics and sports teacher, has turned out to be one of the most shrewd coaches in the German game, leading Dortmund to two league titles, the 1993 UEFA Cup final and next Wednesday's European Cup final.</p>
<p>Insiders say he has a cool, tactical brain and works hard on psychology in the dressing rooms. One of the main reasons Dortmund managed to beat Bayern Munich to the title in 1995 and 1996 was their ability to avoid the kind of public squabbling which is often part of everyday life in Munich.</p>
<p>Hitzfeld has had his disagreements with players but has usually managed to keep good relations with even the most independent of stars like libero Matthias Sammer and midfielder Andy Moeller who have stayed at the club.</p>
<p>There is no doubt who runs the show, though.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm the boss... and an authoritarian one. You are not successful without that,&quot; he once admitted. &quot;If you want to have a winning attitude you have to be ready to win every match -- even in training.&quot;</p>
<p>Son of a dentist, the tall, slim Hitzfeld made his name as a striker in the 1970s when he played most of his career in Switzerland.</p>
<p>He played for Germany at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich and had a brief period in the Bundesliga with VfB Stuttgart before returning to Switzerland.</p>
<p>It is as a coach, however, that he has enjoyed his greatest success. He began his career in charge of unglamorous FC Zug in 1983 but led them back into the Swiss top flight with attacking football in his first season.</p>
<p>&quot;My goal was to be a man who was in demand within five years and could pick and choose where he took a job,&quot; he said. &quot;As a young coach you have to make a name for yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>It was not long before Hitzfeld was coaching bigger clubs like Grasshoppers in Zurich. He has two Swiss championships and three Swiss Cup triumphs to his name. Yet when he came to Dortmund he was not regarded as a big name.</p>
<p>That was soon to change. In his first season Dortmund finished second in the Bundesliga and then boosted the squad with the signings of top-class players like Sammer, Moeller, defenders Juergen Kohler and Stefan Reuter and striker Karlheinz Riedle.</p>
<p>All those players returned home from Italy and decided to move to Dortmund rather than the more glamorous Bayern.</p>
<p>In 1993 Dortmund were successful on the international stage and reached the UEFA Cup final where they lost to Juventus, their opponents in Munich on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But perhaps what has been most impressive about Hitzfeld in recent seasons is his ability to get results in both international and domestic football when his team has been hit by an array of injuries.</p>
<p>That has shown that Hitzfeld has great powers of motivation as well as tactical savoir-faire.</p>
