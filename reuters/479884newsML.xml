<title>ISRAEL: Israeli shekel gains, central bank buys dollars.</title>
<headline>Israeli shekel gains, central bank buys dollars.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Israeli shekel's representative rate was fixed higher against the dollar on Tuesday after the U.S. currency declined on overseas markets, dealers said.</p>
<p>The central bank bought dollars to support the foreign exchange rate.</p>
<p>&quot;The shekel rose against the dollar following the decline of the dollar abroad after sharp falls in U.S. markets,&quot; said Guy Levi at Bank Leumi.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar's decline pushed the basket below the lower edge of the trading band and the Bank of Israel had to intervene in the market, buying dollars, on a relatively high scale,&quot; Levi said.</p>
<p>The central bank has been intervening regularly in the market to defend the basket, which has been trading at the bottom end of its band for two months.</p>
<p>&quot;Volume was high after a four-day Easter break,&quot; Levi added.</p>
<p>The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.3570 shekels against 3.3610 on Thursday. The basket, composed of the dollar, mark, pound sterling, French franc and yen, was fixed at 3.6617 shekels against 3.6587 on Thursday.</p>
<p>On the crosses, the shekel traded against the yen at 2.7136 shekels per 100 yen compared with 2.7205 on Thursday, and against the mark at 2.0100 shekels after 2.0007 on Thursday.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon, the dollar was trading at 3.3530 shekels.</p>
