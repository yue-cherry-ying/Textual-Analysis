<p>Damage assessments remain heaviest in the northern region of the state of Queensland more than one week after cyclone Justin flattened large tracts of Australia's 1997 sugarcane crop, a Reuters telephone survey showed.</p>
<p>The crop is still seen as significantly damaged in the north but is said to be largely unaffected in the central coastal canegrowing area around Proserpine and Mackay.</p>
<p>In the area between the northern and central districts, cane has incurred losses on a slightly lesser scale than first believed.  </p>
<p>On March 24 in the immediate wake of cyclone Justin, grower organisation CANEGROWERS said 20 percent of Australia's 1997 sugarcane crop could be affected by cyclone damage.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't give you an estimate of whether we're going to see a drop in sugar production of ...30 percent or... 10 percent. All I can say is that it will be significant,&quot; Ian Ballantyne, CANEGROWERS general manager, said.</p>
<p>This produced expressions of disbelief in international sugar industry circles, especially in view of the steady world market price despite Justin's havoc.  </p>
<p>Vince Reghenzani, chairman of Mulgrave Canegrowers in the Cairns district of Queensland, which took Justin's central force, said on Tuesday that damage in his area would amount to about 25 percent of cane plus the loss of about A$4.00 a tonne of cane in sugar content.</p>
<p>This would reduce the value of the cane from about A$24.00 a tonne to about A$20.00 a tonne, he said.</p>
<p>This assessment was confirmed for Reuters by an inspector at the Mulgrave mill, south of Cairns.  </p>
<p>In 1996, the three regions involved --- northern region, the Herbert/Burdekin region immediately to the south and the central region to the south of that --- produced 31.34 million tonnes of cane and 4.33 million tonnes of 94 net titre raw sugar in the Australian total of 39.56 million tonnes of cane and 5.44 million tonnes of raws.</p>
<p>Reghenzani said on Tuesday that losses were not as big as first thought, but that about 10 percent of cane had broken tops while about a further 15.0 percent was dead or broken.</p>
