<p>A 30-billion rupee auction of 10-year Indian government securities set for Monday is likely to result in a cut off rate between 13.0-13.2 percent, according to 51 percent of respondents to a poll carried out by Credence, India.</p>
<p>The poll, released on Saturday, surveyed 33 participants, including 18 banks, 12 corporates and three other institutions.</p>
<p>Monday's auction kicks off the government's 1997/98 (April-March) borrowing programme, during which it plans to raise 528.1 billion rupees compared to 350.3 billion in the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>The plan implies the government will have to raise an average 40 billion rupees each month.</p>
<p>Due to the ready avaliability of funds in the banking system the government raised 20.08 billion rupees at its 364-day treasury bill auction on April 9.</p>
<p>Monday's auction is also expected to be a success.</p>
<p>The respondents to the poll said that given the liklihood of falling interest rates the 10-year paper represented a good buy.</p>
<p>Details of the polls results;</p>
<p>-- Nine percent foresaw a cut off rate less than 13</p>
<p>-- 15 percent foresaw a cut off rate between 13.00-13.10</p>
<p>-- 12 percent expected a cut off rate between 13.10-13.15</p>
<p>-- 28 percent forecast a cut off rate between 13.15-13.20</p>
<p>-- Nine percent foresaw a cut off rate between 13.20.13.25</p>
<p>-- 18 percent foresaw a cut off rate between 13.25-13.30</p>
<p>-- Nine percent foresaw a cut off rate above 13.30</p>
<p>Even the nine percent of repsondents who expected to see the coupon pegged below nine percent judged this as a successful outcome for the auction. They said this was because secondary market yields for similar maturity are dropping continuously and cited a 14 pct 2006 paper which was traded at 13.05 percent on April 10 and at 12.92 percent on April 17.</p>
<p>The respondents also said the banking system remained flush with funds and few avenues of investment, and the paper was likely to be popular.</p>
<p>They said banks would be the major subscribers, followed by insurance companies and foreign and private banks.</p>
<p>Many respondents said they expected the paper to trade at a premium in six months time. They reckoned that ample liquidity in the banking system will keep interest rates from rising in the next six months, even if there is an expected outflow from the system. Very few believed that growth in bank credit would be high enough to push up bank credit.</p>
