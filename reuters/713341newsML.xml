<headline>TI official says proper dlr/yen rate at 110.</headline>

<p>Texas Instruments Inc Vice Chairman William Weber said on Tuesday a proper U.S.-Japan exchange rate is about 110 yen to the dollar.</p>
<p>Exchange rates were one of the issues discussed at a conference of Japanese and U.S. business executives in San Francisco, most of which was being held behind closed doors.</p>
<p>Weber told reporters that the exchange rate impacted both the price and cost of a company's goods, &quot;so it's something we have to pay a lot of attention to.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;TI's view is that a proper exchange rate is about 110 (yen to the dollar),&quot; Weber said. The yen was trading at about 113 to the dollar on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Weber said one of the major issues he wanted to see addressed at the U.S.-Japan business conference was &quot;still the whole issue of deregulation and market access&quot; in Japan.</p>
<p>&quot;It's always an issue of how open and how quickly Japan can deregulate itself,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Weber said the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market was now around 29 percent. He had no target for what it should be, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It ought to be whatever the market forces dictate,&quot; Weber said.</p>
<p>He said what was changing in Japan for the better was the recognition by the government and company executives that &quot;having a free and open market that is tariff-free is good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. is probably the most open market in the world and I think other countries are learning rapidly that this is the best approach,&quot; Weber said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think also what we are recognizing is that rather than trying to protect our own markets we're better off to create new and larger markets that we all can participate in,&quot; Weber said.</p>
