<p>Four people were killed and 27 were were injured early on Saturday when a passenger bus collided with a pickup truck on a remote stretch of Alberta highway, police said.</p>
<p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said both drivers were killed in the crash along with two passengers on the Greyhound bus, which was en route from Edmonton, Alberta to Whitehorse, Yukon when the crash occured in early morning darkness.</p>
<p>Both vehicles burst into flames on impact and were consumed by fire, RCMP Constable Craig McIntyre said.</p>
<p>He said all 27 surviving passengers were injured in the accident but none of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as I know no one (is in critical condition). There's a few broken bones, burns, cuts and bruises, that kind of thing, shock,&quot; McIntyre said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Greyhound said one of the surviving passengers was Japanese, while the rest were from western Canada.</p>
<p>The crash occurred about 200 km (120 miles) northwest of Edmonton in good weather and road conditions. The bus was northbound from Edmonton when it was hit head-on by the truck, which may have been trying to pass at the time, RCMP said.</p>
