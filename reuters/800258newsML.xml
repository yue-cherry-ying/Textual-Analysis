<p>Precious metals drifted lower on Thursday afternoon after early New York prices turned slightly easier.</p>
<p>Dealers said U.S. economic data were well in line with economists' forecasts so the reaction in the financial markets was muted limiting the knock on effect in gold.</p>
<p>Business continued light and gold fixed just $1.15 per ounce lower at $326.15 and just five cents above the Wednesday afternoon fixing.</p>
<p>The Decemeber contract on New York's Comex future market was off $0.90 at $329.80.</p>
<p>The dollar and stocks and bonds were slightly firmer after the U.S. July CPI rose 0.2 pct as expected.</p>
<p>Last Friday the U.S. financial markets corrected sharply sending gold to the top of its recent $325-$330 range. Any hope of breaking higher from there depended largely on more moves in the paper markets, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The funds are the shorts in this market and as we're at the top end of the range they're eyeing financials nervously,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;If there's another shake-up on Wall Street we'll see a short-covering move to the upside. Chances are we'll see gold higher,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>Indicating the increasing depth of short positions, implied lease rates rose to 2.68 percent for a month from 2.29 percent on Wedndesday and 1.85 percent at the beginning of the week.</p>
<p>Failure to breach resistance could mean prices falling back to $322-$323 support, dealers said.</p>
<p>Silver was steady after moving up with gold on Wednesday and holding most of its gains. It had rallied up to a high bid of $4.56 at one point on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It was off a cent from Wednesay's close at $4.49/$4.51.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market wanted to fill a gap on the September Comex chart which translated to $5.56-$5.60 in the spot market.</p>
<p>&quot;Until it fills that gap, we're not going to see silver too much weaker,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The platinum group metals were easier and dealers said they expected them to continue drifting as Russian exports trickled on to the market.</p>
<p>&quot;They'll continue consolidating and edging lower but the market is still very tight and there's no way I'd be short in these markets,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Platinum was last at $424.00/$427.00, down $8.00 from Wednesday's close, while palladium was off $11.00 at $213.00/$216.00.</p>
