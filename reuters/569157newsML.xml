<p>Heads of government of the Caribbean said on Thursday they intended to obtain tangible expressions of support from (U.S.) President Bill Clinton on a number of key issues at a Caribbean summit this weekend.</p>
<p>Leaders from the 14-member Caribbean Community (Caricom), Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Thursday concluded their preparatory talks for the summit, one day ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Most of the leaders were heralding the summit, the first in the Caribbean to be attended by a U.S. president, as the start of a new era in U.S.-Caribbean relations.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we must put our expectations too high, but it is a beginning, a new beginning,&quot; said Caricom chief trade negotiator Sir Shridath Ramphal, adding that while the United States needed to provide leadership in the post-Cold War era, &quot;I don't think they have yet lived up to their highest traditions.&quot;</p>
<p>The region continued to insist that its trade and investment concerns cannot be divorced from Washington's efforts to address its security preoccupations, particularly efforts to clamp down on the drug trade.</p>
<p>According to a United Nations International Drug Control Programme report released at the meeting, 62 percent of all cocaine leaving Latin America travels through the Caribbean, with 40 percent of the total reaching the United States.</p>
<p>The report said 248 metric tons per annum transits the Caribbean en route to the United States, another 100 metric tons passes through on its way to Europe.</p>
<p>A further 74 metric tons goes through Central America, then Jamaica, Cuba and the Cayman Islands before reaching the United States, four times more than the amounts of 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Caribbean leaders said the problem would grow further if the World Trade Organisation's ruling against the European Union's banana regime was upheld.</p>
<p>The WTO found the EU banana import regime, which sought to protect Caribbean fruit, violated WTO rules. Caribbean banana exports accounted for 15 percent of the EU market, the rest being controlled by U.S. firms operating in Latin America.</p>
<p>&quot;Our position is to ask the U.S. to give that regime a chance to play itself out&quot; until it expires in 2002, noted St. Lucia Prime Minister Dr. Vaughn Lewis, who will make the presentation on the banana issue during the summit.</p>
<p>Significantly, the region dropped its objections to previous suggestions that it consider giving up the banana trade in return for increased aid. It also insisted the transition away from the banana industry will require increased developmental funding.</p>
<p>&quot;No small country like ours can proceed without some form of assistance,&quot; Lewis said. Aid levels to the region fell some 60 percent, or $700 million, over the past decade.</p>
<p>The leaders planned to lobby Clinton to expand the range of exports covered under the Caribbean Basin Initiative and provide them with the same duty treatment Mexico received under the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>Jamaica Prime Minister P.J. Patterson, who will chair the summit, said the leaders will stress their conviction that &quot;decisions that affect our path forward together must be taken together, and cannot proceed on the basis of unilateral assessments.&quot;</p>
<p>He said this included the U.S. government's attempts to &quot;certify&quot; the drug interdiction programmes of other countries, as well as the Federal Aviation Administration's new system of categorizing civil aviation departments of other countries.</p>
<p>The FAA's decision to give Jamaica and Trinidad category II ratings cost Air Jamaica and Trinidad's BWIA about $150 million in losses since the two were privatised more than two years ago, officials said.</p>
