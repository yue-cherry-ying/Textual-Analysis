<p>Poland's new constitution, awaiting the verdict of a nationwide referendum on Sunday, safeguards public finances but includes some welfare state provisions potentially harmful for the economy, analysts say.</p>
<p>Most economists praise the charter for capping public debt at 60 percent of gross domestic product and forbidding the government to finance the budget deficit in the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;These provisions are healthy from the economic viewpoint. They force a rational construction of national budgets,&quot; said Piotr Kazimierczyk, a senior analyst at the Polish Development Bank.</p>
<p>But the rules, which enforce much-desired anti-inflationary and pro-growth polices at normal times, might prove too strict in emergencies, Kazimierczak added. &quot;In exceptional situations...more flexibility is needed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts say the constitution entrenches the central bank's independence in determining monetary policy and guarding the value of the zloty, but some are concerned that a planned Monetary Policy Council could be a politicised body.</p>
<p>The constitution upholds guarantees of the independence of the bank president -- a non-party figure chosen by the president and approved by parliament for a six-year term.</p>
<p>But members of the monetary council will be selected in equal proportions by the president, the lower house of parliament and the Senate and as such could be prone to political influence, said Bogdan Wyznikiewicz, an analyst for the private Gdansk Market Economy Research Institute (IBnGR).</p>
<p>The new constitution was approved by parliament in April when the ruling leftist coalition of ex-communists and a peasant party reached a difficult compromise with two opposition parties following three years of heated debate.</p>
<p>If it is approved in the referendum, which according to opinion polls appears likely despite criticism by some rightist parties, the constitution will replace the 1952 Stalin-era charter which has since been amended by interim regulations.</p>
<p>The constitution's authors set the limit for the public debt at 60 percent of GDP to ensure that Poland, hoping to join the European Union after 2000, conforms to one of the Maastrich treaty criteria for members of the EU's planned monetary union.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the constitution unnecessarily emulates some welfare state provisions included in Western countries' charters, which might open the way for attempts to force the government into spending on social schemes it can ill afford.</p>
<p>IBGnR's Wyznikiewicz criticised provisions which define the Polish economic system as adhering to social values and which say Poland should put into life principles of social justice.</p>
<p>&quot;If this ends up being treated just as a slogan then I see no problem, but if a certain group, say trade unionists, apply pressure to treat this seriously, then it is possible costly social programmes would have to be launched,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Wyznikiewicz also expressed concern over the implications for Poland's economy of provisions obliging the government to act to curb unemployment and stimulate housing construction.</p>
<p>Analysts were divided on the possible impact of a provision that scraps the president's right to veto the national budget -- powers which former President Lech Walesa threatened to use to browbeat political foes in government in 1994.</p>
