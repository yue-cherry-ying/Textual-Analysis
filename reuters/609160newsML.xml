<headline>DKB says total loans to Koike brothers 26 bln yen.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd said on Friday that cumulative loans it made to the two brothers at the centre of a &quot;sokaiya&quot; racketeer scandal amounted to 26 billion yen.  </p>
<p>DKB president Katsuhiko Kondo told a news conference that the bank's outstanding loans to Yoshinori Koike, the younger brother of racketeer Ryuichi Koike, totalled 4.6 billion yen, and loans outstanding to a real estate firm owned by Yoshinori totalled 2.9 billion yen.</p>
<p>Kondo said the bank had set aside loan loss provisions of 4.4 billion yen on the personal loans to Yoshinori in the year that ended on March 31, 1996, and 2.6 billion yen in fiscal 1994/95 on those made to his real estate company.  </p>
<p>Both Ryuichi and Yoshinori Koike were arrested last week on suspicion of violating Japan's commercial code by taking some 50 million yen in illegal payments from Nomura Securities Co Ltd.</p>
<p>Kondo, who will step down after the bank's annual shareholders' meeting on June 27, said that the bank's deals with the younger Koike started in about 1985, after he was introduced to DKB by a publisher who is now dead.</p>
<p>Media reports have described the publisher as a powerful racketeer.</p>
<p>Kondo said DKB always believed it was making loans to Yoshinori Koike and his company, and has never thought they were to Ryuichi Koike.  </p>
<p>However, Kondo said some DKB officials in the firm's general affairs department might have known that Yoshinori Koike's elder brother was a racketeer.</p>
<p>Kondo said the publisher who introduced the younger Koike had close ties with former top executives at DKB for a long time and therefore the general affairs department had made efforts to facilitate his requests.</p>
<p>&quot;For many years, the management's monitoring of the bank's operations has not worked well,&quot; Kondo said. &quot;We must put an end to such a negative attitude, and work out steps to prevent any recurrence of this kind of thing.&quot;  </p>
<p>Kondo said measures the bank would take to prevent similar scandals included the establishment of a surveillance body with independent members and the opening up of its annual shareholders' meeting to the media.</p>
<p>He said he greatly regretted that the bank had been raided by prosecutors over the loans to the younger Koike and his company. However, he said he could not clarify details of the loans as they were currently under investigation by regulators.</p>
<p>Asked if DKB had known the loans were used to buy shares of Nomura Securities, as has been reported in the media, DKB chairman Tadashi Okuda said he couldn't say definitively.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult to answer the question as regulators are currently carrying out an investigation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Okuda is to step down along with Kondo next month.  </p>
<p>Ichiro Fujita, who will take over the presidency after Kondo resigns, told reporters it appeared the bank had concealed details of its outstanding loans before inspections by the Finance Ministry 1990 and 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than the Finance Ministry missing the problem, our bank avoided revealing it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Another DKB executive told the news conference it was possible the bank had provided other loans similar to those in the Koike case, but gave no details.  </p>
<p>Kondo said the bank has started an internal inspection after he became aware of the Koike case and added that this was continuing.</p>
<p>Okuda said that while the bank had not yet discovered the whole picture, it would penalise bank officials found to be involved in wrongdoing.</p>
<p>He said that the name of the racketeer Ryuichi Koike appeared on the list of DKB shareholders in March 1984, and Kondo said that the elder Koike had attended several annual shareholders' meetings.  </p>
<p>The executives said their resignations did not mean they were trying to evade responsibility for the affair and added that they would do all they could to prevent a recurrence.</p>
