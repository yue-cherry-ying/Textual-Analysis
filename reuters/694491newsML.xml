<p>Hong Kong teenagers, revealing their hopes and dreams, believe life under China could bring tough competition from the mainland and teach them to be more careful about what they say.</p>
<p>The schoolchildren, canvassed about the new era once China ends 156 years of British colonial rule next week, worry that mainlanders could take top university places and jobs.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is a phenomenal Asian success story founded on the hard work of refugees who came here after the 1949 communist revolution in China and turned a once &quot;barren rock&quot; into one of the world's most vibrant economies.</p>
<p>But the new generation, who have never known such hardship, have very different priorities.</p>
<p>&quot;Since people from China are willing to accept low wages, bad working conditions and even long working hours, they will compete with Hong Kong people for jobs. Our living standards will surely worsen,&quot; said 15-year-old Wendy Tam Wing-yee.</p>
<p>She was one of 50 students canvassed by the South China Morning Post and asked in essays to say how the children of capitalism will cope with a new life under a communist regime. Beijing has pledged to retain Hong Kong's autonomous capitalist lifestyle for 50 years.</p>
<p>Some worried about textbook restrictions and wondered whether they would ever learn in the syllabus about the 1989 Tiananmen student uprising that was crushed by troops.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not want China to control everything in my life but there is nothing I can do to change the situation,&quot; said 15-year-old Wendy Wong.</p>
<p>Corisa Wong feared she would be forced to &quot;know more about China and love China. I think this should be done slowly and not be forced on us.&quot;</p>
<p>Eric Chan kept a wary eye on the competition at university, believing there could be an influx of talented medical graduates from China who could compete for jobs as doctors.</p>
<p>Miranda Sheck, 16, was planning to become a journalist but has changed her mind.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there will be more restrictions on the press after the handover. Journalism may not be a good job because it may become an insecure job. Maybe I will become a businesswoman.&quot;</p>
<p>But not all the letters were so weighty.</p>
<p>Sixteen-year-old Dora Ti echoed the concerns of teenagers around the world. In this capitalist enclave of 6.4 million, she will now have more mates to choose from in China's 1.2 billion population.</p>
<p>&quot;I will have a wider choice. Maybe I will get married with a man in Beijing and live in Beijing forever. This will be a good idea.&quot;</p>
