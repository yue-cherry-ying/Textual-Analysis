<p>The Italian Treasury announced on Saturday that it aims to sell at least 12.5 percent of energy giant ENI this month in the biggest international share offer seen so far this year.</p>
<p>Treasury Director-General Mario Draghi told a news conference that more shares would be released if demand for the third tranche sale was strong, but added that the state would not let its holding fall below 51 percent..</p>
<p>Italy currently owns some 69 percent of ENI, which is the biggest capitalised stock on the Milan bourse and the third largest oil and gas company in Europe.</p>
<p>Draghi said that at current market prices, if all the stock was sold, the Treasury would raise some 10 trillion lire ($5.8 billion). &quot;This is certainly the biggest offer of its kind in the world so far in 1997,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;All indications to date suggest there is going to be strong demand for ENI shares in the forthcoming offering,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Treasury will launch a road show for institutions on Monday to whip up support for the placement, with the retail sale aimed at small Italian investors set to run from June 23-27. The share price will be fixed on June 28.</p>
<p>Italy launched the first tranche ENI privatisation in November 1995, placing 15 percent of the company on the market at a price of 5,250 lire per share. In October 1996, a further 16 percent was sold off at 6,910 lire per share.</p>
<p>ENI, a multinational operation headed by Franco Bernabei, has posted consistently better results over recent years, chalking up a record group net profit of 4.45 trillion lire in 1996 and promising further profit growth for 1997.</p>
<p>ENI shares closed in Milan on Friday at 8,739 lire.</p>
<p>A minimum 400 million shares will be offered to the Italian retail market in the third tranche sale, with up to 25 percent of this reserved for ENI employees.</p>
<p>A further 300 million shares have been earmarked for Italian and foreign institutional investors outside north America, with 150 million shares reserved for U.S. and Canadian institutions.</p>
<p>Around 130 million additional shares have been set aside under a so-called &quot;green shoe&quot; option in case of strong interest.</p>
<p>The Treasury said that retail investors would be offered at least a three percent discount to ENI's closing share price on June 27. Small investors will also be offered one free share for every 10 bought, so long as they keep their third tranche stock for at least 12 months.</p>
<p>The ENI sell-off has proved a high-point in Italy's otherwise sluggish privatisation programme, with many other sales regularly delayed by political in-fighting.</p>
<p>The Treasury hopes to sell telecom group Stet later this year but parliament still has to set up a watchdog authority to oversee the sector once it passes to private hands and there is no guarantee it will meet the 1997 sale deadline.</p>
<p>Italy, desperately needing cash to cut its debt mountain, also plans to sell motorway operator Autostrade and Stet's publishing arm, Seat, in the coming months.</p>
<p>However in its 1997 budget, the Treasury predicted that it would raise 10 trillion lire this year from privatisations, meaning that if all goes according to plan, it should near that target with just the help of the ENI sale.</p>
<p>And it already has its eyes on a fresh ENI placement. Under the terms of the third tranche offer, the Treasury is committed to not offering more stock to the market for six months. The 'lock-up' clause with the previous flotations was nine months.</p>
<p>Italy's IMI and CSFB are global co-ordinators for the offer.</p>
