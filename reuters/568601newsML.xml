<p>Carson Pirie Scott &amp; Co said Thursday it expects 1997 first quarter earnings will exceed the prior year's operating earnings per share of $0.15.</p>
<p>&quot;The April sales results brought to a close a satisfying first quarter in which we recorded a nine percent total sales increase and a four percent same-store sales gain,&quot; said Stanton Bluestone, chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on our top-line performance, I expect that our first quarter earnings will exceed the prior year operating earnings per share of $0.15,&quot; he said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Last year's first quarter operating earnings of $0.15 excluded non-recurring items which totaled $0.43.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the retailer reported comparable store sales for the four weeks ended May 3, 1997 fell 2.2 percent from the comparable period a year ago. Total sales rose 2.4 percent to $85.3 million from $83.3 million last year.</p>
<p>Bluestone said he had expected same-store sales would be flat in the month of April due to a shift in the retailer's promotional calendar. The entire sales decrease occurred in the first week of the month during a major sale event when snow accumulation and extremely cold temperatures reduced customer traffic considerably, he said.</p>
<p>The strongest businesses in the quarter were women's sportswear, shoes, men's better sportswear, furniture, home textiles and luggage.</p>
<p>Comparable store sales rose 2.5 percent for the combined March/April period, which eliminates the effect of the promotional shift and the timing of Easter, the retailer noted.</p>
<p>Carson Pirie Scott operates 52 department stores and four furniture stores.</p>
