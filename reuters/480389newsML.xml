<headline>Vietnam slams &quot;Russian document&quot; on U.S. POWS.</headline>
<dateline>HANOI 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Vietnam took a swipe on Tuesday at an old Soviet intelligence report that suggested Hanoi held hundreds more U.S. prisoners of war (POWs) than it acknowledged in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>&quot;Vietnam rejected as flatly slanderous and ill-intentioned the so-called 'Russian Document' on POW and MIA (missing in action),&quot; the official news agency quoted the head of the Vietnam Association of War Veterans, Tran Van Quang, as saying.</p>
<p>It said Quang made his comment at a meeting with the Charge d'Affaires of the U.S. embassy in Hanoi, Desaix Anderson, who confirmed that Washington considered the report null and void.</p>
<p>The issue of POWs and accounting for some 1,600 U.S. servicemen still listed as missing in action or otherwise unaccounted for in Vietnam has been a delicate one in the process of normalising relations between the two former enemies.</p>
<p>One diplomat, who declined to be named, said he believed anti-Hanoi hardliners in the United States were peddling old and discredited reports on POWs to block an exchange of ambassadors.</p>
<p>&quot;This issue is about to hit the press again and people who are outside the system are going to get ready to state their position again,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Republican Leader Trent Lott has said he intends to bring up the long-delayed confirmation of former congressman Douglas &quot;Pete&quot; Peterson as ambassador to Vietnam in the Senate on April 8 or 9.</p>
<p>The nomination has been held up by Republican Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire since it cleared the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on March 4.</p>
<p>Smith had said it was premature to send an ambassador to Hanoi while investigations continued into whether U.S. policy towards Vietnam had been influenced by illegal contributions to President Bill Clinton's election campaign last year.</p>
<p>Long a critic of Vietnam's efforts to account for Americans lost in action in the Vietnam War, Smith has said he would do everything he could to block the nomination.</p>
<p>An official in Hanoi with the Joint Task Force for Full Accounting, which is in charge of efforts to trace MIAs, said the United States accepted that there was no credible evidence in three Soviet intelligence reports on war-era prisoners.</p>
<p>Two of those reports suggested that Vietnam held hundreds more prisoners than it had acknowledged, first in 1970-71 and then in 1972. It was not clear to which &quot;Russian document&quot; the veteran association's Quang was referring.</p>
<p>Hanoi released 591 prisoners in &quot;Operation Homecoming&quot; after U.S. forces withdrew from Vietnam in 1973 and has stated since that they were all it held.</p>
