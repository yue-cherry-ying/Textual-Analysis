<p>The ancient Roman city of Pompeii, buried in a volcanic eruption in 79 A.D., is considering a leap into the late 20th century by issuing special bonds on international markets to help pay for its upkeep.</p>
<p>&quot;We are working on an idea...to raise large international loans -- a sort of 'revenue bond' on Pompeii,&quot; Italian Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni, who also has responsibility for culture, told reporters on Thursday.</p>
<p>He stressed the idea was at an early stage, but said the cash could help with an estimated 500 billion lire ($296 million) to relaunch Pompeii and complete the excavations.</p>
<p>Some of the centre-left government's plans for Pompeii are contained in a bill before parliament that would allow the body which administers the site to keep and manage its entrance fees.</p>
<p>That body, which would become autonomous, would be likely to issue the bonds with the paper underwritten by the Italian government.</p>
<p>&quot;These takings could be used to access international markets which will enable us to have the necessary resources to carry out the restructuring plan,&quot; Veltroni said.</p>
<p>Protection and development of Pompeii is one of a string of projects championed by Italy's year-old government, which has made culture a key policy.</p>
<p>Pompeii was buried under a deep layer of ash in an eruption of the Vesuvius volcano, which towers over the Bay of Naples in southern Italy. The sprawling site now gives one of the finest insights into daily life under the ancient Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Veltroni added that with 22 hectares (55 acres) still to be excavated in Pompeii, protection of existing finds was vital.</p>
<p>&quot;We shouldn't excavate any more until we have the certainty that what is already above ground will be protected,&quot; he said. ($1=1,692 lire)</p>
