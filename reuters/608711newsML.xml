<p>Chaos overshadowed the start of voting in two referendums in Slovakia on Friday and Western diplomats said any chance for fair polls had already been destroyed.</p>
<p>Slovaks were voting on whether they wanted their country to join NATO and whether the president should be directly elected by the people instead of by parliament.</p>
<p>But polling was thrown into confusion by a row over ballots, tied to a long-running feud between the president and the prime minister. As a result, some polling stations had no ballots while others had voting slips without the presidential question.</p>
<p>Western diplomats in Bratislava said the muddle tainted the outcome of the voting and further damaged the already tenuous reputation of Slovakia's new democracy.</p>
<p>&quot;The referendum has already been totally discredited and will have no legal significance,&quot; said one diplomat. &quot;Now the only conclusion is chaos and chaos is damaging,&quot; another diplomat said.</p>
<p>The vote on presidential elections was seen as a way for the opposition to stop Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar from assuming presidential powers when the term of his political enemy, incumbent President Michal Kovac, ends next March.</p>
<p>Under the current constitution, presidential powers would pass to the prime minister if parliament cannot muster a three-fifths majority to elect a new president, which neither the ruling coalition or opposition appear likely to achieve.</p>
<p>Meciar's government has thus fought a fierce battle to cancel the referendum on presidential elections, which resulted from a petition drive led by the opposition.</p>
<p>Polls were open on Friday from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. (1200 to 2000 GMT) and again on Saturday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. (0600 to 1200 GMT), with results to be made public on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>The outcome was cast into confusion after Meciar's interior minister, Gustav Krajci, who is responsible for the technical organisation of the referendums, issued ballots without the question on presidential elections.</p>
<p>Ballots with only the three questions on NATO membership were distributed throughout Slovakia but some mayors refused to accept them, insisting they were illegal without the seal of the Central Referendum Committee (UKR).</p>
<p>&quot;Our mayor decided to not distribute ballots without the question on presidential elections,&quot; an aide to the mayor of Petrzalka, a district of the capital Bratislava, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Krajci said scrapping the question on direct presidential elections was justified due to a Constitutional Court ruling that an appendix to the question was irrelevant.</p>
<p>&quot;The court ruled the appendix was illegal which means that the entire question was illegal,&quot; Krajci told reporters.</p>
<p>The Central Referendum Committee is responsible for supervisising the referendum and must approve its result for the outcome to be valid.</p>
<p>Its deputy chairman, Jozef Rumpolec, said it would recognise only those ballots with four questions, including the presidential one. &quot;The three-question ballots are a forgery,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said the official UKR seal had been reprinted on them from the original four-question ballot, adding: &quot;This is falsification of an official document which is punishable by law and we shall prosecute.&quot;</p>
<p>Opposition leaders urged people to insist on being handed a four-question ballot or to refuse to register.</p>
<p>One diplomat said the chaos was &quot;tragic, because all it serves is to damage yet again not only Slovakia's image abroad but the concept that the country has of itself.&quot;</p>
<p>The European Union is currently processing questionnaires submitted by potential membership candidates to see if they meet its political and economic criteria. Diplomats say Slovakia is unlikely to be invited to join the EU because of shortcomings in its democratic reforms.</p>
