<p>Bulgaria's Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) scored an overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections on Saturday, exit polls showed, giving them a mandate to press ahead with belated economic reforms.</p>
<p>The UDF, which led a winter of unrest amid an economic crisis and forced the former ruling Socialists to hold the polls two years early, drew 56.5 percent of votes along with minor coalition allies, Gallup polling agency said.</p>
<p>The vote for the reformist grouping would be enough to give it an absolute majority in the 240-seat parliament, as had been widely predicted.</p>
<p>The exit poll of 7,000 voters gave the ex-communist Socialists only 19 percent and predicted three smaller parties would also enter parliament.</p>
<p>UDF leader Ivan Kostov, likely to become new prime minister, quickly claimed victory.</p>
<p>&quot;The first demand was for a reformist majority. Here it is, it is the UDF coalition,&quot; he said. &quot;The minimum programme has been fulfilled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The victory is expected,&quot; said Valentin Vassilev, a senior UDF official. &quot;But for us the end of the campaign does not means the end of difficulties, as we have to govern a country ruined by the Socialists.&quot;</p>
<p>President Petar Stoyanov, voting in Sofia, said Bulgaria had to catch up its reformist neighbours after squandering years since the overthrow of communist dictatorship in 1989.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no time to waste. We lost the chance we had with the fall of the Iron Curtain and now we must catch up.&quot;</p>
<p>An interim cabinet led by Sofia's UDF mayor Stefan Sofianski has run the country since February, winning pledges of $1.2 billion from international lenders and kicking off the reform process the new government must continue.</p>
<p>A restrictive fixed exchange rate regime is due to be introduced in June to instil monetary discipline and restore confidence in the lev currency, which went into free fall in January while Bulgaria was without effective government.</p>
<p>&quot;We extend our hand for the implementation of the four priorities of national government,&quot; UDF leader Kostov said.</p>
<p>&quot;Agreement with international financial institutions and introduction of a currency board, war against organised crime and corruption, with the criminal state, opening the (secret police) files of politicians and leading magistrates, and Bulgarian membership of NATO and of the European Union.</p>
<p>&quot;Support for these principles will be the basis for us to accept the hand offered by other parties (in coalition).&quot;</p>
<p>Annual inflation was more than 2,000 percent in March and the planned overhaul of communist-era state firms will add to unemployment already at 14.5 percent.</p>
<p>The Gallup poll also gave the Union for National Salvation coalition seven percent, Euroleft six, and the Bulgarian Business Bloc 5.5 percent, all above the four percent threshold to win seats in parliament.</p>
<p>Another exit poll by Fakt agency gave similar results and put turnout at 70 percent. Preliminary official results are expected early on Sunday.</p>
<p>After communist leader Todor Zhivkov was toppled in 1989, leading communists re-emerged as the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and continued in government. The UDF won elections in 1991 but their government collapsed after only 11 months.</p>
<p>The left still draws support from the old who remember hardline commmunism as a time at least of stability.</p>
<p>Pensioner Mihail Koev said he was supporting the tiny rump unreformed communist party. &quot;I have spent all my life building socialism and now if I support the UDF or the BSP I may have to spend the rest of my life building capitalism,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Student Boyan Roussev, who took part in street theatre in the January protests, was at the other end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>&quot;I am going to vote for the UDF because this is why we spent so many days on the streets and nights on the barricades -- to topple the communists,&quot; he said. &quot;But if they lie to us, I promise I will be the first to go back on the streets.&quot;</p>
