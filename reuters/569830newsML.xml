<p>A group of former AT&amp;T Corp executives Thursday announced plans to form a new company aimed at providing competitive local telephone services.</p>
<p>The company, called OneComm L.L.C., was founded by wireless services pioneer Craig McCaw and three original employees of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc, which was acquired by AT&amp;T in 1994.</p>
<p>Wayne Perry, vice chairman of AT&amp;T Wireless Services, will become chairman of the new company.  Steve Hooper, president and chief executive officer of AT&amp;T Wireless Services, will become president, and Gerry Salemme, an AT&amp;T vice president of federal government affairs, will become executive vice president of government and industry relations of the new company.</p>
<p>The executives will resign from AT&amp;T effective May 12, but OneComm said they will continue to be available to the company for advice on a range of issues.</p>
<p>&quot;We formed OneComm because we're entrepreneurs at heart and we believe that opening up the local markets to competition is the most important effort in telecommunications today,&quot; said Perry.</p>
