<headline>China's top Catholic church official dies at 80.</headline>

<p>Bishop Joseph Zong Huaide, the most senior member of China's state-backed Catholic church, has died in Beijing at the age of 80, officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Bishop Zong died of a heart attack in a Beijing hospital, said an official of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body of which Zong had been a standing committee member.</p>
<p>Zong was chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, a Beijing-sponsored organisation that is responsible for China's Catholics but maintains no links with the Vatican. He was also chairman of the Chinese Catholic Bishops' College.</p>
<p>An official of the association said the funeral would take place after a national holiday to mark the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty on July 1.</p>
<p>Zong was born in eastern Shandong province in 1917, graduated from a Catholic seminary in the provincial capital Jinan and became a priest in a local village in 1943.</p>
<p>He was imprisoned for several years during the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution when all China's churches were closed and the faithful persecuted, but he re-emerged in 1980 to take up a position in the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association.</p>
<p>In an interview last year, Zong said China's Catholic churches were prepared for normalisation of ties with the Vatican.</p>
<p>However, he said the Vatican's diplomatic recognition of Beijing's island rival Taiwan and a requirement that Rome should not interfere in China' domestic affairs continued to divide the two sides.</p>
<p>Official figures say China has some four million Catholics, although church organisations and Western academics estimate the number as closer to 8-10 million.</p>
<p>The underground church, loyal to Rome, is believed to be even larger.</p>
