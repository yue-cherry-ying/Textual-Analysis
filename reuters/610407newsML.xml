<p>-----------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - May 23---------------</p>
<p>Gold is expected to move towards the lower end of its $340.00/$345.00 an ounce trade range on Friday, traders and chartists said.</p>
<p>Devoid of market-moving news, gold was likely to be influenced by the dollar, which was steady in early European trading.</p>
<p>Silver was expected to drift lower while platinum might test $385.00 support.  </p>
<p>GOLD - Seen pressured lower but unlikely to break below support at $340.00 on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is trending lower and is not been helped by the dollar,&quot; one trader said, adding gold would hold above $340.00. &quot;Even if that gives way there is further support at $339.00/$339.50,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Referring to the Comex June gold contract, Martin Squires of Rudolf Wolff said, &quot;With the firming dollar and the continued downward bias of the technical indicators we favour a return to test key support at $339.50.&quot;</p>
<p>On the charts a downtrend line joining the highs of May 14, 15, 16 and 22 should offer resistance.</p>
<p>Resistance is also likely to be found from the downtrending 30-day moving average at around $342.83.</p>
<p>At 0730 GMT spot gold was quoted at $341.50/341.90, against Thursday's London close of $342.50/$343.00.  </p>
<p>SILVER - Might move to test support at $4.60 against a backdrop of downtrending charts and gold's gentle drift lower.</p>
<p>On the charts the 10-day moving average was moving towards a downside cross on its 30-day counterpart.</p>
<p>A break below $4.60 could see a slump to the March 1995 lows of $4.56 and 4.38. &quot;At the moment levels around $4.60 are important,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>At 0745 spot silver was indicated at $4.66/$4.68, down two cents.</p>
<p>PLATINUM - Lower, but should hold support at $385.00.</p>
<p>This weeks news that Russia would resume PGMs exports should keep the market on a defensive footing.</p>
<p>At 0750 GMT platinum was indicated at $387.25/$388.25, against $387.75/$388.75.</p>
