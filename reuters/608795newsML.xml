<p>Leading Russian shares firmed in late afternoon trade on Friday on news of a management shakeup at national electricity utility UES, traders said.</p>
<p>But they did not see significant market movement by closing.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been pretty quiet all day, until a few hours ago,&quot; said Renaissance Capital trader Dmitry Kryukov. News earlier in the afternoon that UES vice-president Boris Brevnov would become chief executive had pushed UES prices higher.</p>
<p>Market leader UES jumped to $0.3205 at 5.40 p.m. (1340 GMT) from $0.3180 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Brevnov replaces Anatoly Dyakov as UES president. Dyakov (corrects from Brevnov) will retain his position as UES chairman.</p>
<p>CentreInvest Securities trader Alexander Pankov said potential sellers and buyers were largely balanced on the market and predicted the Russian Trading System 22-share index would be little changed by the end of trade.</p>
<p>It had edged down to 356.41 at 4 p.m. (1200 GMT) from Thursday's close of 359.04.</p>
<p>Natural gas group Gazprom showed the market's highest turnover, about $31 million to UES's $14 million. Gazprom firmed to $0.656 from $0.628 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Kryukov said some shareholders were nervous ahead of next month's annual meeting. He said a number of big blockholders were being traded.</p>
<p>Gazprom and UES are at the heart of a government campaign to revamp the country's natural monopolies, huge industries with no competition.</p>
