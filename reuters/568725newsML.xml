<p>Opener Aamir Sohail has apologised to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in a move to get his two-year ban from international and domestic cricket lifted.</p>
<p>A board spokesman said on Thursday the PCB council would meet within a week to decide whether to pardon Sohail or reduce the ban imposed last month for alleged violation of the board's code of conduct.</p>
<p>The apology, described as unconditional by the spokesman, follows a deal proposed last week by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's adviser on sports and culture, Mushahid Hussain, that Sohail must apologise and the PCB lift the ban.</p>
<p>A PCB disciplinary committee had announced the ban on April 16 after a month's suspension of the left-hander over a row with PCB chief executive Majid Khan during a domestic one-day game.</p>
<p>The three-man committee had found Sohail guilty of breaching the code of conduct by levelling what it called baseless charges of match-fixing and betting against some national team members.</p>
<p>Sohail has played 34 tests, scoring 2,103 runs at an average of 35.64.</p>
