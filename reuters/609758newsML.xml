<title>USA: NYMEX oil complex called lower, trade seen slow.</title>
<headline>NYMEX oil complex called lower, trade seen slow.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>NYMEX crude oil and refined product futures were called lower Friday tracking activity overnight on ACCESS and in London on the IPE, amid views trade would be light ahead of the U.S. Memorial Day holiday.</p>
<p>But traders said the expiry of June product options could provide some fireworks ahead of weekend, which will keep the NYMEX closed until Monday evening's ACCESS session.</p>
<p>There was no news occupying traders' minds.</p>
<p>Crude oil was called 10 to 15 cents lower after the July contract settled Thursday unchanged at $21.86 a barrel.</p>
<p>The products were called 0.25 to 0.50 cent lower, after June unleaded rose by 0.40 cent on Thursday to settle at 66.93 cents a gallon, and June heating oil settled 0.25 cent higher at 57.80 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>Some players still have hopes gasoline will seize control of the market, since the so-called driving season begins this holiday weekend, and abstract implied demand figures will give way to a real sense of demand at the pump, where prices are lower this year than last.</p>
<p>But gasoline lost more than during the overnight ACCESS session, amid concerns that with refinery utilization rates so high, U.S. players may already be killing the gasoline goose that typically lays one of the oil market's most prized golden eggs at this of year.</p>
