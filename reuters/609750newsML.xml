<headline>GM sees continued N. American profit growth.</headline>
<dateline>WILMINGTON, Del. 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>General Motors Corp said Friday it expects its North American Operations to continue to show improved profitability in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;For the remainder of 1997, we expect our North American Operations to continue showing the kind of progress demonstrated in its highly profitable first quarter,&quot; GM Chairman John Smith Jr said in a statement released from Wilmington, where GM is holding its annual meeting.</p>
<p>GM's North American Operations reported net income of $764 million for the first quarter -- the best performance in more than a decade.  </p>
<p>Sales of GM vehicles outside North America totaled 3.1 million vehicles in 1996 -- about 37 percent of GM's total worldwide sales.</p>
<p>Smith said five new manufacturing complexes are under construction -- in Argentina, Brazil, Poland, Thailand and China. He said Thailand and China are keys to markets in Asia.</p>
<p>Last week GM received a business license for its $1.6 billion deal to build Buick midsize cars in China. The company said it is also negotiating with Chinese officials for joint ventures to produce engines, Opel cars and light-duty trucks.  </p>
<p>&quot;We project that half of all our new-vehicle sales will come from outside North America shortly after the turn of the century,&quot; Smith said, citing the International Monetary Fund's projection that the world economy is now set to grow at the fastest rate in more than a decade.</p>
<p>Smith also told stockholders that GM expects to present to shareholders later this year a proposal to spin off the defense business of its Hughes Electronics Corp subsidiary.</p>
<p>He also said GM's Delphi Automotive Systems continues grow business outside the North American Operations vehicle groups, and is on track to meet its goal of 50 percent non-GM-North American Operations sales by the end of the year 2002.</p>
<p>&quot;General Motors intends to become a growth company once again,&quot; Smith said.</p>
