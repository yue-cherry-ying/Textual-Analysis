<headline>USWC crude trade thin as buyers watch for imports.</headline>

<p>Spot trade for U.S. West Coast crudes was sluggish early Tuesday, as refiners assessed demand for May and waited for imports to be offered amid tight Alaska crude prices, traders said.</p>
<p>Alaska North Slope (ANS), which has been relatively high the last month, eased Monday amid talk that a major refiner in California was buying 1.5 million barrels of Ecuadorian crude (Oriente) through June.</p>
<p>ANS sold early yesterday at $1.02 off West Texas Intermediate (WTI), an 11-cent fall from the mid-March market price.  </p>
<p>Despite Monday's ANS deal, major seller BP offered ANS at $0.90 under WTI.</p>
<p>Oriente's seller, Petroecuador, set term contract prices at -$2.56 off ANS last week and despite the losing price for lifters, traders, said West Coast would win cargoes at $1.00 off ANS, once transportation was included.</p>
<p>&quot;I really feel confident that's the number that's going to get done,&quot; said a trader for a small California refinery.</p>
<p>He said weak sour grade in the U.S. Gulf would encourage trading houses Glencore and Tripetrol to ship more Oriente to California.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't have the flood of sour crudes the Gulf Caost has,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>In California markets, producers sold spot barrels of California Wilmington crude at 0.85 and 0.79 cents a barrels, traders said. The grade, used to make asphalt, has began to rise ahead of summertime repair work on roads.</p>
<p>Other California grades were flat, with trade sapped the last week by the Easter holiday and scheduling on Line 63.</p>
