<p>Intimate letters written by Britain's wartime leader Winston Churchill to his younger brother Jack during World War One are to come under the hammer at Sotheby's auctioneers on Thursday.</p>
<p>Described by Sotheby's manuscript specialist Peter Beal as &quot;the most important series of letters by Churchill ever to appear at auction&quot;, the 17 handwritten letters are likely to fetch between 75,000 and 100,000 pounds ($125,000 and $167,000).</p>
<p>&quot;That's what we expect them to go for, but who knows -- anything could happen,&quot; said Beal.</p>
<p>Churchill, who led Britain through World War Two as prime minister of a coalition government, was voted the most outstanding European of the 20th century by an international panel of intellectuals this week.</p>
<p>Addressed to &quot;my dearest Jack&quot;, a soldier in the British forces, his letters date from August 1914, just three weeks after the start of World War One.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a great moment in the history of the world and our small country and we must all try to act so as to make them like to read about it in the years that will follow...Unless we win I do not want to live any more. But win we will,&quot; Churchill said.</p>
<p>Beal likened the sale to a similar one two years ago of Churchill's speech notes written at the time of the battle of El Alamein, a turning point in the allies' north African campaign. Valued around 9,000 pounds, they fetched more than three times that sum at auction.</p>
<p>Churchill's letters to his brother, which have never before been made public, are rated as especially valuable since they include his personal feelings about the war, its leaders and their policies.</p>
<p>&quot;These letters were written to his closest relation and they express his true feelings about what was going on at this crucial stage in the war,&quot; said Beal.</p>
<p>Penned in sloping grey ink, many of the letters are marked &quot;private&quot; or &quot;secret&quot;.</p>
<p>A letter dated October 16, 1914 reads: &quot;My heart marched with you down the road to Dunkirk. God guard you and bring you home.&quot;</p>
<p>A year later Churchill, who repeatedly wrote of his frustration at not being at the front line, decided to join the army and went on to fight in the trenches in France.</p>
<p>A major reason for this was his dismissal in May 1915 from his office of First Lord of the Admiralty following the disastrous Dardanelles campaign which he masterminded.</p>
<p>The offensive, which was intended to break through Turkey to join up with Russian troops and open up a southern front against Germany, failed to surprise the enemy forces. They launched a counter-attack that resulted in more than 28,000 deaths and more than 96,000 injured on the British side.</p>
<p>Many of the letters express Churchill's anguish over the failed offensive and his long-lasting conviction that, with better planning and execution, it could have succeeded.</p>
<p>&quot;History will vindicate the conception and the errors in execution will on the whole leave me clear,&quot; he wrote in January 1916.</p>
<p>The letters, which are privately owned, will front a variety of manuscripts, first edition novels and memorabilia to be sold in Sotheby's biannual sale of English literature and history.</p>
<p>Also of interest are a set of first-hand accounts of the action at the Turkish port of Gallipoli, part of the Dardanelles attack, including 15 pencil-written letters from a beach-landing officer to his wife. ($ = 0.596 British Pounds)</p>
