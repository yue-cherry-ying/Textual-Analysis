<p>The Senate on Thursday approved a bill to provide relief for disaster-stricken states that President Bill Clinton has threatened to veto if it arrives on his desk with a Republican provision to bar a government shutdown.</p>
<p>Democrats charged this provision was another sign Republicans were attempting to renege on a balanced budget deal reached with the White House last week.</p>
<p>The disaster appropriations was approved on a 77-22 vote, but could be changed next week when the House considers it. It must go back to the Senate for a final vote since under the U.S. Constitution all spending bills must originate in the House.</p>
<p>White House budget director Franklin Raines reiterated President Clinton's threat to veto the disaster relief bill despite a small change the Senate made Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The legislation would put the government on automatic funding after the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year, a situation Democrats said would remove any incentive for passage of spending increases agreed to in the just-concluded balanced budget deal. The Senate raised the level of automatic funding to 100 percent of this year's amount from 98 percent as proposed, but this did not ease White House concerns.</p>
<p>Such disputes forced two government shutdowns in 1996 which polls showed the public blamed on Republicans.</p>
<p>The House held off votes on its version until next week.</p>
<p>The government has had the funds to help victims of floods and other disasters but the $5.5 billion would replenish money spent by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The bill also spends about $2 billion for U.S. military activities in Bosnia and to maintain the no-fly zone in the Gulf.</p>
<p>Another potential roadblock, a dispute over the waiver of environmental protection laws in flood control projects, was resolved with an amendment to permit the waiver of Environmental Protection Agency rules if lives or property are in danger.</p>
<p>Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle said they were ready to move the disaster relief legislation quickly to the White House for a veto. Then, he said, Democrats would have the votes to sustain Clinton's position and could approve disaster relief funds without the automatic funding provision.</p>
<p>&quot;It just completely undermines our whole (budget) negotiation,&quot; Daschle of South Dakota said of the automatic funding. He expressed concern that key parts of the budget agreement were coming unravelled. The disputes over details on the budget will make it very difficult to sell the final plan to Democrats, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, if we're already three or four days later reneging on those levels, then it's hard for me to go back to my caucus and say we really do achieve what I'd hoped we had,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>He and House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt were angered by comments from the key House tax writer who suggested Clinton would not receive the $35 billion in tax cuts for education as Republican leaders had agreed last week. A spokeswoman for House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Christina Martin, said the leaders agreed to reach as close to that amount as possible.</p>
<p>Gephardt said he was reserving judgment on the budget deal. &quot;One thing you can't do is make a judgment on a blank piece of paper,&quot; the Missouri Democrat said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the problem we've got is that the other side is now trying to rewrite and change what, I believe, our negotiators thought was agreed to,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But budget negotiators in the House and Senate said talks were continuing. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and other administration officials met with top lawmakers during the day to work out details.</p>
<p>Budget Committees in both chambers expect to have details ready for votes by their panels next week. The budget agreement is designed to bring the deficit to zero -- or into surplus -- by 2002 with spending cuts in Medicare health care for the elderly and other domestic programmes. It also provides a $85 billion net tax cut over five years.</p>
