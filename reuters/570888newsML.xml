<p>Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Thursday he will grant full powers to his deputy Anwar Ibrahim to run the country when he goes overseas for two months later in May.</p>
<p>Mahathir, who will visit several European nations on a work-and-vacation mission starting on May 19, said he had confidence in Anwar and Malaysia's political stability.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be full powers for Anwar as acting prime minister,&quot; Mahathir told a news conference on Thursday after returning from a working visit to three African states.</p>
<p>Anwar, also Malaysia's finance minister, is seen as a successor to Mahathir.</p>
<p>News of Mahathir's leave -- his longest since becoming prime minister in 1981 -- led to speculation in financial markets on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the speculation, centred on the 71-year-old prime minister's health, among other things, led to the some weakness in the ringgit.</p>
<p>But Mahathir, who had a heart operation eight years ago, dismissed any talk he was ill.</p>
<p>&quot;I am fine as you can see,&quot; a cheerful-looking Mahathir told reporters.</p>
<p>Mahathir also rejected suggestions he was trying to test the leadership of Anwar, 49. &quot;There's no need for me to test anyone. I have confidence in him,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mahathir said the purpose of his overseas mission would be &quot;to wrap up some work and perform several working visits&quot;.</p>
<p>Several ministers said on Wednesday the premier would visit Britain, Poland and Russia to promote Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor -- a planned high-tech zone which will extend south from the capital Kuala Lumpur.</p>
