<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle Friday traded at $66.00 per cwt, down $1.00 from the bulk of this week's sales on Tuesday, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Sales were thin ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend. All major U.S. beef plants will be closed Monday in observance of the holiday.</p>
<p>Fed cattle prices this week slipped $2.00 from last week's top of $68.00 amid lower beef prices and ideas that feedlot supplies were expanding into the summer. The projection for added supplies spurred some feedlots to sell at lower prices just to remain current, market sources said.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are some afraid that fed cattle will trade at $65.00 next week after the holiday,&quot; said Dail Benson, livestock analyst with Dean-Witter Reynolds.</p>
<p>Slower beef demand was reflected in reduced fabricated beef movement despite increased slaughter, compared with the previous week, Benson said. Beef movement through Thursday this week totaled 1,004 loads, compared with 1,191 for the same period last week, USDA statistics showed.</p>
<p>Beef prices at midday Friday were quoted up $0.03 to down $0.42 per cwt, with heavyweight choice quoted down $0.18 at $104.46, USDA reported.</p>
<p>The heavier-weight choice at midday was down $1.27 comapared with last Friday's close.</p>
