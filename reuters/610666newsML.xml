<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mostly down on Friday with sentiment being hurt due to the recent crackdown on the stock markets, traders said.</p>
<p>But the annual rate for the most actively traded seven-day contract closed unchanged at 12 percent due to heavy new domestic A share issues, they said.</p>
<p>Total turnover of the six-contract market fell sharply to 6.55 million lots from 9.6 million lots.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.  </p>
<p>Traders said the recent crackdown on the stock markets had made sentiment on the repo market cautious.</p>
<p>&quot;Sharp fluctuations in stock prices have made traders cautious, preventing many institutions from trading on the repo market,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Three new A share issues on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges on Friday boosted activity in early-maturing contracts, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said the trend next week would very much depend on the performance of the stock markets.  </p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mixed on Friday with the recent crackdown on the stock markets making investors cautious on the spot market as well, traders said.</p>
<p>The most actively traded three-year bond that matures in 1999 fell to 108.60 yuan from 108.68 yuan.</p>
<p>Combined volume of the seven-contract market fell sharply to 509,708 lots from 918,726 lots.</p>
<p>&quot;The recent volatility on the stock markets has made investors cautious with money flowing out of all the capital markets, including the spot market,&quot; one trader said.</p>
