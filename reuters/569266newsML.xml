<p>The share price of Atacocha soared 9.02 percent in early trade Thursday on the Lima Stock Exchange due to positive factors attracting investors to the polymetal miner, brokers said</p>
<p>After two hours trade Thursday, Atacocha had climbed to 1.45 soles in strong volume of 672,000 shares, preliminary bolsa figures showed. The miner also saw healthy gains Wednesday as it climbed 4.76 percent to 1.32 soles on strong volume of 816,000 shares.  </p>
<p>Elevated international zinc prices Thursday was the main reason for the rise, Luis Cueva of local brokerage Argos said.</p>
<p>&quot;Zinc prices have soared and it is affecting more than just Atacocha,&quot; Cueva said.</p>
<p>Also strong first quarter financial results and the implementation of a workforce reduction program have recently made the miner attractive, brokers said.  </p>
<p>But these three factors did not fully explain Thursday's sudden rush for Atacocha and the sought-after mining stock  would probably lose some of its gains by the end of Thursday's session, according to Alicia Campos, mining analyst at local brokerage Provalor.</p>
<p>Another polymetallic miner Morococha also rose strongly in Thursday's early trade gaining 7.26 percent in the first two hours to stand at 3.40 soles after climbing 10.07 percent Wednesday.  Volume Thursday in Morococha was modest as 93,000 shares changed hands in the opening two hours, compared to its strong volume of 796,000 shares in Wednesday's four-and-a-half-hour session. The miner announced Phelps Dodge Corp. had bought a 27 percent stake in the firm earlier this week.</p>
<p>Miners -- especially zinc producers -- have dominated the Lima bolsa this year as the sector's stocks have gained almost 80 percent since the start of 1997, according to the exchange's figures.</p>
