<title>SPAIN: Peseta debt/interbank market closing report.</title>
<headline>Peseta debt/interbank market closing report.</headline>

<p>Spain's debt market proved resilient on Thursday, recovering quickly from initial losses to close slightly higher as soon as U.S. Treasuries bounced back, dealers said.</p>
<p>Though prices near record highs were suggesting a cautious approach, traders said government bonds were well supported by positive inflation expectations. The April Consumer Price Index due out next week is seen falling below 2.0 percent yearly.</p>
<p>&quot;The inflation rate next week is a key factor. Long-term futures can easily go above the 115 level,&quot; a Madrid dealer said.  </p>
<p>Another sharp drop in CPI in April could prompt the Bank of Spain to cut rates by 25 basis points for the fourth time so far this year, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Today the stars in the market were two-year bonds. Dealers bought that segment in anticipation of a possible rate cut as early as Friday next week,&quot; a dealers said.</p>
<p>The April 1999 Bond, coupon 9.4 percent, ended at around 107.43/53, with a yield at 5.28 percent down from 5.31 pct.</p>
