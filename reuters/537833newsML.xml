<p>India's ambassador to Saudi Arabia said on Thursday 55 Indians were now confirmed dead after last week's fierce fire at a haj pilgrimage site which claimed more than 300 lives.</p>
<p>&quot;The dead are 55. The missing are 247. Persons who are injured but who are staying in their normal place of stay is 163 and persons who are in hospital are 191, but I am waiting for an update on that (last figure),&quot; Ambassador Mohammad Hamad Ansari told Reuters by telephone from Riyadh.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia said last week that 343 people died and more than 1,500 were injured in the April 15 blaze which raged through 70,000 tents at Mena near the holy city of Mecca.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether the Indian victims were accounted for in the official death toll, which has not be updated since April 16.</p>
<p>About 80,000 Indians performed the haj this year.</p>
<p>Diplomats and officials said identification of bodies was hard because so many had been charred beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Witnesses said many victims burnt to death in the fire, others suffocated from the deadly fumes while some were crushed by a stampede as panic gripped the pilgrims.</p>
<p>Some diplomats said the week-old death toll could end up higher than already announced in view of the critical condition of some victims being treated at Saudi hospitals.</p>
