<p>Some sportsmen are almost as well known for their footwear as their feats.</p>
<p>Take George Weah's red football boots, or Mike Tyson's black boxing boots, for example.</p>
<p>Could marathon man Martin Fiz be about to follow in their footsteps in the world championships on Sunday?</p>
<p>Spain's defending champion has decided to revert to wearing the white running shoes that helped him to victory in Gothenburg two years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;After I won in Gothenburg, I put them in a glass case in my home,&quot; Fiz said on Friday. &quot;But I have wondered all year whether I should have worn them at the Olympics after I failed to get a medal in Atlanta.&quot;</p>
<p>Two weeks ago Fiz broke open the glass case and tried on his running shoes for the first time in nearly two years and made his mind up to use them on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Spaniard starts as much as favourite as anyone else in what is often an unpredictable event despite finishing fourth at the Atlanta Olympics after miscalculating his pace.</p>
<p>Since then he has bounced back from that disappointment, and a subsequent below-par run in New York last November, with a personal best of two hours eight minutes five seconds in March when winning the Lake Biwa Marathon in Japan.</p>
<p>Fiz, 34, has now triumphed in six out of his nine outings at the marathon.</p>
<p>However, he remained cautious about whether he would win his 10th effort over the classic distance and retain his title.</p>
<p>&quot;Really, many people could win the race on Sunday. There's the Mexicans, many Africans and of course the Japanese.&quot;</p>
<p>One thing Fiz was adamant about was the fact that the combined effects of the heat, pollution and hills could make the this year's race the slowest world championship marathon ever.</p>
<p>As a he is only able to compete in his specialist event two or three times a year, Fiz also called on the International Amateur Athletic Federation to increase the prize money for the world championship marathons.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a question of energy. I am sure 100 metres runners expend as much energy in their races as marathon runners,&quot; Fiz added.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a question of how frequently we can run at our best. And sprinters like Donovan Bailey can run well every few days.&quot;</p>
