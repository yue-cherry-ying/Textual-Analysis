<p>Chilean stocks retreated from their afternoon peak on Friday but still closed at their highest level since 1994, as fading concerns over drought fueled demand for electricity shares, traders said.</p>
<p>The IPSA index of the 40 most-traded shares ended at 125.22 points, up 1.24 percent. The general IGPA index ended 0.82 percent higher at 5491.97 points on trading of shares worth 36.6 billion pesos, the highest volume of the year.  </p>
<p>Heavy rains in Santiago this week and a buy recommendation from ING Barings for Endesa shares were enough to send electricity shares soaring, especially those of hydroelectric utilities hit hard by the drought.</p>
<p>Endesa ended 2.4 percent higher at 278 pesos, and Colbun SA rose 1.3 percent to 39.50 pesos.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is now betting that there won't be electricity rationing this year after all, and for that reason electrical shares are rising,&quot; said an economist at a major Santiago brokerage.  </p>
<p>Fossil fuel generator Chilgener also rose, ending 0.3 percent higher at 167 pesos.</p>
<p>Shares prices in the sector had sagged amid concerns that falling water levels at reservoirs would force hydroelectric suppliers to spend more on fossil fuels, brokers said.</p>
<p>Central bank figures showing 3.4 percent economic growth in March and 3.9 percent in the first quarter were on the low end of analysts' expectations, but still within normal range, they said.</p>
