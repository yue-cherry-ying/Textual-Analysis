<p>South Africa's Inkatha Freedom Party was hampering a truth commission probe into abuses against it by Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, comission chairman Desmond Tutu said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had to cancel a special hearing devoted to atrocities carried out by ANC supporters in KwaZulu-Natal (province) because of a lack of cooperation from within Inkatha Freedom Party structures,&quot; Tutu told a news conference.</p>
<p>A Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) spokesman said the hearing would have dealt with ANC attacks on an IFP stronghold. He could not say when the attacks occured or how many people were killed.</p>
<p>Fighting for dominance in KwaZulu-Natal province between South Africa's two largest black political parties has killed over 14,000 people and caused thousands more to flee over the past decade.</p>
<p>Buthelezi has accused the commission, which was set up to probe 30 years of human rights abuses during the apartheid era, of being biased in favour of the ruling ANC.</p>
<p>Tutu said the TRC had made &quot;some important progress&quot; in persuading Inkatha to assist the commission.</p>
<p>But Tutu warned that time was running out for the TRC, which has to complete its two-year probe at the end of this year into human rights abuses by all sides.</p>
<p>&quot;We have begged parties like the IFP, please, if you do not tell your side of the story the report will be skewed...This commission belongs to all of us.&quot;</p>
