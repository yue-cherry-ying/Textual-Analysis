<headline>Ceasefire group says Israel, guerrillas set bombs.</headline>
<dateline>NAQOURA, Lebanon 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>A five-nation group monitoring a ceasefire understanding in Lebanon said on Thursday Israel or its allies placed a bomb that killed two civilians and wounded two in a Shi'ite Moslem town in south Lebanon on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It also said Lebanese guerrillas placed a bomb near a south Lebanon village a day earlier which injured four Lebanese civilians and two fighters of the pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army (SLA) militia.</p>
<p>Under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire understanding of April 26, 1996, which ended a 17-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon, both sides are barred from carrying out attacks on or from inhabited areas of Lebanon or Israel.</p>
<p>The group, which comprises the United States, France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon, said both actions breached the ceasefire understanding.</p>
<p>&quot;The Monitoring Group accepted as factual that Israeli forces or those cooperating with them placed four explosive devices at the site of an unfinished building near inhabited houses in Nabatiyeh,&quot; the monitoring group said in a statement after examining complaints by both sides.</p>
<p>&quot;The explosion of three of these devices killed two civilians and injured two others. The remaining device, which was examined by the Group, had Hebrew markings,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;With regard to the Israeli complaint, the Monitoring Group accepted as factual that a Lebanese armed group placed an explosive device at a cinder block workshop near inhabited houses in the environs of el-Klea. The target was military. The explosion injured civilians as well as soldiers cooperating with Israeli forces,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Monitoring Group determined that placement of such explosive devices in a civilian populated area violates the April 26, 1996, understanding,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The April agreement reserves the right of guerrillas to fight Israeli troops holding a 15 km (nine-mile) -wide occupation zone.</p>
<p>The pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God) leads an Islamic resistance committed to ousting Israeli troops and the SLA from south Lebanon.</p>
