<p>Fresh firefights broke out in the capital of Congo Brazzaville on Saturday, the third day of a standoff pitting supporters of ex-president Denis Sassou Nguesso against soldiers and political and ethnic rivals.</p>
<p>Witnesses and a Western diplomatic source spoke of isolated if intense clashes and heavy looting in some parts of the city, which the rival forces carved up into no-go areas. Relative calm returned by late afternoon.</p>
<p>There was no reliable death toll although police sources spoke of several dozen.</p>
<p>Witnesses reported at least a dozen bodies in the streets on Friday and one senior police officer told Reuters that 22 members of a police rapid intervention squad, including their commanders, were killed in a clash that day.</p>
<p>The police officer said fighting mainly pitted gunmen from Sassou Nguesso's Mboshi tribe and members of the Kouyou tribe of former president and prime minister Jacques Joachim Yhombi Opango, Lissouba's campaign manager.</p>
<p>&quot;There are many dead and wounded on both sides,&quot; the police officer told Reuters.</p>
<p>Fighting between supporters of Sassou Nguesso and Yhombi Opango in the north has killed 16 people in under a month.</p>
<p>The Brazzaville clashes began after Lissouba's government ordered a crackdown on private militias and unauthorised possession of weapons ahead of a presidential election planned for July 27.</p>
<p>Sassou Nguesso has accused Lissouba of fomenting violence to postpone the election.</p>
<p>His supporters, more lightly armed but more mobile than the army, appeared to be trying to take control of Maya Maya international airport, the diplomatic source said.</p>
<p>Witnesses reported the occasional boom of cannon fire.</p>
<p>Political parties armed their supporters after 1993 parliamentary elections. At that time, ethnic and political clashes killed 2,000 people in the capital. The militias were supposed to have been disbanded.</p>
<p>The latest standoff began on Thursday when troops surrounded the northern suburban home of Sassou Nguesso, a former Marxist military leader named president in 1979 but voted out of office with the advent of democratic reform in 1992.</p>
<p>Officials said troops had gone there to arrest members of his entourage on murder charges in connection with the incidents in the north but they resisted.</p>
<p>Lissouba, Sassou Nguesso and Brazzaville mayor and 1992 presidential runner-up Bernard Kolelas are likely to be the front-runners among about a dozen hopefuls on July 27, if the polls take place.</p>
<p>Kolelas's supporters control southern suburbs on the Congo River. Witnesses said they had closed off their area. Troops from the French Foreign Legion guarded the French ambassador's residence there. Kolelas tried to mediate, his officials said.</p>
<p>International telephone links with Congo Brazzaville, which is dwarfed by Laurent Kabila's Democratic Republic of Congo to the south, have been down since Friday. Telephone contacts remained possible through residents or visitors plugged into the mobile telephone network in Kabila's Congo.</p>
