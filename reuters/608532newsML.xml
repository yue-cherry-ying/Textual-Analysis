<p>The UK spot natural gas market was mostly rangebound and relatively quiet on Friday, traders and brokers said, with interest seen for short term gas as some traders squared their positions ahead of the bank holiday weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;The opening prices today on both the bid and the offer were very similar to the close yesterday,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>He said that June had closed on Thursday bid at 11.40 pence and offered at 11.60 pence a therm and had then opened at the same level on Friday morning. A stand-off between buyers and sellers then persisted for much of the morning, he added, before trade was eventually concluded at least twice at 11.45 pence a therm.</p>
<p>In other months the story was similar. Deals were done in the third, fourth and first quarters as well as in the summer 1998 strip, all within or near the closing levels seen yesterday.</p>
<p>The only exception was the day ahead, where a deal was done at 11.90 pence a therm. This is significantly above recent day-ahead prices and especially striking because the day ahead in question is a Saturday when prices are normally lower than for weekdays. The price may have been affected by the volume, dealers said, which at 550,000 therms was well above the normal lot size seen.</p>
<p>The market was generally subdued, with several of those who had been away from their desks on Thursday watching cricket reported to have taken a day off on Friday to take advantage of the long bank holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The IPE futures market was also quiet, with only 10 lots done, following a blank day on Thursday when no trade was done at all. Prices in the traded months of July and September slipped by, respectively, 0.13 pence and 0.14 pence a therm to settle at 11.05 and 11.25 pence. But most other months saw settlement prices marginally up from the previous level, although the increases were generally so small that the futures market was, like the OTC market, effectively rangebound.</p>
