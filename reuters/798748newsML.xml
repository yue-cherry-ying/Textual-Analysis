<p>Health officials in former Soviet republic Georgia have warned hot-dog lovers that they may be getting rats, mice and old newspapers along with the ketchup and mustard.</p>
<p>Nukri Gugushvili, chief of the Veterinary Service in the capital Tbilisi, told Resonansi newspaper that several illegal underground factories were adding the rodents and chopped-up old newspapers to hot-dogs.</p>
<p>&quot;These factories are closed during the day but at night they begin their odious work,&quot; he said. &quot;Moreover, they pass off their products as having been produced by well-known local meat packing firms,&quot; said Gugushvili.</p>
<p>A Resonansi reporter who visited one of the factories said he had witnessed small children bringing in stacks of old newspapers which were ground up and made into hot dogs along with food colouring and mice.</p>
<p>&quot;I personally witnessed how one little mouse wound up in a batch of ground meat, thereby continuing its miserable existence as a hot-dog,&quot; wrote the reporter.</p>
<p>&quot;These factories are producing several hundreds of kilos of their poisonous products every night,&quot; said Gugushvili.</p>
<p>He said that apparently corrupt health inspectors knew of the practice but turned a blind eye.</p>
