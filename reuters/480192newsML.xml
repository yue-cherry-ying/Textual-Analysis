<p>Algerian soldiers killed more than 20 Moslem rebels in a huge search operation in the northeastern province of Tizi-Ouzou, an Algerian newspaper said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The troops ringed Sidi Ali Bounab forest near Tizi-Ouzou, 90 km (60 miles) east of Algiers, and killed the guerrillas in the night between Saturday and Sunday, said El Watan newspaper.</p>
<p>On Monday, the troops were besieging an unspecified number of Moslem rebels holed up in a cave in the same area, said El Watan without giving more details.</p>
<p>Algerian security forces have been out in force for the past few weeks, carrying out search operations against guerrillas ahead of the June 5 parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>More than 200 Moslem rebels have been killed in such operations, according to Algerian newspaper reports. The dead include some guerrilla leaders killed in Algiers last month in security force raids on their hideouts.</p>
<p>About 60,000 people have been killed in Algeria's violence pitting government forces against Moslem guerrillas since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead.</p>
