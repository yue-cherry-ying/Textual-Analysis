<p>Polish national soccer coach Antoni Piechniczek has resigned a week after his side lost 2-0 to England ending their chances of qualifying for next year's World Cup finals, PAP news agency reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Deputy coach Krzysztof Pawlak will take over for the time being, PAP added.</p>
<p>The agency did not cite reasons for Piechniczek's decision but his coaching style, since taking over a year ago, has aroused controversy.</p>
<p>Critics accused him of constantly changing line-ups and ignoring Polish players with foreign clubs because they sometimes could not meet his training demands.</p>
<p>Grzegorz Lato, the most capped footballer in Polish soccer history, told soccer magazine Pilka Nozna before the latest defeat that the current squad lacked character under Piechniczek's rule.</p>
<p>During a first stint as national coach, Piechniczek led Poland to third place in the 1982 finals in Spain and into the finals in Mexico in 1986.</p>
<p>He later continued his career as coach of the national squads of Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates before his return to Poland's top soccer post.</p>
