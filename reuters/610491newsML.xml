<title>AUSTRALIA: Bomb hoax aimed at Australian race row politician.</title>
<headline>Bomb hoax aimed at Australian race row politician.</headline>
<dateline>ADELAIDE 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Australian police said on Friday a hoax bomb addressed to race row politician Pauline Hanson had been found at a convention centre where she was expected to speak later next month.</p>
<p>Chief Superintendent Trevor Johnson told reporters the hoax bomb had been left outside the European Convention Centre in the suburbs of the South Australia state capital of Adelaide.</p>
<p>Johnson said a man telephoned a local media organisation on Thursday night and said &quot;there is a bomb at the convention centre where Hanson is to speak&quot;.</p>
<p>Police found a box wrapped in brown paper with the word &quot;bomb&quot; written on one side and &quot;For Pauline Hanson, more to come&quot; on another. Inside the package were three containers of flammable liquid but no detonating device.</p>
<p>Johnson said the bomb hoax was &quot;the act of people with a mischievous bent&quot;.</p>
<p>Hanson, an independent member in the Australian parliament, is hoping to launch her populist One Nation party in Adelaide, although the venue of the launch has not been announced.</p>
<p>Similar launches in Western Australia and Tasmania were disrupted by protesters, leading to difficulties in finding venues in other states.</p>
<p>Hanson's party opposes further immigration from Asia, wants Aboriginal welfare cut back and supports moves to overturn a national ban on semi-automatic rifles and shotguns.</p>
