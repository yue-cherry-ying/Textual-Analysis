<headline>AT&amp;T says CEO 1996 compensation down 14 pct.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>AT&amp;T Corp.'s outgoing Chairman Robert Allen took a 14 percent pay cut for 1996 -- to nearly $5.5 million from about $6.4 million in 1995 -- largely due to the lackluster performance of AT&amp;T stock, the telecommunications giant said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Allen's compensation package, determined by AT&amp;T board members, also contained no stock options or restricted stock grants, the company said in its 1997 proxy statement.</p>
<p>In contrast, Allen received stock options in 1995 estimated at the time to be worth up to $11 million based on certain stock performance goals, making his total pay package worth as much as $16 million.</p>
<p>The denial of stock options and the reduction in Allen's 1996 compensation package to nearly $5.5 million from about $6.4 million in 1995 reflected the decline in AT&amp;T stock, company spokeswoman Eileen Connolly said.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, the main decrease from the committee's vantage point is the reduction in shareowner value over the course of the year as represented by the stock price,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The value of AT&amp;T-related holdings of the company's shareholders fell 9 percent in 1996, while the S&amp;P 500 index rose 20 percent, the board's executive compensation committee found, according to the proxy statement.</p>
<p>Allen's rich pay package came under fire at AT&amp;T's annual meeting in April 1996 from shareholder activists, employees and union officials who criticized Allen for receiving the award at a time he was leading a drive to slash 40,000 jobs from AT&amp;T and its subsidaries.</p>
<p>Despite the ruckus raised over Allen's 1995 pay package, AT&amp;T's Connolly noted that the options remain valueless at the current stock price.</p>
<p>Allen is slated to leave his seat as chairman and chief executive to the current chief operating officer, John Walter, in 1998.</p>
<p>Allen's total 1996 compensation included an 18 percent reduction in his bonus to about $1.3 million from $1.5 million the previous year. The bonus was about 25 percent lower than the target level of $1.7 million, Connolly said.</p>
<p>The proxy cited lower-than-expected earnings due to poor performance in its long-distance and credit card businesses and slashing capital spending as additional factors in the reduced pay package.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T shares edged up 12.5 cents to $34.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock, which traded above $48 in January 1996, has since fallen nearly 30 percent amid growing competition in its core long-distance market.</p>
