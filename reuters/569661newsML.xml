<title>USA: Northrop joins Lockheed in Joint Fighter bid.</title>

<p>Aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp. announced Thursday it has added Northrop Grumman Corp. to its team to develop the next generation of fighter jets.</p>
<p>Lockheed said in a statement that Northrop will improve its chances of winning the Joint Strike Fighter contest, which it is contesting with Boeing Co. </p>
<p>&quot;Each of our companies has gained a lot of proven experience in supporting operational low-observable aircraft, which will help us ensure that our Joint Strike Fighter approach is the lowest risk,&quot; said Dain  Hancock, president of Lockheed Martin Tactical Aircraft Systems.</p>
<p>In November, Lockheed and Boeing won contracts worth $718.8 million and $661.8 million, respectively, to develop prototyes for the Joint Strike Fighter, which will be used by both the United States and Britain. The winner will be chosen in 2001 and will build 3,000 fighter jets.</p>
<p>Northrop was part of a third team led by McDonald Douglas Corp. that lost out to Lockheed and Boeing to develop the prototypes. The loss was a severe blow for McDonnell and was seen as a precursor to its proposed merger with Boeing.</p>
<p>Northrop was expected to approach either Lockheed or Boeing in an attempt to take part in the lucrative contractm which was seen as the last mega-contract of the century. Industry experts estimated it could be worth as much as $170 billion. Aerospace firms have said it could be worth multiples of that amount when spare parts and services are factored in.</p>
