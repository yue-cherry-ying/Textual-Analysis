<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross sent emergency aid to the rebel-held Albanian city of Vlore on Saturday as more troops from a multinational security force landed in the troubled Balkan state.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman said the Geneva-based ICRC dispatched trucks carrying food and medicines from the capital Tirana at dawn on a three-hour journey to the southern port of Vlore, which rejects the authority of President Sali Berisha.</p>
<p>&quot;The aid is aimed at 700 beneficiaries in the general and psychiatric hospitals and three orphanages in Vlore,&quot; Nina Winquist-Galbe told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is still very unstable throughout the country,&quot; she added. But she said the Red Cross had encountered no aggression since they began deliveries last month.</p>
<p>Fery Aalam, the ICRC's deputy head of mission in Albania, said: &quot;Supplies of food and medicines to many state institutions have been disrupted by the crisis.&quot;</p>
<p>The ICRC, which has already made two deliveries to Vlore institutions since mid-March, does not use military escorts despite the arrival this week of an Italian-led multinational force whose mission is to protect humanitarian aid convoys.</p>
<p>Winquist-Galbe said that one Red Cross team distributing aid this week in northern Albania, near the town of Krume, had visited hospitals which employed more armed guards than doctors in an effort to keep away gunmen.</p>
<p>Albania has been full of guns since an armed insurrection broke out in late February following the collapse of fraudulent savings schemes in which many had invested their life savings.</p>
<p>Angry Albanians ransacked arsenals deserted by troops and police, flooding the country with weapons. Some 300 people have been killed in the violence.</p>
<p>Rebel committees blaming Berisha for the collapse of the schemes took control of much of the south.</p>
<p>The U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP) handed out small supplies of food aid to state institutions from across Albania on Saturday, officials said.</p>
<p>Vans and cars sent by hospitals, orphanages and homes for the elderly and handicapped around the country drove to the western port of Durres to pick up sacks of wheat flour, beans and vegetable oil.</p>
<p>Italian military spokesman Lieutenant Gianfranco Scalas said 490 Italian soldiers landed by sea in Durres on Saturday, the latest arrivals in a force that will eventually number 6,000. Another 550 Italians troops were due on Sunday.</p>
<p>A column of two dozen Greek armoured personnel carriers and supply trucks carrying more than 100 soldiers was waiting in a suburb of the city of Fier, one hour's drive from Vlore, Greek defence attache Alexandros Xiros said.</p>
<p>&quot;This Greek military company is under Italian command. When the Italians give us the orders, we will go into Vlore,&quot; Xiros told Reuters.</p>
<p>Italian military spokesman Paolo Bianchi said he expected the Greeks to reach Vlore in the next few days.</p>
<p>As the Greek convoy with an Italian military escort travelled south on Friday afternoon, local people lined the streets to welcome them.</p>
<p>The multinational force has received a friendly welcome from Albanians, who hope it will help restore law and order.</p>
<p>The relief operation is running in parallel with diplomatic efforts to steer Albania towards early elections in June and end the violence.</p>
<p>King Leka I, back in Albania after a life spent in exile, said on Friday he had won a promise from President Berisha to hold a referendum on restoring the monarchy.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation that has been created in the country needs a stabilising factor and I think in me they see a stabilising factor,&quot; the 58-year-old king said of his countrymen.</p>
<p>Leka was due to meet Prime Minister Bashkim Fino later on Saturday to discuss Albania's crisis, an official said.</p>
