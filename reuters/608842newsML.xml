<p>A 60-year-old woman was killed when an explosive device went off in her handbag in the central Russian city of Voronezh, Interfax news agency quoted police sources as saying on Friday.</p>
<p>In a separate incident in the central Russian Tambov region, a driver of a truck belonging to a local firm was killed and a security guard wounded in a grenade explosion.</p>
<p>Interfax said an unidentified attacker threw the grenade into the truck as it was passing by.</p>
<p>Bomb blasts are a common method of settling scores between rival gangs in Russia's criminal underworld. Massive illegal sales of arms and ammunition have led to many deaths, often as a result of mishandling explosive devices and guns.</p>
<p>Last month at least four people died and scores more were wounded in two railway station explosions in southern Russia, allegedly carried out by Chechen separatists.</p>
