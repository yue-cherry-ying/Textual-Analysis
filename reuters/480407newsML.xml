<text>
<p>Shanghai's B share index ended down slightly on Tuesday on consildation due to some profit-taking after sharp gains in the past week, brokers said.</p>
<p>The B share index fell 0.341 points or 0.46 percent to 73.186 points on volume of 17.2 million shares worth $7.8 million against $7.6 million on Monday.</p>
<p>Brokers said that domestic investors had become cautious after the sharp gains of the past week and falls in the world's major markets made foreign investors wary, resulting in minor profit-taking.  </p>
<p>&quot;Trading was sluggish with foreign investors staying on the sidelines due to falls in the world markets and uncertainties over the 1996 results of most firms,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;Technical charts show the market needs a period of consolidation around the current level to digest profit-taking,&quot; a second broker said. &quot;But the index will continue to move up after the correction given the good market fundamentals.&quot;</p>
<p>Of 43 B shares, 42 traded with 18 down, 10 flat and 14 up.</p>
<p>Shanghai Dazhong Taxi was the biggest loser on profit-taking, falling $0.070 or 6.03 percent to $1.090 on volume of 287,000 shares.  </p>
<p>Real estate developer Shanghai Lujiazui Finance &amp; Trade Zone Development traded the most on domestic buying, rising $0.014 or 1.40 percent to $1.010 on volume of 1.3 million shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai's A share index gained on speculative institutional buying in selective stocks, but market sentiment had become cautious after sharp gains in the past few weeks, brokers said.</p>
<p>The A index added 7.033 points or 0.54 percent to 1,300.395 points on volume of 773.8 million shares worth 8.3 billion yuan. The SSE 30 blue chip index ended up 4.233 points or 0.12 percent to 3,422.511 points.  </p>
<p>Shanghai Dragon Head was the star on speculative buying, surging 0.80 yuan or 10 percent to its daily limit-up of 8.80 yuan on volume of 3.1 million shares.</p>
