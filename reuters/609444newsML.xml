<p>Impressed by cost-cutting progress at Ford Motor Co., auto industry analysts are turning more bullish on the company, convinced it will continue to outpace its Big Three rivals in rewarding shareholders.</p>
<p>Two analysts this week raised their second-quarter and full-year 1997 earnings-per-share estimates on Ford after two days of upbeat meetings with senior executives at the automaker's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.</p>
<p>&quot;I think from a fundamentals standpoint, of the Big Three, Ford is in the best shape,&quot; Michael Ward, an analyst with PaineWebber, said.</p>
<p>Ward said he now expects Ford to earn $1.82 a share in the second quarter, up from $1.60 a share a year earlier. He also predicts the company will earn $5 a share in all of 1997, and $5.50 next year.</p>
<p>The stock price of the nation's No. 2 automaker has already outperformed that of General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Ford's stock, which was trading at $37.375 Friday, is up more than 15 percent this year, compared with approximate gains for GM and Chrysler of 1 percent and 3 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Analysts now think Ford's stock could push beyond $40 a share. They believe the company is poised to reap more rewards from strong -- and profitable -- light-truck sales, a conservative production schedule, sound dealer inventories and relative peace with the United Auto Workers union.</p>
<p>Analysts are also optimistic about a share repurchase from Ford's board of directors sometime in the second half of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Opportunities for a share repurchase programme are arguably much stronger now than at any point since the cycle began,&quot; Salomon Brothers analyst Jack Kirnan said in a research report. Kirnan noted Ford is expected to have net cash of at least $10 billion by the end of June.</p>
<p>Ward predicted Ford could buy back about $1 billion worth of stock and still have enough cash to repurchase more shares in 1998 and modestly boost its dividend in both years.</p>
<p>Ford is the only member of the Big Three that did not announce a buyback programme for this year. GM has set a $2.5 billion buyback programme this year. Chrysler is about half-way through a $2 billion repurchase programme this year.</p>
<p>As a result of sweeping cost-cutting measures around the company's worldwide operations, some analysts believe Ford will be able to slash 1997 actual costs by $2 billion from its total costs of $110 billion for all of 1996.</p>
<p>That would significantly exceed Ford's original goal of trimming actual costs by $1 billion in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The auto industry has set out big goals in the past but what we've never seen is actual costs come down in a year,&quot; Ward said. &quot;That's a very, very strong statement from any auto manufacturer.&quot;</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced of a rosy future for Ford, however. On Thursday Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Nicholas Colas cut his rating on the automaker to a hold from a buy. Colas could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Michael Robinet, managing director of CSM Forecasting, an industry consultant in Farmington Hills, Mich., said Ford continues to lose ground in the passenger car segment.</p>
<p>He also believes Ford is too optimistic about the potential for future light truck sales, which he said are already showing signs of slowing.</p>
<p>&quot;On trucks they still rule the roost,&quot; he said. &quot;But the jury is still out on continued growth in the future.&quot;</p>
