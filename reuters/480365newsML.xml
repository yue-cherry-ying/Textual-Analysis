<p>The Philippines is considering allowing North Korean defector Hwang Jang-yop to stay in the country for a month, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Siazon said talks were still going on between Beijing, Seoul and Manila on the length of Hwang's stay in the Philippines and that the Philippines would announce Hwang's departure probably only after he had left.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the Republic of Korea has given a commitment to China that they would agree to 30 days (for staying in the Philippines),&quot; Siazon told reporters.</p>
<p>Asked if this was acceptable to Manila, Siazon said: &quot;That is still being considered ... We are in the process of considering 30 days, yes.&quot;</p>
<p>Hwang has been in a secret hideaway since China spirited him to the Philippines on March 18 after he defected to the South Korean consulate in Beijing on February 12.</p>
<p>Seoul and Beijing have agreed on the Philippines as a third country transit point before Hwang was flown to South Korea.</p>
