<p>Banco HSBC Bamerindus SA, formerly Banco Bamerindus, opened smoothly on Monday after HSBC took over the institution, which is Brazil's fourth largest private bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank's branches opened normally,&quot; said a spokesman for the bank, which has 1,208 branches across the country and 2.6 million current account holders.</p>
<p>Like all Brazilian financial institutions, Bamerindus closed Thursday and Friday for Easter holidays.  </p>
<p>Clients said they were unconcerned that the troubled bank changed hands.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not worried at all ... I was concerned all these months when I kept reading about the bank's troubles. But now I'm not,&quot; said Nasir Moreira, 65 years-old, a Bamerindus account holder for 20 years, while queueing at a Bamerindus branch at Sao Paulo city center.</p>
<p>Hiroshi Kubo, the branch's general manager, said the staff had been taken by surprise on Wednesday evening by the Central Bank's announcement of the takeover by Hong Kong Shanghai Bank Holdings Plc (HSBC).  </p>
<p>But over the weekend, Bamerindus employees received instructions on how to operate.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything will continue as before,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under the deal announced by the Central Bank, HSBC, which already owned a minority stake in Bamerindus, acquired selected assets and liabilities of the bank, valued at 10 billion reais, to turn it into a new institution with an immediate $1.0 billion capital injection.  </p>
<p>At a news conference last Thursday to explain the deal, the president of the new bank, Michael Geoghegan, said $400 million of the total $1.0 billion cash injection would pay for goodwill and some of Bamerindus' intangible assets, including its brand name and trademarks.</p>
<p>While newspapers and market watchers speculated over the fate of Bamerindus, HSBC, which sent some 50 people to Brazil to look at the Brazilian bank, had been secretly working on the deal for several weeks.  </p>
<p>Even the bank's former majority shareholder, Senator Jose Eduardo Andrade Vieira, said he was taken by surprise when the Central Bank intervened in Bamerindus and announced the HSBC takeover, according to newspaper reports.</p>
<p>The Sao Paulo stock exchange suspended trading in Bamerindus on Wednesday shortly before the central bank announcement of the HSBC takeover. Trading in the stock remained suspended on Monday morning, with no announcement on when trading would be resumed.  </p>
<p>The Central Bank was offered four alternatives to bail out Bamerindus, but only the HSBC offer was accepted because it included the bank's immediate capitalization, Central Bank officials said.</p>
<p>HSBC, with a strong presence in Latin America, took over some of Bamerindus' assets and obligations without having access to the Bamerindus books.</p>
<p>Last week Bamerindus published its 1996 balance sheet, showing a 256 million reais loss, a result of undermined public confidence as the bank has suffered from market rumors of liquidity problems since late 1995.</p>
<p>Despite the new bank's orderly start, HSBC faced the disappointment of seeing the poor performance of Formula One motor-racing driver Rubens Barrichello, who is expected to star the HSBC Bamerindus' advertising campaign, at the Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday.</p>
<p>Barrichello failed to finish the race.</p>
