<title>USA: Unocal Corp restates 1996 results.</title>
<headline>Unocal Corp restates 1996 results.</headline>
<dateline>EL SEGUNDO, Calif. 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Unocal Corp Friday restated previously reported earnings-per-common-share amounts for the third quarter and full year 1996 to reflect a non-cash reduction resulting from the September 1996 exchange of 6-1/4% Trust Convertible Preferred Securities of Unocal Capital Trust for shares of Unocal's $3.50 Convertible Preferred Stock.</p>
<p>The restatement does not affect 1996 net earnings, cash flows or stockholders' equity amounts previously reported by the company.</p>
<p>Unocal said it recently initiated discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking clarification of a technical accounting issue regarding whether the company's interpretation of its preferred exchange transaction as a security conversion, with no impact on earnings per share, was appropriate.</p>
<p>As a result of these discussions, the company restated earnings per share to reflect the excess of the fair value of the new preferred securities over the carrying amount of the $3.50 Preferred Stock that was received in the exchange.</p>
<p>This amount had been properly charged to retained earnings in 1996. The company has filed with the SEC amendments to its Form 10-K report for the year ended December 31, 1996, and Form 10-Q report for the quarter ended September 30, 1996.</p>
<p>The previously reported and the restated earnings per common share amounts for those periods are provided in the attached table.</p>
