<headline>Fletcher Canada unions set July 14 strike.</headline>

<p>Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd said Tuesday that unionized workers at its three British Columbia pulp and paper mills have announced they will go on strike July 14.</p>
<p>Contract negotiations between two unions and the company broke off Tuesday. The 2,400 workers have been without a contract since April.  </p>
<p>Officials from the Pulp, Paper and Woodworkers of Canada and the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers unions were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>But in a statement, Fletcher negotiator Howard Burleigh said the unions agreed to cooperate in an orderly shutdown of the company's mills at Crofton, Elk Falls and Mackenzie.</p>
<p>Union members recently voted 96 percent in favor of a strike if the contract talks failed. The unions aimed to reach a &quot;pattern&quot; contract at Fletcher, the province's biggest pulp and paper maker, that they would then seek to replicate at other producers.</p>
<p>Fletcher said the union's last demand was for a 35 percent increase in labor costs over three years including a five percent annual wage increase.</p>
<p>The company offered a six percent wage &quot;adjustment&quot; over a six-year contract, a cash settlement of C$1,000 a worker in exchange for moving to a 365-days-a-year operation and employment protection for employees affected by flexible work practices.</p>
<p>It accused the unions of refusing to address the company's agenda for greater flexibility and efficiency in its operations.</p>
<p>Fletcher, majority owned by New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge Ltd, said it &quot;remains committed to negotiating a settlement that will support the fundamental changes required so that it may compete in a global marketplace...&quot;</p>
