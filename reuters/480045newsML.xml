<p>Italian shares closed above the lows on Tuesday in a nervous market with the anxiously awaited March index of the US National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) helping to brake the declines after a key component of the index registered a fall.</p>
<p>The all-share mibtel index dropped 1.61 percent to 11,640 with the blue chip mib30 index falling 1.63 percent to 17,177. Brokers said trading volumes were very thin.</p>
<p>Oil giant ENI and telecom stocks, notably Telecom Italia and state holding company Stet, held up better than most stocks, buoyed by selective buying from foreign fund managers, brokers said.</p>
<p>ENI finished 0.79 percent down at 8,393 lire, with Telecom shedding 0.70 percent to 4,141 lire and Stet falling 0.77 percent to 7,237 lire.</p>
<p>&quot;There are levels below which the market is not prepared to fall,&quot; said a broker with a Milan-based finance house. &quot;Inflation is very low and interest rates can't go up by that much,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Fears of further falls on Wall Street and domestic political uncertainties were continuing to weigh heavily on market sentiment.</p>
<p>Among banks, BCI held its ground, shedding 0.45 percent to 3,322 lire with Credito Italiano easing just 0.25 percent to 2,366 lire.</p>
