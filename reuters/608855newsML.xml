<p>General Igor Sergeyev, named by President Boris Yeltsin on Friday as Russia's new defence minister, is both a career officer and an intellectual able to meet the Kremlin's new penny-pinching criteria.</p>
<p>Sergeyev, the 59-year-old commander of the Russia's Strategic Nuclear Forces, was appointed acting minister on Thursday and confirmed in office on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's up to the president to pick up defence ministers but I can imagine why Sergeyev was chosen,&quot; Yeltsin's influential defence adviser, Yuri Baturin said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;First of all he comes from the strategic nuclear forces, the backbone of Russia's defence,&quot; Baturin told NTV commercial television. &quot;He nicely fits the bill being very good in the technical and scientific aspects of the military reform.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Apart from that, not a single penny invested in his nuclear forces had been wasted in vain and as a result the situation there is better than in other sectors of the armed forces.&quot;</p>
<p>Baturin, now taking a lead role in military planning, had clashed publically with outgoing defence minister Igor Rodionov over the course of reforms needed to create a professional army.</p>
<p>The new appointee, army general Sergeyev, is a 30-year veteran of Russia's nuclear missile force. But a tough budget crisis will make his task all the more difficult.</p>
<p>He headed the Strategic Rocket Forces from 1992, responsible for 756 inter-continental missiles with 3,535 nuclear warheads in Russia's strategic arsenal.</p>
<p>Baturin also praised Sergeyev for high moral standards among his troops. &quot;I haven't heard about any major corruption cases in the Strategic Missile Forces,&quot; he said in reply to a question.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin had focused on army corruption when he sacked Rodionov abruptly on Thursday. &quot;The soldier is losing weight while the general is getting fatter,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Military prosecutors say about 20 generals and 100 colonels are under investigation for graft.</p>
<p>Sergeyev, a bespectacled, silver-haired man who looks older than his 59 years, has said he views Russia's nuclear forces as the backbone of its defence, and he describes it as one that is especially economical in a time of spending cutbacks.</p>
<p>Sergeyev has also spoken out in favor of a START-3 nuclear arms reduction deal with the United States as an extension of the START-2 accord cutting Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals.</p>
<p>He has argued for a political accord with NATO to prevent the stationing of nuclear forces on the territory of members the Western alliance is expected to invite into NATO in July.</p>
<p>Sergeyev was born in 1938 into a mining family and he then attended a naval academy on the Black Sea. He started serving with the missile forces at the height of the Cold War in 1961 and gradually moved up the command ladder.</p>
<p>Married with a son, Sergeyev is said to enjoy sport and classical literature.</p>
