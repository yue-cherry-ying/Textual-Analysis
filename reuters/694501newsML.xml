<p>Turkish troops killed 17 Kurdish guerrillas on Saturday in southeastern Turkey, the semi-official Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>It said eight members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) were shot dead in an operation, launched after nine Turkish soldiers and a state-paid village guard were killed by a landmine, planted by rebels, in the southeastern town of Midyat.</p>
<p>The soldiers and the guard were killed when their military patrol vehicle hit the landmine late on Friday.</p>
<p>The agency said two PKK members surrendered during the clash.</p>
<p>Nine other PKK guerrillas have been killed in other clashes in the southeastern towns of Tatvan, Guroymak, Besiri, Sason, Ozalp and Kulp.</p>
<p>The agency did not say when the clashes took place.</p>
<p>The PKK has been fighting for autonomy or independence in the region since 1984. More than 24,000 people have been killed since then.</p>
