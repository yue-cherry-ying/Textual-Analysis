<p>The head of an influential Turkish business group has called for an end to the ruling coalition because it has become entangled in debate on Islamist activism, the Hurriyet daily said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no going back now. The government must end immediately,&quot; the paper quoted Turkish Union of Trade Bourses chairman Fuat Miras as telling a meeting of the group.</p>
<p>&quot;They have left aside the economy to concentrate on fundamentalism. This is not what they should be doing at a time like this,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's alliance with a secularist party has begun to show cracks under the strain of orders from the army for a curb on the role of Islam in public.</p>
<p>Erbakan is modern Turkey's first Islamist leader.</p>
<p>Several ministers from the True Path Party have cast doubt on the future of the government, formed last June.</p>
<p>Miras said his group had originally supported the coalition because its formation had ended months of political chaos and allowed Islamists to express themselves within democracy. &quot;But it is not working,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Turkey is struggling under annual inflation of almost 80 percent and wide deficits.</p>
