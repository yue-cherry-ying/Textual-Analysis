<title>UK: Sterling steadier in Europe after overnight slide.</title>
<headline>Sterling steadier in Europe after overnight slide.</headline>

<p>Sterling steadied above overnight lows in Europe after being mugged last night by a newswire report quoting comments by an unnamed Labour source about sterling and the ERM.</p>
<p>But the new team at the Treasury moved quickly to dampen speculation that Britain planned to rejoin the ERM saying &quot;There was no truth in it at all.&quot;</p>
<p>The pound dived four pfennigs after Bridge News quoted a Labour source saying sterling should rejoin the ERM at 2.50 marks.</p>
<p>Sterling sank to a low of around 2.7750 marks but by 0928 GMT it had recovered a pfennig to 2.7845/55. It closed in Europe on Wednesday at 2.8151/61.</p>
<p>&quot;While we would not expect the Treasury to pull another major surprise out of the bag in the near future, the comments probably highlight the concern felt by the new government over the strength of the pound,&quot; said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at BankAmerica.</p>
<p>Chancellor Gordon Brown took the markets by surprise on Tuesday but announcing that the Bank of England was to be made independent alongside a quarter point rise in interest rates.  </p>
<p>Weak manufacturing output data this week showed that strong sterling was having an impact on exports and there was some speculation in the market that perhaps the new administration had indulged in a bit of verbal intervention to get sterling down.</p>
<p>But traders doubted such a crass move.</p>
<p>&quot;It's certainly got the pound down a bit but I can't believe it was done deliberately with that in mind,&quot; said one trader. &quot;Anyway rates are expected to rise again soon so that will lend sterling support.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the sharp move down overnight in part reflected the fact that the market was long of sterling and quite happy to take some profits.  </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs economist Gavyn Davies, widely tipped to be appointed to the newly created post of second Bank of England deputy governor, reckoned sterling's fall was more to do with the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;What's happened overnight is that the dollar has come down and the pound is trading down against the yen and the deutschemark in line with the dollar. I suspect that's the main thing that's going on,&quot; he told BBC radio 4's Today programme.</p>
<p>But many disagreed and said an only small fall in the dollar would not have precipitated an almost vertical four pfennig sterling decline.</p>
<p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) distributive trades survey showed that retail sales growth in April was the highest since November 1996.</p>
<p>This helped put some life back into sterling as higher high street spending points to higher inflation and therefore still higher interest rates, dealers said.</p>
