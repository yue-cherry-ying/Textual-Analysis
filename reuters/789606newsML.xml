<p>Dutch international winger Regi Blinker scored on his debut on Saturday as Celtic knocked seven goals past third division Berwick to sweep into the third round of the Scottish League Cup.</p>
<p>Blinker, who arrived at the Glasgow club from Sheffield Wednesday last week in a swap for unsettled Italian Paolo di Canio, scored with a 28th-minute tap-in.</p>
<p>By then Celtic were already 2-0 up and they reached the halftime whistle with five in the bag.</p>
<p>Celtic, who have a UEFA Cup second qualifying match against Tirol Innsbruck on Tuesday, should have scored far more after repeatedly hitting the woodwork.</p>
<p>Swede Henrik Larsson also netted his first goal for Celtic since joining the club in the off-season.</p>
<p>Dundee United, who play a UEFA qualifier against Turkey's Trabzonspor next week, also reached the third round by beating second division Queen of the South 4-2.</p>
<p>Gary McSwegan, who has scored two hat-tricks this season in UEFA Cup qualifiers against Andorran opponents, scored a hat-trick in a match that flattered Dundee.</p>
<p>Aberdeen -- with former Blackburn attacker Mike Newell scoring a hat-trick at Dumbarton -- Dunfermline and Raith all scored five goals apiece.</p>
