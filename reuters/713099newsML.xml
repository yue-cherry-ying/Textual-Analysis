<title>PHILIPPINES: Move to extend Ramos term dealt another blow.</title>

<p>Attempts by a citizens group to change the Philippine constitution and give President Fidel Ramos the chance to run for a second term in office received a near-death blow on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The seven-member Commission on Elections (Comelec) voted unanimously to throw out a petition by the group, called Pirma, that called for a referendum to amend the 10-year-old constitution.</p>
<p>Political analysts said the ruling did not totally close the door on a re-election bid by Ramos despite his public pledge to step down when his term ends next year. Under the law, Ramos can convene Congress into a special assembly to rewrite the constitution, which limits a president to one term of six years. The ban is intended to prevent a repetition of late Ferdinand Marcos' ruinous 20-year rule.</p>
<p>The Comelec decision was the second defeat suffered by Pirma in its campaign to scrap the limit and allow Ramos to run for re-election in the June 1998 polls. Earlier, the Supreme Court also rejected the petition.</p>
<p>Comelec said the Supreme Court had already spoken and &quot;it is our duty to abide by it.&quot;</p>
<p>Pirma collected more than five million signatures on its petition. Among those who signed were six members of Ramos' cabinet, which fuelled speculation that he was interested in a second term if he could find a legal way to do it.</p>
