<p>Britain's United News &amp; Media will take a 30 percent stake in DTN if that consortium wins a licence to operate new UK television services, United News said on Thursday.</p>
<p>United News, publisher of the Express national newspaper and a force in commercial television, plans to invest a maximum of 120 million pounds ($195 million) in DTN, wholly owned by cable and transmission company NTL Inc.</p>
<p>The move offers an intriguing twist in the battle for licences to run digital terrestrial television (DTT), which is expected to be launched with at least 30 channels next year.</p>
<p>DTN is in direct competition with industry heavyweight British Digital Broadcasting (BDB) for three key DTT licences. BDB brings together pay television giant BSkyB, plus leading commercial TV companies Carlton and Granada.</p>
<p>The Independent Television Commission is expected to award the licences in the next few weeks and most industry watchers tip BDB as the likely winner.</p>
<p>Roger Laughton, United's head of broadcasting and entertainment, said that DTN had put together a very impressive bid.</p>
<p>&quot;What we have in front of us is an opportunity to create a competitive market in British pay television,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Laughton said that United had agreed to provide programming when NTL submitted its bid in January but that the two sides had run out of time in attempts to go beyond that.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether the ITC will take the planned investment into account when making their decision on the licences. It has rules which restrict consideration of changes made to applications after a bid deadline.</p>
<p>NTL chief executive Barclay Knapp said his company's legal advisers had told him that the United link should be considered but BDB's lawyers might see in it a different light.</p>
<p>Viewers wishing to tuning in to DTT need only to buy a set-top decoder to receive more than 30 new channels and online services such as home shopping. DTT signals are broadcast from land-based receivers to ordinary set-top aerials.</p>
<p>Its advocates say it will appeal to viewers not convinced by the case for 200-channel digital satellite or cable offerings.</p>
<p>BSkyB plans to launch digital satellite early next year and the cable companies may move even sooner.</p>
