<text>
<p>Massachusetts Gov. William Weld Tuesday called out the state's National Guard to assist powerless residents, help clear roads and set up shelters.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters from the emergency management agency bunker in Framingham in the central part of the state, Weld said he expected the state to offer financial assistance to &quot;Worcester County, western Middlesex County and some parts of Essex...The city of Worcester may need help in particular.</p>
<p>&quot;They had a $200,000 deficit in their snow budget even before this storm hit,&quot; Weld said.</p>
<p>The governor, who expected the state of emergency to last through Wednesday afternoon, said so many people were affected by the power outage because &quot;it's not just the distribution lines that are down.</p>
<p>Some transmission lines are down as well and that's why you have as many as a quarter of a million households without electricity.&quot;</p>
