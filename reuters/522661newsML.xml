<p>Russia's Communist Party and its main foe in the last parliamentary election, the Our Home is Russia pro-government party, outlined on Saturday their plans to prepare for the next presidential election.</p>
<p>The communists blasted the new reformist government President Boris Yeltsin has just appointed and vowed to try and unseat him through a mass public campaign.</p>
<p>Our Home is Russia re-elected Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as its leader. He said the party should be ready to field its own presidential candidate but stopped short of proposing himself.</p>
<p>Parliamentary polls are not due until 1999 and the next presidential election is set for the year 2000 but the main political forces are already eyeing their strategy.</p>
<p>The Communist Party, which has the biggest grassroots network across the sprawling state of 150 million and the biggest faction in the State Duma lower house of parliament, met for its first congress since early 1993.</p>
<p>During this time Yeltsin has crushed with tanks a bloody rebellion in October 1993 by supporters of the old conservative parliament and defeated communist leader Gennady Zyuganov in the presidential election in 1996.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has formed effectively a new government under the veteran Chernomyrdin and given young reformers key positions in the cabinet.</p>
<p>Zyuganov blasted the new cabinet.</p>
<p>&quot;The actions of the reshuffled government deprive the country of perspectives for reviving the national economy and improving the life of the workers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This government will undoubtedly carry out policies murderous for Russia,&quot; said Zyuganov, who peppered his address with quotations from Soviet state founder Lenin, Josef Stalin and Russian nationalist poets.</p>
<p>Zyuganov said his party should devote more resources to extra-parliamentary protests within the framework of the law. The party will also start gathering signatures calling for Yeltsin's resignation.</p>
<p>&quot;The wider and more organised the petition is, the more easily and organically it will grow into a nationwide strike.&quot;</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin, addressing a news conference after the congress of Our Home is Russia, said such actions would be unconstitutional and concluded: &quot;We will not allow this.&quot;</p>
<p>Our Home is Russia won only just over 10 percent of the votes in the last parliamentary poll in 1995, far behind the communists. It unites many central and regional officials and some Russian newspapers call it &quot;The Party of Nomenklatura&quot;.</p>
<p>Both Zyuganov, 52, and Chernomyrdin, 59, are likely candidates in the next presidential election.</p>
<p>But the communists appear to be losing their public appeal after the defeat in the presidential poll last year. Party sources told Reuters the petition and other planned protests were aimed mainly at keeping the communists in the public eye.</p>
<p>For Chernomyrdin, the main task is the success of his government, as he admitted on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;There is only one recipe (for electoral victory) -- evident changes for the better in the life of our people,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying.</p>
<p>Critics say Chernomyrdin lacks the charisma to be able to succeed Yeltsin as president, despite the backing of influential financial groups. Supporters say he would have a chance of winning an election if the state machinery united behind him.</p>
<p>But other experts say three other candidates might be a stronger challenge -- law-and-order General Alexander Lebed, charismatic First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov and populist Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.</p>
