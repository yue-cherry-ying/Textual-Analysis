<p>Representative Sonny Bono could be the Republicans' best hope to unseat incumbent Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, a new poll showed Friday.</p>
<p>Although Bono, the singer who now represents the Palm Springs area in Congress, has not officially announced plans to run for the Senate in 1998, the poll found he is more popular than three Republicans who have entered the race.</p>
<p>In the poll conducted by the Field Institute, Bono came in second to Boxer with 17 percent of the vote, compared with Boxer's 34.</p>
<p>California State Treasurer Matt Fong came in third with 14 percent, followed by San Diego Mayor Susan Golding with 7 percent and businessman Darrell Issa with 1 percent.</p>
<p>In a poll just among the Republicans, Bono, half of the Sonny and Cher singing duo of the 1960s, had 29 percent, followed by Fong with 20 percent, Golding with 12 percent and Issa with 3 percent.</p>
<p>California voters last year approved an initiative to hold primary elections on an open-ballot basis. That system would put candidates of all parties together on one ballot and open voting to all registered voters regardless of party affiliation.</p>
<p>But the system has been challenged in court and the traditional closed primary election may be upheld.</p>
<p>The Field Institute said the margin of error in the poll is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.</p>
