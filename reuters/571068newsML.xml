<headline>Shanghai dissident due for release June 4 - mother.</headline>

<p>Prominent Shanghai dissident Bao Ge, jailed three years ago, is due to be released on June 4 after having been refused visits from relatives for 18 months, Bao's mother said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Bao, sentenced to three years &quot;re-education through labour&quot; in 1994, was a member of the Shanghai-based Association for Human Rights.</p>
<p>He was involved in a number of activities, including a campaign to get Japan to provide compensation for atrocities committed during its occupation of China from 1931 to 1945, his mother, Wang Yufen, contacted by telephone, said.</p>
<p>&quot;I have received a letter from him saying he expects to be released on June 4,&quot; Wang said. &quot;He says June 4 is going to be an important day.&quot;</p>
<p>June 4 is the anniversary of the army crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing in 1989, but Bao's mother said there was no connection between that day and his release.</p>
<p>She said she was worried that Bao, 33, would protest to the authorities that his three-year incarceration was illegal that he would get into further trouble.</p>
<p>&quot;As his mother, I'm of course very happy he's getting out, but I'm worried about the political side of things,&quot; she said. &quot;They will be watching him.&quot;</p>
<p>She said she had not seen her son for 18 months.</p>
<p>&quot;The last time they gave me permission to visit was in November 1995,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Shanghai's small band of dissidents, active in the late 1980s and early 1990s, have either left China or been jailed on various charges.</p>
