<p>Portraits of Sergi Bruguera and Gustavo Kuerten who will contest the French Open men's final on Sunday:</p>
<p>Sergi Bruguera (Spain)</p>
<p>Winner of back-to-back French Open titles in 1993 and 1994, Bruguera is experiencing a return to form at the scene of his greatest triumphs. Once one of the most feared clay courters on the men's circuit, Bruguera has not won a tournament since Prague in 1994. Torn ankle ligaments while training three days before Christmas in 1995 led to a loss of form that resulted in the 26-year-old Spaniard beginning this season outside the top 80. Credits his comeback to the support of father Luis, who has been courtside at Roland Garros for all his matches. Bruguera is generally regarded as the quintessential clay courter, a patient operator from the baseline. Uses extreme version of western grip.</p>
<p>Seeding: 16. Age: 26. Plays right-handed. Weight: 76 kg. Height: 1.88. Ranking: 19. Tournament wins: 14. Career prize money: $9.97 million.</p>
<p>Gustavo Kuerten (Brazil)</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest surprise at a French Open littered with upsets and the unexpected. Has never won an ATP tournament and only recorded one victory in his two previous Grand Slam appearances. Has survived three five-set tests and a four-set semifinal on his way to becoming the first Brazilian man to reach a Grand Slam final, revealing great agility, stamina and coolness in tight situations. First caught people's attention at Roland Garros with his colourful attire, although officials have pleaded with him to wear more traditional whites rather than his yellow and blue kit.</p>
<p>Seeding: unseeded. Age: 20. Plays right-handed. Weight: 82 kg. Height: 1.90m. Ranking: 66. Tournament wins: 0. Career prize money: $284,778.</p>
<p>Head-to-head - Have never met.</p>
