<p>STOCKHOLM, April 1 (Reuter) - Swedish bond yields ended sharply higher on Tuesday, hurt by a weaker U.S.-market, and the crown softened.</p>
<p>The upturn in yields was also a correction from a fall on Thursday, the last day of trading ahead of Easter holidays, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The downward movement was largely uncalled for and now the market is adjusting upwards in quiet trade,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>He added that the trend is changing and that yields are bound to rise in the long run.</p>
<p>The weaker bond market hurt the crown, as did a correction.  </p>
<p>The crown softened to 4.5420 crowns against the mark from 4.5040 crowns on Thursday.</p>
<p>The currency could also have been hurt by bourse portfolio changes. &quot;It is also possible some have sold Swedish shares and invested abroad,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The six-month T-bill rate jumped 10 basis points to 4.25 percent, while the ten-year bond yield leaped 19 basis points to 7.46 percent.</p>
<p>The Riksbank left its key interest rate, the repo rate, unchanged at 4.10 percent, which was expected.</p>
