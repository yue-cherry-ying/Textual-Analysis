<p>President Bill Clinton said on Tuesday that NATO's invitation to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic marked a &quot;giant stride&quot; towards a new Europe that is undivided, democratic and peaceful.</p>
<p>Though the move represented a diplomatic triumph for Clinton, who had resisted a French-led clamour to add Romania and Slovenia in the first round of NATO expansion, he made no effort to claim credit, calling it &quot;a genuine consensus effort&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the result of hard work by all the members of the alliance,&quot; Clinton said in a speech to U.S. embassy employees after the largest enlargement in NATO's 48-year history was announced. &quot;This is not an American achievement, this is a NATO achievement. Every country had its say.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton, who was accompanied by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defence Secretary William Cohen and several members of Congress, said the NATO summit had &quot;taken a giant stride in our efforts to create a Europe that is undivided, democratic and at peace literally for the first time since the rise of the nation state on the European continent&quot;.</p>
<p>In issuing the invitation to the three former communist Warsaw Pact states, leaders of the 16 countries that are now part of the alliance named Slovenia and Romania as prime candidates for the next round of expansion.</p>
<p>Their declaration also cited the Baltic states as &quot;aspiring members&quot; -- a move that could irritate Russia, which has said it would consider NATO membership by former Soviet republics a threat to its own security.</p>
<p>Harkening back to the days of the old Cold War, Clinton recalled the harsh Soviet domination that the prospective new NATO members had endured.</p>
<p>&quot;I ... would say to the people of Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic: your heroism made this day possible. Through long years of darkness, you kept alive the hope of freedom. I still remember the Hungarian uprising of 1956, the Prague Spring of 1968, the Gadansk shipyards in 1981,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While Clinton soft-pedalled his role in reshaping NATO, both Republican and Democratic members of Congress applauded his leadership and predicted that NATO expansion would be approved by U.S. legislators.</p>
<p>Senator William Roth, a Deleware Republican who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, credited the president with &quot;recognizing the urgent need to adapt NATO to the challenges of the post-Cold War era&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there's any doubt the Congress will eventually support this decision,&quot; said Benjamin Gilman, the Republican chairman of the House International Relations Committee.</p>
<p>Secretary Albright, who was born in Prague, said that while she was pleased at the invitations to Poland and Hungary, the invitation to the Czech Republic &quot;makes my heart glad and makes me feel that I've been a part of history&quot;.</p>
<p>Albright's family fled Czechoslovakia twice, once to escape the Nazis, and again after the Cold War began.</p>
