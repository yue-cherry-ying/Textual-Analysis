<p>NOTES: Full company name is CompScript Inc.</p>
<p>The company said results have been restated to reflect one-time charges of $613,457 associated with the acquisitions of Medical Services Consortium, Campo's Medical Pharmacy and Hytree Pharmacy Services. The acquisitions all closed in Q1 and were accounted for as a pooling of interests.</p>
<p>The results also included a one-time charge of $800,000 against the realization of a non-recourse note receivable related to assets acquired in connection with the company's reverse acquisition with Capital Brands Inc during Q2 1996, it said.  </p>
<p>Excluding those charges, the company's net loss would have been $202,645 or a share loss of $0.01, it said.</p>
<p>The reverse acquisition was used as a tool to go public by purchasing a publicly traded company, it said. Compscript was a privately held company before that time.</p>
