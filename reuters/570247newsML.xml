<title>USA: IBM shares rise on Wall Street outlook.</title>
<headline>IBM shares rise on Wall Street outlook.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. shares rose in heavy trading Thursday as two Wall Street firms raised their estimates for the stock a day after an upbeat meeting with the giant computer maker's chairman.</p>
<p>IBM rose $6.125 to $168.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was among the most active issues a midday.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse First Boston raised its 12-month target price for IBM to $195 from $165.</p>
<p>Prudential Securities said it expects the stock to hit $225, up from $190 previously, and continued to recommend buying the stock. The brokerage also raised its 1997 earnings estimates on IBM to $12.50 a share, from $12.35 a share, citing increased expense controls.</p>
<p>IBM had operating income of $1.2 billion, or $2.37 a share on revenues of $17.3 billion in the first quarter. The results surpassed most Wall Street estimates, as IBM's fastest-growing businesses offset a decline in mainframes, minicomputers and workstations.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner said the company has many opportunities for growth -- but reiterated the computer giant's goal is for revenues to rise in the high single digits, unlike some high-tech companies.</p>
<p>He said he called fast-growing tech companies &quot;meteors&quot; because some eventually burn up.</p>
<p>&quot;We are focused on growing shareholder value,&quot; Gerstner said. &quot;We have a model that is not the model of the meteors.&quot;</p>
<p>IBM's revenues grew 9 percent in the first quarter, on a constant currency basis. The company had stellar growth in its services business, which rose 28 percent, amid a drop in revenue for some hardware, such as mainframe computers, minicomputers and workstations.</p>
<p>IBM led a rally in blue-chip stocks as well as the high- technology sector.</p>
<p>Shortly after midday, the Dow Jones industrial average, which tumbled 140 points Wednesday, was up 100.34 points at 7,185.99.</p>
