<p>The military wing of the Islamic Hamas group vowed on Tuesday to take vengeance on Israel over what it it described as the Jewish state's bombings in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>&quot;Qassam will not hesitate to respond to the Zionist crimes painfully and quickly in the heart of Tel Aviv and the biggest cities of the Zionist entity,&quot; said a leaflet issued by Izz el-Deen al-Qassam.  </p>
<p>Two Palestinians were killed in blasts in the Gaza Strip early on Tuesday in what Israel said were botched suicide bombings aimed at Jewish school children.</p>
<p>The PLO charged Israeli troops were behind one of the blasts near an isolated Jewish settlement enclave in the Palestinian-ruled area.</p>
<p>Both Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, whose militants have killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombings, denied they were behind the explosions. Israel Television said an anonymous caller claimed responsibility for the attacks on behalf of the Islamic Jihad.</p>
<p>The blasts came against the backdrop of crumbling Middle East peace moves and Israeli accusations Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has failed to curb militants in areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip under his control.</p>
