<p>Briton Johnny Herbert topped the times in a Formula One practice session for the first time on Thursday, outpacing double world champion Michael Schumacher of Germany ahead of Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix.</p>
<p>The bubbly and popular Herbert, driving a Sauber car powered by a Petronas-badged Ferrari engine, was just one-tenth of a second faster than Schumacher, in a Ferrari, on a day when Heinz-Harald Frentzen's hopes were ended by a crash.</p>
<p>Frentzen, the German winner of the San Marino Grand Prix at Imola two weeks ago, suffered the indignity of crashing against the tight railings of the famous Mediterranean street circuit.</p>
<p>He lost control of his Williams, his car plunging into the steelwork which lines the full length of the track around the harbour. He was not hurt.</p>
<p>Herbert clocked a best time of one minute and 21.188 seconds to ease clear of Schumacher with Canadian world championship leader Jacques Villeneuve third in a Williams. Italian newcomer Giancarlo Fisichella was fourth in a Jordan.</p>
<p>Herbert, fourth in Monaco in 1995, third last year and hoping to do even better this year, said: &quot;It is very nice for me to finish in this position today. But it is only practice and Saturday's qualifying session is the one that counts.</p>
<p>&quot;We did a lot of work on the set-up of the car in testing at Barcelona last week and that is paying off for us now. I think there is more to come from the car, but I am sure everyone is saying that.&quot;</p>
<p>Herbert, who lives in Monaco, said he realised he had gone quickest only by seeing it on a giant screen above the circuit as he drove up the hill towards Casino Square.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a good moment for me and I hope I can have another one like that on Saturday. That is what I want more than anything.&quot;</p>
<p>Herbert's success for Sauber emphasised how competitive the field is this season for the 55th running of the Monaco Grand Prix.</p>
<p>Schumacher said: &quot;Qualifying will be very close on Saturday. You only have to lose a little time in one section and you can slip out of the top 10 here this year.&quot;</p>
