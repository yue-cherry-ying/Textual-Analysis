<p>Prime Minister John Major, battling to shift attention from allegations of &quot;sleaze&quot; in his ruling Conservative Party, hit the campaign trail on Tuesday pledging to keep the British economy booming.</p>
<p>Challenger Tony Blair, strongly fancied to end 18 years of Conservative rule, urged voters to put their trust in his revitalised Labour Party as he and Major went out to meet the people ahead of the May 1 election.</p>
<p>In a preview of the manifesto his party will publish on Wednesday, Major said: &quot;Today Britain is booming. Tomorrow we will be publishing an election manifesto designed to keep it booming.&quot;</p>
<p>Playing to traditional Conservative strengths, Major promised to keep a tight hold on government spending and clamp down on taxes and inflation.</p>
<p>The manifesto would also retain Britain's opt-out from the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union, governing workers' rights.</p>
<p>Also with an eye to a palpable mood of &quot;Euroscepticism&quot; in the country, Blair told business leaders in the central English town of Derby that Britain would only join a single European currency if the conditions were right.</p>
<p>&quot;We would not join in any fudged single currency or one not in Britain's interests. Period,&quot; the Labour leader said.</p>
<p>Blair was speaking as he embarked on a 60-town tour aimed at convincing crucial middle class voters that Labour had changed for the better after being out of office since 1979.</p>
<p>Speaking atop a new &quot;people's platform&quot; which unfolded from Labour's campaign tour bus, Blair told cheering crowds: &quot;Be strong, be of good courage, put your trust in us and we will repay that trust 1,000 times over in the years ahead.&quot;</p>
<p>The platform was intended to counter the battered wooden soapbox used by Major to address crowds and sweep the Conservatives to a surprise fourth victory in 1992.</p>
<p>Both parties treated Tuesday as the start of their campaigns for the election. The first two weeks of electioneering have been low-key and dominated by allegations of parliamentary corruption and sexual pecadilloes in the Conservative party.</p>
<p>Major is fighting an uphill battle against opinion polls which show his party about 20 points behind Labour.</p>
<p>Three Conservatives resigned their jobs last week over allegations of personal impropriety or involvement in a cash for questions row in parliament. Two more Conservative MPs are under under strong pressure to quit.</p>
<p>Major earlier backed Neil Hamilton, the MP at the centre of the sleaze storm, saying he should be allowed to stand at the election.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not going to bow to the witch-hunt mentality of saying that anyone who faces public charges must quit public life,&quot; Major told a news conference. Hamilton has denied accepting envelopes stuffed with cash from a businessman.</p>
<p>Major's campaign got a boost on Tuesday from former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who launched a scathing attack on the revamped Labour Party.</p>
<p>In an article for the Daily Telegraph newspaper, Thatcher accused &quot;New Labour&quot; of turning its back on its beliefs to pander to pundits and pollsters. Blair has ditched much of Labour's socialist dogma and moved it to the centre of British politics.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole of Mr Blair's strategy in creating the boneless wonder that calls itself New Labour is to reassure the electorate in its illusion. But illusion it remains,&quot; wrote Thatcher.</p>
