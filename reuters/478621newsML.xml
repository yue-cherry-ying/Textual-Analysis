<p>The far-right Slovak National Party said on Tuesday it has invited Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of its French counterpart the National Front, to visit Bratislava this spring.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to discuss creation of an association, or community, of nationally-oriented parties of Europe,&quot; Jan Slota, chairman of the SNS, which is a partner in Slovakia's ruling coalition, told the independent radio Twist.</p>
<p>Slovak opposition politicians said they would hold protest marches if Le Pen came to Bratislava.</p>
<p>Slota attended a National Front congress in Strasbourg last weekend at which Le Pen urged European far-rightists to join forces while an estimated 40,000 anti-Front demonstrators marched in protest of his racial policies.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw blacks making a huge noise banging drums on the main square (of Strasbourg). I saw broken shop-windows... drunk blacks and Arabs and a couple of anti-socials,&quot; he told the radio.</p>
<p>&quot;Those Frenchmen who were at the congress were democrats while those in the looted stores... were far away from democracy.&quot;</p>
<p>Slota said Le Pen was expected to visit in late April or early May. &quot;A date has not yet been set but the visit itself certainly was... We will try to arrange meetings at the (top) level,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The opposition Social-Democratic Party issued a statement saying &quot;Slota is putting Slovaks into one basket with Le Pen... and other extremist politicians, who are a disgrace to their countries.&quot;</p>
<p>Peter Zajac, vice chairman of the Democratic Party, told Reuters: &quot;It is all the worse that the SNS is a member of the ruling coalition and in a democratic Europe this can create the impression that Le Pen's politics are acceptable to the Slovak government.&quot;</p>
