<headline>Argentine bonds slightly up, positive mood.</headline>

<p>Argentine bonds finished flat to higher Friday after a slow session with activity capped by the early closure of the U.S. Treasuries market.</p>
<p>Traders said there was very thin volume as little price action was expected on Monday as well because of the closure of both London and New York. But players remained upbeat.</p>
<p>&quot;The market looks solid,&quot; said an analyst.</p>
<p>Argentina's FRB Brady bond due 2005 was flat at 93, while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose $0.14 to 122.97 Thursday.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing on the horizon that may cause a big decline,&quot; added the analyst.</p>
<p>But a trader pointed to the 30-year U.S. Treasury yield which is approaching 7.0 percent as a cause of some disquiet.</p>
<p>If U.S. economic indicators due in coming weeks point to a pick-up in economic activity it could spook the U.S. Treasury market that U.S. rates will be hiked later in the year and thus hit Argentine bonds as well.</p>
<p>In the money markets, call money rates fell to 5.63 percent from 5.98 percent.</p>
