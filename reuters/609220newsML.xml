<title>USA: Teens charged in brutal Central Park killing.</title>
<headline>Teens charged in brutal Central Park killing.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Two teenagers from affluent Manhattan neighbourhoods were charged Friday for the murder of a man was found floating in a lake in Central Park with his throat slashed.</p>
<p>Police said a 15-year-old boy and his 15-year-old girlfriend, both from comfortable neighbourhoods adjoining the park, had been drinking beer at the lakeside with the 44-year-old man after midnight when there was a dispute involving the girl.</p>
<p>&quot;At some point, the 15-year-old boy stabbed him multiple times and threw his body in the lake,&quot; New York City Police Commissioner Howard Safir told a news conference. He called it &quot;a gruesome, horrible murder.&quot;</p>
<p>The victim had large gashes around the throat, abdomen, face and wrist, Safir said. An unspecified amount of money had been taken from his wallet and a knife was recovered that police believed was used in the crime.</p>
<p>Police said the victim lived in Manhattan but declined to identify him until relatives were notified. All three knew each other and were known to frequent the park, police said.</p>
<p>The teens were identified as Christopher Vasquez and Daphne Abdella. The girl is from a wealthy family living on Central Park West, the avenue alongside the park that is home to some of New York's most affluent residents.</p>
<p>Police said Vasquez also lived near the park, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan off Fifth Avenue, another well-off neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Abdella and Vasquez were both charged with second degree murder and depraved indifference for human life, intentional murder and robbery. They were expected to be arraigned Saturday and indicted by a grand jury next week, officials said. If convicted they would face 25 years to life in jail.</p>
<p>The killing was the first in Central Park since the September 1995 murder of Brazilian runner Maria Pinto Moneiro Alves. That murder has not been solved.</p>
<p>Officials said police became aware of the killing after three emergency calls -- one from a private citizen, one from the girl's father reporting the girl was missing and the third from the girl herself.</p>
