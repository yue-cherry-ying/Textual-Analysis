<p>May Brent crude futures were testing $19.00 per barrel on SIMEX at midday on Tuesday, pressured down by the weakness of NYMEX.</p>
<p>May Brent was quoted at $18.85/$19.19 per barrel with value seen at $18.95/$19.00 based on a May/May arbitrage with NYMEX of $1.35.</p>
<p>Brokers said NYMEX crude prices had been pushed lower on ACCESS earlier to test sentiment and that bears would target the seven-month low of $18.68, hit on March 3.</p>
<p>&quot;This market looks like it is going to go lower,&quot; one broker said.  </p>
<p>May in London settled at $19.38 on Thursday ahead of the long bank holiday weekend.</p>
<p>But NYMEX May crude fell 29 cents to $20.41 per barrel on Monday, when London and SIMEX were still closed.</p>
<p>A broker said resistance was now placed at $20.40 for NYMEX May crude. May was last traded at $20.35, down six cents from New York's close on Monday.</p>
<p>Brokers said news that Shell's production in Nigeria was getting back to normal, would take out some minor support for prices.</p>
