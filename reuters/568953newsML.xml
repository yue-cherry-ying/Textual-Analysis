<p>South Africa's Mpumalanga gaming board on Thursday granted the second legal gambling licence in South Africa to Tsogo Sun Holdings Ltd, which it shortlisted in January.</p>
<p>Legislation passed last year legalises casino gambling in South Africa for the first time. Provinces have been given the reins to award licences to companies keen to grab a slice of the multi-billion-rand industry.</p>
<p>Mpumalanga province, in the east of the country, last month awarded the first licence to the Global Resorts South Africa consortium, which plans to build a 200 million rand casino and country club resort in the province's southern highveld region.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision to grant the casino licence in the Northern Highveld area to Tsogo Sun, follows a lengthy process during which the board evaluated the proposals submitted by several registrants in the Mpumalanga Casino Development Project,&quot; board chairman Keith Kunene said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>Kunene said the board had done detailed investigations into all of the shareholders and directors of Tsogo, and considered the objections from other parties in respect of the casino development in the town of Witbank.</p>
<p>Tsogo, a joint-venture between a black consortium and South African Breweries hotels unit Southern Sun, has also been chosen as a preferred finalist in the Mpumalanga town of Nelspruit.</p>
<p>Although the board had completed its probity investigations into Tsogo, it has decided not to grant the Nelspruit licence until judgment in a court case between the board and another casino consortium, Esikhehleni Ltd-Karos Hotels Ltd, Kunene said.</p>
<p>Newspaper reports on Thursday reported however a South African court had ruled on Wednesday in favour of the Karos consortium.</p>
<p>The consortium argued against the granting of preferred finalist status to Tsogo, saying it and the board had not provided enough information on which objections could be raised to the proposed granting of a licence.</p>
