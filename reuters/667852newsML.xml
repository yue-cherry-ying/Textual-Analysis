<p>Tobacco negotiators debated on Tuesday whether to present an incomplete settlement proposal to the White House with the issue of punitive damages unresolved, a source close to the talks said.</p>
<p>Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore, a key negotiator, met with tobacco industry representatives early Tuesday and returned to brief his colleagues later in the morning.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very tough today, very contentious,&quot; Moore told reporters as he rushed into the meeting with other attorneys general representing states that have sued cigarette companies.</p>
<p>A source close to the talks said the attorneys general had suggested that the parties send a letter to the White House asking it to resolve the issue of whether individuals would be allowed to sue to collect punitive damages, which are awarded to punish and deter unwanted behaviour.</p>
<p>The White House Tuesday refused to help resolve issues delaying a tobacco settlement, saying it was up to the parties to reach a deal in their multi-billion dollar legal battle.</p>
<p>&quot;Broadly stating, they know exactly what our position is on fundamental issues related to protecting kids from tobacco use. I don't think there's any question that they know that they've got to meet that test,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.</p>
<p>Talks between tobacco industry representatives and state attorneys general who are suing the industry to recoup the costs of treating diseases allegedly caused by smoking have been going on since early April.</p>
<p>In return for some protections from lawsuits, the cigarette companies would sharply curtail advertising and stop using cartoon characters, pay penalties if youth smoking is not reduced over certain periods, and pay for programmes to encourage smokers to quit.</p>
<p>Sources said Monday that some negotiators hoped to have a proposed settlement to the White House as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday. But McCurry said the parties still seemed at odds on &quot;issues related to liability and damage payments.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't resolve those issues for them,&quot; McCurry said. &quot;We can't render any kind of final verdict on a settlement until we see it.&quot;</p>
<p>Deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsey, who is perhaps President Clinton's closest aide, has been monitoring the tobacco talks. Two key negotiators, Mississippi's Moore and plaintiffs lawyer Dick Scruggs, met with White House staff Monday afternoon to provide an update on progress.</p>
<p>Moore told Reuters early Tuesday morning that the industry was also still balking at the Food and Drug Administration regulating nicotine as well as other issues.</p>
<p>He said the states also wanted protection of so-called whistle blowers, former employees who provide evidence against the industry. States seeking an agreement in which the industry would drop lawsuits against such former employees.</p>
