<p>Families of passengers and crew aboard the Korean Air Lines jumbo jet which crashed in Guam were shown grim photographs of unidentified bodies on Saturday.</p>
<p>Matt Furman, member of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board probing the crash, told the 300 mostly South Korean relatives that the photographs would help the team identify their loved ones.</p>
<p>None of the bodies has so far been identified.</p>
<p>Korean Air Flight 801 was carrying 254 people, mostly South Korean vacationers, from Seoul to Guam when it crashed into low-lying hills near Guam's airport early on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine people survived.</p>
<p>NTSB officials said on Saturday they had recovered only about 100 bodies from the wreckage, most in bad condition.</p>
<p>Guam government officials said the U.S. military was doing its best to recover the bodies but the heat and terrain were holding up the operation.</p>
<p>NTSB team leader George Black said on Friday preliminary investigations showed that the plane suffered no known engine or mechanical failure and was on a controlled, steady descent when it ploughed into the hills.</p>
<p>The flight crew were not aware of any problems before impact, according to the cockpit voice recorder and records of radio conversation with the airport tower, Black said.</p>
<p>KAL and Black discounted media reports that officials had tentatively concluded that pilot error was to blame.</p>
<p>&quot;Those reports are pure speculation and are based on things that we have not even looked at,&quot; Black said on Friday.</p>
<p>The victims' relatives were to visit the crash site for the first time on Saturday when a local Buddhist organisation was to host another service at a make-shift altar.</p>
<p>Twelve people who survived the crash were airlifted to South Korea on Saturday.</p>
<p>The same plane had taken back eight other survivors a day earlier. Doctors said none of them was suffering life-threatening injuries, but KAL officials said three Korean nationals who remained on Guam were critical.</p>
<p>&quot;I am happy to return alive, but I am sorry for those who died,&quot; Kim Min-suk, 29, who suffered minor burns, told Korean media before leaving Guam.</p>
<p>Kim's wife, who also survived, was among those left behind after suffering burns to about 60 percent of her body.</p>
<p>Two of the survivors who arrived on Saturday had suffered burns to 40 percent of their bodies and were admitted to intensive care units at burns centres.</p>
