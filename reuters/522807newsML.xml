<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi urged the Bank of Italy on Saturday to cut official interest rates because price rises have slowed.</p>
<p>&quot;We will soon see the latest economic data, which will confirm the fall in inflation, a fact that could contribute to a reduction in the cost of money,&quot; Prodi told a rally of the centre-left government alliance in Milan ahead of local elections next weekend.</p>
<p>Reduction in the cost of money is not the task of government, but monetary adjustments could be prompted as a consequence of &quot;virtuous behaviour&quot;, he said in a speech reported by the domestic news agency ANSA.</p>
<p>Preliminary data from 11 Italian cities on April 21 and April 22 next week are set to show that Italy's consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in April, compared to 2.2 percent in March, and many analysts see this as a trigger for the Bank of Italy to trim its official discount rate.</p>
<p>The Bank of Italy has cut its discount rate three times in the last 10 months, each time by 75 basis points, with the last reduction coming in January this year bringing the rate down to 6.75 percent from nine percent in early July 1996.</p>
<p>Italy's Treasury minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said earlier this week that he expected Italy's preliminary April CPI data to show an annual rate of 1.8 percent. The official data is published on May 6.</p>
