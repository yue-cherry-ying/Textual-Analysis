<p>An emotional bond stretching back 25 centuries will provide all the inspiration any runner could need when the world championships marathon is held this weekend over the course run by the dying messenger Phidippides in 490 B.C.</p>
<p>Without the use of action replays, split times and a 3,000- strong media army, no one will ever really know what happened the day that Phidippides ran from the town of Marathon to Athens to bring news of the battle between the Athenians and the Persians.</p>
<p>Legend has it that he announced the news with the cry: &quot;Rejoice, we conquer&quot;, then collapsed and died.</p>
<p>When the modern Olympic Games began in 1896, Phidippides' heroism was marked with the inclusion of the marathon based on the course he was said to have taken.</p>
<p>It is gruelling, hilly and tough and on Saturday and Sunday it will test the world's elite marathon runners over the now standard 42.195 kms distance which, in another link with history and tradition, will end at the finish line in the Panathinaikon Stadium, the site of the 1896 Olympics.</p>
<p>The legend of Phidippides and the fact that the first marathon of modern times was run over this course 101 years ago and won by Greece's Spyridon Louis is as inspirational today as it ever was and Australian Steve Moneghetti is more inspired by it than most.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1976 I saw the Olympic marathon on television and at the age of 14 I dreamt of being a marathon runner. I was fascinated with the marathon and started to follow its history.</p>
<p>&quot;I read about the battles between the Persians and the Athenians, the fact the Athenians won despite being outnumbered by about 10 warriors to one, the whole story.</p>
<p>&quot;I became a bit of an expert and lecture on the marathon in Australia and feel like the spokesperson for the marathon there.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't even care if I win or if I am last, I just have a basic desrire to run this course that was first run in 1896. Being a marathoner there's no doubt that the traditional course makes it very special and I can't imagine anything more fantastic than finishing first in the old stadium. Winning on the old course would be the most special moment of my life.&quot;</p>
<p>Italian Giacomo Leone, another medal prospect agreed: &quot;It is very special running on the ancient course and where the modern Olympic Games started. Every runner here has some real emotional pull to the past. But whatever happens in the race, I hope none of the runners suffer the same fate as Phidippides.&quot;</p>
<p>To avoid any possibility of that in the 32 Celsius heat that bakes Athens in the afternoon, both races start at 8 a.m. (0500 GMT).</p>
<p>Two of the top 10 men in the world this year are in the field and the battle for the gold could be bewtween Martin Fiz of Spain, the defending champion who has run a personal best this year of two hours eight minutes five seconds, and Antonio Pinto of Portugal, who has run a best of 2:07.55 this year.</p>
<p>Britain's Richard Nerurkar, another possible medal contender, pulled out of the race on Thursday because of a viral infection.</p>
<p>Moneghetti said the nature of the course left the race wide open.</p>
<p>&quot;It starts to get hilly after about 10 kms and stays hilly for about the next 16 kms. There is a severe uphill at 32 kms with downhills following and the downhill part will be very hard to cope with. Any movement will be on the downhill, that will be one of the key points of the race.</p>
<p>&quot;The hills will gradually eat away at you. It is deceptively tough, and the hot weather will add to it all.&quot;</p>
<p>Reigning world women's champion Manuela Machado, who is 34 on the day of her race on Saturday says she is in superb shape despite being injured in a car crash on June 20 which stopped her training for two weeks.</p>
<p>Olympic champion Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia followed up her success in Atlanta with victory in the Boston Marathon in April and will be a contender again.</p>
