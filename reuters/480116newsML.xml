<p>Sales of new cars in France will fall between 10 and 11 percent in 1997 to around 1.9 million, the French carmakers' association CCFA said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Its forecast is in line with those of the two French carmakers, Renault SA and PSA Peugeot Citroen, which expect the market to shrink around 10 percent.</p>
<p>Car sales last year totalled 2.13 million units, bolstered by a rebate scheme that ran to the end of September 1996. For the first three months of 1997, sales are down 26.5 percent from year-earlier levels, but CCFA chairman Yves de Belabre said the market was expected to improve as the year wore on.</p>
<p>He told a news conference the distortionary effects of the rebates, which pulled sales forward as consumers rushed to take advantage of discounts, were starting to ease.</p>
<p>He also said the slow growth of the French car market, which has not recovered the 1989-1992 sales levels of more than two million units, suggests many old vehicles are due for replacement. &quot;That's why we're reasonably optimistic,&quot; he said.</p>
