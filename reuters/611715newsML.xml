<headline>Yuan ends up against US dollar in Shanghai.</headline>

<p>The Chinese yuan closed up at 8.2924 on Friday from Thursday's 8.2928 against the U.S. dollar, recovering from a technical correction in the past two days due to strong pro-yuan sentiment, traders said.</p>
<p>The weighted average price on Thursday was 8.2923.</p>
<p>The yuan opened down at an intraday low of 8.2930 and rose slightly to move around 8.2925 for most of the session, hitting a high of 8.2918. Trading was dull ahead of the weekend with most business done at 8.2923, traders said.</p>
<p>One dealer said the yuan re-gained its upward momentum on Friday after the technical correction.  </p>
<p>&quot;More buying was seen after the yuan touched the intraday low at the opening,&quot; he said. &quot;But due to the weekend factor, the yuan failed to breach the 8.2920 level at the close.&quot;</p>
<p>A second dealer said the new foreign exchange reserve figures boosted pro-yuan sentiment.</p>
<p>The local media on Thursday reported that China's foreign exchange reserves hit $115 billion at the end of April, an increase of only $3 billion over the end of March.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth of the reserves apparently slowed down in April after months of rapid rises,&quot; the second dealer said. &quot;This indicated the central bank is intervening less on the market.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;If the central bank continues to reduce its activity to depress the yuan, the yuan is likely to set new highs due to increasing demand,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The central bank, the People's Bank, has intervened on a daily basis since the market was establish two years ago to prevent the yuan from rising sharply.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the yuan to move around the 8.2920 level early next week.</p>
<p>The yuan ended up at 7.1866 from 7.2060 against 100 Japanese yen and up at an intraday high of 1.0705 from 1.0721 against the Hong Kong dollar. -- Shanghai newsroom (86-21) 6279-7004</p>
