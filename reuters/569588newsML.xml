<title>USA: Boeing sends officials to scene of crash in China.</title>
<headline>Boeing sends officials to scene of crash in China.</headline>
<dateline>SEATTLE 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Boeing Co. has dispatched local customer service representatives to the site of a China Southern Airlines crash that killed at least 10 people.</p>
<p>Mark Hooper, a spokesman for the aircraft manufacturer in Seattle, said he feared the toll could go higher in the crash of the Boeing 737.</p>
<p>He said company representatives had been dispatched to the crash site from Boeing offices in China, including one in Shenzhen, where the plane crashed on landing.</p>
<p>Hooper identified the plane as a 737-300 model delivered to the carrier in February 1994. The twin-engine plane typically seats from 128 to 149 passengers.</p>
<p>China Southern has about 35 of the Boeing 737s in its fleet, Hooper said.</p>
<p>Boeing generally sends engineers to assist authorities with crash investigations when its airplanes are involved, but Hooper said the company had not yet decided how it would respond to the accident.  </p>
<p>&quot;The unconfirmed figure we have now is 30,&quot; the spokesman said by telephone when asked how many people were killed in the crash.</p>
<p>Officials in the booming city on the border with Hong Kong declined to confirm the death toll, but said at least 10 people were killed when the airliner crashed and burned at the end of a scheduled flight from the southwestern city of Chongqing.</p>
<p>The cause of the crash -- the first civil aviation disaster of its size reported in China for almost three years -- was unclear.</p>
<p>Flight CZ3456 had 65 passengers and nine crew aboard when it crashed at around 9.30 p.m. (1330 GMT) at Shenzhen's airport, local officials said.</p>
