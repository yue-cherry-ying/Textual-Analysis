<p>A refugee group issued an ultimatum to Haiti's culture minister on Friday, threatening riots if he did not turn over profits from a benefit concert by the Haitian-American rap group The Fugees.</p>
<p>In remarks published by the Haitian newspaper Le Nouvelliste, a refugee organisation said it was giving Culture Minister Raoul Peck 72 hours to turn over money from the April 12 concert or face riots.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll come back harder than the students,&quot; said a member of the organisation, which calls itself &quot;Further down the road it will be sadder.&quot; The unnamed member of the group was referring to students who rioted for several days in Haiti last month over school closures.</p>
<p>The Fugees, known for their hit album &quot;The Score&quot;, performed the concert in Port-au-Prince to raise money for thousands of refugees repatriated from the neighbouring Dominican Republic with little more than the shoes on their feet.</p>
<p>But instead of bringing in money, a report by the Office of Coordination for the Fugees released May 13 said the concert generated a deficit of $52,000.</p>
<p>Total revenues for the concert were $476,327, according to the report, despite a reported audience of 80,000. Only 21,000 were reported to have paid for their tickets.</p>
<p>According to the Haitian newspaper Haiti Progres, $353,000 went to an American lighting and Sound Company called BML, while Haitian workers who cleaned up garbage after the concert received $808.</p>
<p>Peck's secretary told Reuters on Friday he had just returned to the country after several weeks abroad but was unavailable for comment on the charges. Last month he was called before Parliament to respond to accusations he stole the money, but he was out of the country.</p>
<p>Many interpreted his silence as guilt.</p>
<p>Peck has made no public comment on the allegations.</p>
<p>The head of the concert organising committee, Leslie Moraille, blamed the Fugees on Haitian radio last week, saying they were the ones who benefited from the concert.</p>
<p>&quot;They will be making videos from the concert, so they will be the ones to benefit 100 percent,&quot; Moraille said.</p>
<p>MTV, which covered the concert, said it had nothing to do with the organisation of the event.</p>
