<p>Tat Lee Bank Ltd said on Thursday it planned an issue of floating rate certificates of deposit (FRCDs) to raise between Singapore $363.9 million and S$399.7 million.  </p>
<p>Tat Lee said in a statement it would issue a maximum of 108.4 million new ordinary shares of S$1.00 each in the capital of the bank to raise cash for expansion and working capital.</p>
<p>The bank said it also aimed to tap medium term funds through the issue of US$100 million and Hong Kong $200 million FRCDs, toghether with a minimum of 45.6 million and a maximum of 54.2 million detachable warrants with expiry in 2002.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong FRCDs would be issued by Tat Lee's Hong Kong branch. Both the rights and FRCD issues would be jointly managed by itself and the Development Bank of Singapore Ltd (DBS).  </p>
<p>Tat Lee said it had already gained approval for its issues from the Monetary Authority of Singapore and an extraordinary general meeting was being convened to get shareholder backing.</p>
<p>Approval for the issue would have to be sought from the Stock Exchange of Singapore, Tat Lee said.</p>
<p>The FRCD issue would be structured as a &quot;bought deal&quot; in which DBS has agreed to subscribe to or procure subscriptions for the entire issue.</p>
<p>The rights issue would be made on the basis of one rights share at the price of S$2.00 for every five shares held.</p>
<p>The rights price of S$2.00 represents a 40 percent discount from the closing price of Tat Lee shares on May 7, 1997.</p>
