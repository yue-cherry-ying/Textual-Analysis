<p>The leading U.S. society of psychologists stopped short on Thursday of condemning the practice of converting gays to heterosexuality through therapy, drawing the ire of leading gay rights groups.</p>
<p>The resolution, passed overwhelmingly at the American Psychological Association meeting here, called for therapists to obtain informed consent from homosexual or sexually uncertain clients before embarking on so-called &quot;conversion&quot; or &quot;reparative&quot; therapy.</p>
<p>The resolution also reaffirmed the group's assertion that being gay did not constitute a mental illness, a position it first adopted in 1973.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the APA voted down a resolution declaring conversion therapy unethical.</p>
<p>It is not known how many people go through conversion therapy, but an organization of converted homosexuals and some religious groups strongly advocate the practice. Opponents of the practice argue that many could enjoy perfectly happy lives as homosexuals but are coerced into emotionally painful, expensive conversion therapy.</p>
<p>Douglas Haldeman, president of the APA's Society for the Psychological Study of Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Issues, released a statement attempting to clarify the APA's carefully phrased position.</p>
<p>&quot;Our concern is that a person, especially a young person, who enters into therapy to deal with issues of sexual orientation should be able to have the expectation that such therapy would take place in a professionally neutral environment absent of any societal bias,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Additionally, therapists should be providing clients with accurate information about same-sex sexual orientation.&quot;</p>
<p>The action by the APA, which represents 150,000 psychologists, researchers, educators, consultants and students, angered those on both sides of the contentious issue.</p>
<p>&quot;Attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation through conversion therapies are morally and ethically wrong,&quot; Kerry Lobel, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, wrote in a letter to the APA.</p>
<p>&quot;While some adults may give their consent to conversion therapy, many are coerced into doing so. The most vulnerable are young people at the mercy of confused parents or adult guardians seeking to erase their own shame or guilt about their child's sexual orientation,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>The Family Research Council, a Washington advocacy group, said the APA was ignoring a growing number of sexual converts.</p>
<p>&quot;Cowed by aggressive homosexual activists who say -- without credible evidence -- that people are 'born gay,' the APA is trying to snuff out genuine hope for those struggling with gender identity problems,&quot; the group's president, Gary Bauer, said in a statement.</p>
