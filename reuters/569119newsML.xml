<p>Leading Russian shares eased in early trade on Thursday and traders said the market would be quiet after a fall on Wall Street on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;New York showed a minus yesterday and it looks like that's not everything: it could be even lower given the decision in the near future on interest rates,&quot; said Prospekt's head of equity trading Andrei Ippolitov.</p>
<p>&quot;Our market fell about one percent and I don't think that anything will change today -- there's absolutely no activity.&quot;</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System 22-share index opened at 338.53 after closing on Wednesday at 338.70. The Dow Jones industrial index closed down 139.67 points on Wednesday at 7085.65.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is due to meet on May 20, which some investors fear could result in an interest rate hike, putting a damper on investment.</p>
<p>National power company UES  rose to $0.2780 from $0.2775 at GMT 1010, but oil producer Surgutneftegaz slipped to $0.813 from $0.830.</p>
<p>Regional power utility Permenergo  announced on Thursday it would pay 1996 dividends of 8,460 roubles per preferred share with a face value of 55,000 roubles, against 6,985 roubles in 1995.</p>
<p>It said it would not pay dividends on ordinary shares, also with a face value of 55,000 roubles, which in 1995 paid out 4,592.5 rouble dividends.</p>
<p>Permenergo, which also announced a four for one bonus share issue, was unchanged at $30.00 at GMT 1030.</p>
<p>Dealers said they did not expect any major Western orders, which have been supporting the market for the past few days, but they said they did not expect the market to fall steeply.</p>
<p>&quot;The market reacted really well to Western demand in the last couple of days, and so we're seeing a slight correction now,&quot; Ippolitov said. &quot;This is not a global fall, at least.&quot;</p>
<p>Some traders said individual &quot;blue chips&quot; had potential to grow further in the second half of the month if demand picked up next week.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation in the week after the holidays could determine how the market will behave in the coming month,&quot; said Mikhail Khaleyev, senior trader at Alfa Capital.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System will observe a Russian holiday starting on Friday. Trading will start again on May 12.</p>
