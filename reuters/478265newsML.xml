<p>Sporting striker Ricardo Sa Pinto was suspended from selection for the national team on Tuesday for hitting Portugal coach Artur Jorge last week.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Soccer Federation said in a statement the suspension would be &quot;for a period to be determined immediately after the conclusion of an inquiry&quot;.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday Bola newspaper said the Lisbon club would fine Sa Pinto between five and seven million escudos ($29,000-$41,000).</p>
<p>Witnesses said Sa Pinto turned up at the Lisbon training ground on Wednesday where the national team were preparing for a World Cup qualifier against Northern Ireland and demanded to speak to the trainer.</p>
<p>Sa Pinto then struck Jorge, knocking him down. He said later he hit Jorge because he was angry with the coach for saying he had excluded him from the national side because of disciplinary problems.</p>
<p>A statement released by Sporting on Monday night said the club had decided to punish Sa Pinto severely for &quot;failing to control his emotions despite strongly attenuating circumstances.</p>
<p>&quot;The sanction that was expressly accepted by Sa Pinto is exclusively an internal matter for the club.&quot;</p>
<p>Sa Pinto apologised for his behaviour but did not mention Jorge by name.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish to apologise to Sporting and to the country because, despite the aggressions of which I was a victim, I should not have reacted in the way I did,&quot; he said on Monday night, reading from a prepared statement.</p>
