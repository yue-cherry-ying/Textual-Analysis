<p>Slovenian shares rose 2.13 percent on Thursday and traders said the rise was due to general optimism that foreign buyers were poised to return to the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic investors finally woke up, obviously the expectation of fresh foreign money is heating up -- the moderate rise is likely to continue for a few weeks,&quot; said Nena Jarc, a trader at Nova Ljubljanska Banka.</p>
<p>The SBI index rose 28.18 points to 1,353.29. The blue chip index has risen 2.79 percent over the past week.</p>
<p>But the push for the market might only be temporary, if foreign investors do not follow the move, Jarc warned.</p>
<p>&quot;If foreigners do not resume buying, in two or three weeks the current optimism could easily disappear.&quot;</p>
<p>In February the central bank blocked foreign buying by ordering foreigners to open special custody accounts in order to trade in shares.</p>
<p>Since then the blue-chip index has dropped over 18 percent, while the average daily turnover has dropped by over 75 percent. The first custodian accounts are expected to take effect from mid-May.</p>
<p>Turnover on Thursday eased to 125.5 million tolars from 134.2 million. Overall 17 shares rose, one fell and one was flat, while nine were untraded.</p>
<p>Petrol trader Petrol was the top gainer and the most actively traded share, jumping 5.25 percent to 19,050 tolars on volume of 1,900 shares for total turnover of 35.7 million tolars.</p>
<p>&quot;In recent days Petrol was significantly undervalued concerning its business performance, but it could soon reach some 20,000 tolars,&quot; said Borut Medvesek, a trader at Eastbrokers.</p>
<p>He said Petrol was likely to rise even higher once international portfolio investors resumed buying.</p>
<p>Food processing company Droga was the only decliner, falling 2.09 percent to 27,120 tolars on volume of 39 shares. -- Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439</p>
