<p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court Friday night blocked the execution of convicted murderer Gary Heidnik, but state authorities immediately appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the death sentence to be carried out early Saturday morning.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania court's action came within an hour of a ruling by the High Court to lift an earlier appeals court stay of execution, allowing official at Rockview prison to prepare to give Heidnik a lethal injection at 2 a.m. Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still preparing to execute Mr. Heidnik at 2 a.m.,&quot; said Tim Reeves, a spokesman for Gov. Tom Ridge. &quot;Obviously if the stay is not lifted we will not proceed, but if it is, we will be ready.&quot;</p>
<p>Convicted of kidnapping and torturing six women, two of them fatally, a decade ago, Heidnik would be the third person to die since the state reinstated the death penalty.</p>
<p>The high court action late Friday reversed a decision by a three-judge panel of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, released earlier Friday. That opinion found him incapable of making a rational decison.</p>
<p>Heidnik, now 53, claimed insanity at his 1988 trial, but a jury convicted him and sentenced him to death.</p>
<p>The strange case came to public attention within hours after Josefina Rivera escaped from a North Philadelphia row house on March 24, 1987.</p>
<p>She had been shackled with five other women in the cellar, which Heidnik had converted into a torture chamber where he enticed streetwalkers into his home to make them his sex slaves. One was killed, and a second died of starvation and mistreatment.</p>
<p>Deborah Dudley's body was found near a rural road in New Jersey. She had been electrocuted. Sandra Lindsay's body was found carved into parts in a basement refrigerator. Heidnik had cooked some parts and fed them to his captives, mixed with dog food, they later testified.</p>
