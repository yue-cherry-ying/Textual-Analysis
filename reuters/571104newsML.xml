<title>THAILAND: Idled Thai textile plants in talks with utility.</title>
<headline>Idled Thai textile plants in talks with utility.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Officials from a Thai electric company and two textile plants have met in a bid to settle unpaid, multi-million dollar power bills which have idled the factories, workers at the plants said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Workers at Thai American Textile Co Ltd told Reuters that officials of the state-owned Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) had met executives of their company as well as with Thai Melon Textile Co Ltd to try and find a way to settle unpaid electricity bills amounting 202 million baht ($7.77 million).</p>
<p>&quot;I think the talks would bear some fruitful results which would allow the plants to resume operation,&quot; said one worker.</p>
<p>The PEA cut electricity supplies at both plants on May 1 after their owner, Chutipat Photiratnanangkul, was unable to pay the four-month-old bills.</p>
<p>Both plants produce textiles and are located in Bangkok's neighbouring province of Pathum Thani.</p>
<p>The PEA said it was the first time it had had payment problems with either of the companies, which have been operating for about three decades.</p>
<p>About 3,000 employees out of some 12,000 are still staying in houses built on the factories' compounds. The two plants are using generators to produce electricity for the workers.</p>
