<p>Japan's NEC and China's Huahong Microelectronics Co have signed a $1 billion deal to build an integrated circuit production facility in Shanghai, the Business News reported on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The two companies have set up a joint venture to open China's largest integrated circuit production line at a plant being built by Huahong in the Pudong development zone in Shanghai, the Business News said.</p>
<p>The China Daily reported that the registered capital for the venture would reach $700 million, of which Huahong would be responsible for 71.4 percent.</p>
<p>Huahong was set up last December with the support of the top Chinese leadership to pull China into the front ranks of world producers of ICs, key building blocks in electronic products of all kinds.</p>
<p>China currently lags far behind the world standard in both quality and quantity of IC production.  </p>
<p>The new Shanghai plant, known in Chinese as Project 909, aims to open in mid-1998 with a monthly production capacity of 20,000 IC wafers with a thickness of either 0.35 or 0.5 microns and length of eight inches, the Business News said.</p>
<p>Current Chinese IC production capacity is only capable of making wafers 1-2 microns in thickness and less than 4.5 inches in length.</p>
<p>China used 6.78 billion IC chips last year, of which more than 80 percent were imported, the China Daily said.</p>
<p>Domestic production in 1996 totalled 1.15 billion chips, but is projected to rise to 2.5 billion a year by the turn of the century, it said.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, an NEC spokesman confirmed the company had agreed to the joint venture and said he expected a formal signing of the agreement, probably by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Huahong is a state-owned company affiliated with China's Electronics Industry Ministry.</p>
