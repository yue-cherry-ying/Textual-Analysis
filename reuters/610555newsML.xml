<headline>TIFFE Euroyen ends flat after subdued trade.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>May 23 settlement  prev settlement</p>
<p> TIFFE Euroyen 3M (Z)	98.91		   98.91</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Key December three-month Euroyen interest rate futures settled unchanged on Friday after moving within a narrow range in subdued trade.</p>
<p>The market ignored a report quoting Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Toshihiko Fukui as saying that the outlook for Japan's economy remains unclear, despite its recovery, traders said. Aggressive sales occured on Wednesday on reports quoting him as saying the BOJ was considering the right time for a rate hike.  </p>
<p>The December was at 98.91 after moving between 98.88 and 98.91. Turnover was 35,894 contracts.</p>
<p>Asked about Wednesday's request made by Rengo, Japan's largest labour group, to raise the discount rate, Jiji news agency quoted Fukui as saying he had told Rengo that he sympathised with the group to a certain extent.</p>
<p>According to Jiji, Fukui said he also told the group that it should give consideration to the economic situation of entrepreneurs and smaller enterprises.</p>
<p>The Wednesday report quoted Fukui as saying that the request was understandable.  </p>
<p>Fukui was also quoted as saying on Wednesday that the central bank was considering the right time to raise rates, but the BOJ later said he was misquoted.</p>
<p>The market shrugged off weak economic data for March released on Friday.</p>
<p>Japan's index of leading economic indicators stood at 30.0 on a scale of 100 in March. The index was below 50, the so-called &quot;boom or bust&quot; mark, for a third successive month.  </p>
<p>&quot;Nobody was active today. But it seems that the topside has been getting heavier since BOJ Deputy Governor Fukui's remark on Wednesday,&quot; said a dealer at a long-term credit bank.</p>
<p>The topside was capped by firmness in Tokyo stocks and growing concerns since Wednesday over a possible rate rise in the summer, traders said.</p>
<p>In the interbank market, the key overnight call money was traded at around 0.49 percent, down from Thursday's 0.50.</p>
<p>Upward pressure in the key rate has eased because banks have recently started to raise funds with longer-term maturities.  </p>
<p>About 120 billion yen of the long-end benchmark three-month certificates of deposit (CD) were issued at 0.58 percent. The rate was unchanged from Thursday's issued rate.</p>
<p>The BOJ left the money market neither in surplus nor in shortfall by refraining from its regular market operation.</p>
<p>The BOJ's credit stance has been neutral since the start of the current bank reserve period.</p>
