<p>Roger Clemens made Carlos Delgado's first-inning grand slam stand up as he pitched eight shutout innings Friday for his major league-leading 11th win in the Blue Jays' 4-1 victory over the Oakland Athletics.</p>
<p>With the win, Clemens (11-0) matched Dennis Lamp's 1985 team record for the longest winning streak to start a season and continued to justify Toronto's faith in signing him to a huge free-agent contract in the off-season.</p>
<p>&quot;It's great when it comes in this fashion,&quot; said Clemens. &quot;We got runs early and I was able to keep them at bay.&quot;</p>
<p>The big right-hander, who checked the Athletics on five hits and struck out eight, exceeded his win total for all of 1996, when he went 10-13 with the Boston Red Sox.</p>
<p>The victory snapped Toronto's four-game losing streak and marked the second time in less than a week Clemens has beaten Oakland to snap a four-game skid by the Jays. In their last 11 games, Toronto is 3-8 with Clemens picking up all three wins.</p>
<p>Delgado's grand slam off Mike Oquist (1-2) was his 11th home run of the year and third in three games.</p>
<p>Mark McGwire scored Oakland's only run of the game with a homer off reliever Mike Timlin. It was McGwire's 23rd homer of the season and the 352nd of his career, moving him into 46th place on the all-time list, breaking a tie with Dick Allen.</p>
<p>At Minnesota, Paul Molitor slugged a three-run homer in the eighth inning - his fourth hit of the game - to snap a 6-6 tie and lift the Twins to a 9-7 win over the Anaheim Angels.</p>
<p>Molitor's game-winning blast came off reliever Pep Harris.</p>
<p>&quot;I have seen this guy pitch, but I hadn't faced him,&quot; said Molitor. He kept pounding that sinker down and in. It was nice to see it go out.&quot;</p>
<p>Said Harris: &quot;That pitch was basically on the ground.&quot;</p>
<p>Minnesota manager Tom Kelly enjoyed himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Very entertaining ballgame,&quot; Minnesota manager Tom Kelly said. &quot;We got behind, came back, took the lead, got behind, came back, tied it up, and then Paulie certainly got a big hit for us.&quot;</p>
<p>In Detroit, promising Jose Cruz Jr. belted a pair of two-run homers and fellow rookie Derek Lowe went 5 1/3 innings for his first big-league victory as the Mariners posted their fifth straight win, 6-3 over the Detroit Tigers.</p>
<p>Cruz, playing just his sixth major-league game, hit his first homer of the game and second of the season off starter Omar Olivares (4-4) in the second inning to stake Seattle to a 2-0 lead. He connected off Olivares again in the sixth to extend the Mariners' edge to 6-3.</p>
<p>Lowe (1-1), from nearby Dearborn, Michigan, allowed three runs and five hits. Bobby Ayala notched the save.</p>
<p>In Boston, Sandy Alomar stroked four consecutive doubles and Orel Hershiser allowed just one run over seven innings as the Cleveland Indians cruised to a 7-3 win over the Red Sox.</p>
<p>Alomar doubled in the second, fourth, fifth and eighth innings to become the 16th player in major-league history to hit four doubles in a row.</p>
<p>The last Indians player to hit four straight doubles was Vic Wertz in 1956. The last major-leaguer to perform the feat was Oakland's Dave Duncan in 1975.</p>
<p>Hershiser (6-2) took the win, and Tom Gordon (3-6) the loss.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Lyle Mouton highlighted a five-run fifth inning with a two-run double and Albert Belle went 4-for-4 as the Chicago White Sox ended Baltimore's seven-game winning streak with a 7-3 victory over the Orioles.</p>
<p>Chicago broke open a 2-2 tie with five runs in the fifth against starter Scott Erickson (8-2).</p>
<p>Doug Drabek (5-4) won for the fourth time in five decisions, allowing two runs and eight hits in 5 1/3 innings.</p>
<p>In New York, Kenny Rogers allowed three runs over 5 1/3 innings and four relievers combined to hold the Brewers hitless the rest of the way as the New York Yankees defeated the Brewers 6-3.</p>
<p>Rogers (4-3) survived six hits and four walks to post his first win since May 15.</p>
<p>Every Yankee batter had a hit and all but one drew a walk as New York overcame an early 2-0 deficit to make a loser out of Brewers starter Jose Mercedes (2-2).</p>
<p>Todd Dunn hit his first major-league homer for Milwaukee.</p>
<p>In Kansas City, Jose Rosado pitched a complete-game five-hitter as the Royals edged the Texas Rangers 2-1.</p>
<p>Catcher Sal Fasano scored the winning run on Jay Bell's infield single in the fifth inning off Texas starter John Burkett (4-5), who also went the distance, yielding just one earned one on seven hits.</p>
<p>Rosado improved to 5-3.</p>
