<p>The Cannes film festival will celebrate its 50th birthday next month with a thriller-heavy competition slate and awards ceremonies attended by the great and the good of the silver screen, organisers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Festival supremo Gilles Jacob told a news conference that Golden Palm candidates at the May 7-18 jamboree would include Johnny Depp (&quot;The Brave&quot;) and Gary Oldman (&quot;Nil By Mouth&quot;), both first-timers in directing, and Wim Wenders (&quot;The End of Violence&quot;) and Nick Cassavetes (&quot;Call It Love&quot;).</p>
<p>After sifting through 860 films, Jacob's team picked 19 for the French Riviera resort competition judged this year by a jury led by French actress Isabelle Adjani.</p>
<p>But Jacob said his list was not closed and would welcome offerings from Constantin Costa-Gavras and Abbas Kiarostami if they were ready in time.</p>
<p>&quot;Eight of the films in selection are thrillers, excluding &quot;Hamlet&quot; by Kenneth Branagh which I suppose I could include. These days people want violence, blood, gore,&quot; Jacob said.</p>
<p>American movies take the biggest share of the selection with six entries including Clint Eastwood's &quot;Absolute Power&quot; (shown out of competition) and Curtis Hanson's thriller &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; based on a novel by James Ellroy.</p>
<p>France's spectacular-specialist Luc Besson kicks off the Cannes season with the futuristic &quot;Le Cinquieme Element&quot; (The Fifth Element). Jacob said he had not decided yet whether it would compete for the Golden Palm.</p>
<p>Other candidates include China's Zhang Yimou (&quot;Keep Cool&quot;), Italy's Francesco Rosi (&quot;La Tregua&quot;), Britain's Michael Winterbottom (&quot;Welcome to Sarajevo&quot;), Canada's Atom Egoyan (&quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;) and France's Matthieu Kassovitz (&quot;Assassin&quot;).</p>
<p>No Cannes festival would be complete without controversy, and critics are looking to a midnight screening of maverick Abel Ferrara's &quot;Black Out&quot; and his lascivious coupling of Claudia Schiffer and Beatrice Dalle to supply it.</p>
<p>To mark the 50th anniversary, virtually all the 35 surviving directors who have won the Golden Palm will attend the award of a special Palm of Palms to Sweden's Ingmar Bergman.</p>
<p>They include Michelangelo Antonioni, Robert Altman, Franceso Rosi, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Emir Kusturica, Costa-Gavras, Wenders, David Lynch, Jane Campion, Chen Kaige and Quentin Tarantino.</p>
<p>Best actor prize-winners and other stars will also flock to Cannes: Robert de Niro, Bruce Willis, John Travolta, Kim Basinger, Michael Jackson, Gina Lollobrigida, Catherine Deneuve, Hugh Grant and Victoria Abril among others.</p>
<p>Culture Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy, attending the news conference the day after President Jacques Chirac called a May-June snap parliamentary election, said he did not know whether the head of state would stick by his earlier pledge to attend May 11 commemorations.</p>
<p>He said the state was giving the festival 22 million francs ($4 million) this year, the lion's share of its 30 million ($5 million) budget.</p>
<p>Both Oliver Stone's &quot;U-Turn&quot; and James Mangold's &quot;Copland&quot;, widely tipped for Cannes, failed to make it in the end, officially because they were unfinished.</p>
<p>Asked about industry reports that &quot;U-Turn&quot; had been judged too violent, Jacob answered: &quot;I did not see extracts from it but I have been told that there is a certain degree of violence...</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot have an accumulation of violent film upon violent film in Cannes, because in the end it becomes unbearable.&quot;</p>
