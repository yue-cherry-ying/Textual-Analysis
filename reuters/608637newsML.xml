<p>South African shares ended the week down on Friday, suffering a case of the blues inspired by a month of weaker than expected corporate earnings, dealers said.</p>
<p>The industrials sector drifted downwards for most of the day as poor sentiment held the market in its grip. The market launched a late mini-rally as Wall Street kicked off to a strong start, but the main indices still ended firmly in negative territory.</p>
<p>&quot;It was an aimless day. We just drifted down and are hoping for better things next week,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The all-share index dropped 24.4 points to 7,071.7 as the industrials index shed 39.9 points to 8,312.1. Volumes were light at 587 million rands worth of trade.</p>
<p>Since clothing firm Edgars posted poor results at the start of May other large players have followed suit. &quot;We have had a mixed bag of results recently and that has seen the industrial sector take a knock,&quot; said Grahame Graham-Parker, general manager at Infinity Asset Management.</p>
<p>But market players are looking to a flood of economic figures due next week for fresh guidance as to the country's economic health. Numbers coming out include April trade, first quarter gross domestic product, money supply, private credit and April consumer price inflation.</p>
<p>The day was not marked by any big trades, with only fuels to chemicals firm Sasol Ltd really attracting inteRest as it ended unchanged at 55.50 rand after 380,000 shares traded in a corporate finance deal.</p>
<p>Industrial group Murray &amp; Roberts dropped 25 cents to 10.70 in volumes of 1.48 million shares, including several bookover deals and 100,000 shares bought by a foreign investor.</p>
<p>Amongst movers were strong rises in shares in some firms in the recently-merged NBS-Boland banking ahead of the reshuffling of some of its interests.</p>
<p>Shares in Samgro Investment Holdings Ltd, the pyramid holding of Boland Bank Holdings Ltd with a 66.5 percent stake, were suspended at the close of trade under bourse rules requiring a listed pyramid firm to hold at least 50 percent of a subsidiary. Samgro finished at 21.00 rand, up 350 cents.</p>
<p>Shares in the Board of Executors Ltd (BOE), which ealier this year bought a 22.2 percent stake of NBS while the NBS Boland group bought a 24.3 percent stake in BOE, also climbed, adding 250 cents to 150.00 rand.</p>
<p>BOE parent firm, BOE Corp Ltd lost 65 cents to 825 cents.  </p>
<p>The golds sector had its third losing day in a row, dropping 3.4 points to 1,192.1.</p>
<p>The price of bullion has been stuck in a range of $340-45 an ounce in recent weeks and market players see no prospect of any firm break out.</p>
<p>&quot;It will test the downside before it will test the upside. I certainly wouldn't be buying into the gold shares at the time,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Near-dated equity futures lost ground in line with their cash market cousins and ended off their settlement prices.</p>
<p>The all-share June contract was last at 6,448/56 from 6,485 as the industrials contract edged down to 8,081/85 from 8,139. Golds contracts were at 835/43 from 845.</p>
