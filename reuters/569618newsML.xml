<title>USA: Brent crude offerings in U.S. remain scarce.</title>
<headline>Brent crude offerings in U.S. remain scarce.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Foreign crude offerings to the U.S. were fundamentally unchanged Thursday, with North Sea Brent offerings scarce and only a few trades discussed.</p>
<p>Foreign crude players said an early June Vasconia cargo was sold around June West Texas Intermediate/Cushing minus $3.60, after being on offer at minus $3.55.</p>
<p>North Sea arbitrage numbers were slightly wider Thursday, with Brent-WTI around plus $1.60 in favor of WTI, and July at the same level, around five cents higher than Wednesday.</p>
<p>Narrow Brent-Dubai spreads have pushed many North Sea and West African barrels away from the U.S. to destinations in the Far East, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The North Sea market has firmed up, but there has been no change in the lack of barrels headed to the Gulf,&quot; said a U.S. player.</p>
<p>There was still some discussion of Brent being shown for early June delivery at June WTI -70 cents, steady from Wednesday talk.</p>
<p>Nigerian Brass River remained on offer for early June with asking prices of Dated Brent +$2.05.</p>
<p>Traders noted there was plenty of North Sea Oseberg sweet crude backed-up in the Bahamas.</p>
<p>&quot;There were nominations for two million barrels, but there is no sign of it moving out of there,&quot; said a trader.</p>
