<p>Union Planters Corp said Thursday it and Magna Bancorp Inc have agreed to merge in a deal valued at approximately $323 million.</p>
<p>Under a merger agreement, Union Planters will exchange approximately 0.5165 common shares for each Magna common share, Union Planters said. Based on Union Planters' closing price of $45.50 on May 8, the Union Planters' shares to be swapped for each Magna share are worth $23.50 each.</p>
<p>Magna closed at 18-1/4, up 3/4 on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Union Planters said the merger is tax-free for Magna shareholders and will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.</p>
<p>The merger is subject to approval of Magna shareholders and regulators and to normal contractual conditions, Union Planters said.  </p>
<p>The deal is expected to be completed during the late third or early fourth quarter of 1997, it said.</p>
<p>Union Planters, which was founded in 1869, has $15 billion in assets and has over 430 banking offices in Tennessee, Mississipi, Missouri, Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana and Kentucky.</p>
<p>Magna, with assets of $1.3 billion, is parent of Magnolia Federal Bank of Savings, which operates 62 banking locations in Mississippi and south Alabama.  </p>
<p>Magna also operates Magna Mortgage Co, a subsidiary that has $3.1 billion in loans that will be combined with Union Planters' own mortgage loan unit, which has a loan servicing portfolio of more than $10 billion, Union Planters said.</p>
