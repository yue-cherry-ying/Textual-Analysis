<headline>U.S. West Coast crudes turn dormant after ANS sale.</headline>
<dateline>LOS ANGELES 1997-03-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. West Coast crude markets were dormant late Monday, as traders evaluated a sluggish West Texas Intermediate (WTI) market and weaker Alaskan crude prices.</p>
<p>West Coast benchmark Alaska North Slope (ANS) was bought by one of California's largest refiners early Monday. The refiner agreed to take delivery of over 400,000 barrels of in early May at $1.02 under May WTI.</p>
<p>&quot;There were very few buyers and lots of sellers,&quot; said the refinery's trader. Traders said increased sales of Colombian and Ecudorian crudes have taken buyers out of the market.  </p>
<p>Over the next two months, Chevron was reportedly buying four cargoes of Ecuadorian crude containing 360,000 barrels each, traders said.</p>
<p>Monday's ANS deal reflects an 11-cent drop from the $0.91 sale in mid-March.</p>
<p>BP, a dominant ANS producer, did not sell the cargo Monday, and offered crude at $0.90 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;It's certainly not gonna get any tighter than 90 cents,&quot; one buyer said.</p>
<p>In California markets, producers last week sold spot barrels of California Wilmington crude at 0.85 and 0.79 cents a barrels, traders said, marginally raising the price from a range of $0.70 yo $0.80 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>Other California grades were steady.</p>
