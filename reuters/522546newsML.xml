<p>Tom Glavine scattered eight singles for his second shutout at Coors Field and the Atlanta Braves pounded out 23 hits en route a 14-0 drubbing of the Colorado Rockies on Friday.</p>
<p>Glavine is the only pitcher with more than one shutout at home run friendly Coors Field, where only six have been thrown since the ballpark opened in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;It's something to throw a shutout in this park, not too many guys do it,&quot; Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said after his team recorded it sixth consecutive victory. &quot;He was strong from the first inning on.&quot;</p>
<p>Kenny Lofton had his second five-hit game of the season for Atlanta, including a solo homer in the fifth off Mike Munoz. Lofton had four runs scored and two RBI for the game.</p>
<p>&quot;He's had 20-some hits in the last six games,&quot; Cox said. &quot;Kenny's got a chance to hit anywhere from .300 to .380, he's that good.&quot;</p>
<p>Fred McGriff had four hits and four RBI, while Michael Tucker went 3-for-5 with three RBI and two runs scored for Atlanta.</p>
<p>The Rockies were limited to eight singles and grounded into a team-record five double plays.</p>
<p>Colorado starter Jamey Wright was lifted with no outs in the third inning as the Braves touched him for eight runs and 10 hits. Munoz surrendered three runs and six hits in three innings of relief.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, Glenallen Hill drilled a two-run double and Jeff Kent followed with an RBI single as the red-hot Giants scored three runs in the ninth for a 5-4 win over the Florida Marlins.</p>
<p>Florida closer Robb Nen (1-1) started the ninth with a 4-2 lead, but promptly loaded the bases before Hill ripped a 2-2 pitch off the wall in centre field to tie the game.</p>
<p>After Barry Bonds was intentionally walked, Kent lined a 1-2 pitch just out of the reach of shortstop Edgar Renteria to seal the Giants' seventh straight win.</p>
<p>Doug Henry (1-0) got the final two outs of the ninth for the victory.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, two-sport star Deion Sanders went 3-for-4 with an inside-the-park home run and Dave Burba allowed one run over six innings as the Cincinnati Reds stopped a four-game slide with a 6-1 victory over the Pirates.</p>
<p>Burba (3-1) allowed four hits, walked four and tied a career high with 11 strikeouts.</p>
<p>The Reds scratched out single runs in the second, third and fourh innings and added three in the ninth on just one hit with the help of two wild pitches by Jeff Granger and a passed ball by Keith Osik.</p>
<p>Kevin Elster's solo homer accounted for Pittsburgh's run.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, Mike Piazza hit a three-run homer and Ramon Martinez allowed one earned run over 6 1/3 innings as the Dodgers beat the Houston Astros 5-3.</p>
<p>Piazza hit his second homer of the season in the fifth against Astros starter Mike Hampton (1-3) as the Dodgers erased a 2-1 deficit.</p>
<p>Martinez (2-1) allowing two runs -- one earned -- and eight hits with three walks and seven strikeouts to lower his ERA to 2.31. Hampton surrendered five runs and nine hits in 5-2/3 innings for the loss.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, Calvin Maduro picked up his first major league win and Rico Brogna drove in three runs with a pair of doubles as the Phillies snapped a five-game losing skid with an 8-3 win over the Montreal Expos.</p>
<p>Maduro (1-2) pitched 7 2/3 innings, allowing three runs and six hits while striking out three for the win.</p>
<p>Jim Bullinger (0-3) took the loss, allowing five runs -- three earned -- over 4 1/3 innings as the Expos lost for the seventh time in their last nine games.</p>
