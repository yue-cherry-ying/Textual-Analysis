<p>A former American prisoner of war who was shot down over Vietnam's Red River delta in 1966 and held for years in the infamous &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot; jail is set to become the first U.S. ambassador here in more than 22 years.</p>
<p>Douglas &quot;Pete&quot; Peterson, whose posting has been delayed by domestic politics and legal wrangling, will mark history when he arrives on Friday at Hanoi's Noi Bai airport as the first U.S. ambassador since the war ended in 1975.</p>
<p>But while the event may be recorded as a milestone in relations between the former foes, the symbolism of his arrival is likely to go largely unnoticed outside government, business and media circles.</p>
<p>More than half Vietnam's 77 million population is too young to have any living memory of a war which tore their country apart and turned its name into a late 20th-century metaphor for the human conscience.</p>
<p>Even the villagers who caught Peterson on the night of his 1966 parachute arrival in Vietnam in a mango tree expressed surprise at the fuss being made about his return.</p>
<p>&quot;The war is ended. The past is closed,&quot; 70-year-old Nguyen Dang Sinh told Reuters in an interview earlier this year. &quot;I don't have much to say.&quot;</p>
<p>Since ties between the two countries were normalised in July 1995, progress in relations has been painstakingly slow. Diplomats on both sides concede their biggest task is working to restore confidence and overcome suspicions.</p>
<p>&quot;Peterson's arrival will definitely help matters,&quot; Vietnam's own ambassador in Washington said earlier this week as he prepared to depart to begin his assignment in the United States. &quot;It's a very good thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Peterson's priority is furthering the efforts to account for the 2,124 American personnel still listed as missing-in-action in Indochina from the war, 1,585 of them in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Today, what's left of the remains of downed planes and helicopters has been largely destroyed by time and the tropical environment. Nonetheless, for reasons which critics say are largely linked to domestic politics, the search goes on.</p>
<p>But he is also expected to oversee more tangible achievements in relations during his tenure, particularly in the areas of economics and trade.</p>
<p>Last month, the two countries signed a copyright accord, a minor step towards the goal of achieving a full-trade agreement, which would lead to Most Favoured Nation trading status for Vietnam.</p>
<p>Although a date for a trade deal remains elusive, officials say an air service accord allowing U.S. airlines to fly to Vietnam may be in place before the end of this year.</p>
<p>Peterson's arrival, however, comes at a time of what some analysts say are increasing signs of a hands-on approach by Washington towards Asia.</p>
<p>Last month, the United States announced sanctions against Burma. On Tuesday, Rear Admiral Michael Haskins, commander of the U.S. Navy in Japan, told a defence conference in Singapore that one of the roles of the United States was to &quot;deter the rise of any hegemonistic power or coalition&quot; in the region.</p>
