<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss stocks' small gains eke out another record.</title>
<headline>Swiss stocks' small gains eke out another record.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Swiss shares ended only marginally higher after moving in a narrow band on Friday, but still managed another record close.</p>
<p>Financials outperformed industrials. Banks and insurers were supported by the prospect for low interest rates in important markets, while dollar-sensitive shares were depressed by the recent slide of the U.S. currency.</p>
<p>The blue-chip Swiss Market Index ended up 4.6 points at 5,181.0, while the all-share Swiss Performance Index was up 6.13 points to 3,272.93.</p>
<p>Bourse volume stood at 2.47 billion francs.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade on Monday is likely to be quiet as input from Wall Street will be missing,&quot; one dealer said. U.S. markets will be closed on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. London share trading is also closed for a holiday.</p>
<p>Nestle was hit by news of rising coffee prices and a downgrade by Morgan Stanley to neutral from outperform. &quot;But the stock still held up quiet well given these negative factors,&quot; one trader noted. Nestle gave up nine francs to 1,798.</p>
<p>Insurer Zurich was among the winners of the day, advancing 18 francs to 504. The stock was reportedly sought due to a positive study.</p>
<p>Insurer Swiss Re clawed back most of the losses it suffered in early trade due to profit-taking. The shares ended down three francs at 1,952.</p>
<p>SBC, which lagged the other major banks on Thursday, was up 12 francs to 354. CS Group and UBS bearers also firmed. One dealer said negative press in connection with dormant Holocaust funds may have put some pressur on UBS shares.</p>
<p>Novartis and Roche gave up around 0.7 percent. Novartis were down 14 francs at 2,000. Roche lost 90 francs to 13,190.</p>
<p>Volume on Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex) was generally low.</p>
<p>Of the total 119,805 options traded, CS Group accounted for 12,419 calls and 5,390 puts. One dealer said the high activity in CS Group options reflected to hedging transactions.</p>
<p>Implicit volatilities were generally on the rise, one trader noted. On the futures side, 2,789 SMI futures contracts changed hands. June SMI futures ended up 18.4 points at 5,173.9.</p>
