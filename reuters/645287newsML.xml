<p>Israeli and PLO officials will meet in Cairo on Sunday in a bid to revive their peacemaking, stalled since March over Jewish settlement building.</p>
<p>But both sides remained entrenched in their positions and there was no sign of an ease in the deadlock.</p>
<p>The Egyptian initiative was almost scuttled when Foreign Minister Amr Moussa announced the meeting prematurely on Saturday, prompting both sides to issue clarifications before finally confirming the talks would take place.</p>
<p>&quot;(Palestinian negotiator) Saeb Erekat will leave tomorrow for a trilateral meeting between the Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian delegations in Cairo,&quot; said Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu Rdainah.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak, who had earlier denied a date for the meeting had been set, said the talks would take place at 5 p.m. (1400 GMT) on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;The final details of the meeting were set this evening in a conversation between (cabinet secretary) Danny Naveh and (Egyptian adviser) Osama al-Baz,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Moussa said the talks would focus on breaking the impasse reached when Israel started work in March on a new Jewish settlement at an Arab East Jerusalem site which Israel calls Har Homa and Palestinians refer to as Jabal Abu Ghneim.</p>
<p>Palestinians say the Jewish state must freeze settlement construction in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war, while Israel vows to continue building homes for Jews there.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel has not agreed to freeze construction at Har Homa,&quot; said Bazak when asked about an Israel Radio report quoting Palestinians officials as saying the Jewish state had accepted an Egyptian proposal to suspend construction.</p>
<p>Palestinians and Western diplomats also denied the report.</p>
<p>Moussa announced the meeting to reporters after Arafat briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo on his latest contacts with the Israelis. He said Arafat had met on Friday with an adviser to Netanyahu who proposed new Israeli ideas to break the deadlock.</p>
<p>PLO officials identified the Israeli adviser as Yitzhak Molkho. He will participate in the talks on Sunday along with Naveh, Netanyahu's political adviser Uzi Arad and an adviser to Foreign Minister David Levy, Yaacov Bardugo.</p>
<p>The PLO officials said Arafat also met the head of Israel's Shin Bet security service, Ami Ayalon on Friday.</p>
<p>PLO officials said Ayalon told Arafat Israel had decided to revoke the VIP pass it had given top West Bank intelligence official Tawfiq Tirawi, suspecting he was involved in the killing of three Arabs who sold land to Jews.</p>
<p>Tirawi denied the allegations.</p>
<p>Egypt has taken Washington's place as main mediator in the crisis since a summit between Mubarak and Netanyahu last month.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources say Egypt is pushing a five-point plan which included a freeze on any change in the status of Jerusalem and a ban on Jewish settlement building in the West Bank for &quot;a sufficient period&quot;.</p>
<p>In return the Palestinians would give a firm commitment to address Israel's security demands, they added.</p>
<p>Palestinians said they were briefed in Cairo on the Egyptian plan and that the Israeli position had not changed.</p>
<p>&quot;Until now there is nothing new from the Israelis, they still refuse to freeze settlement activities,&quot; said Abu Rdainah. &quot;However, Egyptian efforts would continue to try to bridge the gaps.&quot;</p>
