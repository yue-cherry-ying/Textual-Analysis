<p>Boxers who carry a particular gene previously associated with Alzheimer's disease may be more likely to suffer chronic brain damage from blows absorbed in the ring, researchers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Gene mapping of 30 boxers, three of whom were still active, found that those with a form of the gene apolipoprotein E were more susceptible to long-term brain damage, or dementia pugilistica, a condition with symptoms similar to Alzheimer's and commonly called &quot;punch drunk.&quot;</p>
<p>Study author Barry Jordan, formerly with New York Hospital-Cornell University Medical College and currently with the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine in Los Angeles, said the form of the gene may indicate the individual's ability to heal traumatic injuries to the brain.</p>
<p>A battery of tests on the 30 boxers who ranged in age from 23 to 76 years old, showed 11 exhibited normal brain function, 12 showed mild brain damage, four were moderately impaired and three showed signs of significant impairment. Those who had participated in more than 12 bouts were at greater risk of being chronically impaired.</p>
<p>Based on a scale from zero to nine with a higher number corresponding to greater brain damage, boxers who had the gene form had a mean score of 3.9 compared to 1.8 for those without.</p>
<p>&quot;The presence of (the gene form) in a boxer would not necessarily preclude a boxer from participation, but could be an indication to minimise or more strictly limit exposure to the sport,&quot; Jordan wrote in the Journal of the American Association. He suggested genotyping a large, representative sample of boxers to further explore the genetic link.</p>
<p>The study could have potential ramifications for the regulation of boxing and other contact sports such as football, soccer and hockey where brain damage can occur, he wrote.</p>
<p>Some boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, develop Parkinsonism, a disorder characterised by a masklike face, rigidity and slowness of movement, or ataxia, which is characterised by loss of coordination, and clumsiness affecting balance, gait, eye and limb movements and speech.</p>
