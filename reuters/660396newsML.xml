<p>Turkey is studying a plan to enable it to adjust grain import taxes as world prices move, so that it could harmonise with European Union policy, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have begun studying the plan,&quot; said a senior agricultural ministry official.</p>
<p>&quot;It will make it possible for the government to be in harmony with the European Union after our customs union agreement with the EU,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>His comments came after being asked about government plans to raise taxes on wheat imports from the current 15 percent to slow imports and protect farmers. Foreign trade officials said the decree to raise the tax would soon be presented to the government for approval before it can take effect.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the new plan, the government will adjust the tax rate in shorter periods, depending on movements in international prices,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;It also brings compensatory payments to farmers in case they lose over differences between local and international prices,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The tax rates will be determined by an &quot;intervention commission&quot; formed by officials from agriculture ministry, grain board, traders and millers.</p>
<p>Asked if the formation of a new government after elections later this year or early next year would affect the progress of the plan, he said: &quot;This work is independent of politics and for the benefit of the country.&quot;</p>
<p>Ilker Tanik, head of Turkish Millers' Association, said the new system would help traders see their future clearly and bring Turkey closer to the EU's common agricultural policy (CAP).</p>
<p>&quot;Importers and users of local grain will benefit from the new plan,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;This will boost the quality of local output because farmers will not be able to sell bad quality grain,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Turkey entered into a customs union with the 15-nation EU in January 1996 and annulled mutual customs taxes on several industrial goods.</p>
<p>But unprocessed farm products including grains were excluded from the agreement and Turkey pledged it would bring its farm production and pricing policies into harmony with the CAP by 2005.</p>
<p>Officials said the need to increase the wheat import tax had arisen after Turkey's initial estimates that it would produce some 18 million tonnes of wheat in 1997/98, up from 16.5 million a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;There is local wheat and imported wheat. But farmers should be protected against imports,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>Tanik estimated Turkey would produce up to 17 million tonnes of wheat in 1997/98, plus carry-over stocks of two million tonnes from 1996/97.</p>
<p>&quot;There will not be a supply problem this year but imports will continue despite an expected slowdown because of the planned tax rise,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Trade officials said the tax rise would only be in wheat and &quot;wheat-related grain&quot;. Taxes for other grains including barley would remain at 15 percent.</p>
