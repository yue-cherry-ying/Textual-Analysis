<p>Football legend Sir Stanley Matthews, who is 82, was taken to hospital on Friday suffering from chest pains.</p>
<p>The former Stoke City, Blackpool and England player was being treated in the cardiology department of North Staffordshire Hospital, near his home in Stoke-on-Trent, in the English midlands, his wife Mila said.</p>
<p>She said he had been troubled by flu and bronchitis for several weeks, although he appeared well when he was guest of honour at the Golden Jubilee Dinner of the Football Writers Association in London a week ago.</p>
<p>She said: &quot;He woke up this morning with pains in his chest which were worse than usual. We decided it was best for him to go to hospital for tests.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as I know they were doing X-rays but I don't know any more than that at this stage. I'll be seeing him later today and I don't know how long he will be there.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr John Davis said at the hospital: &quot;Sir Stanley was brought into the hospital with pain in the chest and is being observed and is undergoing tests. His condition is comfortable.&quot;</p>
<p>Matthews, regarded as the greatest player of his generation and one of soccer's all-time greats, was nicknamed the &quot;Wizard of the Dribble&quot; and played for England 54 times -- and made another 30 appearances in unofficial wartime internationals.</p>
<p>He became a much-loved national hero for his great skills as a winger and is best remembered by most football followers when, as a 38-year-old, he was instrumental in Blackpool's 1953 F.A. Cup final win over Bolton -- despite carrying an injury.</p>
<p>He made his league debut for Stoke in 1932 -- and played his final First Division match in 1965 when he was 50. He always says he quit too early and could have played on until he was at least 52.</p>
<p>He made his England debut when he was 19 and his last international appearance when he was 41.</p>
<p>He was England's first Footballer of the Year in 1948, an award he won again in 1963. He was Europe's first Footballer of the Year in 1956 and was the first soccer player to be knighted in 1965.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Sir Stan, who over the years has kept himself super fit, officially opened the new Cardiology Department at the North Staffordshire Hospital.</p>
