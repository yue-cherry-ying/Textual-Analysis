<p>Britain's Atlantis Investment Management said on Thursday it was launching a new open-ended Asian growth fund investing in equities and related securities.</p>
<p>Atlantis chief executive officer Peter Irving told Reuters the fund, Atlantis International - Asian Growth Fund, would be managed by former Schroders fund manager Tony Jordan.</p>
<p>It is incorporated in Luxembourg as a SICAV, or open-ended investment company.</p>
<p>Atlantis was set up in 1994 by Irving with a view to building specialist bottom-up funds run by established fund managers with a strong track record.</p>
<p>Jordan moved to Atlantis from Schroders in 1996. Irving was also at Schroders before founding Atlantis, which has assets under management of about $300 million.</p>
<p>Irving said the fund was aiming to raise $50 million, but would be comfortable with a larger intake of possibly $100 million.</p>
<p>Atlantis has a policy of capping the size of funds under management to enable performance to reach its full potential.</p>
<p>&quot;We won't dilute the quality of the portfolio by taking in money if we don't think it is appropriate,&quot; Irving said.</p>
<p>The Asian Growth fund will have the ability to invest in small and medium cap growth stocks, and will be well diversified, with typically 50 to 70 holdings. Diversification at country level will be achieved by limiting exposure to less liquid markets to 25 percent of assets.</p>
<p>Irving said he was not concerned at the timing of the launch given the weakness in Asian markets so far this year.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of the companies we like suffer from a case of the baby being thrown out with the bathwater and we see a great opportunity to invest in these countries now when they are flat on their backs,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If we see value in Thailand, Philippines, Korea, or wherever markets have been absolutely hammered then we will buy those markets, and if we can't see value in a place like Hong Kong we won't have anything in Hong Kong...It is going to be value that drives stock selection and asset allocation.&quot;</p>
<p>The fund is being marketed mostly in Europe, but will be available in other regions.</p>
<p>Atlantis also has a Korean Smaller Companies fund run by Peter Irving and the Atlantis Japan Growth Fund managed by former Schroder Japan fund manager Ed Merner.</p>
