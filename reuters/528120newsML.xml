<p>A discarded cigarette was the probable cause of a fire that destroyed the luxury vacation home of the president of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and caused $1 million in damages, fire officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The three-floor beach home of Reynolds President Andrew Schindler on upscale Figure Eight island was reduced to a row of charred pilings after it caught fire while workers installing ceiling tile were at lunch on Friday.</p>
<p>Damage to the house was estimated at $750,000. Damage caused to houses nearby by flying embers as the fire raged was estimated at $250,000.</p>
<p>&quot;Every county fire department around was there,&quot; said a spokesman for the Wilmington Fire Department.</p>
<p>Fire officials said inspectors had not made a final determination of what caused the accidental blaze. But they said it likely was caused by a cigarette butt left by a worker who told inspectors he had smoked near where the fire started about half an hour before the crew left.</p>
<p>&quot;We have limited the area of origin to the front of the home, in an area where a workman reported discarding a cigarette just a few minutes before the fire started,&quot; Phil Kouwe, fire administrator for New Hanover County Fire Services, said. &quot;We're looking strongly at that as a potential source of ignition for the fire but not ruling out any other possible causes as well.&quot;</p>
<p>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco is a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. The second-largest U.S. tobacco company, its brands include Camel, Winston and Salem.</p>
