<p>One child was killed and four were hurt when a bomb they found on an army shooting range in Turkey's eastern province of Erzurum exploded, security officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;One child was killed, another four were injured as a bomb went off,&quot; a security official told Reuters on phone. He gave no further details.</p>
<p>The state-run Anatolian news agency said children had found a bomb in an army shooting range near their house in the township of Pasinler and took it home, where it exploded. Details about the bomb were not available.</p>
<p>Four-year-old Fedia Ogurce died at the blast and four other children in the family, aged between six and 12, were badly injured and taken to hospital.</p>
<p>Anatolian said security officials had begun to search houses in the township on rumours that other children had picked up bombs from the shooting range.</p>
<p>Turkey's third army corps is based near Erzurum and troops from the province sometimes join the fight against rebel Kurds in the nearby southeast of Turkey.</p>
<p>More than 22,000 people have been killed in over 12 years of fighting between government troops and guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) seeking self-rule in the mainly Kurdish southeast.</p>
