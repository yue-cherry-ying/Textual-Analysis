<title>UK: Minor metals - Bismuth firms, cadmium builds steam.</title>
<headline>Minor metals - Bismuth firms, cadmium builds steam.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Bismuth prices extended a rise over the past week and may move higher near-term against the backdrop of speculative and merchant buying.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in a brisk minor metals sector, cadmium was poised for an upside attack, while antimony bottomed out in anticipation of a snap higher, traders said.</p>
<p>Bismuth, trading at between $3.25 and $3.45 a pound or possibly higher according to several traders, was eyeing levels towards $4.00 near-term.</p>
<p>Low Peruvian and Mexican stocks and talk of shipment delays from major producer China, where sellers were holding out for higher prices, helped the drive higher.</p>
<p>Talk of the need to cover a large short position underpinned cadmium which was looking towards levels of $1 a pound near-term.</p>
<p>Like bismuth, cadmium has remained neglected for the majority of 1997 apart from the last two to three weeks which have seen a reappraisal of fundamentals. &quot;Prices have jumped on low stocks which were slowly cut during 1996/early 1997,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Antimony's ability to hold support between $2,100/$2,150 and a slowing of Chinese offers could signal a bounce in prices, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Considering the support levels have held firm consumers could start to cover,&quot; one player in the antimony market said.</p>
<p>A bounce towards well-established resistance at $2,500 may emerge, another said.</p>
<p>Zaire and the continued suspension of U.S. Stockpile material kept cobalt simmering. The Defense National Stockpile Center confirmed that sales of cobalt will remain suspended until the Court of Federal Claims rules on the complaint filed by Minor Metals Inc.</p>
<p>A Stockpile official said a hearing was scheduled on May 15, but it was not clear if there will be a decision on that date.</p>
<p>Conflicting views on the output of Zaire's state-owned Gecamines swirled around the market. Several traders suggested that production was still flowing and that shipments of high grade material was continuing. Others said that no material has been moved from the Shaba region.</p>
<p>Opinions on magnesium were divided. After a period of inactivity, several traders suggested that prices were firming against a backdrop of a lack of spot material.</p>
<p>&quot;Alloy can demand in the U.S. is robust,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>But with offers from Russian stockpiled material also in the background another trader said the market was seen at lower levels.</p>
<p>Recently 4,000 tonnes of Russian stockpiled magnesium was offered and 10,000 tonnes more may be available.</p>
<p>Countering the talk of stockpiled material and its potentially bearish influence a source close to a Russian producer said &quot;The material is around 12 years old and not in very good condition...not many people are likely to buy it in this state.&quot;</p>
<p>The source suggested Russian producers will purchase the material which will be used in the domestic market.</p>
