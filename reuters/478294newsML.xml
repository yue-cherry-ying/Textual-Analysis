<p>The Czech Republic's hopes of qualifying for next year's World Cup reach a crisis point on Wednesday when they meet Yugoslavia in a European group six tie.</p>
<p>The 1996 European championship runners-up lie fourth in their group with just four points from three games. Spain lead with 13 points after six matches, followed by the Yugoslavs and Slovakia with 12 points from five matches.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to win, that's all,&quot; said coach Dusan Uhrin, adding he had yet to decide on the final lineup for the match.</p>
<p>Still fresh in the minds of the Czechs is November's stinging 1-0 loss in Belgrade, where they wasted several scoring chances.</p>
<p>Uhrin will draw mainly from last summer's outfit, with 14 players retaining their place in the 19-man squad.</p>
<p>The Czechs have largely failed to reproduce the form which carried them to the Euro 96 final, which they lost 2-1 to Germany.</p>
<p>Uhrin's biggest problem of late has been his side's lack of scoring punch up front. The Czechs have scored six goals in four games, but all of those came against lowly Malta.</p>
<p>Sparta Prague's Vratislav Lokvenc has been called up for his first cap in more than a year to replace veteran Radek Drulak.</p>
<p>The urgency of the Czechs has not been lost on Yugoslavia, but with only midfielder Risto Vidakovic complaining of injury, players and officials said they were looking to use a win in Prague to set up a showdown against group leaders Spain.</p>
<p>Lineups:</p>
<p>Czech Republic (from): Ludek Miklosko, Pavel Srnicek; Miroslav Kadlec, Jan Suchoparek, Michal Hornak, Tomas Repka, Karel Rada, Radek Bejbl, Karel Poborsky, Radoslav Latal, Jiri Nemec, Patrik Berger, Petr Nedved, Martin Frydek, Martin Cizek, Vladimir Smicer, Pavel Kuka, Horst Siegl, Vratislav Lokvenc.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia: (probable): Ivica Kralj; Zoran Mirkovic, Goran Djorovic, Slavisa Jokanovic, Miroslav Djukic, Sinisa Mihajlovic, Vladimir Jugovic, Dejan Savicevic, Predrag Mijatovic, Branko Brnovic, Albert Nadj,</p>
