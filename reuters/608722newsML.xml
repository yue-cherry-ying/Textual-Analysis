<p>Russia and Belarus signed a watered-down union charter on Friday vowing to protect political freedoms and market reforms in the two Slav states but clearly committed to keeping the countries independent.</p>
<p>Presidents Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus embraced and smiled as they exchanged red folders containing the document, intended to plug the gaps in the largely declarative Union Treaty they signed on April 2.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a special day in the lives of the Russian and Belarus people,&quot; Yeltsin said at the signing ceremony in the glittering St Vladimir Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace.</p>
<p>Belarus -- the Land of the White Russians -- has no heavyweight modern history as an independent nation. Its population of 10 million is dwarfed by Russia's 150 million and the great majority of its people speak Russian, not the closely related local language, in daily life.</p>
<p>The idea of a new bond to replace the ties broken when the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991 has broad support in both countries.</p>
<p>But the union which results is a far cry from the milestone event once planned to change the destinies of the two states.</p>
<p>Those plans were scotched by Kremlin liberals fearful that Luakshenko -- who has kept the political and economic life of Belarus much closer than Russia's to the old Soviet model -- would gain a foothold on power in Moscow.</p>
<p>Yeltsin made clear the two countries would no longer pursue the aim of forming a common state, which would have been a much more far-reaching step than the new union or the vague &quot;commonwealth&quot; which Russia and Belarus formed in April 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Our union is aimed at forging further relations of brotherhood, friendship and all-round co-operation between Russia and Belarus,&quot; Yeltsin said, setting the limits for integration.</p>
<p>Before the Kremlin ceremony, Lukashenko said the union, which is still to be ratified by both parliaments, contained nothing essentially new.</p>
<p>&quot;By signing the charter we are just going to put into writing the process of integration between our countries which is already unfolding,&quot; the authoritarian Lukashenko told Ekho Moskvy radio.</p>
<p>The union will have supranational bodies, led by a council chaired by Yeltsin and Lukashenko, whose decisions will be binding on the national governments.</p>
<p>But decisions taken by these bodies need the approval of both presidents, minimising their importance.</p>
<p>Opinion polls show that the majority of the people in both former Soviet republics support the idea of close integration. Yeltsin is also thought keen to rebuild ties and shake off his image as the destroyer of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>But the deal has met opposition from different corners.</p>
<p>Lukashenko's nationalist opponents in Belarus have condemned the planned union as a plot by Moscow to revive its empire and</p>
