<headline>N.J. Gov proposes Camden oversight board -- paper.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>New Jersey Gov. Christine Whitman has proposed a fiscal oversight board for Camden which would have broad authority over spending and layoffs, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>New Jersey funds about 60 percent of the city's $100 million budget, and Whitman said local officials need to be held more accountable for spending.</p>
<p>Although the oversight board would stop short of a complete takeover, it might have the same effect, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The plan, which would require legislative approval, would require all spending be approved by the proposed board.</p>
<p>The board would consist of seven members that would include representatives from the city council, the Governor's office, and the state Legislature.</p>
<p>The governor said the needed legislation would be introduced in April or May at the latest, and the board would go to work sometime after July 1, when the state's fiscal 1998 budget year begins.</p>
