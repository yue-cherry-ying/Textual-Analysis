<p>Many ethnic Hungarian pupils in Slovakia refused to accept their year-end report cards on Friday because they were written only in Slovak rather than the traditional bilingual way.</p>
<p>The move to reject the Slovak-only reports was a protest against what the ethnic Hungarians consider to be a violation of their minority rights by the government of Premier Vladimir Meciar, according to leaders of the ethnic Hungarian community.</p>
<p>Slovakia has been battered by European Union and U.S. criticism over the Bratislava government's slowness to implement democratic reforms and improve its treatment of ethnic minorites.</p>
<p>&quot;A more than 77-year long tradition of bilingual reports has been broken,&quot; Bela Bugar, leader of the ethnic Hungarian Christian Democrats Party, told the independent radio Twist.</p>
<p>&quot;The current regime is behaving even worse than that of (Jozef) Tiso... which tolerated bilingual reports,&quot; Bugar, an opposition member of parliament said, referring to the president of the 1939-45 Slovak Nazi-puppet state.</p>
<p>TASR, the official Slovak news agency, reported that many ethnic Hungarian students in various spots in the south of the country had joined in the protest.</p>
<p>Slovakia's Education Ministry ordered only Slovak-language reports to be issued in elementary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>The directive applied also to schools in southern Slovakia where most of the 600,000-strong ethnic Hungarian minority live, many of whom use Hungarian as a teaching language.</p>
<p>The ministry based its decision on a 1995 state language law enacted for the east European country of five million people.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue of single-language reports in Hungarian-language schools... is strictly according to the law which says all official documents must be in the state language,&quot; Gejza Sadecky, head of the ministry's school department, told TASR.</p>
<p>Many parents refused to send their children to school in protest against the move, while several Hungarian language schools administrators disobeyed official orders and issued bilingual reports.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the EU called on Slovakia to withdraw a school handbook, published with EU financing, that denies the persecution of Slovak Jews during World War Two.</p>
<p>Meciar, attending an EU conference on Friday in Amsterdam on Friday, rejected the calls but agreed that the book would not be used as a text in Slovak schools.  REUTER  271602 GMT jun 97</p>
