<p>Officials said on Tuesday nearly 10,000 people were homeless from a weekend fire blamed on playing children that razed a slum in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa.</p>
<p>District Officer David Rithaa said 305 buildings for 2,400 families with an estimated four people in each were destroyed in the blaze in Kisimani village in north Mombasa on Sunday.</p>
<p>The fire spread fanned by strong winds from the Indian Ocean and vehicles from the Mombasa fire brigade were unable to reach the centre of the blaze because of a lack of access roads.</p>
<p>Residents blamed the fire on playing children who threw embers on a palm thatched roof. Some on Tuesday still had no shelter while others started rebuilding with what they could salvage.</p>
<p>Many homeless moved into mosques and churches in Mombasa.</p>
<p>District Officer Rithaa said he could not send maize to feed the homeless until the genuine victims had been identified.</p>
<p>&quot;The food is there but we cannot release it until we know the genuine victims as some people are likely to take advantage of the situation and grab the food aid,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Some residents who had gone to visit to family members elsewhere in Kenya for the Easter holidays returned to Mombasa to find their homes wrecked and all their belongings destroyed.</p>
