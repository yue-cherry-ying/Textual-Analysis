<title>VIETNAM: Vietnam urges speed on Hong Kong boatpeople return.</title>
<headline>Vietnam urges speed on Hong Kong boatpeople return.</headline>

<p>Vietnam called on Friday for the repatriation of boatpeople from Hong Kong to be speeded up ahead of the British colony's return to China at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>&quot;Vietnam has said it hoped that U.K.-Hong Kong authorities would accelerate the repatriation of Vietnamese boatpeople so that the last of them could go home before the crown colony's reversion to China...&quot; the official daily Vietnam News said.</p>
<p>Diplomats said Vietnam's message appeared to be aimed at clearing itself of blame in advance for the inevitable failure to meet Beijing's deadline for clearing Hong Kong's detention camps.</p>
<p>&quot;The Vietnamese are in a hurry to get the problem cleared before China takes over,&quot; said one diplomat. &quot;They don't want anyone to put them in the dock if any boatpeople are left.&quot;</p>
<p>The diplomat said Hanoi, which has in the past been accused of dragging its feet on repatriation, had been working energetically as of late to bring home those cleared for return.</p>
<p>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office in Hanoi said 153 migrants were flown back to Vietnam on Friday, which took the number of non-refugees still in Hong Kong down to 1,630.</p>
<p>Assistant High Commissioner Sergio Vieira de Mello said earlier this month that about 500 non-refugees would still be in Hong Kong after the handover, most of them non-nationals whose identity or places of origin remain to be determined.</p>
<p>He said there would also be about 1,000 genuine refugees, some of whom have been living in Hong Kong camps for as long as a decade.</p>
<p>The UNHCR will urge traditional resettlement countries at a meeting in Geneva on Monday to receive some of the refugees.</p>
<p>De Mello has called on countries such as the United States, Canada and Australia to make an eleventh-hour display of &quot;humanity and charity&quot; towards the refugees.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is waiting for other countries to make the first move,&quot; said one diplomat.</p>
<p>Members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council's Security Panel have suggested that Britain, as the current colonial power, should take all boatpeople and refugees remaining after the handover. However, one source said he understood that Britain was considering taking only 19 refugees.</p>
<p>The boatpeople are the last of a human tide of hundreds of thousands who fled their homeland after the communist victory in the Vietnam War in 1975. About 1.4 million migrants have now been resettled in third countries or returned home.</p>
