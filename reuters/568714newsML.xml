<p>Programme of matches in the German first division this weekend. League positions in parentheses. All kickoff times GMT</p>
<p>Friday</p>
<p>Duisburg (14) v Hansa Rostock (15)  KO 1730. These two are too close to the relegation zone for comfort. Although both should manage to avoid the drop this is an important encounter.</p>
<p>Duisburg are two points ahead of the former East Germans.</p>
<p>    Werder Bremen (10) v Cologne (11)    1800</p>
<p>One point separates two teams in middle of table but this game has little significance with little to play for except pride.</p>
<p>    Saturday	 All Kickoffs 1330 GMT</p>
<p>Karlsruhe (7) v Borussia Dortmund (4)</p>
<p>European Cup finalists Dortmund are in danger of missing out on the two places in the Champions Cup next season since they are seven points behind leaders Bayern. This would be a good game to get their challenge back on track.</p>
<p>St. Pauli (17) v Borussia Moenchengladbach (13)</p>
<p>St Pauli are in serious danger of going down but they will be given no help by a team who are also too close to the relegation zone.</p>
<p>Bochum (5) v VfB Stuttgart (3)</p>
<p>This is one of the clashes of the weekend with both teams battling for a place in Europe next season. Stuttgart, five points behind Bayern, really need a win to keep alive hopes of winning the title.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich (1) v Freiburg (18).</p>
<p>Bayern must win this one against a team doomed to second division football next season. But the Bavarians have struggled against weaker opponents in the past. Anything but three points could set off more internal squabbling in Germany's most controversial dressing room.</p>
<p>Arminia Bielefeld (8) v 1860 Munich (6).</p>
<p>1860 still have a good chance of getting a place in Europe. An away win would certainly boost their chances.</p>
<p>Schalke (9) v Fortuna Duesseldorf (16)</p>
<p>Schalke's minds have been on the UEFA Cup final against Internazionale Milan where they won the first leg 1-0 on Wednesday. A victory in the final seems to be their only realistic chance of returning to European competition next season.</p>
<p>    Sunday				  1600</p>
<p>Bayer Leverkusen (2) v Hamburg (12)</p>
<p>This is perhaps one of the most important moments of the season for Leverkusen. If they win and Bayern slip up, they really could have a chance of winning their first ever championship.</p>
