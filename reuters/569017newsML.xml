<p>Russian ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky scuffled with television reporters on Thursday after he was denied access to a World War Two commemoration attended by President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>The flamboyant Zhirinovsky, furious after Kremlin bodyguards barred him from a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, bundled a woman reporter into his car and slammed the door on her.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses said he also tangled with a cameraman.</p>
<p>&quot;She was a hooligan, that girl... How could I know that she was a correspondent?&quot; Zhirinovsky exclaimed on Russian television later, adding: &quot;What if there had been a shootout?&quot;</p>
<p>Zhirinovsky, leader of Russia's extreme right Liberal Democratic Party, has hit the headlines with scuffles before.</p>
<p>He once threw a glass of juice at Boris Nemtsov, now a first deputy prime minister, in front of the television cameras, and scrapped with fellow deputies in the lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>Zhirinovsky is immune from prosecution because of his parliamentary status.</p>
<p>But Itar-Tass news agency quoted Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov as saying he would investigate Thursday's incident, which took place on the eve of celebrations marking the 52nd anniversary of the end of World War Two.</p>
<p>Zhirinovsky complained in a statement released by his office that presidential guards had denied him access to the tomb, but he did not mention the altercation with the two journalists.</p>
<p>The reporter, Julia Olshanskaya, told Russian television she had thought Zhirinovsky was about to abduct her.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought of my family, of my parents,&quot; she said. &quot;I thought, 'It is good to be a journalist but not to that extent'.&quot;</p>
