<p>Albania's general election took place in a climate of terror and was marred by irregularities which distorted the result, chairman of the defeated Democratic Party Tritan Shehu was quoted on Tuesday as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;There were serious irregularities,&quot; Shehu was quoted as telling Italian weekly magazine La Discussione in an interview to be published in full on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;In 30 of the seats in the south we weren't even able to present our candidates. We were completely blocked. He said his party had accepted the result &quot;only so as to avoid confrontation and violence&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't consider it to be a real result but we put the interests of the country before those of the party.</p>
<p>&quot;We had 25 percent of the vote to their 47 percent. I know that is not the Albanian reality because the election took place in a climate of violence, of terror...&quot;</p>
<p>Shehu's Democrats were ousted by Albania's ex-communist Socialists in a poll described by international monitors on Tuesday as &quot;acceptable given the prevailing circumstances&quot;.</p>
<p>The Socialists and their allies look set for a two-thirds majority in parliament as a result of the June 29 and July 6 voting, which followed months of armed anarchy.</p>
<p>Shehu said the election had handed power back to rulers from the impoverished Balkan country's hardline Communist past.</p>
<p>&quot;The future depends on what the Socialists do,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Their victory has brought people from the old regime back into power, people who have committed crimes, people who, until a little time ago, were going around terrorising others, people who, I'm sure, don't have a democratic vision of public life.</p>
