<p>Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Ian Macfarlane said on Thursday he would be disappointed or surprised if there was a reversal in the trend in short-term interest rates in the immediate term.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be disappoiting or surprising if a reversal were to occur in the immediate term,&quot; Macfarlane told a federal government committee in answer to a question about how long interest rates were likely to stay down.  </p>
<p>Macfarlane said the bank's policy on interest rates was traditionally &quot;pre-emptive&quot; and that cuts were normally followed by a period of stability.</p>
<p>&quot;We have tended in Australia to make our movements in monetary policy, I think, quite early -- the word there is pre-emptive -- to do two or three quickly then to have it followed a period of stability,&quot; Macfarlane said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the experience of the last five or six years I think you would see that is the sort of pattern that has emerged and we hope that is the sort of pattern that could emerge on this occassion,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Macfarlane said he hoped economic conditions do not force the bank to reverse its position on rates.</p>
<p>&quot;I would hope that that would not prove necessary.&quot;</p>
