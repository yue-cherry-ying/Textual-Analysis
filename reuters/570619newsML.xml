<title>GERMANY: Germany's Herzog urges Europeans to back unity.</title>
<headline>Germany's Herzog urges Europeans to back unity.</headline>
<dateline>AACHEN, Germany 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>German President Roman Herzog on Thursday urged Europeans not to underestimate the dangers of what he called re-emergent nationalism, saying it could be contained only by embracing European integration.</p>
<p>After receiving the Charlemagne prize for promoting European unity, Herzog said in a speech that he understood the apprehension among citizens of the European Union about giving up their currencies and allowing the transfer of more power to EU headquarters in Brussels.</p>
<p>The ceremony was overshadowed by the death of former West German defence minister and one-time Bundestag President Kai-Uwe von Hassel who collapsed and died aged 84 as he arrived at Aachen town hall to attend the ceremony.</p>
<p>Herzog urged Europeans to be &quot;Euro-critics&quot; who recognise the problems but support integration rather than &quot;Eurosceptics&quot; wanting to abandon the project altogether.</p>
<p>&quot;If we want to prevent the conflict scenarios predicted by the Eurosceptics evolving into self-fulfilling prophecies, then we must not cede the field now to those prophets of doom,&quot; Herzog said.</p>
<p>&quot;The spectres which stalked Europe in the 1930s have not been banished for all time. Everywhere they seem to be re-emerging and we must drive them back again by all the means at our command.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Aachen city authorities said veteran politician Hassel had been a regular guest of honour at the annual ceremony for the Charlemagne prize.</p>
<p>Hassel, a Christian Democrat (CDU), was West German defence minister from 1963 to 1965 and president of the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) from 1969 to 1972.</p>
<p>After the Social Democrats (SPD) became the largest party in parliament in the 1972 elections, Hassel remained a CDU deputy in the Bundestag until 1980 and focused on European politics.</p>
<p>Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth paid tribute to the Bonn veteran in an inteview with WDR television as &quot;a great political personality&quot;.</p>
<p>Visiting King Juan Carlos of Spain presented Herzog with the prize -- one of Germany's top political awards.</p>
<p>Launched in 1950, the prize is awarded in the western city of Aachen where the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne, who tried to convert Europe into a single Christian empire, was buried in 814.</p>
<p>Previous recipients of the prize have been Britain's war-time prime minister, Sir Winston Churchill, and West Germany's first post-war chancellor, Konrad Adenauer.</p>
