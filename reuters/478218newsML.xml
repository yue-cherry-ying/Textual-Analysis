<p>Pocket Communications Inc., a wireless personal communications services (PCS) operator, said it voluntarily sought bankruptcy protection Monday after defaulting on $80 million in loans.</p>
<p>Privately held Pocket had bid $1.4 billion in the auctions for entrepreurial operators held by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission last November for for its licenses and has paid the FCC more than $140 million.</p>
<p>The company had one license covering 35 million potential U.S. customers in markets such as Chicago, Detroit, Dallas-Ft. Worth, St. Louis, New Orleans, Las Vegas and Honolulu.  </p>
<p>Pocket officials said they filed for court protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland, Northern Division.</p>
<p>In a phone interview, Dan Riker, the company's chairman and chief executive, said the company voluntarily chose to file for bankruptcy to protect its assets against a group of creditors to which it had defaulted on $80 million in loans.</p>
<p>The creditors include a group of Asian entrepreneurs and telecom equipment makers Siemens AG and Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson, the executive said.  </p>
<p>Pocket was one of several top bidders in last year's PCS auctions that have buckled under the strain of interest payments required by the FCC to pay for the PCS licenses.</p>
<p>Pocket, NextWave Telecom Inc., which bid $4.7 billion, and several other winners had asked regulators for a more lenient timetable in which to repay the bids, which have become loans from the government on which the bidders pay interest.</p>
<p>The companies had asked for an annual repayment schedule instead of a quarterly one.</p>
<p>Pocket said it filed for bankruptcy to satisfy short-term financing requirements and to initiate a restructuring plan.  </p>
<p>Pocket had previously secured commitments for more than $646 million in financing to build out its PCS networks from equipment vendors including Ericsson, Siemens' Stromberg-Carlson unit and Northern Telecom Ltd.</p>
<p>It said it had completed deals with Ericsson and Northern Telecom for $481 million of that financing.</p>
<p>However, Riker said Pocket's financing plans had hinged on an initial public offering planned for last fall, which had to be postponed due to delays in the FCC auction process.</p>
<p>A second shot at an IPO in January fell apart when Wall Street soured on initial offerings in the wireless sector.  </p>
<p>Analysts forecast a shakeout in the industry as a host of new players engage in a city-by-city battle for market share with established cellular incumbents typically owned by cash-heavy regional Bell companies and long-distance carriers.</p>
<p>Riker said the company views the filing as a temporary measure to ensure its long-term viability. He forecast that the reorganization process would take several months before it can emerge from Chapter 11 on firm financial footing.</p>
<p>Referring to the bankruptcy protection, he said that, &quot;If there was no waiver, the creditors would have had a right to seize the collateral,&quot; or PCS licenses it holds.  </p>
<p>Pocket said it has about $1 billion in assets -- largely the value of its wireless liceneses -- and about $1.5 billion in liabilities -- largely the long-term debt owed to the FCC.</p>
<p>The company has begun construction of PCS networks in its Las Vegas and Honolulu markets and has switching equipment and local management in place there.</p>
<p>Riker said Pocket's financial troubles would delay the launch of its services. &quot;We think (autumn) is probably the time frame,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The company said it had applied to the Bankruptcy Court for authority to hire the law firm of Whiteford, Taylor &amp; Preston as its bankruptcy counsel, and Perkins Coie as general corporate counsel. Pocket is based in Washington.</p>
<p>Brightpoint Inc, an Indianopolis-based provider of retail packaging and fulfillment services for many cellular phone providers, has invested $5 million in Pocket.</p>
<p>Riker started Pocket in 1993 after 12 years with MCI Communications Corp, where his jobs included heading the company's cellular business before it was sold to McCaw Cellular.</p>
