<p>Homecourt was no advantage for the Miami Heat or the Houston Rockets Wednesday as the New York Knicks and Seattle SuperSonics snatched road victories in NBA second-round playoff action.</p>
<p>Allan Houston and Patrick Ewing combined for 18 points in a 22-3 burst that closed the third quarter and gave the Knicks an 88-79 victory over the Heat in the opener of their Eastern Conference semifinal series.</p>
<p>Houston scored 27 points and Ewing 24 for New York, which remained unbeaten in the playoffs and wrested the homecourt edge away from former coach Pat Riley, who was denied his 1,000th NBA coaching victory by his former team and now bitter rivals.</p>
<p>&quot;There wasn't a lot of trash-talking, just good old-fashioned hard play,&quot; Houston said. &quot;I think when you prepare for the worst, it doesn't seem as bad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The guy that beat us tonight was Allan Houston,&quot; said Riley.</p>
<p>The Knicks held the Heat without a basket for more than seven minutes of the second half. Miami set franchise playoff lows with 19 percent shooting and three baskets in the third quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;We had the opportunity in the third quarter to open up a little more space but they were committed to not letting that happen,&quot; said Riley.</p>
<p>&quot;They played extremely well and we've got a really big, big game coming up on Friday.&quot;</p>
<p>Tim Hardaway scored 21 points and Alonzo Mourning added 20 for the Heat, who beat out the Knicks for their first Atlantic Division title but lost to them for the fourth time in five meetings this season, including all three in Miami.</p>
<p>The Heat opened a 52-44 lead with 5:39 left in the third period before Ewing and Houston took over. Ewing made a 10-footer and two free throws and Houston hit a three-pointer before the Knicks took the lead for good at 53-52 on a jumper by Charles Oakley with 3:30 remaining. The quarter ended with New York up 66-55 -- a 19-point turnaround.</p>
<p>&quot;It was one gigantic run that did us in,&quot; Riley said.</p>
<p>Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy credited backup point guard Charlie Ward with keying the burst. Ward had four points and five assists in 18 minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;Charlie played it very well defensively,&quot; Van Gundy said. &quot;He did an excellent job. He's a true point guard. He makes the game be easy for the other players. He gets everyone involved. I thought he ran the team very well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Charlie Ward did a good job of finding me,&quot; said Houston.</p>
<p>Ewing dominated his hyped matchup with Mourning, grabbing 16 rebounds. Mourning, who had early foul trouble, had just six rebounds and missed 7-of-13 free throws.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a big rivalry,&quot; Ewing said. &quot;Bragging rights are at stake.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not a 1-on-1 matchup,&quot; Mourning said. &quot;It's not a boxing match. It's 5-on-5.&quot;</p>
<p>Larry Johnson had 14 points and Oakley added 11 and 12 rebounds for the Knicks, who shot 36 percent (26-of-73) from the field but made 30-of-32 foul shots.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously free throws are very important in the playoffs,&quot; Van Gundy said. &quot;We hit an extraordinary percentage tonight. They struggled a little bit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We've got to make our free throws,&quot; Mourning said.</p>
<p>In Houston, Shawn Kemp had 22 points, 15 rebounds and two huge baskets down the stretch as the SuperSonics held off the Rockets 106-101 and evened their Western Conference semifinal series at one game apiece.</p>
<p>&quot;You've just got to believe in yourselves and we did that tonight,&quot; said Kemp.</p>
<p>Hersey Hawkins scored 21 points and Sam Perkins, a surprise starter who virtually neutralised Houston superstar centre Hakeem Olajuwon, added 18 for the SuperSonics, who opened a 21-point lead, nearly blew it, then recovered to gain the homecourt edge. Game 3 is Friday in Seattle.</p>
<p>After losing three of four regular-season games and the opener on Monday, Seattle resumed its dominance of Houston. The Sonics have won 15 of the last 19 meetings and have never lost in five playoff series against the Rockets.</p>
<p>Clyde Drexler scored 25 points and Charles Barkley 21 for the Rockets, who went scoreless for over five minutes of the second quarter and lost for the first time in five post-season games.</p>
<p>The Rockets were threatening to complete an unlikely comeback when Kemp took charge with just over two minutes to go. He followed on a miss and was fouled, completing the three-point play for a 96-90 edge with 2:15 remaining.</p>
<p>Drexler made a three-pointer, but Kemp made a runner in the lane for a 98-93 edge with 1:42 left. Houston missed two shots and Detlef Schrempf made two foul shots to seal it at 100-93 with 49 seconds to play.</p>
<p>Schrempf and Gary Payton scored 17 points apiece for the Sonics, who made 31-of-33 foul shots. Seattle was 43 percent (33-of-76) from the field.</p>
<p>Olajuwon had 19 points and 12 rebounds for Houston, which was 22-of-32 from the line. The Rockets shot 45.5 percent (35-of-77).</p>
