<p>Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen, declaring that the Bank must remain committed to its inflation control targets, said on Friday that past interest rate cuts should continue to support solid economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank must remain committed to its inflation-control targets,&quot; Thiessen said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>&quot;It is by maintaining Canada's low trend of inflation that monetary policy will contribute to the type of durable expansion that will deliver improved economic prospects for Canadians.&quot;  </p>
<p>There was no doubt that Canada's difficult economic transformation had acted as a drag on output and employment, &quot;but I believe we are now at the stage where the benefits from these necessary adjustments have begun to outweigh the difficulties,&quot; Thiessen said.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the lags involved, the substantial past easing of interest rates should continue to support robust growth in domestic spending for some time.</p>
<p>&quot;And with strong U.S. demand boosting our exports, the Bank feels there is good reason to expect a solid expansion in the period ahead.&quot;  </p>
<p>Thiessen said the decline in interest rates represented a substantial stimulus to domestic spending. Normally it takes 12 to 18 months for monetary policy actions to have an impact on the economy, he said.</p>
<p>But he said recent evidence, particularly from interest-sensitive sectors, were &quot;very encouraging.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The economic results for the second half of 1996 and the monthly data so far for 1997 confirm that there have been substantial increases in household spending on housing, motor vehicles, and consumer durables, just as expected. Businesses, too, continue to increase their capital spending,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>&quot;Some people wonder why the Bank is still bent on controlling inflation when it is so low and no longer seems to be a threat. With this continued focus on inflation, isn't there a risk that monetary policy will fail to provide the support necessary for incomes and employment to grow?&quot; he said. He responded that the Bank provided crucial stability.</p>
<p>&quot;When the Bank takes action to keep inflation inside the current target range of one to three percent, monetary policy operates as an important stabilizer for the economy, helping to maintain sustainable growth over time in output and employment,&quot; the governor said.  </p>
<p>He said the Bank would tighten monetary conditions when the economy was expanding at an unsustainable pace but also ease, &quot;as we said did from late 1995 to late 1996, when the economy is sluggish and it looks like the trend of inflation could fall below the target range.&quot;</p>
<p>Thiessen noted that while the inflation targets were introduced to help reduce a high inflation rate, &quot;I believe that they continue to be the best means to conduct monetary policy even now that inflation is low and the aim is to keep it low.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the reason the Canadian economy had not performed better with low inflation was due to the complexity and magnitude of the transformation that had been required.</p>
<p>This was due to the global challenge and the domestic challenge, the latter arising from the need to reverse imbalances of the 1970s and 1980s -- rising costs of production, speculation especially in real estate, large budget deficits and accumulating public indebtedness.</p>
<p>He repeated earlier remarks about the ability of the economy to grow without inflation though the less stimulus was needed in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;Because we still have a fairly wide margin of spare production capacity in our economy, there is ample room for strong growth in coming quarters, without a resurgence of inflation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;However, as slack in the economy is taken up, we will need less monetary stimulus to keep the economy on a sustainable, low-inflation growth path.</p>
