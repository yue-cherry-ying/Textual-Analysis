<p>A U.S. ethics panel on Saturday recommended legislation to ban the cloning of entire human beings but would still allow private cloning of human embryos for research.</p>
<p>The National Bioethics Advisory Commission said these cloned embryos should not be allowed to be implanted into women's wombs to make viable babies, a source familiar with the recommendations said.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton asked the advisory group in February to review the legal and ethical ramifications of cloning after scientists in Scotland cloned a lamb using a cell from an adult sheep.</p>
<p>The 18-member commission consisted of scientists, lawyers and theologians.</p>
<p>Clinton in March had already banned federal funding of human cloning work, broadening his 1994 prohibition of government-funded human embryo research.</p>
<p>The panel's proposal would extend that human cloning ban to include privately funded work but leaves in place the current policing allowing private embryo research.</p>
<p>A pharmaceutical industry group welcomed the recognition of the importance of genetic research but said any law against cloning complete human beings should be narrowly defined.</p>
<p>&quot;Any legislative prohibition on the cloning of entire human beings must not jeopardise biomedical research that involves the cloning of human genes, cells or tissues,&quot; the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said in a statement.</p>
<p>But Sen. Christopher Bond, a Missouri Republican, said the bioethics commission left the door wide open to future cloning.</p>
<p>&quot;I had hoped that the federal ethics commission would not be afraid to make a strong moral statement that human cloning is wrong, period and should be banned,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Bond, who has already introduced a bill that would completely ban human cloning, said it would be up to Congress and state legislatures to resolve the issue.</p>
