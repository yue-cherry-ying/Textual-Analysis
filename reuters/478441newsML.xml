<p>The ending of merger talks between British property groups Hammerson Plc and MEPC Plc is unlikely to lead to a hostile bid by Hammerson for its larger rival, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;They won't go hostile,&quot; a property analyst at one firm of British stockbrokers told Reuters, adding that a merger would have been &quot;like a turkey voting for Christmas&quot; for the management of one of the companies and was therefore a non-starter.</p>
<p>He said institutional investors, who according to newspaper reports had been pushing the firms to come to a merger agreement could only suggest such a course of action and could not force it upon them.</p>
<p>Newspaper reports had suggested that pension fund manager PDFM, which controls a stake of more than 17 percent in each company, had applied pressure for a merger of the two firms.</p>
<p>Earlier the firms confirmed newspaper reports over the weekend that they had held preliminary discussions about a possible merger but these had ended two weeks ago. Newspaper reports had said that MEPC was still open to a bid proposal from Hammerson.</p>
<p>If the 3.2 billion pound ($5.2 billion) merger went ahead, it would create Britain's second largest property company behind Land Securities Plc and be listed in the FTSE 100 index.</p>
<p>Last month Hammerson reported a 21.3 percent increase in pre-tax profit for 1996 to 70.0 million pounds from 57.7 million a year earlier. The group's gearing was only 58 percent and it has unused credit facilities of around 300 million pounds.</p>
<p>MEPC has also benefited from improving conditions in the property market. Last December it reported pretax profits of 140 million pounds compared with 122.6 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>However its net asset value (NAV) per share dropped to 450 pence from 457 pence at the end of the previous year due to the writedown on a Los Angeles shopping mall. The group is targeting a NAV of 690 pence per share for 2001.</p>
<p>Analysts said that a merger of the two would have created economies of scale, reduced management expenses and formed a large business in Canada. But some said there were perhaps too many synergies for a marriage of the two to work.</p>
<p>&quot;It may well be that there was too much synergy, possibly they don't have the complementarity,&quot; said Steve Mallen, head of research at property consultants Knight Frank.</p>
<p>He said a merger would have been a &quot;significant move&quot;, creating an important international player and boosting MEPC's share price. The group's shares were up nine pence at 486.5 pence at 1625 GMT. Hammerson's were down 1.5 pence at 431 pence at 1537 GMT.</p>
<p>Mallen said the rising property market was the right sort of environment for merger or takeover activity, with medium sized companies which had weathered the recession now possible targets.</p>
<p>Mergers in the property sector would always be made more difficult by the forces of personalities and cultural styles, but there would be an increase as firms moved to become more global players, with greater access to capital.</p>
<p>But the market upturn would also mean companies would be busy with their development plans and would not have time to work on merger or takeover plays. ($ = 0.609 British Pounds)</p>
