<headline>French court rejects far-right bid to shut theatre.</headline>
<dateline>TOULON, France 1997-04-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>A French court rejected on Thursday a demand by a far-right National Front mayor for the closure of a theatre and cultural complex in the southern port city of Toulon.</p>
<p>Several thousand artists and supporters had marched through Toulon in February to combat the municipality's drive to sack the Chateauvallon theatre's left-wing director Gerard Paquet and close his centre.</p>
<p>&quot;(The ruling) is a great victory. The next step is to reinstate Paquet in his post,&quot; Paquet's lawyer Jean Guy Levy told reporters. The public prosecutor had argued that there was insufficient ground to close the complex.</p>
<p>Chateauvallon became a symbol of opposition to the Front when city subsidies to the centre were stopped following the party's victory in municipal elections in 1995.</p>
<p>Paquet, after a series of clashes, was sacked in February for failure to get mayor Jean-Marie Le Chevallier's approval for printing the programme for 1997.</p>
<p>Lawyer Didier Gestat de Garambe, an aide to Le Chevallier, said that, if Paquet had not been dismissed, the centre would have been ordered shut down by the court.</p>
<p>The arts establishment has clashed repeatedly with the anti-immigration National Front in the party's four southern municipal bastions, denouncing censorship in libraries and at cultural events.</p>
<p>Culture Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy and writers protested in Toulon late last year against Le Chevallier's ban on a tribute to Jewish writer Marek Halter.</p>
