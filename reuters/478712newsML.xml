<p>He was an acrobat, then a mayor, briefly a judge and finally a hermit -- an inauspicious track record for someone considered by many to be among Latin America's greatest living artists.</p>
<p>Juan Felix Sanchez, now a wrinkled brown stone of a man, the suppleness of his acrobat years long gone, cheerfully dismisses such thoughts. Sitting in the open cobbled courtyard of his simple Andean home, he waves his hand at faded letters from Venezuelan presidents and museums displayed around him.</p>
<p>&quot;I built the churches and sculptures because they weren't there,&quot; he said simply, as if nothing could be more obvious than hand-fashioning a chapel and a clutch of delicate wooden statues on a solitary Venezuelan mountain moor.</p>
<p>Felix was born at the turn of the century, the sixth child of a mule-herder, and his hearing is now half gone -- along with his teeth -- and his handlebar moustache has turned a proud silver-gray. But age has only recently dimmed a late-flowering creative energy. He carved his first statue when he was 52 and, at an altitude that quickly brings breathlessness, built his first chapel when most men would be thinking about retirement.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything he touches becomes art, is magical,&quot; bubbled Anita Tapias, head of the research department at Venezuela's National Art Gallery in Caracas and curator of a small exhibition of Felix's hand-hewn wooden furniture, the latest in a series since he won Venezuela's National Art prize in 1988. &quot;He may be little known but he's absolutely one of the continent's most gifted artists.&quot;</p>
<p>Ill health recently brought Felix down from his mountain to San Rafael -- at 10,500 feet (3,200 metres) the highest village in Venezuela. But he appeared not to notice the change as he sat in a stained blue suit and battered felt hat, watching a horizon of slow-moving clouds pass over the second church he began building at San Rafael at the age of 81.</p>
<p>EMBODIMENT OF ANDEAN WAY OF LIFE</p>
<p>&quot;These mountains are a very beautiful place to me, I don't know about others,&quot; he said quietly as the hubbub of friends, family and chickens milled around him.</p>
<p>They say you do not judge a South American by his country but by his altitude, and Felix's beloved landscape reflects a mountain way of life that recognisably stretches thousands of miles (kilometers) south with the Andes all the way to Chile. Rising above 8,250 feet (2,500 metres), the lush green vegetation of the American tropics gives way to parched dun-grays and stunted shrubs, the air thins and the lowlands' rich sunshine cools to a dry, stark light.</p>
<p>Felix's church at San Rafael lies in a kink in the road, its austere granite walls and terra-cotta-tiled roof glowing strangely in the low afternoon sun. Inside, layers of different coloured stone rise like a cake, with rudely carved wooden chairs pushed against the walls. Around the rock altar, picked out with white pebbles, stand naif wooden statues -- including one of the sober-suited 19th century Venezuelan doctor, Jose Gregorio Hernandez, who cured the poor for free.</p>
<p>Offerings of wild flowers lie in niches. Thumb-sized prayer candles burn in a blackened rack. The light is yellow, soft. A nativity scene lies on the stone-slabed floor.</p>
<p>&quot;I just built the church; others made it beautiful, decorated it,&quot; he said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Up steep mule paths to the even higher altitudes where Felix built his first chapel, the mountains rise in waves, the sun frets their peaks, the peaks pile on top of each other, and the wind howls across the barren landscape.</p>
<p>WHERE BOLIVAR RODE</p>
<p>Simon Bolivar, the great Venezuelan-born hero of South American independence -- respectfully nicknamed &quot;culo de hierro&quot; or &quot;iron ass&quot; by his soldiers for his stamina in the saddle -- frequently rode these passes at the start of the 19th century as he fought the Spaniards.</p>
<p>But history has since drawn its cloak around the region.</p>
<p>The mobile phones and sweaty commercial bustle of Caracas are hundreds of miles (kilometers) northeast on the Caribbean coast, a world away. And only a steady tourist trade in the nearby mountain university town, Merida, which boasts the world's highest cablecar as well as the ice cream parlour with the most flavors, spins off the occasional visitor even to San Rafael.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, I've been to Caracas a few times,&quot; Felix said, his smiling blue eyes still bright behind cataracts. &quot;And most boring it was too, although the only thing people talk about here is potatoes!&quot;</p>
<p>When he won Venezuela's National Sculpture Prize in 1988, the award drew outrage from the capital's artistic salons where the more polished lines of high conceptual art reigned. &quot;They considered him too folkloric, they didn't think he was a real artist,&quot; Tapias said.</p>
<p>Several documentaries and books followed. Yet few ever see his work where he made it. Their austere exteriors, melding Andean desolation with Christian mysticism, bely the intimacy inside.</p>
<p>&quot;This is blessed,&quot; a rare visitor said, standing in weak sunshine as dust motes sparkled in the pewless chapel's aisle.</p>
