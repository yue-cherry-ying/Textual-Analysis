<p>Irish bonds experienced mixed fortunes in late trade on Thursday with good domestic interest pushing up shorter-dated paper but longer-dated stock eased slightly, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said trade was relatively robust considering most of continental Europe was closed to mark Ascension Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is not as quiet as it would normally be with most of the European continent closed. There has been a reasonable amount of business. Money market rates seem fairly stable while the short-end of the market is back en vogue,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market interest has been mostly domestic given the fact that most of the European continent is out. The tone of the market is more confident than I might have expected coming in to work today,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>By 1435 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was up 15 pence from Wednesday's close at 101.70 to yield 6.04 percent while the key benchmark eight percent bond due 2006 was down five pence from the close at 108.77 to yield 6.70 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said Irish bonds were trading at 156 basis points over Germany in the five-year area and at 92 basis points over German bunds in the 10-year area.</p>
<p>Market focus is likely to be divided between the UK, where the new Labour government was settling into power, and Ireland, where a question mark remained over the future direction of the Irish pound, for the remainder of the week, dealers said.</p>
