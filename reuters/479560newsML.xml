<p>President Bill Clinton asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Tuesday to study curbing television liquor ads following the industry's decision to abandon its nearly half-century-old voluntary ban.</p>
<p>&quot;Liquor has no business with kids, and kids should have no business with liquor. Liquor ads on television would provide a message of encouragement to drink that young people simply don't need. Nothing good can come of it,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>Clinton, who had criticised the industry's decision last year to end the voluntary ban in effect for television ads since 1948 and radio ads since 1936, told reporters at a White House ceremony that he hoped the industry would rethink its position.</p>
<p>&quot;My message to the liquor industry is simple,&quot; he said. &quot;For 50 years you have kept the ban. It was the responsible thing to do. For the sake of our parents and our young people, please continue to keep that ban.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;Barring that, we will work to find ways to respond to the decison ... we will do what we must do to support our parents, to help them do their job.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton's remarks, made in the White House Roosevelt Room, fit squarely with the family-oriented themes of his successful 1996 presidential campaign. They also reflected his increasing use of the White House as a bully pulpit on social issues in the tradition of former President Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>The distilled spirits industry has complained that there is no ban on beer and wine television advertising, but Clinton dismissed this as a rationale for liquor advertising, saying there should be no expansion of promoting the use of alcohol.</p>
<p>&quot;At a minimum, there should be no backsliding,&quot; he said. &quot;There is something to be said for not making matters worse.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to his public remarks, Clinton also made his case in a letter to FCC Chairman Reed Hundt which the White House released.</p>
<p>Without specifying precisely what he wanted the FCC to do, Clinton urged the independent federal agency which regulates the broadcast industry look into what effect the ban's ending may have and then to study &quot;appropriate actions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I urge the Commission to take all appropriate actions to explore what effects might ensue in light of the decision by manufacturers of hard liquor to abandon their long-standing voluntary ban on television advertising, specifically the impact on under-age drinking,&quot; Clinton wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;I would appreciate your help and (that) of the Commission in exploring the possible actions you could take to support our parents and children in response to the manufacturers' decision to break with the long and honourable tradition of not advertising on the broadcast medium,&quot; he said.</p>
