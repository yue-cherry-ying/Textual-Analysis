<p>Manchester United tightened their grip on the English premier league crown and effectively ended Liverpool's title challenge with a 3-1 win over their bitter rivals at Anfield on Saturday.</p>
<p>The victory took United to 69 points with four matches to play, left Liverpool on 64 points with three matches to play and realistically means Arsenal, on 63 points and four games to go, are the only team who can still take the tite off United.</p>
<p>All four goals came from headers, Gary Pallister and Andy Cole scoring for United and John Barnes for Liverpool.</p>
<p>Pallister opened the scoring when the Liverpool defence left him unmarked at a 13th minute corner and he headed home powerfully past Liverpool out-of-form goalkeeper David James.</p>
<p>Barnes equalised for Liverpool six minutes later from a corner at the other end, before Pallister restored United's lead with another header from a corner three minutes before halftime.</p>
<p>Cole took advantage of a mistake by James after 63 minutes to wrap up the points for United, who now seem set to win the title for the fourth time in five years.</p>
