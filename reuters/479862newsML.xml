<p>The Turkish treasury sharply increased the sale amount in its second inflation indexed, two-year bond auction, further fuelling cash demand on Tuesday, bankers said.</p>
<p>They said liquidity demand was already firm due to continuing income tax payments, bankers said.</p>
<p>The Treasury sold 109.8 trillion lira of the bonds at a risk premium of 24 percent, compared to 18.6 trillion lira sale and 25 percent risk premium at the first inflation-indexed bond sale on March 4.</p>
<p>Bankers said the sale amount was above the market's previous expectations and the central bank began funding the banks immediately after the results were announced.</p>
<p>Banks will pay 108.7 trillion lira for the auction on Wednesday when they will collect 68.1 trillion lira from the central bank for maturing reverse repos.</p>
<p>It lent 3.6 trillion lira at 72 percent overnight, 21.8 trillion lira at 67 percent on tmrw/next and 16 trillion lira at 68 percent via tmrw/week.</p>
<p>The average overnight money rate eased to 70.23 percent from Monday's 71.79 percent because the rates dipped to a low of 60 percent earlier in the day due to funding by the central bank and a state bank on the overnight repo market, bankers said.</p>
<p>The average overnight repo rate leapt to 74.28 percent from Monday's 71.82.</p>
<p>Bond yields eased by around a percentage point due to demand in outstanding papers before and after the auction.</p>
<p>Turkish lira slightly firmed to 127,630 against the dollar from Monday's 127,650 close as the dollar eased versus the mark.</p>
