<p>Russia may borrow, cut spending, sell state property and sell securities to pay huge wage arrears to those on the state payroll, President Boris Yeltsin was quoted as saying on Tuesday by Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>&quot;We must determine ways to find finances...how we can cut spending and increase revenues, where to use borrowing, the sale of property and securities,&quot; Yeltsin told top government officials at his holiday retreat in northwestern Russia. He gave no further details but said a decree would be signed later on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;When we unite efforts of the federal authorities, both presidential and govermental, as well as banks and local authorities then we can cope with any problem,&quot; Yeltsin was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Yeltsin was meeting First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov and other top government members who had brought him proposals on how to meet his earlier demand to pay back all wage arrears. Last week he gave the cabinet three months to solve the problem.</p>
<p>But both Nemtsov and fellow First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais appear to think the deadline is too tight. Nemtsov was quoted as saying on Monday it might take up to six months to pay back all the debts.</p>
<p>Interfax said Yeltsin, Nemtsov and the ministers would hold a session open for selected media later on Tuesday during which they would make public a concrete plan of action.</p>
