<p>U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross appeared to be making little progress in his latest mission to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot tell you that I am optimistic,&quot; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters.</p>
<p>Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down two months ago after Netanyahu gave the final go-ahead for building 6,500 houses for Jews in Arab East Jerusalem on land claimed by both sides.</p>
<p>Ross, on his second mission in a month, met Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in Gaza and Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Thursday.</p>
<p>Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told Israel Radio that Ross brought no new ideas.</p>
<p>A terse statement from Netanyahu's office said only that Ross had reported on his meeting with Arafat and &quot;would continue to move between the sides in order to continue the process of clarifying positions.&quot;</p>
<p>Ross was due to meet Arafat again on Friday and then go to Cairo, ending his current round of talks ahead of Israel's memorial and independence day commemorations on Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p>A Moslem militant blew up a Tel Aviv cafe in March, killing himself and three Israeli women, and Israel says Arafat must crack down on &quot;terror&quot; before resuming talks, a move which Netanyahu said &quot;would help the peace process.&quot;</p>
<p>Arafat spokesman Marwan Kanafani said the Palestinian leader stressed to Ross the need to stop all settlement activity before peace talks could resume, but Netanyahu's aide David Bar-Illan said the building work would continue.</p>
<p>Erekat said Arafat had given Ross documents on Israeli settlement activities on land captured in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>&quot;We told Ross: Examine this report. You will find that Netanyahu is negotiating through the bulldozers,&quot; Erekat told the radio.</p>
<p>Asked on Israel Television if a resumption of peace talks was in the offing, Netanyahu's cabinet secretary, Danny Naveh, said: &quot;I am sorry to say I still cannot say that is so.&quot;</p>
<p>Israel appeared to lend little weight to a meeting which Bar-Illan said its Shin Bet domestic security chief would hold with his Palestinian counterparts on Friday, with U.S. officials sitting in.</p>
<p>&quot;There were meetings like this one in the past. What is needed here, as agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority dictate, is continuous contact between Israeli and Palestinian security people,&quot; Naveh said.</p>
<p>Israel has demanded a resumption of full security cooperation suspended by the Palestinian Authority, which is in charge of self-ruled parts of the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p>Jewish settlers said shots were fired late on Thursday at an Israeli vehicle carrying 11 Jewish female students on the road between Jerusalem and the West Bank town of Hebron. The army said bullets hit the van but no one was hurt.</p>
<p>In a move that angered the Palestinians, Jewish settlers took up residence in a house on Jerusalem's Mount of Olives. An Armenian cleric sold the villa, on Israeli-annexed land, to an American Jew who leased it to the settlers.</p>
