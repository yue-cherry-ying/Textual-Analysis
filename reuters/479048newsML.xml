<headline>Israeli consumer spending, factory output rise.</headline>
<text>
<p>JERUSALEM, April 1 (Rueter) - Early indicators for January-February showed a general positive picture, as consumer spending and industrial output rose, the Central Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The bureau said industrial production rose in January at an annualised rate of four percent after annualised increases of three percent in December and two percent a month in May-November 1996.</p>
<p>Imports of production inputs, not including fuel, rose in February at an annual rate of four percent after remaining almost unchanged in January and big declines since March 1996.</p>
<p>Consumer spending was also a bright spot. Retail sales turned around, rising at a two percent rate in January after no change in the preceding two months, the bureau said. In July-October 1996, retail sales had fallen at a two percent annual pace.</p>
<p>Imports of consumer durables rose in February by one percent in annual terms following an annualised six percent drop in January and 14-20 percent annualised decline September-December, the bureau said.</p>
<p>However, the number of tourists arriving by air dropped in the first two months of 1997 at an annualised rate of three percent. The downturn followed annualised declines of four to five percent between September and December.</p>
<p>In addition, growth in industrial exports, excluding diamonds, slowed to a five percent pace in February, after rising at a six percent rate in January and nine to 11 percent in July-December, the bureau said.</p>
