<p>The owners of more than two million trucks pulled their vehicles off India's roads on Tuesday in protest over a proposed service tax and higher insurance premiums, transport officials said.</p>
<p>Booking and delivery at nearly 60,000 transport companies across the country came to a standstill, S.P. Singh, a spokesman for All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;According to our reports the strike was total. It was peaceful,&quot; Singh said. The nationwide strike started at midnight on March 31, he said.</p>
<p>The congress represents owners of about two million heavy trucks, one million light- and medium-weight trucks and some 60,000 booking and delivery companies.</p>
<p>&quot;About 2.2 million trucks have gone on strike,&quot; Singh said, adding that talks on Tuesday afternoon between Finance Ministry officials and the AIMTC had failed to break the deadlock.</p>
<p>The AIMTC objected to a five percent service tax on road transport which Finance Minister P. Chidambaram proposed in the federal budget for the 1997/98 (April-March) financial year.</p>
<p>It also denounced a decision by state-owned insurance companies which the transport congress said would raise insurance premiums by 300 to 400 percent.</p>
<p>The government says the tax proposal would be discussed by parliament before it is made effective.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has also said it will hold further discussions on the issue,&quot; a government official told Reuters. &quot;The government has said the tariff advisory committee will hold discussions on premiums.&quot;</p>
<p>India was waiting for a response from the truck owners, the official added.</p>
<p>&quot;We have called a meeting of the our national action committee tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. (0530 GMT) to discuss government proposals,&quot; Singh said. AIMTC representatives will meet government officials after Wednesday's meeting, he said.</p>
<p>The AIMTC had two rounds of talks with government officials on Monday which ended inconclusively.</p>
<p>Industry officials said the truckers, who move 60 percent of India's goods, should have postponed their strike.</p>
<p>&quot;The strike should be deferred. Even if the truckers have some grievances it should be addressed when there is a stable government,&quot; said a spokesman for Punjab, Haryana, Delhi Chambers of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's 10-month-old minority government is facing a political crisis after its key ally, the Congress party, withdrew its support on Sunday. Deve Gowda must face a parliamentary confidence vote by April 11.</p>
<p>Deliveries of aviation fuel to airports could also be affected by the national truck strike, another AIMTC official said. He said dock workers at Nava Shiva, the port for Bombay, would refuse to load or unload ships.</p>
