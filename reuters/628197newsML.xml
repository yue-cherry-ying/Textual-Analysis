<title>HONG KONG: One leader, two birthdays for Hong Kong's Tung.</title>
<headline>One leader, two birthdays for Hong Kong's Tung.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>His staff carefully planned a surprise 60th birthday celebration for Hong Kong's future leader -- but the surprise turned out to be on them.</p>
<p>Tung Chee-hwa, who takes the helm when Hong Kong reverts to China on July 1, revealed that differences between the Chinese lunar calendar and the Western calendar meant he had a further 39 days to go before he turned 60.</p>
<p>When Shanghai-born Tung arrived in Hong Kong, his birthday that year fell on May 29 -- and that is the date recorded on his identity documents.</p>
<p>His &quot;real&quot; birthday falls on July 7.</p>
<p>But that did not stop him blowing out the candles and sharing around the cake he was presented with on Thursday with his staff and wife Betty, who dropped into his office accompanied by several grandchildren.</p>
<p>Tung, whose name means &quot;build China&quot;, will suceed departing colonial governor Chris Patten to lead Hong Kong as a mainly autonomous region of China under Beijing's &quot;one country, two systems&quot; political concept.</p>
