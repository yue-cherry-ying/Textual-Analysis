<p>The United States and the European Union appeared to be headed for a full-fledged trade fight over meat imports as an April 1 deadline loomed without any settlement in sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Never say never, but I'm not optimistic,&quot; said a senior U.S. Agriculture Department official Monday when asked if the two sides were likely to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;I've not heard anything optimistic from the negotiators,&quot; said an EU spokesperson.</p>
<p>An unsuccessful resolution of the dispute could mean the disruption of the trans-Atlantic trade of hundreds of millions of dollars of meat, poultry, dairy and pet food products, with the European pork sector and the U.S. poultry industry feeling the brunt of the impact.</p>
<p>Administration sources said there could be an announcement as early as Tuesday on what actions Washington would take if there were no agreement.</p>
<p>The U.S. meat and poultry industry appeared to be bracing themselves for the worst.</p>
<p>Industry officials said that unless U.S. and EU officials come up with a deal within the next 24 hours, the EU will implement new inspection standards that will effectively stop some $50 million worth of imports of U.S. poultry.</p>
<p>Washington could respond by adopting new procedures that would in turn cut off shipments of EU meat, mostly $300 million worth of pork, to the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. and EU negotiators met all last week trying to resolve differences over meat import inspection rules ahead of the April 1 deadline to avoid any trade disruption.</p>
<p>The so-called veterinary equivalency issue has been a bitter source of dispute between the two sides for years. An agreement would allow each side to accept meat and poultry products from the other even if the inspection methods differed.</p>
<p>U.S. officials and industry representatives have maintained that the United States recognises equivalent practices by European packing and processing plants and allows EU meat imports into America. But they say that Europe has been insisting that U.S. plants follow exactly the same procedures as Europeans.</p>
<p>The U.S. industry has urged the administration to take tough action.</p>
<p>&quot;Any legitimate means that would get the EU's attention on equivalency, and perhaps let them understand on a first hand basis what equivalency is, would be a prudent step,&quot; said Bill Roenigk of the National Broiler Council.</p>
<p>Whether a cut-off of U.S. imports of EU pork imports -- most of which comes from Denmark -- will persuade Europe to accept Washington's position is unclear, but a U.S. meat industry official said it will at least get Brussels' attention and may lead to an eventual settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation will probably get a little ugly, but with the European Cpmmunity, you can't get anywhere unless you take them right up to the brink,&quot; said the U.S. industry source.</p>
