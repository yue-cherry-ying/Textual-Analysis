<p>A bomb exploded on Thursday at a small town gathering in Poland of veterans marking the anniversary of the end of World War Two, killing a 72-year-old man and wounding several people, police said.</p>
<p>The device went off under a table at which 50 ex-combatants were seated in the southwestern town of Rudna Gwizdanow. The blast killed the man nearest to it and badly mutilated his body, a police duty officer in nearby Legnica told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;One person is badly wounded and others injured to various degrees...three may have to be hospitalised,&quot; said the officer, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>He said it was possible the dead man may have planted the device himself, adding: &quot;There is no information on what may have been the motive for this act.&quot;</p>
