<title>USA: Two-thirds favor death penalty for McVeigh.</title>
<headline>Two-thirds favor death penalty for McVeigh.</headline>

<p>As attorneys for Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh prepared more testimony aimed at avoiding his execution, a new poll showed on Saturday that two-thirds of Americans think he should be put to death.</p>
<p>Defence attorney Richard Burr asked the same jury that last week convicted McVeigh for the April 19, 1995, bombing to put aside their emotions after days of tearful stories from bombing survivors and spare the life of the former solider.</p>
<p>Burr said he would present testimony from about 20 more character witnesses, including McVeigh's former teachers, Army buddies, co-workers, bosses and his father William. The testimony is expected to end some time next week.</p>
<p>The Newsweek poll said 67 percent favour the death penalty for McVeigh and even among those who say they are opposed to the death penalty, 32 percent said McVeigh should die. The survey was taken on Thursday and Friday and had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.</p>
<p>It also showed that 56 percent believe that those who kill for ideological reason should be put to death. Defence attorneys say McVeigh set the bomb because he thought the government was at war with the American people.</p>
<p>Veigh was convicted on Monday of murder and conspiracy charges in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people.</p>
<p>As he has throughout his trial, McVeigh showed little emotion but appeared touched when a former neighbour, one of the first defence witnesses, burst into tears as he testified. The seven men and five women on the jury watched intently.</p>
<p>The prosecution ended its part of the penalty phase of the trial on Friday morning after testimony from 38 bombing survivors, rescuers and those who lost loved ones.</p>
<p>Burr tried to paint a different picture of McVeigh: &quot;There's also a person at the centre who you will not be able to dismiss as a monster or a demon, but who could be your son, your brother, your grandson.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We believe ... you will come to the conclusion that the right response is a life sentence,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said McVeigh was enraged by the government's 1993 attack at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, where some 80 people died. Waco became a rallying cry for right-wing extremists who felt federal agents provoked the tragedy and the U.S. government violated the Branch Davidians' rights.</p>
<p>Reading Soldier of Fortune magazine and watching amateur videos about Waco, McVeigh came to believe &quot;the government had declared war on the American people.&quot;</p>
<p>Through next week's witnesses, Burr will also try to build a portrait of McVeigh, who he said was a serious-minded student who was socially awkward.</p>
<p>Judge Richard Matsch ordered the jury back at 9 a.m. on Monday.</p>
