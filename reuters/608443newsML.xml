<headline>SOCCER-ZIDANE COMES COMPLETE WITH PLATINI SEAL OF APPROVAL.</headline>

<p>Last spring, former France and Juventus star Michel Platini put his reputation on the line for the club's current French idol, Zinedine Zidane.</p>
<p>It took just one telephone call from Platini, now co-president of France 98 World Cup Organising Committee, to persuade Juve to buy Franco-Algerian Zidane from Bordeaux.</p>
<p>Twelve months later, Platini's high opinion of the 24-year-old midfielder appears more than vindicated by his first season in Italy.</p>
<p>The last year has seen him evolve into a key element in the Juventus side which last weekend all but wrapped up its 24th league title and which next Wednesday faces Germans Borussia Dortmund in the Champions Cup final in Munich.</p>
<p>With his creative attacking play just behind the two front men and in a midfield where he is ably covered by French compatriot Didier Deschamps, Zidane has proved so effective that Juventus have been able to make light of the injury-enforced absence of Alessandro Del Piero.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Zidane has scored five Serie A goals as well as getting on the scoresheet against Rosenborg and Ajax in the Champions League.</p>
<p>Born in Marseille to parents of Algerian origin, Zidane made his professional debut with Cannes in 1988.</p>
<p>After three seasons with Cannes and four with Bordeaux, it was only last year that he attracted the attention of European soccer's elite with some sparkling performances for Bordeaux in their run to the UEFA Cup final which they lost to Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>Both Barcelona and Juventus were keen to sign him but in the end Zidane opted for Italy.</p>
<p>After a recent spectacular Zidane goal had set Juventus on their way to an important 4-1 league win against Piacenza, compatriot Platini was quick to re-affirm his high opinion of Zidane.</p>
<p>He told the Turin-based sports daily, &quot;Tuttosport&quot;: &quot;It's the end of the world if a player like Zizou (Zidane) starts scoring goals.</p>
<p>&quot;I've always had a very high opinion of him... and without imagining that he could become a regular goalscorer.</p>
<p>&quot;Seriously, though, he could become a real problem for me because if he follows my path at Juventus, the fans will forget all about me&quot;.</p>
<p>In five seasons at Juventus between 1982 and 1987, Platini not only helped the club win two league titles, one Champions Cup and one Cup Winners' Cup but he was also the leading goalscorer in Serie A on three occasions.</p>
<p>Zidane has some way to go before matching that record but he is just about to pick up a league title and can add another trophy on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But Zidane is modest about comparisons with his illustrious predecessor.</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot imagine what certain comparisons mean for me, to hear people say that I scored a goal just like Platini would have done, and changed the course of a game...&quot;</p>
<p>One very obvious comparison with Platini, however, is well worth highlighting.</p>
<p>Like Platini, Zidane's initial impact with Italian soccer was not easy.</p>
<p>Platini arrived in 1982 playing for a Juventus side which contained six members of Italy's World Cup winning team, none of whom were much pleased by the high level of pay and publicity afforded to the Frenchman.</p>
<p>It took Platini six months to establish himself both in the Juventus dressing room and on the playing field.</p>
<p>Zidane, too, had his initial difficulties settling into a re-shaped Juventus where he was essentially replacing Portuguese midfielder Paulo Sousa while playing behind newly arrived strikers, Croat Alen Boksic, Christian Vieri and Nicola Amoruso.</p>
<p>Zidane also came on the scene after a disappointing Euro 96 tournament. Although France got to the semifinals, Zidane played below his best.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year, I worked overtime with Bordeaux and in the end you saw yourselves what bad shape I was in by the Euro finals&quot;, he said last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Just at the moment, I'm tired again, above all mentally because this has been an especially stressful season and I cannot wait to go on holidays in Bordeaux.&quot;</p>
<p>Before that, however, he has a Munich appointment to fulfil.</p>
