<title>TANZANIA: Mobutu-Kabila meeting scheduled for Wednesday.</title>
<headline>Mobutu-Kabila meeting scheduled for Wednesday.</headline>
<dateline>DAR ES SALAAM 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>South Africa's deputy president said on Thursday a new meeting between Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila was scheduled for next Wednesday.</p>
<p>Deputy President Thabo Mbeki told reporters at Dar es Salaam airport before leaving for Rwanda: &quot;We are going to prepare the next meeting scheduled for Wednesday.&quot; He said the venue was unclear because of Mobutu's health.</p>
<p>He gave no details of the plans for the talks. Mobutu was at a mini-summit in Gabon on Thursday after his departure from Kinshasa on Wednesday triggered suggestions he would never go back.</p>
<p>Zaire's government said Mobutu would return to his capital. Kabila's rebels were reported by residents to hold Kenge, 250 km (150 miles) by road east of the capital, after heavy fighting.</p>
<p>Mbeki said the purpose of his six-nation African tour was to brief leaders on the results of the first face-to-face meeting between Mobutu and Kabila on a South African ship off Congo on Sunday.</p>
<p>It was agreed then that South African President Nelson Mandela would convene another meeting in eight to 10 days.</p>
<p>Asked about reports of foreign involvement in fighting east of Kinshasa, Mbeki said he was not aware of it but if the question featured in negotiations it could complicate the talks.</p>
<p>Tanzania's President Benjamin Mkapa earlier on Thursday told Mbeki both sides in Zaire should compromise to ensure a smooth transition of power and called for African support for a South African peace initiative.</p>
<p>&quot;The president pointed out that though a change of government seemed certain in Zaire it was all the same necessary for a compromise solution to be reached by the warring parties to ensure a smooth transition,&quot; Mkapa's spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Zaire is an expansive territory with a big population...If it was left involved in turmoil the big spillover effects are certain to cause untold suffering in neighbouring countries,&quot; Mkapa said.</p>
<p>Mbeki discussed the problem with Mkapa and Julius Nyerere, Africa's elder statesman and a former Tanzanian president.</p>
<p>Mbeki saw Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos on Wednesday in Luanda and said he still believed that a second meeting between Mobutu and Kabila would take place next week.</p>
<p>He said he believed Mobutu would return to Kinshasa after attending Thursday's mini-summit in Gabon's capital, Libreville.</p>
<p>He said he spoke to Kabila on Tuesday night and reminded him of his promise to halt his forces from advancing on Kinshasa.</p>
<p>&quot;I spoke to him last night. He told me that he had ordered his men to stop advancing on all fronts and gave me his assurance that they were not moving forward,&quot; Mbeki said.</p>
<p>Mediators including the United Nations, the United States and South Africa are trying to prevent further bloodshed in Zaire's civil war and arrange a peaceful transition of power.</p>
<p>After a stop in Pretoria, Mbeki is due to meet Kabila in Lubumbashi, Zaire, and travel on to Kinshasa for talks with Mobutu on Friday before going to Brazzaville, Congo, and Gabon.</p>
