<p>Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh sought spiritual help for himself, his government and the nation's troubled economy at a religious ceremony on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The premier and his wife Phankrua were among hundreds of believers dressed in black who participated in a ceremony to bid farewell to the bad side of Rahu, the god of darkness, at a Buddhist temple in Bangkok, local media reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Thai fortune tellers and superstitious locals believe that the powerful god Rahu carries with him bad luck for 18 months and then switches to good luck for the next 18 months.</p>
<p>Wednesday's ceremony was to bid farewell to the bad side.</p>
<p>&quot;After performing the rites the Prime Minister received the power from Rahu which will make him stronger, more decisive and determined,&quot; Attaviroj Sritula, one of the most popular fortune tellers in Thailand, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The power that prime minister gained from Rahu will have an impact on his performance and the country's economy will improve. His power will save the country,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Chavalit and his wife are strong believers in the supernatural. This week they moved from his old residence to a new rented home after fortunetellers advised him to do so to avert bad luck</p>
<p>But his wife said the move was because the house had too many leaks and needed renovation.</p>
