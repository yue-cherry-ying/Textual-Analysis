<p>Future legislators on Saturday defied an imminent legal challenge and passed a string of laws for Hong Kong which will come into effect after the territory reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>The 60-member provisional legislature met in Shenzhen, just across the border in China, where it was presented with a series of bills by officials of the future administration led by Hong Kong's chief executive-designate Tung Chee-hwa.</p>
<p>A crucial bill governing residency rights in Hong Kong after Britain hands it back to China on July 1 passed through two readings, Hong Kong's Wharf Cable TV station reported.</p>
<p>Three bills governing the membership of municipal bodies after the handover passed through all three readings, it said.</p>
<p>Under rules laid down earlier by the future chamber, proposed bills must go through three readings before July 1.</p>
<p>They will then be ratified as post-handover Hong Kong laws on July 1.</p>
<p>The provisional legislature was formed under Beijing's auspices in December and is poised to replace the current elected chamber, which China will disband, on July 1.</p>
<p>Its meeting in Shenzhen, however, follows a warning by the Democratic Party that it would file a lawsuit against the shadow chamber within the next few days claiming it was illegal to have two legislatures operating at the same time.</p>
<p>The imminent lawsuit has been facilitated by an earlier ruling by Hong Kong's Supreme Court allowing the Democrats to use government funds to fight laws passed by the shadow chamber.</p>
<p>But in Shenzhen, members of the provisional legislature scoffed at the imminent legal battle and claimed the future lawmaking chamber had strong legal basis.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm only sad that Hong Kong must spend so much money over something when the outcome, everyone knows, is a foregone conclusion,&quot; said provisional legislator Tam Yiu-chung.</p>
<p>The president of the shadow body, Rita Fan, also waved it off.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the threatened lawsuit) won't affect the work of the provisional legislature...It doesn't bother me at all. I'm confident we will prevail in the end,&quot; Fan told reporters.</p>
<p>The provisional chamber holds meetings, however, in Shenzhen, instead of Hong Kong, to fend off potential legal attacks.</p>
<p>The bill on residency rights, which was unveiled by future leader Tung on Friday, will tighten rules on immigrants getting permanent residency after July 1, local television stations reported.</p>
<p>It proposes that illegal immigrants, after residing in the territory for seven years, need permission from the immigration chief to receive permanent right of abode.</p>
<p>Under the current system, they are automatically granted permanent residency after seven years.</p>
<p>Critics on Saturday lambasted the bill as a way of keeping out Chinese dissidents, but a senior Tung aide dismissed the charge.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone, if they enter Hong Kong illegally, cannot get permanent residency in Hong Kong. This does not mean we are targeting any group of people,&quot; Elsie Leung, the future Justice Secretary told reporters.</p>
<p>Provisional legislator Henry Tang agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be part of China, in the event that there is any advocacy of splitting with the motherland, or other such activities, we must have laws (against them),&quot; Tang said.</p>
