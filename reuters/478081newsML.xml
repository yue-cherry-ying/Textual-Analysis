<headline>KKR forms firm with former American Re executive.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co said it and former American Reinsurance Co chief financial officer James Fisher have formed a new entity to help KKR identify investment opportunities in the insurance industry.</p>
<p>KKR will provide some financial backing for the company, Fisher Capital Corp, which will be based in Princeton, N.J. Fisher will have the opportunity to participate in KKR's investments.</p>
<p>KKR's investment in the firm was not disclosed.  </p>
<p>Since the early 1990s, KKR said it has viewed the insurance industry as an attractive area for investment and said it continues to see it as an area of great potential.</p>
<p>KKR has so far made two successful investments in insurance -- Canadian General Insurance, which KKR bought in 1995 and still owns, and American Re, which KKR sold to Munich Re in August 1996.</p>
<p>One month later, KKR called off a $2.7 billion agreement to buy the Talegen insurance business from Xerox Corp.  </p>
<p>Shortly after that, KKR general partner Saul Fox left the firm, where although he was a generalist, he had been actively involved in the insurance deals.</p>
<p>Fisher now will provide KKR with specialized knowledge of the insurance industry, where he has about 17 years of experience, said a spokeswoman for Kekst, KKR's outside public relations firm.</p>
<p>&quot;The insurance industry presents many investment opportunities for firms prepared to work through its financial and regulatory complexities, and this is particularly true during this time of rapid change and consolidation,&quot; Fisher said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;KKR possesses the creativity, capital and long-term view that is needed in the sector and I look forward to helping KKR continue to pursue their interest in the insurance field,&quot; Fisher said.</p>
