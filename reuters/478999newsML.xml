<p>The Indonesian rupiah was little changed against the dollar in thin turnover on the first trading day of the new fiscal year, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is not much going on. People seem to have no mood to trade after the long weekend,&quot; one local bank dealer said.</p>
<p>The market reopened on Tuesday after a four-day break.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was hovering in a narrow range and was quoted at 2,400.00/00.50 at 0900 GMT, compared with an opening of 2,400.50/01.50.</p>
<p>Dealers said liquidity was ample, with overnight money falling to seven percent in the afternoon from 14.0 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;But overall sentiment seems to remain firm on the rupiah,&quot; the local bank dealer said, adding that swap rates were stable.</p>
<p>Tom/next swaps were at par/0.15 and overnight at -0.1/0.1.</p>
<p>Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,399.5/99.8 and 2,400.0/00.5, respectively. Dealers said the focus was on the new reserve rate which will be effective starting April 16.</p>
<p>One-month swaps were at 10.00/10.50, two at 21.50/22.50, three at 32.5/33.0 and six at 67.0/67.5 points.</p>
<p>Bank Indonesia raised its intervention band by one point to 2,395/2,587 and the conversion band to 2,395/2,443 on Tuesday.</p>
