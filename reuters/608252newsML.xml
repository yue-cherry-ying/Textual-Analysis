<p>General Motors Corp. Chairman Jack Smith urged shareholders Friday to consider the world's largest automaker as a growth company, but offered few comments about labor strife that continues to hurt profits.</p>
<p>In remarks to a record low 99 shareholders at the ornate Hotel du Pont, Smith drew laughs when he said the giant company plans to have &quot;abs,&quot; another term for the rippling abdominal muscles that have been popularized by exercise videos.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't seen my abs in years,&quot; Smith said. &quot;But I can tell you this -- GM is going to have abs. We are going to get lean and we are going to run fast.&quot;</p>
<p>Smith said the automaker expects its core North American Operations to continue to show the kind of progress it had in the first quarter, when it reported net income of $764 million, the best in 10 years.</p>
<p>He cited the 14 new models being introduced in North America, capacity expansion overseas, rising components sales to external customers and good prospects for Hughes Electronics Corp.'s space and telecommunications businesses as signs of GM's future growth potential.</p>
<p>Smith said he wishes the company could have avoided strikes last year that cost it $1.2 billion in profits, as well as work stoppages this year that have hurt earnings another $225 million.</p>
<p>But he repeated GM's long-standing position that it cannot give in to United Auto Workers union demands for more jobs because that hurts GM's long-term competitiveness.</p>
<p>That did not sit well with one long-time Delaware shareholder. Milton Gaul suggested GM look into why it has such poor labor relations compared with other members of Detrot's Big Three. &quot;There's some disease here,&quot; Gaul said.</p>
<p>The 99 shareholders who attended the meeting was the lowest since the company began keeping count in 1948. In what has become a GM tradition of tight control, the company restricted reporters to the back of the room and limited speakers to a total of 10 minutes. Large digital clocks displayed each speaker's elapsed speaking time in bright red numbers, and flashed &quot;DONE&quot; when they ran out.</p>
<p>During the meeting, company executives faced several questions about the working and living conditions of GM employees in Reynosa, Mexico. One worker, Margarita Del Angel, told the chairman she works more than 14 hours a day and earns 350 pesos a week -- the equivalent of $44.30.</p>
<p>Smith said GM is proud of housing initiatives it has taken to improve conditions in Mexico, but acknowledged the company has &quot;room to improve.&quot;</p>
<p>Smith also heard from Rev. Jesse Jackson. Speaking on behalf of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Jackson urged GM to adopt a plan to ensure that minority dealers will not be unfairly punished by the company's Project 2000 reorganization, which seeks to trim the dealer base by 20 percent.</p>
<p>Responding to questions from shareholder activist Evelyn Davis, GM officials said:</p>
<p>--the commpany spent $307 million on outside legal fees, a reduction of $48 million from 1996;</p>
<p>--GM employees gave between $700,000 and $800,000 to the company's political action committee in the 1995-96 election cycle;</p>
<p>--GM no longer makes &quot;soft money&quot; political contributions;</p>
<p>--GM spent $15.6 million in lobbying efforts in 1996.</p>
<p>Shareholders adopted all the items submitted by GM's board and rejected all five of the shareholder recommendations.</p>
<p>GM's stock gained 50 cents to $57.25 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
