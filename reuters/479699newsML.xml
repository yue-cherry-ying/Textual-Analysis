<headline>Century Telephone to merge Metro, sees gain.</headline>
<dateline>MONROE, La. 1997-03-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Century Telephone Enterprises Inc said Monday it had a strategic alliance with Brooks Fiber Properties Inc to merge its competitive local exchange carrier, Metro Access Networks Inc, with Brooks Fiber's operations.</p>
<p>Under the pact, Century and Metro Access' minority shareholders will receive about $63.4 million plus the net book value of Metro Access at March 31, excluding Metro Access' indebtedness to Century, which will be converted into Metro Access equity before the merger, Century said.</p>
<p>Brooks Fiber said Metro Access shareholders will get about 5 million shares, based upon an exchange rate of $20.60 per share, of Brooks Fiber common stock.</p>
<p>Century shares closed Monday down 3/4 at 29-1/2. Brooks shares closed unchanged at 17-7/8.</p>
<p>Century said it would book an after-tax gain of about $26 million, or $0.43 per share, from the deal, depending on the price of Brooks Fiber's stock on the closing date of the merger.</p>
<p>Century said it will become Brooks Fiber's largest shareholder, with about 12 percent ownership of the company, after the merger closes and gain representation on Brooks Fiber's board, including a vice chairman position.  </p>
<p>It said the merger will consist of Metro Access developing competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) networks in seven Texas cities and gives Century and Brooks Fiber the opportunity to develop additional CLEC networks in Century's wireless markets in Michigan on a 50-50 joint venture basis.</p>
<p>Additionally, Century said it will be able to buy dedicated and switched network services in certain markets in Texas and Michigan from Brooks Fiber at favorable prices, and that Brooks Fiber will be able to buy from Century operational or administrative services.</p>
<p>&quot;This alliance allows Century to continue to participate in the dynamic opportunities the CLEC business offers without incurring additional earnings dilution from Metro Access,&quot; Century chief executive Glen Post said in a release.</p>
<p>Consummation of the merger is subject to regulatory approvals, the execution of certain related agreements and certain other customary closing conditions.</p>
