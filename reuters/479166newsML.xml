<p>The batwing U.S. B-2 &quot;stealth&quot; bomber, built to foil radar and capable of dropping new earth-penetrating nuclear bombs, became operational on Tuesday at an air base in Missouri, the Pentagon said.</p>
<p>Defence Department spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters 13 of the planned 21 planes, which can carry both nuclear and accurate conventional bombs, had been delivered to Whiteman Air Force Base and several had been put on operational status.</p>
<p>Bacon did not discuss their nuclear capability but Air Force and defence officials have said the $2 billion planes can carry a new bunker-busting bomb that penetrates hundreds of feet underground before detonating a small nuclear charge.</p>
<p>Libya and North Korea are among nations that have buried weapons sites and command posts and Washington has made clear that it would consider nuclear retaliation if a country used chemical, biological or nuclear arms against U.S. troops.</p>
<p>The Air Force originally planned to buy more than 50 of the Northrop Grumman Corp. planes, made of composite materials to confuse radar detection, but decided to buy only 21 because of their high cost and the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>The B-2 was originally designed to deliver nuclear bombs to the heart of the Soviet Union in case of a war but is now expected to be used chiefly in conventional warfare.</p>
<p>Bacon said it was capable of worldwide missions carrying 2,000-pound (900 kg) conventional bombs that are guided to their targets by satellites in space. The bombs are designed to strike within 20 feet (six metres) of a target with unerring accuracy.</p>
<p>&quot;I can assure the U.S. taxpayers that this is the most up-to-date heavy bomber flying in the world today,&quot; Bacon said in response to questions about the high cost of the planes. &quot;It's designed to be able to evade enemy defences and to zero in on its targets.&quot;</p>
<p>He confirmed a report in Tuesday's Washington Times that Russia was continuing a Cold War programme of building deep underground bunkers to protect government leaders in case of nuclear attack but he said &quot;we do not consider it a threat.&quot;</p>
<p>That Russian civil defence programme has been under way for years, he said, noting that both the United States and Russia were now in the process of making deep reductions in their nuclear weapons stockpiles.</p>
