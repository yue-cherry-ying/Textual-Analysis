<text>
<p>After a day of meetings and speeches, U.S. President Bill Clinton found a moment to stroll down a quaint shopping street in The Hague (corrects from Amsterdam) lined with cafes and take a sip of beer, but he declined a taste of raw herring.</p>
<p>Clinton arrived in the Netherlands on Tuesday to mark the 50th anniversary of the Marshall Plan, the U.S. programme that helped rebuild western Europe after World War Two.</p>
<p>His visit coincided with the start of the season for herring, a delicacy that is eaten raw, often with onions.</p>
<p>Clinton, who went window shopping with his wife Hillary, demurred when a young woman offered him some raw herring and a White House aide took the fish away.</p>
<p>Another woman emerged from a bistro with a tray of beers but was jostled as she approached the president, sending all the glasses but one crashing to the ground. Clinton appeared to feel badly about the incident and took a sip, prompting cheers.</p>
<p>The Clintons ended their half-hour stroll by sitting down for a drink at an outdoor cafe with some senior aides. Several aides drank beers, the president a cup of coffee, and his wife a hot tea.</p>
