<p>Steffi Graf needed three hours to overcome South African Amanda Coetzer in the Strasbourg semifinals on Friday, avenging a crushing defeat in Berlin eight days earlier.</p>
<p>Graf, who took only one game from Coetzer in the German Open quarter-finals in her first tournament after a three-month injury layoff, won 4-6 7-5 7-6 to move into the final where she will meet either Judith Wiesner of Austria or Croatian Mirjana Lucic.</p>
<p>The match, Graf's 10th victory over Coetzer in 13 meetings, was delayed for more than an hour because of rain during the opening set.</p>
<p>Coetzer has proved a handful for Graf this year, dumping the German out of the Australian Open in the fourth round to end her record 45-match unbeaten run in grand slam tournaments.</p>
<p>It was the second successive match in which Graf has dropped the first set following her 3-6 6-2 6-1 quarter-final win over Frenchwoman Sandrine Testud on Thursday.</p>
<p>But the former world number one said she was happy to get as much clay court action as possible before beginning the defence of her French Open title in Paris next week.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think I'm getting too much, though I hope I won't get any three-hour matches in the French Open,&quot; she said, adding that it &quot;will probably not be until Wimbledon that I get my game back.&quot;</p>
<p>Graf said she might have done better against Coetzer if she had attacked the net more, adding she was still lacking confidence after her knee injury.</p>
<p>&quot;Berlin for me just wasn't a match, I wasn't concentrated and I was nervous,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Coetzer, her disappointment obvious after a gruelling three hours on court, said: &quot;I'm really disappointed. I thought I could win and came ready to do so.</p>
<p>&quot;She played very differently from Berlin, but the whole situation was different, the court, the crowd,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll be very happy if I can meet her again in the (French Open),&quot; added Coetzer, who is in the same half of the draw at Roland Garros.</p>
<p>Graf, asked how she felt about meeting Coetzer again in Paris, said: &quot;Let's just take it match by match.&quot;</p>
