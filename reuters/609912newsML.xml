<p>Russian Urals prices were still bearing the brunt of bad refining margins on Friday but some sellers said they saw the sour crude firming soon in a more liquid market as prompt barrels find homes.</p>
<p>&quot;Urals is still weak as the refiners margins are poor,&quot; one Italian refiner said.</p>
<p>The recent rise in the price of benchmark Brent crude, some $2.50 a barrel since the start of May, hurt margins and there was recent talk of some Mediterranean refiners mulling cutting runs.</p>
<p>But other traders said Urals would pick up after two cargoes (May 30-31 and June 1-2) were reported sold at about Dated Brent -$1.36 and -$1.39 respectively late on Thursday, a few cents higher than a Wednesday trade at Dated Brent -$1.42 for a May 27-29 loader.</p>
<p>There was also unconfirmed talk of a May 25 loader changing hands on Thursday at a very distressed Dated Brent -$1.47 but the deal could not be confirmed immediately.</p>
<p>One of Thursday's sellers said the sour Russian crude was on its way up as most of the prompt barrels have been snatched up already.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect (Urals) would come up. One of the reasons it was hammered was that because there were so many unsold cargoes at the end of May and those cargoes have disappeared so we are back into a more liquid and normal market,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;So I would not be surprised if you would see something in June done at (Dated Brent) -$1.30,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Syria's state oil company Sytrol and some term lifters have agreed to set the June price of Syrian Light at a 77-cent discount to Dated Brent, or five cents over the May price, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, some people have already agreed,&quot; one term lifter told Reuters when asked if an agreement has been reached.</p>
<p>Lifters said the price was set at a 77-cent discount to Dated Brent - a compromise between Sytrol's original asking price of Dated Brent -60 cents and lifters' bids of a rollover from May or even lower prices.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known if agreement has been reached over the price of Syria's heavy crude Souedie for June but one lifter said the latest talk was pegged around $4.40 below Dated Brent.</p>
<p>The May price was set at Dated Brent -$4.65.</p>
<p>The West African market was quiet early on Friday but one lifter said it sold a Bonny Light/Bonny Medium at Dated Brent +50 cents and Dated Brent -1 cent to a European refiner late on Thursday.</p>
<p>The lifter said it also sold a June 6-9 Qua Iboe at the equivalent of Dated Brent +54 cents.</p>
<p>However, other traders said they thought the price reported on Qua Iboe was a bit rich, saying Bonny Light was assessed in the high 40s above Dated Brent and Qua Iboe was a few cents lower.</p>
<p>Reaction over Nigeria's higher June Official Selling Price continued with some commentators saying it would leave lifters with narrow profit margins.</p>
<p>&quot;NNPC's spell of generosity towards its term lifters is clearly over,&quot; Compass's Jonathan Bearman said in a report on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The changes leave lifters with a margin of 6-8 cents relative to spot quotations, but the majority of lifters have to pay sponsors' commissions of 10-11 cents a barrel,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Compass said the best spot prices for June Nigerian barrels so far have been a 52-cent premium to Dated Brent for Bonny Light, and Dated Brent +57 cents and +45 cents for Brass River and Qua Iboe respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if these levels are achieved on resale, lifters will not be able to recover their local agents' fees. Accordingly, traders will have to work for their money in June if they are to avoid losses,&quot; it added.</p>
