<p>Raw materials and half-finished products accounted for more than two-thirds of Poland's imports in 1996, a senior official at the government's Centre for Strategic Studies (CSS) think-tank said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Jan Misala, the head of CSS strategy and international integration department told a news briefing that production inputs accounted for 67.1 percent of imports, consumer goods accounted for 18.5 percent of last year's imports and investment goods for 14 percent. Unclassified imports made up the balance.</p>
<p>&quot;Poland's growth creates demand for processed goods which the economy, still to a large extent structurally unchanged, cannot provide, directing the demand abroad,&quot; Misala said.</p>
<p>He said investment imports were higher at the start of Poland's market reforms in 1990 at 15.1 percent of the total with production inputs making up 57.3 percent and consumption flat at 18.5 percent.</p>
<p>Misala also said Poland's exports consisted mainly of raw materials and low-processed goods, making them more vulnerable to swings in economic business cycles.</p>
<p>&quot;The structure of Polish imports and exports is not going the way we would like it to,&quot; Misala said.</p>
<p>Poland recorded a current account trade deficit of $8.15 billion last year and the shortfall is expected to widen to between $10 billion and $12 billion this year.</p>
<p>He said Poland had to boost its exports through internationally accepted institutions such as exports insurance and credit guarantees which were now too weak in terms of capital and organisation.</p>
<p>Foreign direct investment would also help, if it brought with it the latest technologies, he said.</p>
<p>He also stressed that a one-off devaluation of the zloty, advocated by some politicians as a means of boosting exports, was a short term solution which would bring higher inflation.</p>
<p>It would also make Poland even more attractive as a place for labour-intensive production and source of raw materials instead of highly processed goods and technologies.</p>
