<p>Industrial conglomerate BTR Plc said on Thursday that if sterling remained at its current high level, it would cut the company's first-half 1997 reported sales by around 300 million pounds ($485 million) and operating profit by some 35 million pounds.</p>
<p>Excluding currency translation effects, BTR said it expected underlying first-half operating profit to be &quot;somewhat lower&quot; than a year ago due to weak economic conditions in Germany and Australia, although underlying sales are expected to show growth.</p>
<p>It said it expected the underlying performance to improve in the second half.  </p>
<p>In a trading statement made in conjuction with the group's annual meeting later on Thursday, BTR said the performance of Germany and Australia both continued to reflect depressed economic conditions, and, in the case of Germany, with an inevitable spill-over effect on the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>Some 30 percent of BTR sales are in Germany and Australia.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Ian Strachan said that against this background, BTR was driving ahead on its new strategy to deliver profitable growth.</p>
<p>He said the group's divestment programme was over 80 percent complete, new investements and acquisitions in the core business were in hand, and BTR's restructuring programme was being implemented.</p>
<p>&quot;The degree of change which BTR is undergoing is far-reaching. It cannot happen overnight and the speed at which the strategy begins to show through in the bottom line will continue to be influenced partly by factors outside our control, such as the business cycle or the fluctuation of currencies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is, however, my firm expectation that the underlying performance of the group's continuing businesses will improve steadily as our strategy is implemented and that attractive returns will be generated for shareholders in the years ahead,&quot; he added.</p>
