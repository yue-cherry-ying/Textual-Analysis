<p>When the landmark flight attendants tobacco case goes to trial next week, a mom-and-pop legal team from Miami Beach will be trying to bring down one of the world's richest and most powerful industries.</p>
<p>In Dade County's 1920s-era courthouse, Stanley and Susan Rosenblatt, parents of nine children and owners of a modest legal practice, will argue that the $45 billion tobacco industry has for decades defrauded the American public.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, known as Broin vs. Philip Morris Cos. Inc. et al, claims the major players in the industry were involved in a conspiracy that resulted in thousands of airline flight attendants being sickened by tobacco smoke they breathed at work in the crowded cabins of U.S. passenger jets.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is a landmark in tobacco litigation: the first class action and first secondhand smoke case against the cigarette industry to go to trial, with some 60,000 plaintiffs, and the largest potential payout. Rosenblatt says he will ask for more than $5 billion in punitive damages.</p>
<p>Yet the lawyers at the heart of the action, pitted against an industry rich in cash and hardened in decades of legal warfare, have financed this history-making case themselves. Stanley Rosenblatt will say only that it has cost them more than $500,000, with trial yet to begin.</p>
<p>&quot;We're in denial about that,&quot; he said of the cost. &quot;If we think about it, we just get depressed.&quot;</p>
<p>The David-and-Goliath nature of the case is evident each time the two sides line up in court. Rosenblatt and Rosenblatt wheel in case files and sit alone on one side. Sharply dressed tobacco lawyers, a dozen or more, crowd tables on the other.</p>
<p>At a recent hearing, presiding Judge Robert Kaye asked how many tobacco lawyers would be present at trial. &quot;About 200,&quot; one industry attorney said, smiling.</p>
<p>The Rosenblatts' small practice -- they work with three other lawyers -- was mainly engaged in liability cases before Norma Broin came into their lives six years ago.</p>
<p>An American Airlines flight attendant and a non-smoker, Broin says she contracted lung cancer by breathing passengers' smoke. The Rosenblatts were not the first lawyers she asked to take her case. She calls their acceptance of it miraculous.</p>
<p>&quot;When they took this case, it was 1991, it was not the P.C. thing to do,&quot; Broin said. &quot;They were taking on a trillion-dollar industry, there were no guarantees.&quot;</p>
<p>Richard Daynard, head of the Tobacco Products Liability Project at Northeastern University, called the Rosenblatts &quot;heroic&quot; for pushing the six-year-old case to trial.</p>
<p>&quot;They did what everyone, myself included, thought was impossible,&quot; he said. &quot;Anyone who bets against them at this point may be making a mistake.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosenblatt said his initial inclination was to decline -- &quot;other lawyers said you'd have to be out of your mind to take on the tobacco companies&quot; -- until he began to research environmental tobacco smoke and what he calls the industry's history of denial and misrepresentation.</p>
<p>&quot;No one had ever put them in their place,&quot; said Rosenblatt, a non-smoker who by his own admission was never a crusader against smokers or smoking.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the moral cause more than anything,&quot; he said. &quot;I think the story, when told properly to a fair-minded jury ... I'm hopeful that they will say, 'Enough already.' Are we really going to hook another generation of kids?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's Don Quixote. I'm sure he views himself as that,&quot; said Miles McGrane, a Miami attorney who has defended against Rosenblatt malpractice lawsuits in the past.</p>
<p>Colleagues describe them as the ideal legal tag team. Stanley, 60, the pugnacious litigator, Susan, 46, the patient behind-the-scenes scholar, writer and researcher.</p>
<p>&quot;Stanley is intellectually very sharp and focused,&quot; McGrane said. &quot;When he takes on a case, it becomes a cause, which in some people would be a detriment. That's where Susan comes in. She keeps them balanced.&quot;</p>
<p>The Rosenblatts, Orthodox Jews who do not work Saturdays, say the case has simply expanded an already rigorous schedule. Work days stretch from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., including Sundays. Their brood was warned the case would take a toll.</p>
<p>&quot;The kids understand this is a big case because people are always coming up and asking us about it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In pretrial hearings, industry lawyers asked Kaye to muzzle Rosenblatt after he released to national television a taped deposition of a tobacco executive comparing cigarette addiction to a yearning for Gummi Bear candy.</p>
<p>&quot;He may offend everyone else in the courtroom,&quot; McGrane said. &quot;I've seen him go out of his way to offend people. But he's not going to offend the jury.&quot;</p>
