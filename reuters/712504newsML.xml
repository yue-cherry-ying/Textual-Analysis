<p>The death toll in floods in southern Poland rose to seven on Tuesday, after two more people were killed in the Jelenia Gora province and one drowned in the city of Raciborz, the police spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;For now we have reports of seven people killed as a result of the floods,&quot; Andrzej Przemyski, spokesman for Poland's Police Chief told Reuters.</p>
<p>On Monday four people drowned in Walbrzych province after days of heavy rain swelled major rivers to flood levels, putting 35,000 hectares of southern Poland under water.</p>
<p>Deputy Interior Minister Zbigniew Sobotka told a news conference on Tuesday the situation could get worse if rains continued.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently nine provinces have declared a state of flood alert, but we expect it will be declared in 12,&quot; Sobotka said. &quot;(In some towns) streets look like mountain torrents.&quot;</p>
<p>He said 10,000 homes were flooded as a result of the heavy rains, which started on Saturday, and 6,000 people had been evacuated but that the number could grow to 12,000 people.</p>
<p>The most affected provinces were Katowice, Walbrzych and Opole, he said, adding that many areas in all affected provinces were deprived of drinking water and energy.</p>
<p>Reports from the affected areas told of children evacuated from holiday camps, and underground gas, electricity and telecommunications facilities swamped.</p>
<p>Sobotka said rescue operations were being conducted by 5,950 professional and voluntary firemen, 800 policmen, 575 soldiers and more than 6,000 communal service workers.</p>
<p>Sobotka said it was hard to estimate the financial losses caused by the rain. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700</p>
