<p>Dresdner Bank AG, Germany's second largest commercial bank, said on Friday that strong operating business in the first quarter left it cautiously optimistic for its profit outlook for 1997.</p>
<p>The bank, reporting detailed first quarter earnings for the first time, posted a 10 percent advance in operating profit for the first three months amid strong advances in interest and commission income as fund and equity sales improved.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the environment remains difficult for German banks in 1997, after a good first quarter we remain cautiously optimistic for the full year,&quot; chairman Juergen Sarrazin told the bank's annual general meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;We are also confident of being able to present a full year 1997 result which will enable us to pay an attractive dividend as well as significantly increase our reserves,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dresdner raised its 1996 dividend to 1.45 marks per share from 1.35 marks and also paid a bonus dividend of 10 pfennigs to mark its 125th anniversary, as its net profit surged 31 percent to 1.58 billion marks, outstripping its main rivals.</p>
<p>Sarrazin said earnings in the first quarter of 1997 had as usual been influenced by special factors and full year results could not be directly extrapolated from them.</p>
<p>Operating profit before risk provisions advanced to 991 million marks ($586.4 million) in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The bank posted a particularly strong rise in commission income for the period, with a 20.6 percent rise to 1.2 billion marks on the back of high equity and mutual fund sales.</p>
<p>Net interest income rose rose 8.8 percent to 1.7 billion marks, but was partly boosted by elements of &quot;quasi-trading income&quot;, Sarrazin said, which were not necessarily sustainable over the full year.</p>
<p>Own-account trading income was 330 million marks, which Sarrazin said was very satisfactory, without providing a comparative figure. The first quarter result was, however, equal to half the full trading income for 1996.</p>
<p>Sarrazin took the opportunity of the meeting, attended by shareholders representing 72.6 percent of its capital, to firmly deny media reports that Dresdner was keen to buy into Postbank, the postal bank due for privatisation this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We are neither interested in taking over Postbank or in taking a stake in it,&quot; Sarrazin said, although he conceded that the bank had in 1995 considered these options.</p>
<p>In general, Sarrazin downplayed the urgency of the need for mergers in German commercial banking, saying the need for consolidation was &quot;not acute&quot; at present.</p>
<p>&quot;Dresdner is certainly not a takeover candidate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Turning to another topical issue, Sarrazin said Dresdner would net more than 500 million marks from the sale agreed this week of a stake in chemicals and metals firm Degussa AG to utility Veba AG.</p>
<p>Dresdner agreed to sell the stake, part of a 36.4 percent package, for 800 million marks, and plans to use the gains to further strengthen its own funds.</p>
<p>The bank's administrative costs rose 10.4 percent to 2.3 billion marks in the first quarter, partly due to the first-time consolidation of funds unit RCM Capital Management, without which the rise would have been 7.3 percent.</p>
<p>Dresdner is placing strong emphasis on institutional fund management, which Sarrazin said he considers one of the most promising segments in international banking.</p>
<p>Dresdner did not give any precise figures for loan loss provisions for the first quarter, but Sarrazin said these were likely to remain at about the year-ago level for the full year.</p>
<p>The bank's balance sheet total passed the 600 billion mark for the first time by March 31, rising 11.5 percent to 625 billion marks, but lending added only 3.5 percent to the total, the rest being due to money market business.</p>
<p>Sarrazin said the bank was focusing more on margin and asset quality in its lending business.</p>
<p>Dresdner shares outperformed the broader share market, closing the bourse session 1.02 marks up at 62.82.</p>
