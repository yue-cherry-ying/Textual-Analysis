<p>Pakistani vegetable oil prices are likely to rise next week on increased local demand, dealers said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Heavy buying by local cooking oil mills in a depressed market pushed prices up between 60 and 100 rupees ($1.47 and $2.46) on Friday, a dealer of Saulat Enterprises said.</p>
<p>Another factor boosting prices was a lower than expected stock position in Malaysia, which had about 805,000 tonnes of palm oil at end-July, against a forecast one million tonnes.</p>
<p>A third factor was monsoon rains in Pakistan which had disrupted supplies of cottonseed oil from ginneries and oil extraction units to domestic markets, the dealer said.</p>
<p>One importer also linked the increase to government restrictions on the misuse of an exemption from five percent income tax granted to industrial importers of palm oil.</p>
<p>Industrial importers had been selling tax-exempt imported palm oil -- meant exclusively for their own consumption -- on the market, said the importer, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Since this practice stopped after the government cracked down, palm oil prices had risen between 60 and 100 rupees.</p>
<p>RBD palm oil prices jumped to $525 per tonne C&amp;F from $505 last week and soyoil eased slightly to $555 per tonne C&amp;F from $560 last week, the dealer said.</p>
<p>Vegoil stocks fell to 130,000 tonnes, including 105,000 tonnes of RBD palm oil and olein, from 135,000 tonnes last week.</p>
