<p>Berlin is a dirty, hectic city of evil memory, filled with crime, building sites and loud, pushy people, according to a survey of how Germans feel about their historic capital.</p>
<p>Only one German in 10 would want to live in Berlin, the Emnid research institute found in a poll for Der Spiegel magazine published on Friday.</p>
<p>The city became the official capital again when Germany was reunited in 1990. Many thousands of civil servants will have to move from Bonn when it becomes the seat of government in 1999.</p>
<p>Germany's largest city, with a population of 3.4 million, Berlin fared especially poorly among easterners and women among the 1,010 people questioned. Only five percent of the easterners and seven percent of women would want to live there.</p>
<p>High-income Germans were especially put off by the Berliners, who they feel are loud and pushy, the survey found.</p>
<p>&quot;Bad memories about past epochs are for one in five Germans a reason they wouldn't want to live in Berlin,&quot; the study said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some connect Berlin to the Nazis, others see the city's image burdened by the East German communists while others don't like the Prussian traditions of the city.&quot;</p>
