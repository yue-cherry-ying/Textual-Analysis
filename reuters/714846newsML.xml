<p>Japan's ruling party on Tuesday proposed new laws to allow the country's armed forces to take part in naval blockades, evacuation of Japanese nationals from abroad and anti-terrorist operations inside the country.</p>
<p>The Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) Research Commission on Security suggested the government submit the bills to the next full session of parliament in January next year, after the United States and Japan announce a final report on new bilateral defence arrangements in September.</p>
<p>The three parties in Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's parliamentary alliance were expected to discuss the exact contents of the new laws by the year-end, LDP officials said.</p>
<p>Last month, the two countries issued an interim report on new &quot;Guidelines to Defence Cooperation&quot; which called on Japan to take on an expanded security role in East Asia.</p>
<p>The guidelines provide a set framework for actual defence cooperation under the 1960 U.S.-Japan Security.</p>
<p>The old 1978 guidelines only stipulated U.S.-Japan military cooperation in the event of a Soviet invasion of Japan and did not require Japan to play any military role in a regional conflict in East Asia unless attacked.</p>
<p>Among other things, the interim report said Japanese navy vessels would take part in enforcing naval blockades and minesweeping operations in emergencies around Japan.</p>
<p>The interim report did not specify what it meant by regional conflicts &quot;surrounding Japan&quot;, such as conflicts on the Korean Peninsula, between China and Taiwan or over the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Japanese military analysts said the extensive measures suggested in the new guidelines, if finalised, would amount to a new U.S.-Japan Security Treaty challenging Japan's pacifist constitution.</p>
<p>The constitution bars Japan from threatening or using military force to settle international disputes and prohibits Japan from entering into NATO-type collective security arrangements.</p>
<p>Japan's military, called the Self-Defence Forces, has been limited to a purely defensive role, except for non-combat U.N. peacekeeping operations.</p>
<p>The LDP commission proposed revising the Self-Defence Forces (SDF) Law to allow the navy to inspect foreign ships to enforce U.N. resolutions and to evacuate Japanese nationals in times of emergency in a foreign country.</p>
<p>The LDP commission also proposed new laws to allow troops to deal with armed refugees and spies attempting to enter Japanese territory and terrorists operating inside Japan.</p>
<p>Other proposed new laws would require local governments and private firms to provide support for the U.S. military in emergencies.</p>
