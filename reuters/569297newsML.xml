<p>A group of Brazilian Indians will fight to the death or commit suicide rather than accept a court order to abandon land they consider sacred, a representative of the Catholic Church said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>About 70 Guarani-Kaiowa Indians have been given until May 13 to leave their officially demarcated reservation which lies inside a huge, privately owned estate in the remote western state of Mato Grosso do Sul, near the border with Paraguay.</p>
<p>But the Guarani-Kaiowas refused to leave and about 130 members of the tribe from other villages have joined them to resist the eviction order, Maucir Paulette, a lawyer with the Catholic Church's Indian Missionary Council (CIMI) said.</p>
<p>The Indians are armed with guns and bows and arrows and have stockpiled about 15 gallons (60 liters) of gasoline which they are threatening to use in Molotov cocktails or to set fire to themselves, Paulette said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are three Indian cemeteries in the area and the link with the ancestors is what keeps them there. For them, it is a sacred link,&quot; he said. The eviction order was brought by the owner of the farm within which the reservation lies. The Indians have been forced off the land twice before.</p>
<p>The Guaranis and Kaiowas were once separte Brazilian tribes who lived a nomadic existance across a vast swathe of Brazil and what is now Paraguay. But as farmers pushed further and further into Brazil's interior, the tribes were forced into ever remoter areas of the country.</p>
<p>In recent decades, even the furthest corners of Mato Grosso do Sul have been occupied by settlers who have chopped down the forests and claimed the land for themselves.</p>
<p>As a result, many Kaiowa-Guaranis have fallen into destitution and 280 tribe members, many of them children and teenagers, have committed suicide over the last five years, according to figures from CIMI.</p>
<p>An official in the court where the order was issued said the judge was merely following the decision of a more senior tribunal which upheld an appeal by the landowner against the demaraction of the area as a reservation.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know how the Indians will react,&quot; said the official who asked not to be named. &quot;It could be that there is violence. The police can't go in bashing heads or there will be trouble for sure.&quot;</p>
