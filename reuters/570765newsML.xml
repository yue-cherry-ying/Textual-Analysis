<headline>C&amp;W shares firm after HK Telecom results.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Shares in Cable and Wireless Plc firmed in a weak overall UK equity market in pre-market trade on Thursday, lifted by a strong performance by 58.5-percent owned Hong Kong Telecom, dealers said.</p>
<p>C&amp;W shares were up 2p at 498-1/2 by 0720 GMT, after HK Telecom shares rose HK$0.50 to HK$14.70 following the release of results for the year to March 31, showing a 12.5 percent rise in net profit to HK11.18 billion.  </p>
<p>Dealers also said there was continuing market talk ahead of the territory's reversion to Chinese rule on July 1 that a China partner could take a stake in the HK operation.</p>
<p>C&amp;W on Wednesday fended off such talk, saying it was not compelled to do anything because of the change of administration in Hong Kong and it expected business as usual after the handover.  </p>
<p>John Tysoe, analyst at SocGen, said the future of HK Telecom was probably the single most important issue facing C&amp;W now that its UK operations had been merged with a group of cable operators under the C&amp;W Communications banner.</p>
<p>&quot;The logic is that they have to reach a deal that makes the company look more local,&quot; Tysoe said, &quot;but it is not a new idea... what they will want to do is to swap some of the equity for an investment in China.&quot;</p>
