<p>Scotland's Colin Montgomerie birdied three of the last four holes to maintain his one-shot lead after the third round of the European Grand Prix on Saturday.</p>
<p>Only a frustrating bogey at the last prevented the reigning European number one from increasing his overnight lead.</p>
<p>Earlier Montgomerie fell a stroke behind defending champion Retief Goosen of South Africa and England's Lee Westwood despite saving from 40ft on the ninth and collecting two birdies.</p>
<p>After lightning held up play for two hours in the afternoon, Montgomerie returned to the course to reassert his dominance, finishing at four-under for an 11-under-par total of 205.</p>
<p>Westwood returned to miss a 10ft birdie putt to equal the course record 65 and remained one shot off the pace.</p>
<p>Goosen's 68 left him on 206 with Westwood, two strokes ahead of England's Jamie Spence and Scott Henderson of Scotland.</p>
<p>Montgomerie, seeking his first win of the year before next week's US Open, grabbed the lead with birdies on the 15th, 16th and 17th holes.</p>
<p>The Scot hit a 40-yard chip to 10ft and followed up with two more 10-footers to go two ahead of the field before a loose drive and then a wide approach shot on the last led to a bogey.</p>
<p>&quot;The finish was unfortunate, only my second bogey of the week, because a 67 would have kept me on target,&quot; said Montgomerie.</p>
<p>&quot;I predicted 16-under-par would win this, so if I'm right, I'll need a 67 in the final round now to win.&quot;</p>
