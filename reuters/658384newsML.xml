<text>
<p>A Malaysian businessman and his wife may have set a record of sorts when they sat through a marathon seven-hour court reading of 2,372 charges for alleged cheque forgery.</p>
<p>The case involving cheques valued at 9.3 million ringgit ($3.72 million) was heard in Sibu Sessions Court in east Malaysia's Sarawak state on Wednesday, the New Straits Times reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>It took seven hours for three interpreters, defence and prosecution officials to read out the 2,372 charges and have the couple's pleas of not guilty recorded separately.</p>
<p>The interpreters were necessary because defendants are ethnic Chinese and court proceedings are conducted in Malay.</p>
<p>Ling Sui Ngee is accused of assisting in disposing of the cheques which his wife Hu Siew Hie, a former employee of timber firm Rimbunan Hijau Group, allegedly forged. The offences allegedly occurred between 1994 and 1996 and carry a penalty of 20-year jail terms and a fine upon conviction.</p>
<p>The couple's trial is fixed for December 1.</p>
<p>The Sibu court had to postpone all other cases set for Wednesday to deal with the marathon hearing, the newspaper said.</p>
