<p>London cockneys love to swig beer in open-top buses at the Epsom Derby while millionaires in top hats quaff champagne in the grandstand.</p>
<p>For British high society gets the chance on Saturday to revel in the delights of the world's most famous horse race.</p>
<p>It launches the summer season that then takes the rich and famous on to racing at Royal Ascot, tennis at Wimbledon and rowing at the Henley regatta.</p>
<p>Even the most indefatigable socialite barely has time to fit in a trip to the opera at Glyndebourne where everyone who is anyone picnics on the manicured lawns in full evening dress.</p>
<p>But the Epsom Derby, which has 200 imitators around the world from Arkansas to Madrid, crosses class barriers and ranks as a unique British tradition.</p>
<p>For it also gives the gypsy fortune tellers a chance to ply their trade amid the jellied eel stalls and raucous funfair rides.</p>
<p>&quot;The Derby is a national day out for aristocrats and artisans, gypsies and generals, viscounts and villains,&quot; is how former racecourse boss Tim Neligan once described festivities at the unique course just 14 miles (22 kms) from the centre of London.</p>
<p>In Victorian times, mid-week Derby Day was a national holiday with parliament going into recess and even judges bringing trials to a halt for the day.</p>
<p>Crowds of up to 750,000 would flock to Epsom Downs. Today the race has been switched to a Saturday and the racecourse would be delighted to get 60,000 spectators.</p>
<p>Last year it battled the rival attraction of the Euro 96 soccer championships. This year England's cricket team is heading for a rare victory against arch rivals Australia.</p>
<p>But the appeal of the great race has never faded around the globe.</p>
<p>In Jamaica's 120 betting shops, it is the breakfast highlight of the weekend. In Hong Kong, the race is relayed live on giant screens to the British colony's two racecourses. For Sri Lankan punters, this is the big gamble of the year.</p>
<p>Purists are appalled that the greatest test offered for a thoroughbred racehorse should be a track with more twists and turns than a rollercoaster.</p>
<p>&quot;It has always been a mystery to me why our best race should be run on our worst racecourse,&quot; complained BBC television commentator Julian Wilson.</p>
<p>But the race has captured people's imagination for over 200 years.</p>
<p>Triumphs and tragedies abound from a suffragette who died by throwing herself in front of King George V's horse to the 1932 winner April the Fifth who had to walk to the course after its horsebox got stuck in a traffic jam.</p>
<p>Authors from Henry James to Charles Dickens have tried to capture the atmosphere of racing's frenetic helter skelter.</p>
<p>But it was  American writer Bill Bryson who perhaps best distilled the essence of Derby Day: &quot;It is like your first experience of sex -- hectic, strenuous, memorably pleasant and over before you know it.&quot;</p>
