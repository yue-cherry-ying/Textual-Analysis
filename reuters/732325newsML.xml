<p>Iran accused Israel on Wednesday of &quot;arts banditry&quot; following the showing of Iranian films at a Jerusalem film festival, the official news agency IRNA said.</p>
<p>It said the state Farabi Cinema Foundation denounced the screenings, which it said were arranged without Iran's permission, as &quot;a plot hatched by Europe and the illegal state of Israel&quot;.</p>
<p>The foundation, which controls much of Iran's film industry, said the showings were &quot;open arts banditry, and ...incompatible with the most basic principles of international and cultural regulations&quot;.</p>
<p>It said the Jerusalem festival had already screened &quot;Gabbeh&quot; by Mohsen Makhmalbaf and was planning to show three other films by the Iranian director whose work has been well received by international critics.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear if foreign distributors of the films needed to get prior permission from Tehran officials over showings outside Iran.</p>
<p>&quot;Gabbeh&quot;, a poetic film about nomadic carpet weavers, was screened at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival and has been shown since in art film houses in Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>Iran says Israel has no right to exist. Tehran condemns the Middle East peace process as a sellout of Palestinian rights.</p>
<p>The Islamic republic often condemns Israel over its policy on East Jerusalem, the site of Islam's third holiest shrine.</p>
