<p>Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said Thursday the effective date on a capital gains tax rate reduction will be negotiable as part of the overall tax legislation expected to be worked out later this year.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, the South Dakota Democrat said the May 7 date proposed by the Republican chairmen of the House and Senate tax writing committees had not been part of the budget agreement reached last week with the White House.</p>
<p>Daschle said it was too early to tell whether May 7 would be the date in the final tax cut bill.  </p>
<p>Wednesday Finance Committee chairman Sen. Bill Roth, Republican of Delaware, and Ways and Means Committee chairman Rep. Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, announced they would propose May 7 as the effective date for any capital gains cut passed by Congress. While the tax legislation must still be written, their intentions carry great weight in the deliberations.</p>
<p>&quot;I am concerned with some of these pronouncements by the chairs of the Finance and Ways and Means Committees that they have already determined that much of the tax legislation is going to be retroactive. That certainly wasn't in the (budget) agreement,&quot; Daschle said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know that we have nailed many of the parameters with regard to taxes sufficiently,&quot; he continued. &quot;It is too early to tell. What are the cost implications of retroactivity? And, what are we talking about, what is it (the tax bill)?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Daschle agreed with House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt that the budget deal worked out with Republicans had included a $35 billion education tax credit over five years, despite comments from Archer that the no specific amount for education had been adopted.  </p>
<p>The budget agreement provided for a gross $135 billion tax cut over five years of which $50 billion would be offset by tax increases including an extension of the airline ticket tax. The net tax cut would total $85 billion over five years and $250 billion over 10 years.</p>
<p>It was expected to include a capital gains tax rate cut, which Republicans have said they would like to see drop to 20 percent from the current 28 percent. In addition to the education credit, it was also to include a $500 per child tax credit and reduction in inheritance taxes.</p>
