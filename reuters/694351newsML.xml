<p>Britain's new Conservative leader William Hague called on Friday for a referendum on the EU treaty agreed by Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair at last week's Amsterdam summit.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a question of sovereignty,&quot; a Hague aide told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Blair came back empty-handed,&quot; he said. &quot;Imposing the EU Social Chapter will be disastrous for Britain. Fishermen gained nothing and the concessions on retaining border controls had already been won by Conservatives.&quot;</p>
<p>Blair said after the summit that he had done a deal to protect Britain's fishing industry from foreign fishermen buying up British quotas and that he had guaranteed Britain's border controls in a way which the Conservatives had failed to do.</p>
<p>He also reversed Conservative policy by signing up to the EU's Social Chapter, which guarantees employees certain minimum rights.</p>
<p>The referendum call was agreed unanimously at a shadow cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the aide said.</p>
<p>He denied that the call signalled a hardening of Hague's line on Europe, pointing out that Denmark is to hold a referendum on Amsterdam and France had held one on the Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>Hague's call came in a speech to the annual Scottish Conservative conference, his first public appeal to rank-and-file members of a Scottish party stunned by a general election wipeout and riven by internal dissent.</p>
<p>He reiterated opposition to Labour plans for a separate Scottish parliament. The conference decided by a huge majority to campaign for a &quot;No&quot; vote in a referendum on a Scottish parliament but to work for maximum representation if a parliament is set up.</p>
<p>Opposition to any change in the 300-year-old link with England was a major factor in the party's disastrous election campaign.</p>
