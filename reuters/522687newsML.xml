<p>The ghosts of Nicaragua's past returned to haunt it this week as left-wing Sandinista protesters raised barricades and burned tires in a five-day national strike which ended on Friday.</p>
<p>Protesters set up 54 roadblocks that partially paralyzed traffic across the country before the government and strike leaders agreed to start a national dialogue to heal Nicaragua's deep political wounds.</p>
<p>The strike startled many Nicaraguans who thought political stability had returned to their country after back-to-back civil wars that ended in 1990.</p>
<p>Early in the term of President Arnoldo Aleman's predecesser, Violeta Chamorro, sometimes-violent Sandinista protests paralyzed the country and forced her government to make major concessions.</p>
<p>Faced with televised images around the world of barricades and burning tires in Managua's streets, Aleman gave in to many Sandinista demands in order not damage the economy and scare away desperately needed foreign investment.</p>
<p>After four gruelling hours of negotiations with top Sandinistas and strike leaders on Friday, Aleman emerged and announced &quot;the easing of tensions and the return to normality in the life of the country starting today.&quot;</p>
<p>Former Sandinista President Daniel Ortega described the agreement as a &quot;stop to allow an opportunity for understanding&quot; and said the national dialogue would begin on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope with this negotiation process to give an answer to the people and that it leads to a process of stability and peace in our country,&quot; Ortega told the news conference.</p>
<p>Sandinista protesters, many of whom had spent five days manning barricades on roads and highways across Nicaragua, took down the barricades late on Friday but said if the government did not fulfill its word, they would be back.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Aleman government doesn't fulfill its promises it will be in serious trouble,&quot; peasant leader Jose Luis Garcia said.</p>
<p>The government said the strike cost Nicaragua's impoverished economy $11 million and may have created investor jitters.</p>
<p>Pro-Sandinista strikers were protesting the right-wing government's economic policies, which they said were pushing many out of work, and demanding that legal titles to confiscated properties they received during the Sandinista land reform in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The Sandinistas won key concessions for ending the strike, with the government agreeing to form five working groups to negotiate solutions to Nicaragua's many problems and come up with a definitive national agreement within 30 days.</p>
<p>One key working group will try to hammer out labor stability in Nicaragua, addressing Sandinista fears of mass layoffs of civil servants under Aleman's economic austerity program.</p>
<p>Another will look for definitive resolution to Nicaragua's bitter property dispute, which involves an estimated 200,000 houses, farms and businesses confiscated by the state during the Sandinista land reform in the 1980s, many of which are being reclaimed by their former owners.</p>
<p>The government also agreed to send a bill to parliament to suspend court-ordered evictions of people with confiscated land for three months.</p>
<p>The Sandinistas, who governed Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990 with Soviet and Cuban backing, lost Nicaragua's Oct. 20 presidential elections to Aleman's Liberal Alliance but alleged the elections were fraudulent.</p>
