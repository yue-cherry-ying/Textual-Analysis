<p>Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd, Japan's 10th-largest commercial bank, and the smaller regional bank Hokkaido Bank Ltd said on Tuesday that they plan to merge in April 1998.</p>
<p>The two banks said in a joint statement they had decided to start preparations for the merger and that it would be carried out on an equal basis.  </p>
<p>Hokkaido Takushoku will be the surviving entity after the merger, the two banks said in their joint statement. Both are headquartered in Sapporo, Hokkaido's largest city.</p>
<p>Hokkaido Bank will be disbanded and the new bank's name will probably be Shin-Hokkaido Bank, they said.</p>
<p>Hokkaido Takushoku also said that it would withdraw from overseas operations by March 1998.  </p>
<p>It said the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd would help in providing overseas services to its clients after the pullout.</p>
<p>Hokkaid Takushoku said it would continue offering foreign exchange and overseas investment services at its branches in Japan.</p>
<p>It said it would post an appraisal loss of 61 billion yen on its securities holdings in 1996/97.  </p>
<p>The two merging banks said in the joint statement that the merger would create a super-regional bank which could contribute to the growth of their clients and the regional economy.</p>
<p>They said the banks must be able to provide advanced financial services and have strong financial condition amid the era of global competition and deregulation in Japan's financial industry.</p>
<p>&quot;We have reached the conclusion that the merger on an equal bases will best respond to the needs of the times,&quot; the statement said.  </p>
<p>Hokkaido Takushoku Bank had total assets of 10.12 trillion yen as of the end of September 1996, while Hokkaido Bank had assets worth 3.35 trillion yen.</p>
