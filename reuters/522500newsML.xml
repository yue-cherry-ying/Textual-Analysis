<p>Well-known caddie Jeff &quot;Squeeky&quot; Medlen underwent a second bone narrow transplant on Thursday, Nick Price said Friday.</p>
<p>Price, who was leading the PGA Tour event here after two rounds, told reporters that Medlen had received his mother's bone marrow for the second time, after a first transplant three months ago proved unsuccessful.</p>
<p>&quot;He didn't want to have it done at all (but) that is about the only thing that is going to save his life right now,&quot; Price said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the only option. He is sicker now than he has ever been. I went to see him the Sunday before Augusta and I hardly recognised him. It was very, very sad.&quot;</p>
<p>Medlen, 42, worked for Price for six years before quitting last November, four months after learning he had leukaemia.</p>
<p>He underwent the latest transplant at the Ohio State University Hospital in Columbus.</p>
