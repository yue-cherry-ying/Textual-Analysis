<p>South Africa's football officials labelled their own players as &quot;greedy&quot; and &quot;mercenary&quot; on Friday after the team threatened to boycott Saturday's friendly international against England over a pay dispute.</p>
<p>The South African Football Association in a statement released on Friday said they had been forced by the players in to handing over the total match fee of 125,000 pounds ($203,000) after the players refused to play the match unless their appearance money was increased.</p>
<p>That fee was paid by the English F.A. to the South African F.A. to play the match. The South Africans had budgeted some of it for expenses, some for youth development and some to pay the players.</p>
<p>Players and officials were locked in negotiations most of Friday, delaying a training session at Old Trafford by six hours as they haggled over money.</p>
<p>Officials eventually agreed to give the players an increased fee but said the action amounted to &quot;blackmail&quot; and could jeopardise future international engagements.</p>
<p>&quot;We decided with great reluctance to hand over the money in order to protect our integrity and our agreement with the Football Association in England. &quot;The decision by the squad to hold us to ransom has been nothing short of mercenary and a major disappointment.</p>
<p>&quot;The players have not only put the future of their own international careers in jeopardy but also the future of South Africa's participation in the international arena,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The association said they would lose money that would otherwise have been ploughed back into youth development in their country.</p>
<p>&quot;We now face the dilemma of having to cancel future international engagements because the match fee will not cover the excessive demands of the South African players.&quot;</p>
<p>South African officials said they had made the issue public to expose &quot;the increasingly greedy attitude being adopted by the players.&quot;</p>
<p>This is not the first that the South African team have threatened to boycott an important international match unless they were given increased appearance fees and win bonuses.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the final time that the association will allow itself to be blackmailed,&quot; the statement added.</p>
<p>Players spent most of the morning at their hotel in Macclesfield near Manchester huddled in meetings as they negotiated with officials.</p>
<p>A morning training session at Old Trafford had to be rescheduled as coach Clive Barker attempted to mediate. &quot;We are making a stand because we believe we deserve the money,&quot; said one player. &quot;Why should we settle for less when the bosses are caught helping themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, South African Football Association president Solomon Morewa resigned after a judicial inquiry found he had mis-managed the association's finances and overpaid himself.</p>
<p>The threatened boycott is not the first time an African team due to play England has been involved in a financial dispute.</p>
<p>Cameroon's star attraction Roger Milla refused to play against England at Wembley six years ago because he was not given a special match fee by the English Football Association.</p>
