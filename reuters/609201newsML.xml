<title>ISRAEL: Journalist held by Palestinians on hunger strike.</title>
<headline>Journalist held by Palestinians on hunger strike.</headline>

<p>Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab who is being detained by the Palestinian Authority went on hunger strike on Friday to demand that he should be either freed or charged, human rights groups said.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Centre for Democracy and Elections (PCDE) also said that Kuttab was being denied visiting rights.</p>
<p>Kuttab's brother told Reuters earlier that Kuttab, who holds U.S. citizenship and lives in East Jerusalem, was detained on Wednesday after he obeyed a summons by Palestinian police and went to the Ramallah self-rule enclave in the West Bank.</p>
<p>He said the detention was apparently related to a dispute between Kuttab, who has a private contract to carry live broadcasts of Palestinian Legislative Council sessions, and Palestinian state-run television.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Kuttab announced at 11.45 a.m. this morning that he had started a hunger strike that will continue until he is released from prison or charges are brought against him,&quot; the Palestinian Centre said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The PCDE strongly condemns the order made by the office of the president (Yasser Arafat) of the Palestinian Authority to deny visitation rights to...Kuttab,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch called for Kuttab to be freed. &quot;We urge you to release him immediately,&quot; it said in a letter to Arafat.</p>
<p>&quot;This incident follows a disturbing pattern of harassment by the Palestinian Authority of journalists, human rights monitors and other government critics, a number of whom have been detained soley for exercising their internationally guaranteed right to free expression,&quot; the letter said.</p>
<p>The United States, calling for Kuttab's release, said on Thursday that the matter had been raised with senior members of the Palestinian Authority but not directly with Arafat.</p>
