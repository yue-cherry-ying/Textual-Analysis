<p>DEMOCRATS CALL FOR DISCLOSURE OF MPS LAND HOLDINGS</p>
<p>Australian Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot says the public has the right to know if MPs stand to gain financially from the Prime Minister's ten-point plan on native title.</p>
<p>Senator Kernot has reiterated her call for Coalition MPs to declare their land holdings, saying she's concerned some Queensland politicians in particular have a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>She says one point in the plan is a proposal to upgrade leaseholds to freehold land.</p>
<p>The Senator says she sees that as giving some people a significant capacity for financial benefit.</p>
<p>Federal Cabinet yesterday endorsed John Howard's plan and backbenchers will consider it next week</p>

<p>GAIN FROM AIRPORT SALE TO BE FACTORED INTO NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET</p>
<p>A spokesman for Federal Finanace minister, John Fahey, says the windfall gain from the Government's three-point-four billion dollar sale of three major airports will go in to next year's budget.</p>
<p>He says the figure won't improve this year's Budget due to be handed down next Tuesday.</p>
<p>The sale of the Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports was announced yesterday by the Federal Transport minister.</p>
<p>Bankers Trust economist, David Bassanese, says the sale figure had been factored into this year's figures, so next week's numbers won't be as good as expected.</p>
<p>Mr Bassanese says allowing for the special three billion payment from Telstra, he's expecting a deficit of around one billion dollars.</p>
