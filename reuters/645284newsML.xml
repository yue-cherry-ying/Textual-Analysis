<title>LEBANON: Freed Lebanese labour leader to go on fight.</title>
<headline>Freed Lebanese labour leader to go on fight.</headline>

<p>Lebanese leftist union leader Elias Abou Rizk pledged to carry on his fight for his principles, moments after a judge ordered on Saturday that he be released.</p>
<p>&quot;If I have been before my arrest very tough in my struggle to defend freedom, democracy and the daily bread, now I will be tougher in defending these principles,&quot; Abou Rizk told reporters in Saint George hospital in Beirut.</p>
<p>Abou Rizk, 54, was arrested eight days ago for claiming to head Lebanon's divided labour movement, but spent the time in the hospital suffering from high blood pressure, respiratory and urinary tract problems.</p>
<p>Investigating judge Said Mirza ordered Abou Rizk released on bail of 400,000 Lebanese pounds ($260) after rival unionist Ghneim al-Zoghbi's lawyer agreed.</p>
<p>Abou Rizk was arrested after General Labour Confederation (CGTL) elections in April produced two leaderships -- one headed by him and one by Zoghbi, who was recognised by the government.</p>
<p>The release of Abou Rizk pending trial was a sign that the split was on its way to being healed, union sources told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We are ready to repeat the elections of the CGTL leadership but without the new ten votes that were imposed on us from Ministry of Labour,&quot; Yasser Nehme, a CGTL supporter of Abou Rizk, said.</p>
<p>Abou Rizk, who was seeking a second four-year term as CGTL chief, harried Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri during his first term with general strikes and demonstrations to demand better conditions for workers.</p>
<p>Abou Rizk's campaign against the government gained wide support from the opposition and he came close to winning election to parliament on a leftwing ticket last summer.</p>
