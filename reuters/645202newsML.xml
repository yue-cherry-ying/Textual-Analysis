<p>French troops opened fire in the capital of Congo Brazzaville on Saturday on government soldiers trying to loot a building housing French cooperation workers, Western military and diplomatic sources said.  </p>
<p>One source told Reuters that the French troops drove off the would-be looters and evacuated the French cooperation workers to another building. There were no casualties on the French side, the source said.</p>
<p>&quot;The out-of-control army soldiers began firing on the building but the French soldiers who were in the area drove off the looters,&quot; the source said, adding that he had no details of casualties among the Congolese soldiers.</p>
<p>Three days of clashes pitting supporters of former president Denis Sassou Nguesso against soldiers loyal to President Pascal Lissouba and other political and ethnic rivals have rocked Brazzaville, capital of the former French colony.</p>
<p>French soldiers came to Brazzaville several months ago and like U.S., British, Belgian and Portuguese troops remained on standby to evacuate foreign nationals from Kinshasa in the event of a bloodbath there during the final days of the civil war that brought Laurent NJP</p>
