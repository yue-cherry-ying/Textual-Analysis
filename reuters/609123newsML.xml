<title>INDONESIA: Indonesian rupiah steady despite campaign violence.</title>
<headline>Indonesian rupiah steady despite campaign violence.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>The Indonesian rupiah was steady against the dollar in late trading on Friday, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said volume was thin in sluggish trading as most local operators left early fearing violence on the final day of election campaign. Witnesses later reported a clash between rival political groups in a southern suburb of the capital.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no reaction because people have gone home already. There is hardly any counter party in the market,&quot; one of the only few remaining local bank dealers said.</p>
<p>One foreign bank dealer said operators had squared their positions early on Friday in anticipation of violence.  </p>
<p>Dealers said despite earlier false rumours of clashes, local operators were not pressured. They said the rupiah even strengthened briefly at midday.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was last 2,442.25/42.75 at 0945 GMT, compared with an opening of 2,440.0/42.0. Today closed at 2,440.75/41.5.</p>
<p>Dealers said liquidity was sufficient, with overnight money trading last at 10.0 percent.</p>
<p>Witnesses said police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and shots into the air to break up a fight between supporters of the United Development Party (PPP) and rivals from the ruling Golkar party in the Ciputat area of southern Jakarta.  </p>
<p>Jakarta was tense through the day, with many schools closed and a number of offices shutting down early on fears of trouble after violence between PPP and Golkar partisans earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Dealers said longer-term swap rates were edging up on foreign buying on fears that Jakarta operators might follow Thai steps to stop quoting tom/next swaps to foreigners.</p>
<p>One state bank dealer said fears of a squeeze in tom/next swaps drove swap rates up but cooled off later.  </p>
<p>&quot;They don't want to be left over with no rupiah. They just tried to accumulate some rupiah. But they seemed to reverse their perceptions later in the afternoon,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>Overnight swap was at 1.2/1.4 and spot/next at 0.6/0.8.</p>
<p>One-month swaps were at 17.0/19.0, two at 32.0/34.0, three at 44.0/48.0 and six at 86.0/89.0 points.</p>
<p>The central bank raised its intervention band by one point to 2,412/2,604 but lowered its conversion band by one point to 2,419/2,467 on Friday. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364</p>
