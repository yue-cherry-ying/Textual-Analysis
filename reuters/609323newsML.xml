<headline>Holiday stillness seizes U.S. foreign crude market.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Activity in U.S. foreign crude markets for delivery into the U.S. Gulf slowed to a nearly complete halt Friday afternoon ahead of the U.S. Memorial Day holiday, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's pre-Memorial Day sleepiness,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The North Sea market provided the only real fireworks, with Glencore's buying of a Brent cargo for June 9-11 loading at a rather pricey 17 cents premium to July Brent seen as possibly signaling some sort of posturing by Glencore.</p>
<p>&quot;They're playing a game of some kind of game to try to firm up prices,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Glencore is said to be just one cargo short of putting together an ultra large crude carrier (ULCC) for shipment to South Africa, traders said.</p>
<p>Domestically, Brent being offered into the USG was talked at a 60 cents discount to July WTI/Cushing, but only notionally, since talk was so thin.</p>
<p>Some traders said buyers would not likely show too much interest until the deltas soften to somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 cents below July WTI/Cushing since the domestic market is currently viewed as well supplied.</p>
<p>On the West African scene, a Forcados cargo for June 20-25 loading was heard done at a 22 cents premium to Dated Brent, with a European trading house doing the selling and the buyer as yet unidentified.</p>
<p>On the Latin American side, players said the outcome of Colombia state-owned Ecopetrol's latest tender for its coveted light sweet Cusiana would have to wait until next week.</p>
<p>Traders said Ecopetrol pushed the loading date back to June 22-23 after a first round of bidding for the previous June 17-18 loading window turned in bids far below the Colombian company's liking. The delay may give the pricey shipping market a chance to cool down, traders said.</p>
<p>In other Latin talk, a cargo of Colombian Cano Limon crude was heard offered at a $2.15 a barrel discount to July WTI/Cushing fob, but other traders thought that number awfully high. Talk was too thin to split those differences reliably.</p>
<p>Also, a European oil company was still reported trying to turn around a cargo of Colombian Vasconia at a $3.45 discount to July WTI/Cushing after picking it up last week at $3.60 under fob.</p>
