<p>Call it the big show that could.</p>
<p>&quot;Titanic&quot;, the least-nominated of the year's major Broadway musicals and at $10 million the most expensive, defied the naysayers on Sunday and won five Tony awards, including the coveted best musical honour.</p>
<p>Overcoming at best tepid reviews and early reports of technical problems, the operatic musical about one of the greatest disasters in maritime history also won Tonys for best book, best score, best orchestrations and scenic design.</p>
<p>But while &quot;Titanic&quot; defied the odds and won every category in which it was nominated, it had to share the evening's spotlight with &quot;Chicago,&quot; a revival of a 20-year-old musical about vampy murderesses and their circus-like trials which triumphed with six Tonys, including best musical revival, as well as awards for leads Bebe Neuwirth and James Naughton, director Walter Bobbie, choreographer Anne Reinking and Ken Bilington for best lighting.</p>
<p>Alfred Uhry's &quot;The Last Night of Ballyhoo,&quot; a comic drama about assimilationist southern Jews in 1939, was named best play. Uhry, whose only previous play was the wildly successful &quot;Driving Miss Daisy,&quot; became the first playwright to have won a Pulitzer, an Oscar (both for &quot;Miss Daisy&quot;) and a Tony.</p>
<p>The Tonys for acting in plays went to Briton Janet McTeer for her controversially manic interpretation of Nora in Ibsen's &quot;A Doll's House,&quot; which won each of the four categories in which it was nominated, and to veteran Christopher Plummer for the one-man play &quot;Barrymore,&quot; in which he portrays the late great actor John Barrymore.</p>
<p>&quot;A Doll's House&quot; was named best revival of a play, and Tonys also went to co-star Owen Teale for best featured actor and its director, Anthony Page.</p>
<p>The play's producer, Bill Kenwright, spoke in awe of his experience bringing the play, which originated in London, to Broadway.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody in London wanted it,&quot; he said of the season's most successful play, adding that it had to be staged in an &quot;out-of-the-way&quot; theatre. &quot;But we've been welcomed on Broadway like you wouldn't believe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But in many ways the evening belonged to &quot;Chicago,&quot; which has been the only show this season to win rave reviews, to consistently sell out and to clean up in the awards.</p>
<p>Director Bobbie speculated on the show's timely success, after its original run struck out, winning none of 11 Tonys for which it was nominated and having a relatively brief run.</p>
<p>&quot;So much has happened in our social and judicial history (since 1975) that it was the time to do it,&quot; he said, referring to the recent O.J. Simpson murder trial that is held up to scathing, but wildly entertaining review in &quot;Chicago.&quot;</p>
<p>The show's producers said productions of the show are now being planned for London, Vienna, Berlin and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Neuwirth, most widely known for her role as the dryly icy Lillith in the television sitcom &quot;Cheers,&quot; said her mind was a &quot;vacuum&quot; when her name was called. &quot;I had not a thought in my head. It's a very surreal experience.&quot;</p>
<p>A clearly delighted McTeer said that until four months ago, she had never seen a play on Broadway.</p>
<p>&quot;Titanic&quot;'s sweep seems certain to boost its box-office fortunes, though it remains to be seen whether it can be fashioned into a bonafide hit.</p>
<p>Producer Michael David noted that &quot;true success on Broadway is a combination of art and commerce, and we seem to have accomplished half of that -- our peers seem to think we're artful. Only time will tell if we are commercial.&quot;</p>
