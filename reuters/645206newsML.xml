<p>The Nigerian air force has flown home 250 people, mostly Nigerians affected by civil strife in Sierra Leone following a coup there two weeks ago, state-owned News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The returnees, mostly businessmen, arrived in the capital Abuja on Thursday and were handed over to unprepared officials of the national emergency relief agency, NAN said.</p>
<p>&quot;We were not aware that they were coming until about eight hours after their arrival and so we could not make prior arrangements for them,&quot; it quoted one relief official as saying.</p>
<p>The returnees have been accommodated at a youth transit camp in a suburb of Abuja and the non-Nigerians among them handed over to the local office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
<p>The coup by junior officers in Sierra Leone on May 25 toppled the elected president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, and Nigeria is in the forefront of a campaign to restore him to power.</p>
<p>But the shelling of Freetown by Nigerian gunboats in a show of force last Monday failed make an impact on the coup makers who responded by naming their own ruling council and saying they would not reinstate Kabbah.</p>
<p>Nigeria's next move is not clear but the commander of a West African force assembled in Freetown to deal with the situation is in Abuja to meet Nigerian army ruler General Sani Abacha.</p>
