<p>The parliamentary leader of the Free Democrats (FDP), Chancellor Helmut Kohl's junior coaltion partner, said the centre-right government started too late with its budget reforms, a weekly magazine reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hermann Otto Solms, a powerful FDP behind-the-scenes mover and shaker, told the news weekly Der Spiegel that differences between the FDP and Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) had the coalition walking a fine line.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in difficult territory,&quot; he said in an interview to be published on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The necessary reforms were introduced too late, too reluctantly. The coalition could not agree soon enough at the beginning of the legislative period,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The government now finds itself in the bind of trying to introduce big income tax cuts at a time when tax revenues are falling and it has to rein in the budget deficit in order to meet membership criteria for Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>One bone of contension between Kohl's CDU and the FDP is an earlier decision to cut the solidarity tax -- a surcharge on income tax bills to finance German unification -- by two percentage points.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoever retreats from lowering the solidarity surcharge breaks his promise to taxpayers. The FDP is not willing to do this,&quot; said Solms.</p>
<p>Solms also said that there was still a possibility to reach a compromise with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) on the government's tax reform bills for 1998 and 1999.</p>
<p>The SPD has rejected Bonn's plan to lower the top tax rate to 39 percent from 53 percent. Solms was not conclusive as to whether the coalition would be prepared to compromise.</p>
<p>&quot;The tax rate must come down for everyone, not just low wage earners as the SPD wants, and it must come down sharply,&quot; he said.</p>
