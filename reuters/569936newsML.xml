<p>The U.N. special representative to Afghanistan visited Kabul on Thursday to discuss the country's food shortage and the purist Islamic Taleban's policy towards women.</p>
<p>Special representative Norbert Holl said he recently visited the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, where most of the Taleban leadership is based, and met acting Foreign Minister Mullah Mohammed Ghaus.</p>
<p>Holl said Ghaus had brought up the subject of the food shortage.</p>
<p>&quot;He asked the United Nations to help overcome this food shortage, and I promised him to take action on that,&quot; said Holl, speaking at Kabul airport after a two and a half hour visit to the Afghan capital.</p>
<p>The price of wheat flour, one of the staples of the Afghan diet, has increased by more than 400 per cent since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Flour supplies to Afghanistan have been severely curtailed by a shortage in neighbouring Pakistan, the source of most of Afghanistan's supplies.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the main problems is that they have difficulties to get the food supply through Pakistan. This is a political matter,&quot; Holl said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is something that has already been discussed with the Pakistanis, which I will take up again and which will also be taken up in New York.&quot;</p>
<p>Holl said he also discussed the issue of women's education with various Taleban officials and was hopeful that in time the leadership would allow women back into education and employment.</p>
<p>The Taleban have closed girls' schools in the areas they control and have banned women from employment except in the medical sector.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to keep telling the Taleban that gender is a big issue and I am sure that there is a certain flexibility in the overall behavior of the Taleban.</p>
<p>&quot;When they tell me that in the future they will try to find some ways to accommodate girls and women in education, I am inclined to belive that. Let's give them some more time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Holl also said that despite his mission's lack of success in brokering peace in Afghanistan, he had not detected any frustration during a recent visit to the United Nations in New York.</p>
<p>&quot;I know that I have not achieved a great deal of success, nevertheless there is no sense of frustration. I think that they are happy that I am here and that I am doing the job, and they all pledged full support.&quot;</p>
