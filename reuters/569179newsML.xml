<headline>Mexico says tollway financial bailout in works.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Mexico's Communications and Transport Minister said a long-delayed program to ease the financial burden of the country's tollway companies should be ready soon, a ministry statement said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;With respect to the highway restructuring, I reiterate that they have important financing problems...but we have advanced already a great deal in negotiations and we expect that not much time will pass before we can announce a result,&quot; the ministry said in a summary of Minister Carlos Ruiz Sacristan's comments.</p>
<p>Ruiz Sacristan vowed the plan would be ready seven months ago.  </p>
<p>Indebted builders and operators, such as Empresas ICA, Tribasa and Grupo Mexicano de Desarollo, are looking forward to the long-pledged government program aimed at helping them cope with lower than expected traffic volume.</p>
<p>The companies holding highway concessions face billions of pesos in debt as the nation's financial crisis reduced freeway traffic.</p>
<p>High tolls to pay for construction costs also diverted passengers from the new roads. The 280 km (170 mile) route from Mexico City to Acapulco, built by Tribasa, costs about 300 pesos in tolls each way.</p>
<p>The government has set aside 14 billion pesos to tackle the tollways' financial woes over the next five years.</p>
<p>It also may take a stake in the tollways, built or privatized under the administration of former president Carlos Salinas.</p>
<p>Ruiz Sacristan also said the Federal Traffic Police would be removed from the ministry's jurisdiction to be an autonomous separate entity.</p>
