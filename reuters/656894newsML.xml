<title>ITALY: Second son of Italian dictator Mussolini dies.</title>
<headline>Second son of Italian dictator Mussolini dies.</headline>

<p>Vittorio Mussolini, second son of Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, died in a Rome clinic on Thursday after a long illness, Italian media reported.</p>
<p>Vittorio, 81, the third of five children, died in the afternoon at the clinic Villa del Rosario, the ANSA newsagency said. No one was available at the clinic to confirm the report.</p>
<p>His brother Romano said the funeral would take place on Saturday in Rome and he would be buried on Sunday in the family tomb at Predappio, near Forli in central Italy.</p>
<p>Vittorio was a lieutenant in the Italian air force and fought in the skies above Spain in 1936 and in the Second World War.</p>
<p>He emigrated to Argentina after the war but returned to Italy years later.</p>
<p>His brother Romano is now the last of Mussolini's children left alive. Edda Mussolini Ciano, the eldest, died in April 1995 aged 85.</p>
<p>Edda, tragic favourite child of the Italian dictator, disavowed her father and renounced the family name after he refused to stop the execution of her husband Galeazzo Ciano by a firing squad in 1944.</p>
<p>The Mussolini name retains a high profile in Italy however.</p>
<p>Vittorio's son Guido stood for parliament in general elections last year representing the neo-fascist Social Movement party, while his younger cousin Alessandra, daughter of Romano, represented the right-wing National Alliance.</p>
