<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>LIFFE wheat moved mostly higher in thin volume, helped by a weak performance from sterling against continental currencies.</p>
<p>July was most active, trading 101 lots of a total 240. It also had the biggest rise, last trading 1.50 stg higher at 90.25 stg. &quot;The old crop suddenly found a bit of life,&quot; one trader said. For much of this week the old crop has looked on its last legs.</p>
<p>The market reaction to sterling's weakness was muted, he said. &quot;I don't think people altogether believe in currency,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sterling was steady in late Europe against the mark, though off earlier highs.</p>
<p>In late trade sterling was at 2.7545/55 marks compared with 2.7670/80 late Thursday.</p>
<p>The May contract expired Friday, last trading at 87.75 stg, 0.25 lower.</p>
<p>Barley volume was limited to 11 lots. Of those, 10 were on May, which last traded unchanged at 91.00 stg.</p>
<p>Monday is a holiday in the UK, and the market re-opens on Tuesday.</p>
