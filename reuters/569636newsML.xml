<p>New Jersey Gov. Christine Whitman signed legislation Thursday implementing a $230 million bond act for port dredging approved by voters last year.</p>
<p>With cargo containers at Port Newark being unloaded in the background, Whitman said the money would be used to keep the ports open and generating what she said was $29 billion in economic activity for the state.</p>
<p>Whitman the state bond money would preserve 18,000 jobs and &quot;preserve New Jersey's reputation as an international gateway.&quot;</p>
<p>But the governor said she was worried that the federal government had not included enough funding for port dredging in its budget request, in particular for Elizabeth Channel.</p>
<p>&quot;The Elizabeth Channel needs immediate attention,&quot; Whitman said. &quot;But the federal government may not be ready to fund this work as soon as permits are issued. If that's the case, I will ask the Port Authority to draw on the $65 million in dredging funds allocated to New Jersey to dredge the Channel.&quot;</p>
<p>Whitman also said she had asked for a review of potential sites to dump dredged material, with a report due back in six months.</p>
<p>The bond authorization includes $185 million to dredge navigational channels that lead to port areas known as Reaches A, B, C and D in the Port Authority's region. That bond money would also finance the search for appropriate disposal sites.</p>
<p>Another $20 million would be used to dredge navigational channels located in the rest of the state, and $20 million more would be used to finance economic development projects in the Delaware River and Bay region.</p>
<p>The last $5 million is earmarked for decontamination technology.</p>
<p>The bond money is in addition to $130 million the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey already designated for dredging.</p>
