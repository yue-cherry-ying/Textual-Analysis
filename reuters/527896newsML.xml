<p>China on Tuesday urged senior U.S. officials not to meet the Dalai Lama during a visit to the United States this week and called the exiled Tibetan leader a puppet of Western forces aiming to split China.</p>
<p>White House spokesmen have said they welcome the Dalai Lama, Beijing's arch-rival in the battle for the loyalties of its restive Himalayan region, but have given no details on which U.S. officials he is likely to meet.</p>
<p>If U.S. leaders met the Dalai Lama it would mean Washington backed the Tibetan god-king's attempts to split the Chinese motherland and would be an interference in China's affairs, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai said.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the U.S. side can deal cautiously with the Dalai Lama's visit to the United States, in line with the long-term and essential interests of two countries,&quot; Cui told a news briefing in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;We resolutely oppose any meetings between U.S. leaders and the Dalai Lama,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama was bent on restoring feudal rule to Tibet and undoing the decades of economic growth and social progress the region enjoyed under communist rule, the official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dalai Lama's activities to split the motherland are backed by Western anti-China forces, with whom he has colluded and for whom he has been a most willing tool, in order to fulfil his political scheme,&quot; Xinhua said.</p>
<p>Foreign forces had funded the Dalai Lama in his attempts to cause political unrest in the remote mountain region, but such plots were doomed to fail, the agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;As their tool, the Dalai Lama, in spite of his... activities to split the motherland, will also come to no good end,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Beijing routinely accuses the Dalai Lama, who has lived in India since he fled Tibet in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule, of seeking independence for his Himalayan homeland.</p>
<p>The exiled spiritual leader has been the target of a string of virulent state media condemnations in recent days. His visits to other Western nations have often prompted angry responses from Beijing.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama's Washington visit is expected to pose a diplomatic dilemma for Clinton, with some analysts predicting he will risk China's wrath by arranging a high-profile meeting with the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.</p>
<p>However, when the Dalai Lama visited Washington in 1995, Clinton avoided a meeting, arranging only to &quot;drop in&quot; on a meeting between him and Vice-President Al Gore.</p>
<p>Cui said the Dalai Lama should not be considered a purely religious figure and added that China already felt it was difficult to boost the cross-Pacific relationship.</p>
<p>&quot;We think improving Sino-U.S. relations is not easy,&quot; he said, adding that efforts were needed from both sides.</p>
<p>Sino-U.S. ties have improved in recent months, culminating in a visit by Gore last month. The two sides have also agreed on an exchange of presidential visits planned for later this year and in 1998.</p>
<p>Cui did not say if the Dalai Lama's trip would affect a planned trip to Washington later this month by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who is to meet Clinton.</p>
