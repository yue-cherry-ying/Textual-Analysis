<p>The Security Council called on Monday for a much-delayed national unity government in Angola to be formed by the latest agreed date of April 11 and renewed the mandate of the 6,240-strong U.N. peacekeeping force there until April 16.</p>
<p>Establishment of a national unity government, originally scheduled for Jan. 25 but postponed several times, would mark the culmination of a 1994 accord ending nearly two decades of civil war between the government of Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA, the former rebel movement. UNITA has been largely blamed for the delays.</p>
<p>The Security Council, in its unanimous resolution, welcomed the arrival of UNITA deputies and future officials of the unity government in Luanda, the capital, &quot;although after considerable delay&quot; in the implementation of the peace accord.</p>
<p>It welcomed the &quot;decision by the government of Angola ... to install the GURN (government of unity and national reconciliation) on April 11, 1997&quot; and called on both parties &quot;to form the GURN on that date.&quot;</p>
<p>The council also called on both parties &quot;to remove all remaining obstacles to the peace process&quot; and implement without further delay its remaining military and political provisions, particularly the incorporation of UNITA soldiers into the Angolan armed forces, demobilization of those not required and the normalisation of state administration throughout the national territory.</p>
<p>The council again said it was ready to consider the imposition of trade and travel sanctions previously threatened against UNITA if the national unity government was not established by April 11.</p>
<p>The peacekeeping force, called the U.N. Angola Verification Mission III (UNAVEM III), was renewed for little more than two weeks, until April 16. It was most recently renewed for a month, until the end of March, while previous mandates have usually been for two or three months.</p>
<p>The shorter periods enable the Security Council to keep the situation under closer scrutiny.</p>
<p>The resolution praised the efforts of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, during a visit to Angola last week, to move the peace process forward. He was asked to provide a new report by April 14 on the status of the new government's installation.</p>
