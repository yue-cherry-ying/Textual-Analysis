<p>Gold explorer Helix Resources Ltd said on Friday that it had no information which could explain recent trading in its stock.</p>
<p>The company, which is closely-watched by traders and investors for its exploration drilling programme in the Gawler Craton region of South Australia, also said it had no matters of importance to announce to the market.</p>
<p>Helix shares were 12.5 cents higher at A$1.90 at 2.00 p.m. (0300 GMT) on turnover of 127,456 shares. The stock earlier this year reached a record high of A$4.99 as investors focussed on the Gawler Craton as the next big gold mining area.  </p>
<p>The stock exchange had queried Helix about the rise in its shares to A$1.95 on May 22, from A$1.48 on May 21.</p>
<p>Stock brokers said the run up in price was probably linked in part to rumours that fellow miner Acacia Resources Ltd may move to acquire Helix coupled with anticipated new drilling results soonfrom the Gawler Craton propsect.</p>
<p>Acacia holds about 19.99 percent of Helix.</p>
<p>&quot;We've made it pretty clear that we are looking to see how things unfold,&quot; Acacia corporate development manager Allan Brash told Reuters, when asked about the company's plans for its Helix stake. -- Sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800</p>
