<title>UK: Gokal given 14-year prison sentence for BCCI fraud.</title>
<headline>Gokal given 14-year prison sentence for BCCI fraud.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON</dateline>
<text>
<p>Former shipping tycoon Abbas Gokal was sentenced to 14 years in prison and fined almost 3 million pounds ($4.8 million) Thursday for his part in the crash of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the biggest banking fraud in history.</p>
<p>&quot;These frauds ... are as serious as any likely to come before these courts ... No lesser period would suffice to mark the gravity of the conduct of which you have been convicted,&quot; Judge Richard Buxton said.</p>
<p>He gave Gokal four years for conspiring to account falsely and 10 years for conspiracy to defraud. These will be served consecutively, despite a plea by defence lawyer Colin Nicholls for a concurrent sentence.</p>
<p>Buxton also ordered Gokal, the former chairman of Gulf Group, a Mideast shipping and trading company, to pay 2.94 million pounds ($4.8 million).</p>
<p>The Pakistani businessman was found guilty at London's Central Criminal Court in April, following a trial lasting nearly five months.</p>
<p>He was the fifth person to be convicted for a role in the downfall of BCCI, which collapsed in 1991 with debts of more than $12 billion after evidence emerged of widespread money laundering.</p>
<p>Gokal, 61, had been found to have masterminded, along with BCCI officials, a massive fraud totalling around $1.2 billion.</p>
