<p>French carmaker Renault said after a board meeting on Saturday it had decided to go ahead and close a Belgian factory employing around 3,000 workers, despite heavy government and trade union pressure to consider alternatives.</p>
<p>The group announced the decision in a statement issued after a meeting called by chairman Louis Schweitzer to decide the fate of the Vilvoorde assembly plant near Brussels on the basis of an independent report into plans to shut the factory on July 31.</p>
<p>&quot;The chairman indicated that the procedure with a view to closing the plant in 1997 will be pursued,&quot; a statement said.</p>
<p>A Renault spokeswoman said the planned July 31 closure date could be &quot;pushed back, perhaps to October&quot; but that the plant would be shut down this year.</p>
<p>Belgian Renault union leader Karl Gacoms, who waited outside the suburban Paris offices of Renault, said after the decision that the battle to protect jobs would go on. &quot;I believe the movement will get tougher,&quot; he told LCI television.</p>
<p>Renault's statement said the report by an outside consultant concluded that cutting working time at the Vilvoorde plant, instead of closing, was not a viable alternative.</p>
<p>Schweitzer said talks with trade unions would continue on a plan including financial compensation and offers of employment to Vilvoorde workers at factories in France, it said.</p>
<p>Renault would also ensure some form of industrial activity was continued at Vilvoorde by Renault or other companies, creating &quot;around 400 jobs&quot;. It would also try to find a buyer willing to devote the site to automobile business.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said 3,100 workers were concerned.</p>
<p>She said unions had already been informed in previous meetings with Renault management that it would be possible to offer 272 jobs in French factories to Vilvoorde employees -- 210 car worker jobs and 62 other executive or office posts.</p>
