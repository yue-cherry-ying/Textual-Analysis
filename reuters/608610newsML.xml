<p>The secessionist Bloc Quebecois is in danger of winning less than a majority of Quebec seats in the June 2 federal election, according to a poll published on Friday in the Montreal daily newspaper La Presse.</p>
<p>The May 16 to 21 survey of 1,002 Quebec voters by SOM Inc. showed Prime Minister Jean Chretien's Liberals leading the Bloc by 34 percent to 31 percent after distribution of the 25 percent of undecideds. The Conservatives had 30 percent.</p>
<p>In the 1993 federal election, the Bloc won 54 of Quebec's 75 seats with just under 50 percent of the vote in the French-speaking province. That gave the party, which advocates Quebec's separation from Canada, the second most seats in the last House of Commons.</p>
<p>The latest poll showed the Bloc losing support among francophone voters, its main constituency.</p>
<p>Among francophones, the Bloc led with 38 percent, followed by the Conservatives at 33 percent and the Liberals at 27 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very bad news for the Bloc,&quot; sociologist and poll analyst Pierre Drouilly told La Presse. &quot;For each percentage point lost, the number of (Bloc) seats will shrink.&quot;</p>
<p>The SOM poll is considered accurate to within 3.7 percentage points 19 times out of 20.</p>
<p>The Bloc campaign has struggled under new party leader Gilles Duceppe. It has been especially hurt by the surge in popularity in Quebec of Conservative leader Jean Charest, a native of the province.</p>
<p>Bloc fortunes took another blow on Thursday when Quebec's Federation of Labor, one of the province's most powerful unions, questioned if the Bloc was needed at all in Ottawa to promote Quebec separation in federal politics.</p>
<p>The SOM-La Presse poll also showed weakening support for Quebec separation, with 59 percent of respondents saying they would vote against sovereignty and 41 percent in favor.</p>
<p>The results included an apportionment of the 12 percent who said they were undecided or declined to answer. Separatists narrowly lost the October 1995 Quebec sovereignty referendum by 50.6 percent to 49.4 percent.</p>
