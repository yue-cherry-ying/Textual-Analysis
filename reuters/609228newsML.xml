<p>By Gail Appleson, Law Correspondent</p>
<p>The lead negotiator for state attorneys general in tobacco settlement talks said Friday that progress is being made and he hoped to know within two weeks whether an accord could be reached.</p>
<p>However, the negotiator, Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore, cautioned that a deal was not imminent.</p>
<p>&quot;We've completed some of our work, but have a long way to go,&quot; he said in a telephone interview. &quot;We'll know if we're going to resolve this thing in the next two weeks is what I believe. If we don't, I've got to come home and get ready for trial.&quot;</p>
<p>Tobacco stocks firmed in response to reports that negotiators were making progress. RJR Nabisco rose $1.50 to $33.375 and Phillip Morris Cos. closed at $45.375, up 62.5 cents, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;These stories have more detail than previous stories, which show that these are honest-to-goodness negotiations,&quot; said Paine Webber tobacco analyst Emanuel Goldman.</p>
<p>Moore is the lead negotiator for Mississippi and the 28 other states that have sued the tobacco industry to recoup Medicaid costs of smokers. Mississippi's trial is scheduled to begin July 7, followed by Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>In addition to the Medicaid cases, the industry is facing its first class action trial beginning June 2 in Miami. The suit is seeking damages on behalf of some 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants who allegedly contracted lung diseases and other ailments from secondhand smoke on U.S. passenger jets.</p>
<p>It is believed that the upcoming trials added to the pressure on the tobacco industry to begin negotiating with attorneys general in early April.</p>
<p>While a large meeting between the parties was held earlier this month in Dallas, talks resumed this week in New York involving only a core group of negotiators. The majority of attorneys general were given an update through a conference call on Thursday.</p>
<p>Moore said he expected the smaller group would continue to negotiate next week.</p>
<p>Recent news reports that a final settlement restricting litigation was near has drawn wide-spread criticism from anti-smoking forces. Groups from eight states issued a statement Wednesday protesting the speed and secrecy of the talks.</p>
<p>In addition public health groups are scheduled to meet Wednesday in Chicago to voice their concerns.</p>
<p>Moore denied a report in Friday's Wall Street Journal that negotiators were close to a plan that would sharply restrict the ability of current smokers to bring lawsuits.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the proposal would also make it virtually impossible for future smokers to be compensated for the most common tobacco-related illnesses, such as lung cancer.</p>
<p>&quot;The story is wrong,&quot; Moore said. &quot;The talks are about the future. The focus has been on children and public health and how to reduce smoking ... Very little time has been spent on civil liability.</p>
<p>The Journal reported that a current proposal would require smokers to try to stop smoking or enter a smoking-cessation programme before they could sue the industry. Those who failed to try to quit by 2005 would give up their right to sue.</p>
<p>Moore said smoking cessation programmes and cessation incentives will be built into any possible settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;Our top priority is to reduce teenage consumption by 50 percent in seven years. If we do that, then that will reduce adult consumption within 15 to 20 years by the same amount.&quot;</p>
<p>Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who heads a committee of attorneys general on the liability issue, said the group would never agree to a settlement that would make it virtually impossible for smokers to sue the industry.</p>
<p>He added that the group had not discussed a monetary settlement in any detail.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher, who has participated in telephone conference calls to update the suing states, said he also felt a final settlement was far from being reached.</p>
<p>&quot;Any settlement would have to make sure that they (tobacco companies) stop targeting our children and that Pennsylvania taxpayers are adequately compensated,&quot; Fisher said in an interview.</p>
<p>He said he had not heard any dollar figure yet.</p>
