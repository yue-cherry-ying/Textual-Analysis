<p>Indian cable-maker Sterlite Industries stepped into Asian debt markets on Thursday with its first-ever floating rate note launched into international markets.</p>
<p>The US$70 million notes mature in 2007 but can be put after seven years. They were launched at par to float at 130 basis points over the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate.</p>
<p>With fees, the all-in return is 138.57 basis points.</p>
<p>Union Bank of Switzerland is the lead manager.</p>
<p>Sterlite is one of a number of Indian companies planning to tap the capital markets.</p>
<p>UBS also has a mandate to arrange a US$100 million seven-year straight bond for Arvind Mills.</p>
<p>Indian Railway Finance Corp  IRLY.BO has mandated ANZ to arrange a floating rate note issue.</p>
<p>Steel Authority of India has been talking with investment banks about a fixed-rate bond.</p>
<p>Indian issuers have attracted interest lately partly because the government has moved to relax some rules on offshore borrowings, bankers said.</p>
<p>Some syndicate managers in Hong Kong said the Sterlite deal was priced too tightly, comparing it with a recent issue by CESC, the Calcutta-based power utility.</p>
<p>CESC's issue, a 10-year deal which can be put or called after seven years, paid a coupon of 150 basis points over LIBOR and an all-in of roughly 157 basis points.</p>
<p>Bankers said there is renewed speculation that India may issue a sovereign bond later this year.</p>
<p>In other news, Thailand's Robinson Department Store launched a 6.8 billion yen floating rate note issue.</p>
<p>The three-year notes were priced at par to float at 135 basis points over the six-month yen London Interbank Offered Rate. With fees, the all-in return is 176.6 basis points.</p>
<p>Development Bank of Singapore and Societe Generale Asia are lead managers.</p>
<p>A number of issuers have opted for yen financing of late. Bankers said the yen deals are attractive because the withholding tax is lower than for dollar-based transactions.</p>
<p>Swapped into dollars, the Robinson Department Store deal pays about 180 basis points, a wider spread than the company offered a year ago.</p>
<p>Thai issuers have had to pay more for their money this year in the wake of Thailand's financial problems and its downgrading by Moody's Investors Service to A3 from A2.</p>
<p>Bankers said Associates Corp's first Euro-Asian floating rate note, which was priced on Wednesday in London, attracted good interest in Asia, although European accounts were the biggest buyers.</p>
<p>The five-year notes were priced to give a discount margin of 10 basis points over LIBOR, a level deemed generous.</p>
<p>Bankers said Guangdong Enterprises will start roadshowing its 144a Yankee bond imminently. The bond reportedly will be about US$250 million and have a maturity of 10 years.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch is the lead manager, while HSBC Markets and CS First Boston are participating as co-lead managers.</p>
