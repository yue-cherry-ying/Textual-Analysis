<title>AUSTRALIA: RBA would shadow new Australia prudential body.</title>

<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said on Thursday it would have to shadow the Australian Prudential Regulation Commission (APRC) proposed by the Wallis Financial System Inquiry, effectively duplicating the APRC's work.</p>
<p>RBA Governor Ian Macfarlane told a parliamentary committee in Sydney the RBA would have to shadow the work of the APRC if it was to fulfill its responsibility for financial system stability.  </p>
<p>&quot;To do it properly, we would in a sense have to be a second supervisor,&quot; Macfarlane said, adding there was a great potential for duplication between the two.</p>
<p>The Wallis Inquiry last month recommended the creation of a single commission to supervise the prudential safety of financial institutions like banks, insurance companies, pension funds, building societies and credit unions.</p>
<p>This new single regulator, the APRC, would take over from the RBA, which regulates banks, the AFIC (Australian Financial Institutions Commission) which regulates credit unions and building societies and the ISC (Insurance and Superannuation Commission).</p>
<p>But Wallis also said the RBA must retain the final responsibility for financial system safety.</p>
<p>Macfarlane referred to the situation in Germany, where the Bundesbank employs as many people monitoring banks as does the national prudential regulator.</p>
<p>&quot;That is possible,&quot; he said, when asked if that could happen in Australia.  </p>
<p>Macfarlane however rejected claims by some, including the Commonwealth Bank of Australia managing director David Murray, that the new prudential system created the risk of U.S.-style Savings and Loans-type failures.</p>
<p>He said there was no reason why the new system would compromise the prudential safety of banks or any other financial institutions.</p>
