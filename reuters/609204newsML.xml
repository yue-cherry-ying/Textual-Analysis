<p>An Israeli-Egyptian summit next week will succeed if Israel agrees to stop building settlements for Jews on lands captured in 1967, Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said in remarks broadcast on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I would foresee a success if an agreement on a freeze on the question of settlements (would) be reached,&quot; Moussa told Israel's army radio.</p>
<p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak on Tuesday at the Egyptian Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. Egypt, partner to a 1979 treaty with Israel, hopes to break an Israel-PLO peacemaking deadlock.</p>
<p>Mubarak's senior adviser Osama el-Baz flew to Israel on Friday and held talks with Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's office said after the meeting that el-Baz would fly home on Friday and return to Israel at the beginning of next week to pave the way for the summit.</p>
<p>&quot;Saving the peace process is our duty, all of us. Saving the peace process is for the good of Israel, of the Arabs, of the Palestinians, of everybody,&quot; Moussa said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu last met Mubarak in early March. It was their third meeting since Netanyahu took office last June. Mubarak met Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in Cairo on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Asked on Friday if he expected the Sharm el-Sheikh summit to revive peace talks, Arafat said: &quot;We hope so.&quot; He told reporters during a meeting with Israeli lawmakers in Gaza that he had not been invited to join the summit.</p>
<p>Mubarak has previously proposed a six-month Israeli freeze of settlement expansion to boost peace moves. Netanyahu vows his government will press ahead with construction for Jews in the areas captured in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Palestinians say stalled talks can resume only when Israel halts work on its Har Homa settlement at the edge of East Jerusalem. Netanyahu plunged negotiations with the PLO into crisis two months ago when he broke ground on the settlement.</p>
<p>The PLO views the project -- on a hill Palestinians know as Jabal Abu Ghneim -- as an attempt to pre-empt future &quot;final status&quot; peace talks on the fate of the city where it hopes to found a capital.</p>
<p>&quot;The formula for resuming the negotiations is clear and is acceptable to all countries of the world and the parties except Mr Netanyahu, who believes he has a divine duty to resume settlement activity,&quot; Arafat's adviser Marwan Kanafani told Israel Radio in Arabic on Friday.</p>
<p>Israel says it can build where it likes in East Jerusalem, which it captured in 1967 and annexed, and says an interim peace accord with the PLO enables it to do so.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no ban in the agreement to building in Jerusalem. It's clear to all,&quot; Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said on Israel Radio on Friday.</p>
<p>Israel conditions a resumption of talks on a PLO crackdown against militants.</p>
<p>Both Moussa and Levy sounded a hopeful note ahead of the summit.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps there will be an opening. Mr Netanyahu will be bringing a new attitude, a new position which would ameliorate the situation,&quot; Moussa said.</p>
<p>Levy voiced optimism, adding: &quot;I hope that we are doing our best in order to get the process back on a constructive track.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu set a meeting with Mubarak only after news leaked on Thursday that Israeli President Ezer Weizman, whose job is largely ceremonial, had an invitation from the Egyptian leader, underscoring the peacemaking crisis facing Netanyahu's right-wing government.</p>
<p>A Gallup poll of 491 Israeli Jews for the newspaper Maariv published on Friday showed that were new elections held, Netanyahu would run neck-and-neck with former army chief Ehud Barak, the man most likely to succeed Nobel peace laureate Shimon Peres as leader of the opposition Labour party.</p>
<p>Labour is due to choose a new leader at a June 3 convention.</p>
<p>Of those surveyed, 45 percent would vote for Barak and 40 percent for Netanyahu. Fifteen percent gave no response. The poll had a 4.5 percent margin of error.</p>
