<p>President Boris Yeltsin succumbed to pressure from reformist ministers on Tuesday to delay paying wage arrears to public-sector workers, while tension flared up in separate areas on Russia's Caucasian fringe.</p>
<p>On just the second full day of his holiday in the northwestern region of Karelia, Yeltsin emerged to sign a series of important decrees on the economy, ranging from oil exports to wage debts, and was briefed by key government officials.</p>
<p>In the southern Caucasus, a period of relative calm came under threat as nine Russian police in the region of Dagestan assigned to guard the frontier with neighbouring Chechnya died when their vehicle was blown up by unknown attackers.</p>
<p>A Dagestan official said the attack was probably linked to Chechnya, from which Russian troops withdrew last year after a peace deal following a bloody two-year attempt to put down a separatist revolt.</p>
<p>Separately, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, who says Russia is trying to blockade his territory, accused Moscow of provocation after five Chechens were seized from a bus heading for Chechnya from neighbouring North Ossetia.</p>
<p>Far from the Caucasus, Yeltsin met reformist First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov and other top government officials at the Shuyskaya Chupa residence beside a lake in pine forests near Petrozavodsk, 180 km (110 miles) from the border with Finland.</p>
<p>He signed a decree saying wage arrears to the armed forces should be paid in two months, as he had wished, but that the rest of the backlog to other employees on the state payroll would be paid by January 1, 1998.</p>
<p>On Friday Yeltsin had said he wanted these other arrears to be paid by October 1.</p>
<p>&quot;In two months we cover the debt to the army and in three months more -- to the rest of the public sector,&quot; he said in televised remarks.</p>
<p>&quot;(The debt) is a disgrace for our country,&quot; said Yeltsin, recognising the threat posed by the pent-up frustrations of the millions whose wages have been delayed for periods of up to six months over the past two years.</p>
<p>Yeltsin had come under strong pressure to extend his deadline from Nemtsov and the other first deputy prime minister, Anatoly Chubais.</p>
<p>Nemtsov, feeling clearly at ease, told Yeltsin that only a date of January 1 was realistic.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not want to mislead the people,&quot; he said, adding the government had worked round the clock to prepare the plan.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is young and can do without sleep,&quot; Nemtsov, 37, added with a laugh.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Yeltsin as saying during the meeting that &quot;we must determine ways to find finances...how we can cut spending and increase revenues, where to use borrowing, the sale of property and securities&quot;.</p>
<p>Chubais has said the wage backlog to the armed forces alone is more than five trillion roubles.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry's press service said on Tuesday that the central government's debt to those working in federal institutions was 7.7 trillion roubles while the overall debt of regional authorities amounted to 25.6 trillion. It was not clear if these figures included the debt to the armed forces.</p>
<p>News agencies said Yeltsin also signed decrees on production sharing, which covers the rights if foreign investors, and on oil industry debts to the state budget. The latter document also covered quotas on oil sales.</p>
<p>No details were immediately avaliable but Interfax quoted Yeltsin as saying both documents were &quot;of global importance&quot;. He added the decree on oil was &quot;a real blow against banditry&quot;.</p>
<p>Nemtsov was quoted as saying the new rules were aimed at making it impossible &quot;for crooks to do nothing but earn money&quot;. ($=5,791 roubles)</p>
