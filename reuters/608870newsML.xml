<p>The zloty began a cautious recovery after Thursday foreign selling as foreigners stayed on the sidelines on Friday and banks expected the central bank to intervene if the zloty fell any further, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said trade was volatile but mostly among Polish players, some of whom were buying currency to cover positions shortened yesterday by foreign purchases and others buying the zloty because at current lows they saw it as a bargain.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreigners are absent and the central bank is checking rates so traders expect it could step in and the zloty is rising,&quot; said Andrzej Rzysko, chief dealer at Societe Generale.  </p>
<p>At 0905 GMT the zloty was at 0.84/0.53 above the parity rate, up from 0.64/0.50 percent at the opening. It was at 3.2050/150 zlotys to the dollar and 1.8960/020 to the mark against 3.2220/3.2330 and 1.8973/8994 at opening respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;At such lows, unjustified by the very good fundamentals, the zloty is a bargain and it is only a matter of time when investors start buying it again,&quot; a dealer at a foreign bank here said.</p>
<p>The zloty's almost two-percent drop on Thursday against the basket of currencies was caused by the Czech crown crisis which for many foreign investors cast a shadow over the whole region.  </p>
<p>On the money market overnight and tomorrow/next rates held flat at 21.60/21.90 percent despite a 500 million zloty reverse repo and 150 million zloty 91-day NBP-bill sale offer.</p>
