<title>UK: OPEC freeze talk and quota warnings help oil prices.</title>
<headline>OPEC freeze talk and quota warnings help oil prices.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Signs that OPEC is preparing to freeze its production ceiling at its meeting next month and calls to tackle quota-busting helped steady oil prices on Thursday.</p>
<p>But traders warned that a failure to move quickly against members who overproduce would store up trouble for prices in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;They must address overproduction soon or the price will almost certainly fall,&quot; said Bob Finch, head trader of Vitol SA, the world's largest independent oil trading and refining company.</p>
<p>World benchmark Brent crude oil for June delivery closed up 53 cents at $18.67 a barrel on Thursday, boosted by a strong technical rally led by U.S. traders.</p>
<p>Earlier the market gained a few cents when the president of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Abdullah Salem al-Badri, said he expected the group to stick to its 25.03 million barrel per day (bpd) ceiling.</p>
<p>Kuwaiti oil minister Isa al-Mazeedi sent a warning to OPEC members who flout their output quotas saying they should stick by official allocations or risk a further fall in oil prices, which have shed almost $7 a barrel since the turn of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Self-discipline is still exercised by a few key members but if this discipline is not maintained I don't dare speculate what prices will do,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Al-Badri, also Libya's oil minister, said demand was not strong enough to support any increase in the 11-member cartel's output, which reached 27.05 million bpd in April, according to a &quot;We are overproducing, yes, but I have contacted everyone and I hope we will have cooperation,&quot; he told Reuters while attending a conference in Iran.</p>
<p>Oil traders said a rollover in June would have little market impact unless the group managed to solve the almost intractable problem of rampant overproduction which has lifted supply more than two million bpd above its self-imposed ceiling.</p>
<p>Seven OPEC ministers have scheduled talks on Thursday in the central Iranian city of Isfahan, where they were attending an oil and gas conference, to discuss quota-busting but concrete proposals seemed as distant as ever.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly recognising a problem exists is part of the battle but it will be interesting to see whether this meeting under the roof of a hard-line state might exert a little discipline,&quot; said Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at brokers Smith, Barney in London.</p>
<p>Rising exports from Iraq, which returned to the world oil market in a limited capacity last December under a United Nations $2 billion oil-for-food exchange, and accelerating output growth at new foreign company operated fields would make any restraint extremely difficult, traders said.</p>
<p>And the mechanics of an agreement to narrow the gap between actual output and the ceiling would be near-impossible.</p>
<p>&quot;Proportional cuts based on current output are the only realistic possibility, yet agreeing these encourages and rewards quota-breaking,&quot; said Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at UBS Global Research.</p>
<p>&quot;The second problem is that even if OPEC did manage to agree cuts, this would stimulate non-OPEC supply, further reducing demand for OPEC oil.&quot;</p>
<p>Without OPEC action, analysts predicted prices will resume this year's downtrend towards the end of June, undermined by higher crude production, a seasonal slowdown in demand and a surge in stocks, currently rising by as much as two million bpd.</p>
<p>With the U.N. widely expected to renew the Iraqi sales agreement for another six months when it expires on June 7, oil markets can look forward to even higher volumes from Baghdad as the value of its barrels fall.</p>
<p>Any signs the U.N. may be able to overcome U.S. opposition to Iraq's request for an increase in the $2 billion cash ceiling could provoke a price slide much sooner.</p>
<p>&quot;This battle will heat up during May and might provoke a few jitters in the market, especially if the pro-Iraqi coalition including France, China and Russia appears to succeed,&quot; said Washington-based consultants Petroleum Finance Co.</p>
