<p>President Bill Clinton said on Tuesday he told Iraq religion should not be used to evade international obligations but gave no indication the United States would retaliate for Baghdad's defiance of a &quot;no-fly&quot; zone to transport pilgrims.</p>
<p>&quot;My message is that we support people in exercising their religiouis liberties and in living out their religious convictions everywhere in the world ... But we don't want to see religion in effect used and distorted in a way to try to avoid international obligations,&quot; Clinton told reporters.  </p>
<p>&quot;We intend to continue to observe the no-fly zone and continue to support the embargo until he (Iraqi President Saddam Hussein) lives up to the conditions of United Nations resolutions,&quot; Clinton said in a brief exchange with reporters as he left on a trip to observe flooded areas of North Dakota.</p>
<p>He had been asked whether he had &quot;a message&quot; for Saddam in light of Baghdad's decision to enter a no-fly zone imposed by Gulf War allies after the 1991 conflict and send helicopters to the border with Saudi Arabia to pick up Moslems returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>
<p>The move raised a question as to whether the United States would attempt some sort of retribution for the defiance. Its allies in the Gulf War have taken a more flexible stance on such issues in recent times and have been less insistent than Washington on strict enforcement of post-war sanctions.</p>
