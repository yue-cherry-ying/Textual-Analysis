<p>The Chinese yuan closed little changed in very slow trading at 8.2908 on Saturday from Friday's 8.2906 against the U.S. dollar with a holiday mood dominating the market, traders said.</p>
<p>The weighted average price on Friday was 8.2908.</p>
<p>The exchange will close from Sunday to Tuesday to mark the Chinese takeover of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Traders said few people wanted to trade in any serious volume on the last day ahead of the three-day holiday.  </p>
<p>The yuan opened at an intraday high of 8.2905 and moved in a very narrow range of 8.2906 and 8.2910 for most of the session, hitting a low of 8.2952. Most business was done at 8.2908, traders said.</p>
<p>One trader said neither buyers nor sellers wanted to push the rate sharply either way due to the forthcoming holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;A small amount of buying emerged at about the 8.2910 level, making the yuan move at a high level,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the yuan to move just below the 8.2900 level next Wednesday when the market resumed trading.  </p>
<p>The yuan closed up at 7.2331 from 7.2951 against 100 Japanese yen and higher at an intraday high of 1.0690 from 1.0706 against the Hong Kong dollar.</p>
