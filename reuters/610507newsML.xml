<title>AUSTRALIA: Australia's Packer tops rich list, again.</title>
<headline>Australia's Packer tops rich list, again.</headline>

<p>Australian media baron Kerry Packer has again topped his country's rich list, boosting his personal fortune to a peerless A$3.9 billion.</p>
<p>Packer, whose media empire owns Australia's biggest commercial television network and a stable of magazines, is now worth more than twice his nearest rival in the seriously rich stakes, according to figures published on Friday.</p>
<p>Australia's second richest, Frank Lowy, chairman of shopping centre group Westfield Holdings Ltd, is worth A$1.4 billion, Business Review Weekly magazine said in its annual &quot;Rich 200&quot; edition.</p>
<p>Packaging magnate Richard Pratt ranked a close third with A$1.3 billion.</p>
<p>But Packer is peerless, accounting for almost 10 percent of the total fortune of A$40.6 billion amassed by the richest 200.</p>
<p>In the past year, he has added another A$600 million, or A$1.6 million a day, to his personal wealth, the magazine said.</p>
<p>Packer's soaring fortunes mainly reflects the steadily climbing share price of his Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, which has risen 26 percent over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>A high-rolling gambler, the 59-year-old billionaire has also made some quick profits on the green felt of casino tables.</p>
<p>In just 20 minutes at the Mirage casino in Las Vegas this year, Packer won 20 straight hands of baccarat at A$250,000 a throw, Business Review Weekly said.</p>
<p>But Packer is still a minnow compared with the world's richest men, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, U.S. investment guru Warren Buffett and Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of oil-rich Brunei.</p>
<p>Gates' fortune was last estimated at US$18 billion, ahead of Buffett on US$15.3 billion, according to Forbes magazine.</p>
<p>Asia's richest man, the Sultan of Brunei, is said to be worth an estimated A$30 billion, The Australian newspaper said in February.</p>
<p>Packer is also lagging behind his great Australian-born media rival, Rupert Murdoch.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Business Journal this week's estimated Murdoch's worth at US$3.2 billion, making him the wealthiest person in southern California and marginally richer than Packer.</p>
