<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin, holidaying for the first time at a lakeside residence in the northwestern region of Karelia, is having a successful fishing trip, his wife Naina said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;On the first day they caught next to nothing. Perhaps the fish were scared away,&quot; Naina said in televised remarks.</p>
<p>&quot;But yesterday I think they caught about 20. Some were very small but still very tasty. I think the water is very good here,&quot;.</p>
<p>Yeltsin and his wife arrived on Sunday at the Shuyskaya Chupa residence in a pine forest near the Karelian capital Petrozavodsk, 180 km (110 miles) from the border with Finland.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said the residence, labelled the &quot;President Hotel&quot; by local journalists, had angling facilities and an indoor tennis court.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no problems for the president with fishing,&quot; a local fishing official told Tass on Sunday, adding that Karelia had 62,000 lakes and 11,000 rivers.</p>
<p>Yeltsin is a passionate fisherman and hunter and a doctor has said his shooting at his residence near Moscow complicated preparations for his heart surgery last year. The weapon's recoil affected his chest, the doctor said.</p>
<p>A Karelian hunting official told Tass that hunting for most types of the game was prohibited at this time of the year, but wild boar was a possibility.</p>
<p>Tass quoted Naina as saying on Tuesday she was not allowing the 66-year-old Kremlin leader to play tennis.</p>
<p>Yeltsin was a keen tennis player before he was struck down with heart disease last year, but he has not returned to the game despite his apparent recovery from a multiple heart bypass last November.</p>
