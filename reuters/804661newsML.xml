<p>Few people turned out on Sunday for a one-day campaign to clean up Lebanon's badly polluted Mediterranean beaches, organisers said.</p>
<p>Volunteers taking part in the campaign to clear the 210-km (130-mile) shoreline of rubbish said they were bitterly disappointed at the poor turnout.</p>
<p>They had been hoping thousands would pitch in and help.</p>
<p>&quot;I am shocked because we were expecting more than 25,000 people to take part, but it ended up with few tens here and there,&quot; said Elie Aoun, leader of volunteer team at Nahr al-Moutt, east of Beirut.</p>
<p>&quot;It's because people still do not feel that they are concerned in cleaning their shore,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Environmental groups and other non-governmental bodies organised the campaign with sponsorship from the environment ministry and help from the embassies of several other Mediterranean countries in Lebanon.</p>
<p>&quot;People are convinced that if they do clean the seashore today it will be full of garbage the next day,&quot; said Rania Korban, a volunteer at Ramlet al-Baida in West Beirut.</p>
