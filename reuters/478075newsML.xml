<p>Barring an extremely weak March employment report on Friday, the days of the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yielding below 7.0 percent are behind us for the foreseeable future, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>Rather, they added, it appears as if the bond -- at 7.10 percent on Tuesday afternoon -- is marching toward 7.25 percent, then higher, to yields not seen in about two years.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in the early stages of a long-term bear market,&quot; said Richard Suttmeier, president and technical trader at Global Market Consultants. &quot;People aren't realizing that yet.  </p>
<p>&quot;People are still under the assumption that we are still in a bull market and that dips are meant to buy,&quot; Suttmeier said.</p>
<p>Technical analysts noted that the market was in pretty bad shape, with Treasuries deemed oversold.</p>
<p>Until Friday's jobs data, though, the bond was seen sticking to a 7.07- to 7.12-percent range.</p>
<p>&quot;If we get a strong number, we would test the old highs&quot; of 7.20 to 7.25 percent, said John &quot;Rocket&quot; Spinello, government securities strategist and managing director of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co Inc.  </p>
<p>&quot;If we get friendly, non-farm payrolls, less than a 220,000 rise and no bad wages, I think we could stage a bit of a rally&quot; back near 7.0 percent, Spinello said.</p>
<p>Still, he acknowledged, the trend is &quot;to higher yields.&quot;</p>
<p>Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have grown by 182,000 in March, with the unemployment rate dipping to 5.2 percent and average hourly earnings up 0.4 percent, according to a Reuters poll.</p>
<p>Should bond yields rise to 7.25 percent, it would be the highest level since the close of business on May 3, 1995, which at that time, marked an 11-month low.  </p>
<p>The bellwether yield had been as high as 7.15 percent on a closing basis on September 6, and 7.19 percent on July 8. On Tuesday morning, the bond climbed as high as 7.13 percent -- but only for a brief moment.</p>
<p>&quot;It's safe to say that we are in a nine-month trading range: July to April,&quot; Merrill's Spinello added.</p>
<p>But the odds of breaking out of that range sometime soon look good.</p>
<p>Ronald Daino, technical trader at Smith Barney Inc, put the chance of a 7.25 percent bond at 40 percent, with a 30 percent shot at it rising to 7.50 to 7.60 percent.  </p>
<p>He noted that there was no specific time period. &quot;The direction is the important thing,&quot; Daino said.</p>
<p>Suttmeier, however, predicted that the bond yield would jump to 7.34 percent in three to five weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;If payrolls are negative (for the market) we'll get to 7.34 percent sooner rather than later,&quot; he said, noting that a friendly report would delay reaching that target somewhat.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the curve, technicans see the 10-year note rising to 7.09 percent when the bond reaches 7.25 percent, the five-year note at 6.90 percent and the two-year at 6.50 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The key level to hold is 6.76 percent on the two-year note in the longer term,&quot; Suttmeier said. &quot;If that ever gives way, the market will anticipate more than a 6.0 percent federal funds rate.&quot;</p>
