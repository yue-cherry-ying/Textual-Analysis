<p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said on Monday the country saw &quot;a few promising moves&quot; in the human rights field last year but little change in the general situation.</p>
<p>&quot;There are marginal differences, in some areas for better and in some areas for worse,&quot; HRCP chairperson Asma Jahangir told a news conference in Islamabad while releasing the commission's report for 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The ills of 1996 were mostly the same as of 1990 (when the commission wrote its first report) and they loomed nearly as large,&quot; an introduction to the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;There were indeed a few promising moves during 1996,&quot; it said, citing reduced violence in the port city of Karachi, the judiciary's assertion of independence, wider public awareness of bonded farm labour in the southern province of Sindh and of child labour, and ratification of a U.N. convention on eliminating discrimination against women.</p>
<p>All these advances occurred when former prime minister Benazir Bhutto was in power. But the HRCP report said two notable initiatives were taken by the caretaker government set up by President Farooq Leghari after he sacked Bhutto in November on disputed charges of misrule.</p>
<p>&quot;One was the extension of the adult franchise to three million people of tribal areas (bordering Afghanistan) and the other was the promulgation of a rather cautious Freedom of Information Ordinance,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The year was thus not altogether misspent,&quot; it said. But it added &quot;The bleakness, however, remained predominant.&quot;</p>
<p>The rule of law was plagued by a series of problems including threats to life and property, excesses by the police, and difficulties of access to justice through courts, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Religious and sectarian intolerance still kept renting the national fabric. Discrimination and violence against women and against religious minorities were as much a matter of routine now as in the past.</p>
<p>&quot;Obligations in the sector of education and health continued in the main to be recognised as important in principle but unaffordable in practice,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;And governance remained stricken by its perennial maladies, even to the extent of both the first and this latest survey reporting the same extreme step of an elected government being dismissed and a parliament with a popular mandate being dissolved midway through their tenure, and much on identical charges.&quot;</p>
<p>This was a reference to the dismissal of governments led by Bhutto, first in 1990 and again in 1996.</p>
