<p>Protests against a proposed base metals mine in northern Wisconsin have escalated with 29 environmentalists held in jail on Tuesday for refusing orders to disperse, police said.</p>
<p>Monday's demonstrations were organized by the environmental group Earth First!, which is known for confrontational tactics, against the proposed Crandon Mining Co. project, a joint venture of mining giants Exxon Coal and Minerals Co. and Toronto-based Rio Algom Ltd.</p>
<p>The protesters were arrested at the proposed mine site and outside the company's office in Crandon and held on charges that included unlawful assembly, trespassing and disorderly conduct, the Forest County sheriff's office said. Initial court hearings were scheduled for Wednesday.</p>
<p>No arrests were made at a separate demonstration in Rhinelander, 25 miles from Crandon and 110 miles north of Green Bay.</p>
<p>Crandon Mining has applied for state and local permits to extract tons of zinc, lead and copper from a tract of land near the headwaters of the Wolf River, which is prized for its fishing, whitewater rafting and scenic beauty. State approval was seen is expected to take at least 18 months.</p>
<p>The mine would be the largest mining operation to open in environmentally conscious Wisconsin, where copper mining has only recently become viable again.</p>
<p>More protests at the proposed mine could occur this week, said Susan Franz, a member of Earth First!, which held its first Midwest meeting over the holiday weekend in the nearby Nicolet National Forest, drawing about 160 people.</p>
<p>Mining company officials said they would comply with Wisconsin's strict pollution laws. &quot;If we don't, we won't get our permits,&quot; said Dick Diotte, a Crandon Mining spokesman. ((Chicago newsdesk 312 408 8720))</p>
