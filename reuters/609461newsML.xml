<p>The European Union on Friday exuded confidence that it would sign a treaty shaping Europe for the 21st century on schedule at an Amsterdam summit in three weeks' time.</p>
<p>Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, rounding off a one-day informal meeting of EU leaders, brushed aside concern about outstanding differences within the 15-nation group and stressed that significant progress had been made in the talks.</p>
<p>&quot;The atmosphere was excellent,&quot; Kok said, summing up the meeting in the Dutch coastal resort of Noordwijk. &quot;Basically the message was that everybody wants Amsterdam to be a success. A good deal of progress has been made.&quot;</p>
<p>European Commission president Jacques Santer said: &quot;I am leaving with the absolute conviction that all those represented here have the firm aim of reaching an agreement in Amsterdam.&quot;</p>
<p>The leaders, due to sign far-reaching treaty reforms in Amsterdam on June 16-17 after a 15-month inter-governmental conference (IGC), drummed home the message of a &quot;People's Europe&quot;, creating jobs, free movement and a better environment.</p>
<p>The new treaty is intended to restyle Europe to absorb up to a dozen ex-communist states. It will effectively rewrite the bloc's &quot;constitution&quot;, paving the way for a more efficient and open Union.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be a Europe enabling people to live a full life...a People's Europe,&quot; said Irish Prime Minister John Bruton.</p>
<p>Yet the mood of optimism, in part triggered by the arrival of a more pro-European British government, risked being dashed by a squabble over the balance of power in an expanded Union.</p>
<p>While there is broad agreement that the bloc must make itself more accessible to its 370 million citizens through moves to promote job creation, workers' and consumers' rights and the environment, there were signs of a rift over how to balance power between small and large states in the bloc.</p>
<p>Some leaders want to scale back ambitions for a bold new step towards political union, arguing that a new treaty should simply ensure that the Union works over the next few years -- by increasing majority voting and streamlining EU institutions.</p>
<p>France and Germany suggested boosting the voting power of the bloc's larger countries at the expense of the smaller ones and French President Jacques Chirac initially urged his partners to halve to 10 the number of European commissioners.</p>
<p>But this was dismissed by countries such as Luxembourg and Ireland, among the bloc's most vociferous defenders of small countries' rights. Under a compromise proposal, the Commission would be limited to 20 commissioners -- what it has now.</p>
<p>The summit, however, was dominated by Tony Blair, who breezed in to his debut among Europe's elder statesmen and caught the imagination of diplomats and media with his message of a positive and constructive British role in the bloc.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, portrayed as Blair's puppet master in a British election campaign advert by the ousted Conservatives, was warm. &quot;There is no question at all that the British government has made clear that Britain is a part of Europe and wants to help in shaping it,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;There is without doubt a noticeable change towards the building of Europe in the new British approach,&quot; Chirac said, while others waxed lyrical about &quot;a new atmosphere&quot;.</p>
<p>Blair's message of changing Europe was well received and swiftly picked up by other leaders more used to lengthy and tortured negotiation on the niceties of institutional reform.</p>
<p>&quot;If Europe is to have support amongst the people of Europe, then it has to be a Europe that is clearly focused on the things that matter to them,&quot; the Labour leader said, giving prominence to jobs, competitiveness, environmental protection and consumer rights.</p>
<p>EU diplomats said the leaders were determined to settle thorny internal issues like the size of a future Commission and a re-weighting of votes in the decision-making process in the run-up to Amsterdam so that the summit could focus on the grander ideals of bringing Europe to its citizens.</p>
