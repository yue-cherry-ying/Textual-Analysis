<p>Police and Roman Catholic rioters clashed across Northern Ireland on Monday in a wave of violence prompted by a Protestant Orange order march in the town of Portadown.</p>
<p>The display of firepower by the Irish Republican Army in overnight unrest was the biggest in years and the outpouring of nationalist fury appeared to mark the end of any honeymoon with Britain's new Labour government.</p>
<p>A bomb was thrown at a Belfast police station and a 14-year-old boy was in critical condition in hospital after being hit on the head by a plastic bullet. Another 14-year-old boy suffered gunshot wounds to the shoulder. Dozens more were injured as the unrest sread.</p>
<p>Security forces and rioters traded gunfire in a night of rioting and unrest that dealt a serious blow to Northern Ireland's stalled peace process.</p>
<p>Unrest was reported in Belfast, Newry, Strabane, Londonderry and Portadown.</p>
<p>Rioting followed a march through a Roman Catholic area of Portadown by the hardline pro-British Protestant Orange Order despite protests by Irish nationalist residents.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political arms, denied it was resposible for provoking the unrest despite comments by one of its senior figures urging Catholics to take to the streets,</p>
<p>&quot;The events that we saw over the past 24 hours were provoked by the shameful decision of the British government to capitulate to the Orange Order's demands to march through nationalist areas where there is fear and trepidation at their presence,&quot; Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said.</p>
<p>&quot;The nationalist community have become stronger politically and numerically and the Unionists are afraid to negotiate or to manage the change,&quot; he said on BBC radio.</p>
<p>David trimble, leader of the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party, said the IRA had been planning violence.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that came out very clearly last night, with the clearly prepared reaction that the IRA orchestrated throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>In one of worst incidents, what was believed to be a hand-held blast bomb was thrown against the New Barnsley police station in North Belfast.</p>
<p>The explosion echoed around the city centre shortly after midnight as cars were hijacked and set on fire.</p>
<p>The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility in a statement to a news organisation for the shooting on Sunday of a policewoman in a police vehicle. She was hospitalised with facial injuries.</p>
<p>The IRA, which enjoys support among some sections of the 40 per cent Catholic minority, is fighting a 28-year war to end British rule of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The crackle of automatic gunfire was heard in various parts of the city throughout Sunday night and into the early hours of Monday morning.</p>
<p>Police said in one incident a volley of shots was fired at police patrol in the Crumlin area of Belfast.</p>
<p>In another, five high-velocity rounds were fired at police in the Springfields area of Catholic West Belfast, while 20 rounds were fired at police in the nationalist Old Park area.</p>
<p>Police and ambulance sirens wailed intermittently across the Northern Ireland capital as security and rescue forces rushed from flashpoint to flashpoint, residents said.</p>
<p>Two &quot;spy-in-the-sky&quot; security force helicopters clattered over the capital keeping watch as the demonstrations spread from Catholic neighbourhoods around the city.</p>
<p>Youths burned hijacked cars to draw in police and troops before pelting them with petrol bombs.</p>
