<p>United Nations agricultural and food aid experts called on rich countries on Monday to step up global efforts to stop huge chunks of the earth's surface from being turned into wasteland.</p>
<p>Senior officials from the U.N.'s Rome-based International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), World Food Programme and Food and Agriculture Organisation marked the third international day to combat desertification with an appeal for urgent action.</p>
<p>&quot;Even as we meet, more dry lands on our planet are turning into unproductive wastelands,&quot; IFAD chairman Fawzi al-Sultan told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said a 1994 Convention to Combat Desertification, which was drawn up in the wake of the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992 and took force last December, showed the international community was committed to fighting the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;But commitment is not enough. For the Convention to be effective this commitment must be translated into immediate action at both the economic and operating level,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;While developing countries are called upon to work out effective national action programmes, developed countries must increase efforts in support of this process.&quot;</p>
<p>Bahman Mansuri, director of IFAD's economic policy and resource strategy department, said the U.N. estimated that an area of fertile land equivalent to the size of Ireland was being lost every year at an annual cost of $9-12 billion.</p>
<p>He said many programmes were already under way -- IFAD has invested more than $3 billion in dryland areas since it was set up in 1978 -- but was concerned at the level of assistance from developed countries.</p>
<p>&quot;One would expect more readiness on the part of developed countries in shouldering the responsibility of financing,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;There's a feeling that they're still sitting on the fence.&quot;</p>
<p>The 115 signatories of the Convention are due to gather for the first time in Rome from September 29 to October 10 to work out strategies for where to go from here.</p>
<p>Corrado Clini, director-general of the Italian environment ministry, said the meeting would not be just a talking shop.</p>
<p>&quot;The international signatories have recognised that desertification is a global environmental problem. That's a major change to the previous approach which considered it to be a local problem,&quot; he told the news conference.</p>
<p>More than 40 percent of the earth's land area consists of drylands at risk from desertification, IFAD said.</p>
<p>The problem was at its most acute in Africa but even developed countries, such as the United States, Australia and southern European states, were suffering loss of productive land, according to the U.N. group.</p>
<p>&quot;The responsibility for fighting desertification is global,&quot; Mansuri said, adding that he hoped that innovative sources of finance could now be opened up, such as debt swaps or taxes.</p>
