<p>Some 300 Japanese legislators from both the ruling and opposition camps set up a non-partisan league on Friday to urge parliament to start discussions on revising the country's 1947 pacifist constitution.</p>
<p>The league comprises members of parliament from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) as well as those from opposition parties Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), Shinshinto splinter Taiyoto and the liberal Minshuto (Democratic Party).</p>
<p>The league's aim is to establish a standing parliamentary committee on constitutional issues rather than to propose revising the constitution, league officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The group will not directly propose actual revisions to the constitution,&quot; a league official said. &quot;Our aim is primarily to found a parliamentary forum where legislators can freely discuss this important issue.&quot;</p>
<p>League chairman Taro Nakayama, a former foreign minister, told a news conference: &quot;We aim to address all questions about the gap between reality and the constitution.&quot;</p>
<p>No members of the Socialist party or the Japan Communist Party joined the league. Asked about the absence of the leftists, Nakayama said: &quot;They're still in the Cold War mould.&quot;</p>
<p>Discussing possible revisions to the U.S.-drafted constitution has long been taboo in Japan because of concerns that a revision would revive pre-war militarism.</p>
<p>At the centre of the controversy is Article 9, which bans Japan from using military force to settle international disputes.</p>
<p>Successive Japanese governments have maintained that the article also prohibits Japan from taking part in collective security arrangements, such as the U.S.-led coalition which defeated Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past, constitutional revision was automatically equated with an about-face in the country's security policy, but we would like to see the league take up all aspects of the constitution and not just Article 9,&quot; LDP Secretary-General Koichi Kato said.</p>
<p>&quot;This league means there is a mood in the country that seeks discussion on constitutional matters without making these presumptions,&quot; Kato told a news conference.</p>
<p>Amending Japan's constitution would need a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament as well as approval by a simple majority in a nationwide referendum.</p>
