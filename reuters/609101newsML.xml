<p>Singapore police said on Friday they have arrested a Filipina maid on suspicion of murdering her sister-in-law.</p>
<p>A police spokesman told Reuters the woman had been remanded in custody for psychiatric examination and would appear in court again on June 13.</p>
<p>He said investigators were accompanied by a Philippine diplomat to the scene of the crime and the two sides were cooperating closely. He declined to comment on why the psychiatric examination was ordered.</p>
<p>The Philippine embassy declined comment, but sources close to the case said both sides were treating it with the utmost caution because it raised memories of the furore caused by the execution in Singapore in 1995 of Filipina maid Flor Contemplacion.</p>
<p>That execution, for the murder of a young Singaporean boy in her care and a fellow maid, brought the two countries close to a break in relations. Many Filipinos remain adamant Contemplacion was innocent.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Flor, part two,&quot; said one source close to the case who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>Both the Philippines and Singapore withdrew their envoys after Contemplacion's execution and relations were only restored last year.</p>
<p>The sources said police arrested a 33-year-old maid from Cagayan province in the northern Philippines on Thursday for the murder of fellow maid Anita Fuggan.</p>
<p>They declined to name the detained woman, who faces a mandatory death sentence if charged and convicted of first degree murder.</p>
<p>&quot;The doctors are talking to her, not the police. It looks like she is an undocumented (illegal) worker who could not deal with the stress of working here,&quot; said one source.</p>
<p>The woman came to Singapore last month to work as a maid and did not have a work permit to do so, the sources said.</p>
<p>They said police found Fuggan, who had worked legally in Singapore for three years, lying on the floor with head and abdominal injuries.</p>
<p>This latest case comes as the two countries are preparing for a visit to Manila by Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong within the next two months.</p>
<p>Goh was originally scheduled to visit the Philippines in 1995 but the trip was cancelled after Contemplacion's hanging.</p>
<p>The execution so enraged Filipinos they burned thousands of Singaporean flags and marched on Singapore's embassy in Manila.</p>
<p>Philippine President Fidel Ramos and Goh patched up the row on the sidelines of a regional summit in December 1995.</p>
<p>One source familiar with the new case said the Philippines might ask Singapore's permission to bring in its own pathologist to help out in the investigation.</p>
<p>In the Contemplacion case, Singapore and Filipino pathgologists reached sharply different conclusions about how the maid and the boy were killed.</p>
<p>The Filipinos said the maid whom Contemplacion was accused of killing could only have been strangled by a man. Singapore disagreed. U.S. pathologists who were called in to conduct their own tests sided with the Singaporean conclusions.</p>
