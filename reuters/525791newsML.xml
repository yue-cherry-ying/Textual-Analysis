<p>India's ambassador to Saudi Arabia said on Monday 179 Indians were still missing after a fire that killed over 300 Moslem haj pilgrims last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Some 179 are missing and 123 are injured,&quot; Mohammad Hamad Ansari told Reuters by telephone from the kingdom. &quot;The injured figure is constantly changing because we keep coming up with more and more information.&quot;</p>
<p>Ansari said there was still no exact figure for the number of Indians killed in the fire, which swept through a key pilgrimage site near the Moslem holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This is exactly what we are really anxious to find out,&quot; he said. About 80,000 Indians performed the haj this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Our teams in Mecca are doing a head count room by room, building by building,&quot; he said. &quot;We know exactly where the people are staying in Mecca. We are also going around mortuaries and hospitals as well. In mortuaries the situation is more difficult because of charred bodies.&quot;</p>
<p>Witnesses said many victims were burned, others suffocated from fumes while some were crushed by a stampede. Saudi Arabia has said 343 people died and over 1,500 were injured.</p>
