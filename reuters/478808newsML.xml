<p>Human rights activists called for new curbs on police brutality on Tuesday after Brazilian television showed Sao Paulo police officers beating drivers at a roadblock and firing at a car, allegedly killing a passenger.</p>
<p>Activists said the footage, aired on Globo television on Monday night, supported their claims that urban police violence against innocent civilians was rampant in Brazil. &quot;This kind of stuff happens all the time,&quot; said James Cavalaro, the Brazilian representative of Human Rights Watch. &quot;However, what is different in this case is that it is down on film.&quot;</p>
<p>A Sao Paulo police spokesman said nine officers were arrested pending charges after the video was aired. The amateur video showed military police setting up a roadblock ostensibly to check identity papers and car documents in a hunt for drug traffickers.</p>
<p>The footage, taped in the early hours of March 3 and March 7, showed the leader of the police operation hitting drivers and passengers of stopped cars with his baton and strolling around with a gun in his hand. One man was beaten and taken behind a wall. A few minutes later, a shot was heard. Globo said the man was seriously wounded but survived.</p>
<p>On another night the video showed officers at a roadblock in the same place allegedly extorting money from innocent drivers. After beating up the occupants of one car, an officer was filmed firing twice into the back of the vehicle after it drove away. Globo said a passenger was hit and later died at a hospital.</p>
<p>The Globo report, which has been shown repeatedly on several channels since it was first aired, has triggered a wave of public repudiation. In Brasilia Justice Minister Nelson Jobim described the police behaviour as &quot;monstrous.&quot;</p>
<p>Leftist Congresswoman Marta Suplicy said the Sao Paulo military police force was in a state of collapse. &quot;The chaos in the military police goes from this madness to the basic training course where they are taught to batter and beat up,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Sao Paulo's military police has a documented history of abuse. The worst incident was the 1992 killing of 111 inmates at Carandiru prison after an elite force was called in to quash a prisoner's mutiny.</p>
<p>Cavalaro of Human Right's Watch said it was a sad irony that the latest example of police violence once again involved the Sao Paulo military police as new statistics showed officials had made progress in curbing the worst abuses within the force. He said the number of civilian deaths by Sao Paulo military police had dropped to fewer than 300 in 1996 from a record 1,470 in 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;While clearly an improvement, those numbers are still high if compared with cities like New York, where annual number of civilians killed by police officers is in a range of between 20 to 30 people,&quot; he said.</p>
