<p> JULY     Close  * Support * Resist * RSI14 *   MA10 *   MA30</p>
<p> COFFEE   2,082  *  2,020  *  2,300 *  80.8 *  1,955 *  1,748</p>
<p>---------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - May 23 ----------------</p>
<p>LIFFE coffee futures are seen pulling back for a couple of days, before resuming their bull run with a vengeance, analysts said.</p>
<p>July robustas were called to open $10 down after closing near their session low on Thursday.</p>
<p>Trevor Neil, senior technical analyst at Union Cal Futures, said London's attempt to rally on Thursday was weak as July tried to take out resistance but failed in low volume.</p>
<p>&quot;Technically, that's a weak sign, and I expect follow-through on the downside this morning,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Neil said July's reaction near support between $2,020 and $2,010 would be important. &quot;If it fails there, I would target a gap toward $1,860,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Neil expected $2,010 to hold.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend is still strongly up.&quot; Despite the short-term losses expected, there was no sign that a major top has been put in.</p>
<p>If a sell-off materialised in the near term, July would be able to work off some of its extremely overbought relative strength index (RSI) position, analysts added.</p>
<p>Neil expected weakness to only last through about Wednesday before coffee surged again. He said he would view any fall as a temporary, intermediate profit-taking setback so long as Tuesday's opening was at $2,010 or higher.</p>
<p>London's markets are closed on Monday for a public holiday.</p>
<p>When coffee resumed its bull run, July should touch $2,300. &quot;That is a modest estimate just based on momentum. I think it can touch that quite easily and quickly. The market is extremely bullish,&quot; Neil said.</p>
