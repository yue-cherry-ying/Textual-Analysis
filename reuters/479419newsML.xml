<p>Sweden's Finance Minister Erik Asbrink said on Tuesday that unemployment appeared to have peaked but it was impossible to say categorically.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of talk saying that unemployment had hit its peak. But you can never be 100 percent sure,&quot; Asbrink told reporters after a party meeting.</p>
<p>He said most forecasts estimated unemployment would fall this year and fall even further next year.</p>
<p>In February Swedish unemployment was running at 8.8 percent.</p>
<p>Asbrink repeated that his government wanted to halve open unemployment by the year 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;We must start to notice it this year and in 1998,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asbrink said it was important that the government continued to pursue a political direction that gave strong public finances and low inflation.</p>
<p>Asbrink said it was vital that there was confidence in Swedish economic policies.</p>
<p>&quot;We have won back a lot of confidence,&quot;  he said. &quot;It is important that we stick to strong public finances and low inflation. It is vital for employment.&quot;</p>
