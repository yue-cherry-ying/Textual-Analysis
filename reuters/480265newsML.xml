<headline>LME starts week slowly, zinc skips above $1,300.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Base metal business got off to a slow start on the LME on Tuesday after the long Easter holiday, with only zinc seeing reasonable interest, traders said.</p>
<p>Zinc prices raced higher from $1,291 up to $1,305 a tonne, before settling at $1,304, up $9 from Thursday's kerb close.</p>
<p>A 13,025-tonne LME warehouse stock decline helped the rise, although the market was already on the move prior to the data.</p>
<p>Traders said the market had recovered well from the sell-off seen last week, which had possibly been engineered to shake out some of the weeker longs. Prices are now in better shape technically, and should re-test the recent $1,307 high, they said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, copper prices probed towards the $2,380 level on the charts - a break above that could see the market run up towards $2,400.</p>
<p>But business was slow, while the 6,225-tonne stock fall was not as large as some recent talk had suggested. Three months settled back around $2,375, up just $3 from pre-weekend levels.</p>
<p>Aluminium was dull, with the market unable to build on the rally away from the $1,300 level last week. The 2,525-tonne stock decline was marginally supportive, and prices held at a steady $1,644/47.</p>
<p>Nickel edged back above the $7,800 level, and was $15 steadier at $7,820.</p>
<p>Lead and tin were quiet and holding at $686/88 and $5,885/5,905 a tonne, both relatively steady. Alloy was indicated at $1,535/45 a tonne.</p>
