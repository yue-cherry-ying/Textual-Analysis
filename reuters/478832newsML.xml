<text>
<p>Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was due to meet Tuesday with political leaders and ministers to discuss possible last-minute alterations to a civil service reform bill, officials said.</p>
<p>The bill, which was due to be put a first of two votes in the Chamber of Deputies Wednesday, has run into opposition in Congress, mainly because of a proposed ceiling on public sector pay and pensions which would hit many lawmakers' pockets.</p>
<p>Proposed solutions to the impasse include an exemption of lawmakers and judges from the 10,800 reais ($10,188) monthly ceiling on pay and pensions included in the reform.  </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Planning Minister Antonio Kandir, who was due to attend Tuesday's meeting, the minister would probably be asked to detail the cost of offering exemptions to the ceiling.</p>
<p>&quot;They will want to see the numbers so they can reach some kind of political deal,&quot; the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Civil service reform is considered the government's most effective tool in cutting public spending and would enable states and municipalities who spend more than 60 percent of receipts on payrolls to dismiss currently unfireable workers.</p>
<p>The bill was sent to Congress in August 1995 and its has been snail-paced in the face of opposition ranging from trade unions to government allied parties.</p>
<p>As a constitutional amendment, the bill requires two three-fifths majorities in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate.</p>
