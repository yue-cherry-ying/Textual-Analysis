<p>Iran, $11 billion in arrears to its foreign creditors as recently as March 1994, has repaid 60 percent of its foreign debt, central bank governor Mohsen Nourbakhsh said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sixty percent of Iran's foreign debts have been paid and there is no problem in this respect,&quot; Nourbakhsh said remarks reported in Tehran newspapers on Thursday.</p>
<p>There were no further details. In January, the central bank said Iran's total foreign debt stood at $20.4 billion as of September 20.</p>
<p>Nourbaksh said the country's trade balance qA $18.4 billion for the past three years while hard currency savings had reached $7 billion.</p>
<p>Iran's economic growth rate reached 5.2 percent in the Iranian year 1375 which ended in March, while the figure for the industry sector was 6.3 percent, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Iran's economy is considerably improving. That's a well known fact in the world,&quot; the central bank governor added.</p>
<p>Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said last month he was satisfied with Iranian economic policy and he praised the country for reviving growth and bringing inflation down.</p>
<p>Camdessus told Nourbakhsh during spring meetings in Washington of the World Bank and IMF that he hoped the momentum of policy reform would continue, an IMF spokesman said.</p>
<p>Nourbakhsh was quoted by Iranian media last month as saying annual consumer price inflation in urban areas fell to 17.4 percent in the year to March, about one-third the figure for the previous year.</p>
