<p>Authorities in Memphis, Tennessee, searched Friday for rock singer Jeff Buckley, who disappeared while swimming in a marina near the Mississippi River, a spokesman for Columbia Records said.</p>
<p>&quot;Jeff Buckley has been missing since he went for a swim in a marina Thursday evening,&quot; said the spokesman. The marina was about one-half mile away from the main body of the river.</p>
<p>Buckley, 30, whose first album &quot;Grace&quot; was critically acclaimed, was in Memphis preparing for his next album. He was set to start recording the album in June, which was expected to be released in 1998.</p>
<p>Buckley is the son of Tim Buckley, a popular solo performer of the 1960s and early 1970s who died of a drug overdose.</p>
<p>The label spokesman described Jeff Buckley's music as a fusion of underground, rock, folk and jazz.</p>
<p>Buckley was swimming by himself as a companion sat nearby on the bank of the marina. The friend notified authorities about 10 minutes after he realised Buckley was missing.</p>
