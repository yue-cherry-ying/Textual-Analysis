<p>Palestinian President Yasser Aaraft arrived in Cairo on Saturday and went straight into talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Egypt's attempt to break the deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian relations.</p>
<p>Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa are also attending the talks at Mubarak's office in northeastern Cairo, officials said.</p>
<p>President Mubarak is at the centre of mediation to bridge the gap between Israel and the Palestinians, mainly over Jewish settlement actitivity in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources said on Friday that Egypt and the Palestinians were working on a five-point plan which includes a freeze on any change in the status of Jerusalem and a ban on Jewish settlement of the West Bank for &quot;a sufficient period&quot;.</p>
<p>In return the Palestinians would give a firm commitment to address Israel's security demands, they added.</p>
<p>But the sources said the gap between the two sides remained very wide, especially on the question of Jewish settlements.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to go back on a decision to build 6,500 homes for Jews on an East Jerusalem site known to Israelis as Har Homa and to Palestinians as Jabal Abu Ghneim.</p>
<p>Moussa said on Thursday it was premature to talk about any openings on the part of Israel, particularly since the Jewish state outlined a vision for peace in which Palestinians are largely sidelined.</p>
