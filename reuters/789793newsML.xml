<p>Taiwan's Vice President Lien Chan said the stock market's bull run reflected nothing but the island's strong economy, local newspapers reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;Speaking overall, the economic development and its solid growth have been fully reflected in the (stock) market, which is why I say the stock market is healthy,&quot; Lien told the Economic Daily News in an interview.</p>
<p>But Lien, who doubles as premier, said he was concerned about what he described as a &quot;shallow-dish&quot; stock market largely dominated by individual investors instead of institutional investors, and thus more volatile.</p>
<p>&quot;Our country's stock market can be characterised as a shallow-dish stock market,&quot; Lien told the Commercial Times in a separate interview.</p>
<p>&quot;More individual investors, higher turnover rate and more volatile price changes are the market's main characteristics,&quot; Lien said.</p>
<p>He added many stocks' price/earnings ratio was &quot;slightly too high&quot;.</p>
<p>Lien's comments on the stock market coincided with that of Finance Minister Paul Chiu. In an interview with Reuters Financial Television on Friday, Chiu said the stock marekt was &quot;quite sound&quot; and that a nightmarish crash in 1990 was unlikely to recur now.</p>
<p>Taiwan's benchmark stock index has risen more than 40 percent since the beginning of 1997 and a whopping 100-plus percent since rival Beijing test-fired missiles onto the island's doorstep in March 1996.</p>
<p>The bourse was one of the world's best performing markets.</p>
<p>Lien said this year's technology-led stock rally was backed by good fundamentals.</p>
<p>&quot;The electronics sector has continued to grow and it's normal to reflect such growth in the share prices,&quot; Lien told the Commercial Times.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is pleased to see an economic recovery lead to a prosperous stock market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The capitalist island posted gross domestic product growth of 6.83 percent in the first quarter and is on track to grow 6.24 percent for all of 1997, according to state projections.</p>
<p>The government would let market forces determine stock level, Lien said.</p>
<p>&quot;The cabinet respects the free market principle in the stock market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Many officials, including the central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong, and analysts have raised concerns that Taiwan's market, which on July 31 surpassed the 10,000-point threshold for the first time since 1990, may be overheated.</p>
<p>Central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong last week cited a &quot;consensus&quot; that the market may be slightly overheated with its recent torrential turnover, but said the bank had no opinion on whether the index was too high.</p>
