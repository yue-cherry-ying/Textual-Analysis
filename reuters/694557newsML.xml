<headline>Rome's Borghese Gallery reopens after 13 years.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1997-06-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Rome's famed Borghese Gallery, one of Italy's richest museums, reopened on Saturday after bureaucratic red tape and restoration work kept it closed for more than 13 years.</p>
<p>The gallery, in the Villa Borghese park in central Rome, is a treasure house of masterpieces by artists such as Raphael, Titian, Bernini, Caravaggio and Canova.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we reopen the Bhorgese Gallery. Today we close a wound,&quot; Culture Minister Walter Veltroni told guests at the reopening ceremony.</p>
<p>Veltroni has called the delay in reopening shameful, accusing Italy of abusing its rich cultural heritage. He vowed last summer to have the museum reopened by July, 1997.</p>
<p>Once a must for visitors on the Grand Tour of Italy, the museum was closed in early 1984 after it was discovered that a series of underground water sources was threatening the foundation of the building.</p>
<p>Lengthy restoration, exacerbated by the dense bureaucracy tied to Italian public works, kept the celebrated collection closed longer than most people thought necessary.</p>
<p>The works were put together in the early 17th century by Scipione Borghese, who exploited his wealth and the fact that his uncle was Pope Paul V, to amass one of Italy's greatest art collections.</p>
<p>The Italian state bought the museum in 1905 after many of its masterpieces had passed into French hands when Napoleone Bonaparte's sister Pauline married Camillio Borghese in the early 19th century.</p>
