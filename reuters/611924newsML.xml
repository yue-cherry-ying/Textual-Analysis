<p>Singapore shares were seen steady early Friday but in a lacklustre mood as investors stayed cautious due to bearish technicals and lack of incentives.</p>
<p>&quot;It's quite difficult to recommend anything as there is just as much interest to buy selected stocks as there is to sell others,&quot; a local bank dealer said.</p>
<p>He said electronics and property stocks could draw better interest after stronger April non-oil export figures and firm prices in a recent government land tender for executive condominiums.  </p>
<p>There could also be more follow-through upward momentum on the broader market if sentiment in Malaysia remained firm.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Sraits Times Industrials Index closed at 2,061.71, up by 7.72 points. It brushed an intraday high of 2,073.28 points.</p>
<p>Market volume was 210.22 million shares with gainers ahead of losers by 225 to 152.</p>
