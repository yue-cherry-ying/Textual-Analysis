<p>President Boris Yeltsin said on Thursday a treaty on Russia's relations with NATO was nearly ready and he might join Moscow talks in person next week in an effort to finalise the accord.</p>
<p>&quot;About 98 percent of the document is ready,&quot; Yeltsin told reporters after laying a wreath at the Kremlin's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, part of ceremonies marking the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in 1945.</p>
<p>Moscow resents NATO's plans to invite some eastern European countries to join the Western alliance.</p>
<p>But since NATO made clear it would not drop expansion plans because of Moscow's objections, the Kremlin has concentrated on working out a deal which would meet its security concerns. It is seeking to limit changes in military deployments in Europe and to win a say in NATO planning.</p>
<p>&quot;The main thing now is to ensure Russia's part in NATO's decision-making process,&quot; Yeltsin said.</p>
<p>&quot;We also want them not to move their forces into the new territories, including nuclear weapons.&quot;</p>
<p>Leading NATO members, including the United States, insist that compromise with Moscow does not leave the new members with fewer security guarantees than existing pact allies.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said that he wanted his Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and NATO Secretary General Javier Solana to sort out the remaining differences at their next meeting in Moscow so to make possible the signing of the document before the alliances Madrid summit in July, possibly on May 27.</p>
<p>&quot;They must discuss the outstanding problems at their meeting on May 13, maybe with my participation, so to have the document finally ready,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This would reduce the threat to our national security though would not remove it fully,&quot; Yeltsin said. &quot;We still remain opposed to the expansion.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin said that NATO's plans to expand have triggered the worst diplomatic crisis in Europe in decades.</p>
<p>&quot;There has not been any crisis in decades which would affect Russia's interests as this one does,&quot; he said. &quot;This should ring alarm bells in all European countries and the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We urge all reasonable forces in Europe to be extra- cautious,&quot; Yeltsin added.</p>
