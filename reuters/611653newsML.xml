<p>NTT Docomo, the cellular phone subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT), aims to acquire five million new cell phone subscribers in the year to end-March 1998, NTT Docomo president Koji Oboshi told a news conference on Friday.  </p>
<p>This will be in addition to NTT Docomo's existing 11 million cell phone subscribers in its nationwide service.</p>
<p>Oboshi said, however, that the sharp growth in Japan's cell phone market will begin decelerating this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We will shift our emphasis to mobile multi-media, which we expect to begin expanding (into a mass market) around the year 2000, and we hope to develop infrastructure for mobile computing and mobile multi-media services by then,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>NTT Docomo last month announced that it would begin an experiment on wide-band Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) digital phone networks in Japan, jointly with several major telecommunications equipment manufacturers, in 2000.</p>
<p>The wireless communications system would provide increased data transmission speed and system capacity and allow for video transmission.</p>
<p>Oboshi also said NTT group's personal handyphone system (PHS) service will incur a 75 billion yen loss in the year ending in March 1998, down from a 90.7 billion yen loss in the year ended in March 1997.</p>
<p>The loss in the PHS affiliate, in which NTT Docomo owns about a 45 percent share, is expected to reduce Docomo's group net profit by 32 billion yen in the current business year ending in March 1998.</p>
<p>NTT Docomo, which is expected to go public next autumn, has a nearly 50 percent share of Japan's booming cellular phone market.</p>
