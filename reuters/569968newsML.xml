<p>Following are some of the main factors affecting Indian stock markets on Thursday morning:</p>
<p>NEWS OUTLOOK:</p>
<p>Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Wednesday brushed aside demands by left-wing allies and political rivals, and stood by his landmark 1997/98 (April-March) budget.</p>
<p>&quot;No major changes have been made in taxation and on customs duties,&quot; Chidambaram told parliament as he moved the budget plan that would slash corporate and personal income taxes.</p>
<p>Leaders of the left-wing parties, the Congress party and the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) met Chidambaram earlier this week and pressed for changes in the tax and tariff plan, which he first presented to parliament on February 28.</p>
