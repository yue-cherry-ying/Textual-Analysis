<p>The Czech 1997 state budget deficit widened to 8.5 billion crowns at the end of March from 6.7 billion at the end of February, the CTK news agency quoted the finance ministry as saying on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Comparative results for the first three months of 1996 were not available. The full-year budget was approved as balanced with both revenues and expenditures at 549.1 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Ministry officials were not immediately available for confirmation.  </p>
<p>CTK did not report total budget revenues and expenditures for the period.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik has said he would submit a plan to cabinet this month to cut 1997 state spending by two percent across the board. The plan, amounting to 11 billion crowns in cuts, would exclude social support payments.</p>
<p>The government has blamed a slowdown in the pace of economic growth and lower tax revenues for the deficit.</p>
<p>According to preliminary data, industrial production fell 3.9 percent in January, year-on-year, while construction output fell 18.6 percent.</p>
<p>Last year's budget, originally approved as balanced, ended with a 1.56 billion deficit, after three years of surpluses.</p>
