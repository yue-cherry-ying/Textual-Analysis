<headline>Czech PX50 rises but activity low - dealers.</headline>
<dateline>PRAGUE 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Czech major issues surged again on Friday pushing the PX50 index up 1.45 percent to 484 but dealers said prices had been built on low volumes and expected a downturn on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Gains are partly because of domestic buying and partly just that there are not many active players in the market. I would not bet on the day's rebound continuing,&quot; said Miroslav Nosal of Patria Finance.</p>
<p>The major factor affecting foreign investors' intentions on the Czech equities market continued to be the current instability in the Czech crown and fears of a devaluation.</p>
<p>On Friday, the crown again came under assault from foreign and domestic selling pressure but strengthened markedly after heavy central bank intervention.</p>
<p>The crown fell to a Friday low of minus five percent against the mid-point of its mark/dollar basket but rebounded</p>
<p>Transmission was aborted</p>
