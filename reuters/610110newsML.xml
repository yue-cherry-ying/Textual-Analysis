<headline>Congresswoman calls for military policy review.</headline>

<p>A leading congressional critic of the way the Air Force handled the Kelly Flinn adultery case said Friday the military needs to review its policies on fraternisation and enforcement.</p>
<p>&quot;The entire armed services has to review their military policies, their policies on fraternisation, their policies of enforcement, and move forward,&quot; Representative Nita Lowey, Democrat of New York, said in an interview with the Cable News Network.</p>
<p>The lawmaker also said the military's rules on sexual conduct were not in line with what goes on in society.</p>
<p>&quot;They certainly don't conform to what most of us see in the norms of life and that's why we need an entire review,&quot; she said. &quot;It just doesn't make any sense.&quot;</p>
<p>Her remarks came one day after Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall announced that Flinn, the nation's first female B-52 bomber pilot, had been given a general discharge and would leave the service instead of being court-martialed on charges that she committed adultery, lied during an official investigation and disobeyed a direct order.</p>
<p>The discharge would prevent Flinn from flying planes for the Air Force Reserve or the Air National Guard unless she obtained a waiver, which Flinn's attorney, Frank Spinner, said she would seek.</p>
<p>Flinn, 26 and single, will also have to repay $18,000 in tuition fees that the government gave her to attend the prestigious Air Force Academy.</p>
<p>Lowey also said there was a randomness to the way in which the military enforced its policies and said the armed services should be consistent in the way it carries out its rules.</p>
<p>&quot;As you look at all the cases, there was a randomness with which the armed services enforced their policies,&quot; Lowey said. &quot;There was no consistency.</p>
<p>&quot;The real problem here originally,&quot; she added, &quot;was that Kelly Flinn was not given an administrative review and that it was going to court-martial. It would have been better if there had been an administrative review and it wasn't a public spectacle to begin with.&quot;</p>
<p>Lowey was one of several members of Congress who criticised the Air Force over its handling of the case.</p>
<p>When asked by CNN if it was appropriate for Congress to get involved in the matter, Lowey replied: &quot;I don't think it was inappropriate. The fact that members of Congress got involved was a good thing.&quot;</p>
