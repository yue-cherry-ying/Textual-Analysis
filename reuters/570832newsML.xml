<p>Building products and petrol refinery group Pioneer International Ltd said on Thursday it was experiencing the first signs of an upward movement in volume and prices in the Australian building and construction industry.</p>
<p>&quot;We are starting to see volume and prices moving upwards. We've been seeing the first signs in April,&quot; managing director John Schubert told reporters.</p>
<p>Schubert said Pioneer was also looking for acquisitions and merger opportunities, mainly in the United States.  </p>
<p>Speaking after an Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce luncheon address, Schubert said the United States construction industry was moving ahead well.</p>
<p>Pioneer's markets in North America would be good for some time yet, Asia would see continued growth but European economic conditions would still impinge on infrastructure development, Schubert said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Pioneer currently had cash available on its balance sheet of A$500 million for acquisitions or merger opportunities.</p>
<p>&quot;And if we sell Ampol it will be more,&quot; Schubert said.  </p>
<p>He said Pioneer was still reviewing its options over the sale of its 50 percent stake in Australia's largest petroleum marketer and refiner Ampol Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to progress. It is inevitably a slow process but discussions are underway,&quot; Schubert said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still reviewing our options,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ampol is the trading name of Australia Petroleum Ltd, which Pioneer jointly owns with Caltex Australia Ltd.</p>
