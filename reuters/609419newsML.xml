<p>A languorous dollar stood flat to lower at the U.S. midday as foreign exchange desks thinned ahead of the long Memorial Day weekend.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar and British pound -- big movers and shakers overnight -- had also settled down and dealers were expecting little-to-no action for the remainder of the session.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is really very quiet,&quot; said Mark Gargano, managing director of currency derivatives at First Union National Bank. &quot;Ranges are extremely tight today.&quot;  </p>
<p>The dollar dipped down to session lows against the mark and fell to 115.25 yen in mid-morning trade, but began a slothful trip back up to the top of its tight range near midday.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar is well supported against the yen at 115.25/35 and dollar/mark is well supported at the 1.6880 level,&quot; said Bob Steiner, vice president on the foreign exchange desk at Mellon Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;You may see some drifting up but not too much more than that at this point,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>At midday, the dollar was changing hands at 1.6905/15 marks, down from 1.6924/27 at the open. It was fetching 115.59/69 yen, just below its opening rate of 115.68/73.</p>
<p>Shortly after midday. the dollar pushed up above its opening levels against both the mark and yen.</p>
<p>The outlook for dollar/yen, dealers said, was dependent on the rate's ability to move above key resistance at 116.50 -- where offers are rumored to be lurking.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen a correction from the oversold condition but we need to get above 116.50 and 117 to make me believe we're going back to 120,&quot; said Gargano.  </p>
<p>Traders pegged good support in the Australian dollar, which tumbled overnight after Australia's central bank cut official interest rates by 50 basis points, at $0.7630/40 and said a return to the $0.7750 area was in the cards for next week.</p>
<p>Sterling/mark, which fell sharply on Thursday, gained ground in U.S. trading, moving above the 2.76 threshold.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterling/mark came from 2.78 down to 2.74 so a retracement back to 2.7650 is just about normal,&quot; said Mellon's Steiner, cautioning that another downward turn may be forthcoming.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere at midday, the dollar had weakened to 1.4050/60 Swiss francs from 1.4070/80. Sterling was firmer at $1.6320/30 versus $1.6305/15. The dollar was stronger at Canadian $1.3735/40 against C$1.3729/34.</p>
