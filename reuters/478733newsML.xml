<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates ended down just 10 basis points at 21.90 percent on Tuesday in a move that mirrored U.S. long bond yields, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Overnight Cetes rates closed down because of the (U.S. long) bond yield, which zigzagged through the session, but ended down, which also bolstered the peso,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Benchmark 48-hour pesos contracts closed unchanged at 7.9120/7.9140 per dollar.  </p>
<p>U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds were up 6/32 to yield 7.08 percent as the money market was closing in Mexico, after being down 5/32 in early trade to yield 7.12 percent.</p>
<p>Another dealer said the session had been volatile due to concern the Federal Open Market Committee would raise U.S. interest rates again in May.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the upward trend to continue and that, mainly, has led to both uncertainty and jitters in the Mexican market,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Traders and analysts thus estimated primary interest rates would gain after two weeks of decreases at Banco de Mexico's primary auction to be held later in the day.</p>
<p>Money market traders surveyed by Reuters showed they forecast the central bank would assign bellwether 27-day Cetes at an average rate of 21.22 percent. This would be a gain of 63 basis points since last week's auction.</p>
<p>Auction results are due out at 1830 local time/0030 GMT.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico drained 2.961 billion pesos through six secondary auctions, which it assigned at rates of between 23.73 and 23.84 percent, at maturities of between one and 16 days.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper, meanwhile, closed up 50 basis points at 23.90 percent.</p>
<p>Liquidity of 1.843 billion pesos was scheduled to return to the system from prior central bank participation.</p>
