<p>U.S. banks were more generous toward businesses than consumers in terms of extending credit over the past three months, a Federal Reserve survey issued on Friday showed.</p>
<p>The latest survey of senior loan officers at 59 domestic banks and 24 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks showed a trend that began in 1996 toward restricting consumer lending has continued.</p>
<p>&quot;The responses suggest that over the past three months domestic banks have become more accommodative lenders to businesses but have tightened credit to households,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>The survey said that stiff competition had caused many banks to offer easier terms for both commercial and industrial and for commercial real estate loans. It said there has been &quot;a slight strengthening&quot; in demand for both types of business credit.</p>
<p>The latest survey updates one done in January and published on February 10.</p>
<p>&quot;Once again, both standards and terms for consumer loans were tightened and banks reported less demand for these loans,&quot; it found. Standards for home mortgages were little changed but demand for them weakened a little since January.  </p>
<p>The Fed survey said that about half of the banks tightened standards for new credit-card accounts during the past three months and about 20 percent imposed tougher standards for other consumer loans as well.</p>
<p>Some 40 percent of the banks also reduced their credit limits on credit-card lines since January, the Fed found.</p>
<p>While banks were generally more eager to lend to businesses, the Fed noted some differences between domestic banks and the U.S. branches of foreign banks.</p>
<p>It said &quot;small net fractions&quot; of foreign-controlled banks had tightened some terms on commercial loans since January.  </p>
<p>&quot;This represents a shift for foreign banks, which reported having eased terms on these loans for the past several surveys,&quot; the Fed said.</p>
<p>The banks that tightened their commercial lending rules said they did so because of &quot;lower tolerance for risk and a deterioration in their current or expected capital position,&quot; the survey reported.</p>
<p>But the larger percentage of banks that went the other route -- making it easier for businesses to get loans -- said their motivation was more aggressive competition from other banks and from nonbank sources of credit.</p>
