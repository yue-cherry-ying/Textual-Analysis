<p>Croatia's president Franjo Tudjman, recently elected for a second term in office, has successfully completed medical treatment and is fit to perform all his duties, state news agency HINA reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The president's medical council, assisted by experts from France and Germany, carried out final check-ups and a number of diagnostic tests at the end of his medical treatment, a council statement carried by HINA said.</p>
<p>&quot;The council has concluded that there are no traces of the previous illness and that the applied treatment was successfully completed,&quot; the statement said. It did not say what the illness was.</p>
<p>Tudjman, who noticeably lost weight last year, was treated at a U.S. military hospital in Washington in November for what U.S. sources said was stomach cancer.</p>
<p>Tudjman's office never confirmed this and described his ailment as stomach ulcers and swollen lymphoid nodes.</p>
<p>The-75-year old president's distinctive mane of silver hair has thinned considerably during the treatment but he appears to have regained weight and regularly plays tennis.</p>
<p>&quot;The president can perform all his duties without any restrictions,&quot; the statement said.</p>
