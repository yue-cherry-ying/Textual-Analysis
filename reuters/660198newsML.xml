<headline>FDA warns dietary supplement may cause heart attack.</headline>

<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday warned consumers to stop buying and using dietary supplements containing &quot;plantain&quot; because they may contain digitalis, a plant that can cause heart attacks.</p>
<p>Digitalis, also known as foxglove, contains powerful heart stimulants that can cause life-threatening heart reactions including cardiac arrest if ingested, the FDA said.</p>
<p>The agency's latest warning follows closely on the heels of its announcement on June 2 warning against the use of dietary supplements containing ephedrine.</p>
<p>The FDA said it found digitalis in samples of raw material labeled &quot;plantain&quot; that has been used by various manufacturers as an ingredient in making dietary supplement products.</p>
<p>In addition, some of the suspect plantain has been distributed to retailers who sell the product in bulk for making tea or who use it in blends of specialty teas.</p>
<p>Plantain is a perennial weed used in herbal remedies as a laxative and in poultices. It is not related to the tropical banana plant, the fruit of which is also known as plantain.</p>
<p>The effects of digitalis may include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, confusion, low blood pressure, vision problems, and abnormal heart rate and rhythm.</p>
<p>The FDA last month issued a warning to consumers about an herbal laxative and cleansing agent containing digitalis and distributed by Arise &amp; Shine of Mount Shasta, Calif. But other products containing the plant have since been identified.</p>
<p>The agency said it was continuing to investigate the mislabeling of raw material labeled as plantain and to work with manufacturers to identify any supplements containing digitalis to ensure they are recalled.</p>
<p>Consumers can call FDA's consumer hotline at 800-FDA-4010. People with adverse effects should see a doctor, FDA said.</p>
<p>FDA included a list of over seven distributors and manufacturers whose products contained digitalis, and over 100 retail outlets around the country which sold the products.</p>
<p>The Council for Responsible Nutrition said it had notified its 84 member companies about the FDA findings and was recommending that they stop sale of any products believed to contain plantain, at least until testing can confirm whether digitalis is present in the products.</p>
<p>&quot;Plaintain is not a common ingredient of dietary supplements and is primarily used as an herbal laxative or cleanser. CRN has no reason to believe that any of its members are in fact marketing products with this ingredient,&quot; the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>CRN recently took the lead in drafting Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) for dietary supplements, which would require every manufacturer of such supplements to conduct at least one test of identity on every ingredient in the product.</p>
<p>FDA published the industry draft in February 1997 as an advance notice of proposed rulemaking.</p>
