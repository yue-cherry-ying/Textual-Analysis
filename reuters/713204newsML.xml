<headline>Qatar, Turkey close to gas deal - officials.</headline>

<p>Qatar and Turkey are close to concluding an agreement for the supply of one million tonnes a year of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for 25 years from mid-1999, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A Qatari delegation, led by the undersecretary at the ministry of finance, economy and trade and chairman of Ras Laffan LNG Company, Youssef Hussein Kamal, left for Ankara on Monday, to finalise the deal, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the eighth round of negotiations between the two countries. I think this time they will agree to sign the deal,&quot; an official from the Turkish embassy in Doha told reporters.</p>
<p>Turkey's state-owned pipeline company, Botas, in 1995 signed a memorandum of understanding with Ras Laffan LNG Company (Rasgas) to buy two million tonnes of gas annually.</p>
<p>But complex negotiations on pricing delayed signing of a firm sales-and-purchase agreement (SPA), and now the quantity of gas that Turkey will lift from Qatar has been whittled down to half the amount envisaged in the MoU, said the official.</p>
<p>Rasgas is one of three Qatari LNG ventures designed to tap the North Field, the largest single concentration of natural gas in the world.</p>
<p>The first project, Qatargas, has already come onstream and has been supplying the Japanese market since early this year. The second, Rasgas, that would supply Turkey, is under construction and the third, Qatar Enron LNG Marketing Company, is still at the stage of signing up long-term customers -- crucial to win finance and begin construction.</p>
<p>Rasgas is designed to produced 10 million tonnes of LNG at a cost of $9 billion but in the absence of sufficient long-term customers it has started with just two LNG production facilities to produce five million tonnes annually for Korea Gas Corporation, with which it signed an SPA on June 30 to supply 4.8 million tonnes a year for 25 years from July 1999.</p>
<p>A Rasgas official said: &quot;The Turkish deal, along with one more possible from a Far East customer, would help the company start building one more train by the year-end.&quot;</p>
<p>Rasgas has initialled MoUs and letters of intent with a number of customers in India, China, Taiwan and Thailand for around seven million tonnes, though no firm SPAs have been concluded so far.</p>
