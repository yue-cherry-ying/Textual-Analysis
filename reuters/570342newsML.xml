<p>Higher fuel oil prices in Asia and the United States buoyed European paper markets on Thursday but physical fuel trade was deadened by public holidays in the main trading countries, dealers said.</p>
<p>High sulphur barge paper for May traded at $84.50/$85.00 on the back of bullish sentiment in Singapore, where 180-cst grade was sold at $102 a tonne for May 26-30 delivery, up $2 on Tuesday, in anticipation of fresh demand.</p>
<p>May Singapore swaps were also up, at $101.50/$102.50. Stronger U.S. prices have also boosted one percent cracked swaps in Europe.</p>
<p>But traders said it was unclear how much of the paper rise would filter through to physical markets. Both cargo and barge markets were barely discussed, due to public holidays.</p>
<p>Low sulphur supplies were believed tight in the prompt period in northern Europe, though buyers were also relaxed after last week's flurry of deals.</p>
<p>High sulphur cargoes were quiet in the north, though Mediterranean bunker requirements were rumoured filled earlier this week in secretive trades.</p>
<p>A 25kt low sulphur straight-run deal was heard done on Tuesday from an Irish to a European refiner.  </p>
<p>The price was undisclosed.</p>
<p>But other straight-run sellers were quiet and Russian fuel oil was still in short supply. - London newsroom +44 171 542 8060</p>
