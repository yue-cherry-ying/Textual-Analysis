<p>Despite recent setbacks, the United States remains hopeful that North Korea will take part in Korean peninsula peace talks, a U.S. official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The official, who asked not to be identified, said the size of food aid to famine-hit North Korea remained the main sticking point to opening talks involving China, South Korea, the United States and North Korea.</p>
<p>The official made the comments while briefing reporters about talks in Tokyo on Wednesday between officials from the United States, South Korea and Japan aimed at coordinating policy on North Korea.</p>
<p>They involved Charles Kartman, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state, Yu Myung-hwan, director-general for North American affairs at the South Korean Foreign Ministry, and his Japanese counterpart, Ryozo Kato.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States is still hopeful of a positive answer in due course to (proposals for) peace talks,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>At talks in New York two weeks ago, North Korea turned down proposals to join negotiations aimed at finally closing the book on the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a now-fraying armistice.</p>
<p>Talks also broke down earlier this week between the Red Cross organisations of the two Koreas aimed at stepping up food supplies to North Korea, where harvests have been devastated by two consecutive years of record floods.</p>
<p>North Korean officials said that the talks would resume once the South had decided how much food aid it would give while Southern officials said this would depend on how much citizens in the South were willing to donate.</p>
<p>The U.S. official said the United States and its partners would watch the situation in North Korea carefully in the coming weeks which was when the food crisis could reach &quot;calamity&quot; levels.</p>
<p>However, he said that apart from already pledged humanitarian aid, the United States was hamstrung in its response because of a lack of independent information from North Korea on its plight.</p>
<p>The World Food Programme, a United Nations agency, has so far this year appealed for 200,000 tonnes of food for North Korea, or about $95 million. About $38.6 million of this has been raised. The United States has pledged $25 million and South Korea $6 million.</p>
<p>In Wednesday's meeting, the United States and South Korea decided not to offer further large scale aid until North Korea agreed to peace talks while Japan decided to withhold all aid until Tokyo-Pyongyang ties were normalised and other issues put to rest, in particular charges that North Korea kidnapped a Japanese schoolgirl in 1977 and spirited her away to Pyongyang.</p>
