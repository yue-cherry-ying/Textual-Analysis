<p>A relatively quiet trading session may unfold on Wednesday as traders prepare for the crucial nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.</p>
<p>Tuesday the National Association of Purchasing Management's March survey came in stronger than expected at 55.0, but as the number had been forecast to be strong it had little lasting impact on bond prices.</p>
<p>Payrolls, however, remained an unknown variable and market players know Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will continue to look at the number for signs of wage inflation.  </p>
<p>&quot;Factory orders (due at 1000 EST/1500 GMT) are not market-grabbing, I get the feeling the dollar's the more important story (on Wednesday),&quot; said Mary Dennis, economist at Merrill Lynch. (Corrects name of firm).</p>
<p>Dennis said the Tankan survey of Japanese business confidence (due at 1850 EST/2350 GMT) could set the tone of trading for the day. The yen rebounded Tuesday against the dollar and talk had it that an encouraging Tankan survey could be seen.</p>
<p>Should the yen rally further it could spill over into the U.S. bond market, hurting prices.  </p>
<p>Dennis said she suspected few short positions were still in the market ahead of the payrolls report.</p>
<p>Players also were expected to pay heed to the Treasury's reopening of the 10-year inflation-indexed issue first sold on January 29 -- with the expectation that the size of the issue would be increased, Dennis said.</p>
<p>&quot;All lies in the employment report on Friday. Most are looking for some moderation from the extremely strong levels we've seen in recent months,&quot; said John Williams, chief global economist at Bankers Trust Co. Williams also said activity was likely to be limited until Friday.</p>
