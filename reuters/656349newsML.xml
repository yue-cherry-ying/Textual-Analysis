<p>China's capital plans to stage a series of events this month to celebrate the return of the British colony of Hong Kong to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>China's biggest art exhibition since the 1949 communist take-over would open on June 30 at the Museum of Revolutionary History in Beijing and include 2,000 historical paintings, with many focusing on the history of Hong Kong, the Beijing Youth Daily said.</p>
<p>An exhibition of paper cuts by Chinese farmers would also be staged from June 18 to 21, the Beijing Daily said.</p>
<p>The China National Philatelic Corp would issue a series of commemorative stamps to mark the end of more than 150 years of British rule over Hong Kong, a company official said. He could not give a date for the issue.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways planned to auction 176 sets of commemorative tickets for the first train to travel from Beijing to Hong Kong on July 1, a ministry official said.</p>
<p>The 176 sets, each comprising one gold and one silver ticket, would be sold later this month, the official said but gave no further details.</p>
<p>On the evening of June 30, the Beijing city government would stage a spectacle of song, dance and fireworks before an audience of more than 60,000 people in Tiananmen Square to celebrate the resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, officials said.</p>
