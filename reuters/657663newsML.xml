<headline>More than 75,000 roaches in Georgia woman's home.</headline>

<p>A Georgia woman whose flat was infested with more than 75,000 cockroaches won free insecticide and a cash prize this week after her problem was judged one of the worst in the country.</p>
<p>Mary Esposito said roaches lived in her dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, coffee-maker, VCR, wallpaper, dresser drawers and bathtub faucet.</p>
<p>&quot;While I cook, roaches fall from the ceiling fan into my food,&quot; she said. &quot;I keep a clean home and am frustrated that roaches keep coming back.&quot;</p>
<p>Entomologist Austin Frishman visited the suburban Atlanta home Esposito shares with her teenage son on Tuesday, setting up 72 bait stations and using six tubes of gel as part of a free treatment offered by Combat, a cockroach bait manufacturer.</p>
<p>&quot;The amount of product used was eight to ten times the amount recommended for an average infestation,&quot; Frishman said.</p>
<p>Esposito was one of six national &quot;winners&quot; chosen from hundreds of entries in a contest sponsored by the company. She was also given a $1,000 cash prize and a supply of cockroach control products.</p>
<p>Frishman estimated Esposito's home had more than 75,000 roaches. &quot;A home with an average roach infestation can have 15,000 roaches, which can multiply exponentially,&quot; he said.</p>
