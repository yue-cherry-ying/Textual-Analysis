<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton issued executive guidelines on Thursday ordering federal agencies to give government employees as much freedom as possible to engage in religious worship in the workplace.</p>
<p>&quot;Religious freedom is at the heart of what it means to be an American,&quot; Clinton said at a ceremony announcing the new guidelines.</p>
<p>Clinton said the new rules clarify:</p>
<p>- that federal employees may engage in personal religious expression to the greatest extent possible;</p>
<p>- that employers may not discriminate in employment on the basis of religion;</p>
<p>- and that employers must reasonably accommodate employees' religious practices.</p>
<p>&quot;These guidelines will ensure that federal employees and employers will respect the rights of those who engage in religious speech as well as those who do not,&quot; said Clinton, a Southern Baptist and regular churchgoer.</p>
<p>A copy of the guidelines released by the White House said federal employers must accommodate an employee &quot;when work schedules interfere with Sabbath or other religious holiday observances or when work rules prevent an employee from wearing religiously compelled dress.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition, an agency must prevent any supervisor or any employee from engaging in religious harassment or creating &quot;a religiously hostile environment&quot; through the use of intimidation, ridicule or insult.</p>
