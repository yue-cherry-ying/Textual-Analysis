<p>Israelis are overwhelmingly unhappy with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's performance on the economy, according to a poll published on Friday to commemorate his first year in office.</p>
<p>A Gallup poll of 491 Israeli Jews for the newspaper Maariv showed 61 percent not satisfied with his economic performance and 29 percent satisfied, while 10 percent did not know or respond. The poll had a 4.5 percent margin of error.</p>
<p>The poll showed that were new elections to be held, Netanyahu would run neck-and-neck with former army chief Ehud Barak, the man most likely to succeed Nobel peace laureate Shimon Peres as leader of the opposition Labour party.</p>
<p>Labour is due to choose a new leader at a June 3 convention.</p>
<p>Of those surveyed, 45 percent would vote for Barak and 40 percent for Netanyahu. Fifteen percent gave no response.</p>
<p>The survey showed Israelis also unhappy with Netanyahu in the realms of security, administration and integrity.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, survivor of a corruption scandal, scored lowest in the area of &quot;proper administration and integrity&quot;. Sixty-five percent said they were dissatisfied with him in these areas while 21 percent were pleased and 14 percent had no response.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, who narrowly edged out Peres last May 29 on a promise to guard Israeli security, found favour in this area with 44 percent of those surveyed. But more were displeased with his security performance -- 49 percent -- while seven percent had no response.</p>
