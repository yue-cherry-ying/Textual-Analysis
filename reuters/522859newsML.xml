<p>The man chosen to head India's new centre-left government was picked by a 15-party coalition that had to balance the clashing ambitions of its leaders and please a disgruntled ally, analysts said.</p>
<p>Inder Kumar Gujral, 77, was named by the United Front on Saturday to replace caretaker prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda and win back vital support from the Congress party after a three-week-old political crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;The key thing was that he must have the widest acceptability within the front and not raise the hackles of the Congress,&quot; Mahesh Rangarajan of New Delhi's Centre for Contemporary Studies told Reuters.</p>
<p>But within an hour of Gujral's nomination, a key regional party pulled out of the government, marking the exit of P. Chidambaram, who, as finance minister, lent a free-market face to the centre-left coalition.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda was defeated by an overwhelming majority in a confidence vote on April 11 after Congress withdrew make-or-break support to him on March 30. Congress said it would renew its backing if a new leader replaced Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>The government was formed last year with Congress support as an alternative to Hindu nationalists, who emerged as the largest group from general elections that threw up a hung parliament.</p>
<p>But Congress accused Deve Gowda last month of not containing the upstart Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), their common foe. Both struggled to avert snap general elections could have strengthened the BJP.</p>
<p>In the wrangling that ensued, clashes linked to castes, regions and personal ambitions cancelled out each other, leaving Gujral as the consensus choice to head a new government.</p>
<p>&quot;He is the least offensive person,&quot; Rangarajan said. &quot;He has impeccable credentials and he's a very sober leader.&quot;</p>
<p>Gujral, foreign minister in the outgoing 10-month-old coaltion, has no political power base to worry potential rivals. At the same time, he has a clean image and proven skills as an administrator.</p>
<p>But cracks appeared in th coaltion minutes after the goateed leader's nomination, exposing the fragility of the delicate choice.</p>
<p>The regional Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC), whose leader G.K. Moopanar was widely seen as a front-runner in the leadership race, said it would not join the new government.</p>
<p>Rangarajan said most United Front members could not accept the TMC, formed last year by breakaway Congress members in their home state, as the government's leader as it was considered too close to Congress.</p>
<p>But Gujral, also a former member of Congress, was acceptable to the coalition because he had rebelled in 1975 against then prime minister Indira Gandhi, showing his own mind, Rangarajan said.</p>
<p>Analysts said Congress, India's oldest party, had withdrawn its support from Deve Gowda because it felt immobilised at being neither in government nor in full opposition.</p>
<p>India Today magazine said Congress president Sitaram Kesri was also hitting back at attempts by the United Front to embroil senior Congress leaders in corruption cases that had already harmed the party.</p>
