<headline>Singapore rubber ends on quiet note, trade modest.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Singapore rubber market closed steady on Friday in largely modest trade as players kept to the sidelines ahead of the spot expiry in Japan of the May contract, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some European dealers were involved in a bit of shortcovering but the whole tone of the market was mostly quiet,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;People were asking for quotes this afternoon, but there were not many takers,&quot; another dealer said. &quot;No one wanted to take an exposed position until the spot expiry in Japan next week.&quot;  </p>
<p>The market drifted for most of the afternoon session, only coming alive towards the end of trade on some modest deals for TSR20 rubber by players doing a bit of covering, dealers said.</p>
<p>A Buddhist holiday in the top rubber-producing countries of Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia coupled with weak offtake kept sentiment subdued.</p>
<p>At 0945 GMT, July RSS3 rubber was unchanged at 113.00 U.S. cents a kg. July RSS1 was seen steady at 161.50 Singapore cents (US$1.13) a kg. July TSR20 was seen also unchanged at 154.75 Singapore cents (US$1.08) a kg.</p>
