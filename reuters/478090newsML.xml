<title>USA: CSCE world sugar ends firmer and at top of range.</title>
<headline>CSCE world sugar ends firmer and at top of range.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE world sugar futures closed sharply higher, with the spot-May contract ending on the key psychological 11.00-cent mark amid speculative and local buying, dealers said.</p>
<p>A dearth of selling allowed May to climb to 10.97 cents early, where it lingered for most of the day. Trade scale-up selling kept a lid on the rally, but aggressive buying on the close pushed the spot month over its upside target of 11.00.</p>
<p>Many trading sources viewed the close at the top of the day's range as a bullish indicator and said May could rack up further gains on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Refco analyst Anne Prendergast stressed that the market failed to break out of its range, however, adding that prices are more likely to retrace gains.</p>
<p>&quot;The specs and locals bought it up because it's not going down,&quot; Prendergast said. &quot;I don't see the justification for the upside move given tepid physical offtake and no compelling bullish news.&quot;</p>
<p>Firm resistance was pegged at 11.15 cents and support around the day's low of 10.78 cents basis the May contract.</p>
<p>The spot month settled 0.15 cent higher to 10.94 cents, having ranged from 11.01 to 10.78 cents. The back months ended 0.13 to 0.06 firmer.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 17,686 lots compared with Monday's official 6,366 lots.</p>
<p>Open interest in May fell 176 lots to 58,478 lots, as of Monday's close. Dealers said players have begun to roll May positions into July.</p>
<p>The last trading day for the May contract is April 30.</p>
