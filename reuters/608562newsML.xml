<p>The first meeting of the UK's new Monetary Policy Committee will take place on June 6, the Bank of England announced on Friday.  </p>
<p>The central bank said the committee would normally meet every month on the Wednesday and Thursday following the first Monday of each month.</p>
<p>The decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee will be announced at 1200 UK local time (currently 1100 GMT) immediately following the Thursday meeting, the bank said.</p>
<p>This arrangement has been varied exceptionally, for June and September of this year, the central bank said.  </p>
<p>The September meeting deviates from the normal procedures because it follows the second not the first Monday in the month.</p>
<p>The bank said the outcome of the meeting would be made on the wire services' Bank of England pages --  BOE/MONEYOPS1 in the case of Reuters.</p>
<p>The dates for the announcements for the rest of the year are: Thursday, July 10</p>
<p>Thursday, August 7</p>
<p>Thursday, September 11</p>
<p>Thursday, October 9</p>
<p>Thursday, November 6</p>
<p>Thursday, December 4  </p>
<p>The Bank of England also listed the names of the members of the interim Monetary Policy Committee which will be deciding the level of UK interest rates until the final nine-member panel has been appointed.</p>
<p>Executive directors Mervyn King and Ian Plenderleith will join Bank of England Governor Eddie George and his deputy Howard Davies on the committee.</p>
<p>The UK Treasury says it has not yet made any appointments to the MPC.</p>
