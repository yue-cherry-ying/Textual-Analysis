<p>Chandrasiri Abbrew stands barefoot on the beach with a beatific look of satisfaction on his face.</p>
<p>At his feet, the tiny creatures pad down to the thunderous waves crashing onto the shore. He shoos off a swooping crow, scares off a prowling dog.</p>
<p>The short but perilous dash to safety is over. They disappear bobbing into the surging breakers and are gone.</p>
<p>For Chandrasiri Abbrew, who has now helped to save more than one million turtles from plundering poachers, it was another job well done and he never tires of the nightly ritual.</p>
<p>&quot;I like animals, I am a happy man. People come to see my turtles every day,&quot; he says, gazing with proprietorial pride at the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery on the storm-tossed western coast of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The spot, fringed by coconut trees and lashed by giant waves, is perfectly chosen. Up to 1,500 turtles a day stagger ashore to lay their eggs in the sand with an unerring homing instinct. CONSERVATIONISTS TEACH FISHERMEN TO SAVE TURTLES</p>
<p>Here you can see five of the world's eight species of turtle -- loggerhead, green turtle, leatherback, hawksbill and the tiny Olive Ridley.</p>
<p>Chandrasiri's hatchery was founded in 1979 through a wildlife conservation grant of $US100,000 from Swedish cameramaker Victor Hasselblad.</p>
<p>Before then, conservation was never a prime concern for the local fishermen who thought nothing of turning the turtle eggs into omelettes.</p>
<p>Some even believed that eating them could boost a man's virility, a boast that had Chandrasiri shaking his head in angry disbelief. MAN THE BIGGEST THREAT TO TURTLE'S SURVIVAL</p>
<p>Poachers cut off their flippers for handbags and ripped off their shells to make combs.</p>
<p>The skies above produce many a peril for the tiny turtles on their dash for freedom. Eagles and crows sweep down to grab them before the sanctuary of the sea is reached.</p>
<p>Even the hatchery is locked at night and surrounded by nets to stop the preying mongoose from breaking in.</p>
<p>But Chandrasiri has no doubt about who is the biggest threat to the turtle.</p>
<p>&quot;The animal is not dangerous. It is people who are dangerous. I am 100 percent sure of that,&quot; he said at the hatchery in this tropical paradise that Marco Polo once called the finest island on earth. FISHERMEN PAID FOR THEIR PAINS NOW SAVE TURTLES</p>
<p>The eggs are taken from the beach, buried again in sand in the safety of the hatchery and then left until they crawl warily from their shells.</p>
<p>They are transferred into one-day, two-day and three-day water tanks before being scooped up in nets, taken down to the beach, tipped up and watched over with almost paternal pride as they head for freedom.</p>
<p>The fishermen who once nonchalantly scooped the eggs up for a snack now bring them to the hatchery and are paid for their pains, a handy supplement to their incomes in the six months when they cannot fish in the monsoon season.</p>
<p>It is a popular tourist attraction and Chandrasiri never tires of explaining the basics of conservation to groups of up to 300 schoolchildren a day who traipse to the hatchery, tucked away down a pot-holed track. SAVING TURTLE LIFELONG MISSION FOR CONSERVATIONIST</p>
<p>When the visitor hands over a 500 rupee (US$8) contribution to the hatchery, he beams with delight.</p>
<p>&quot;That is good. With that money we can now buy 250 eggs from the fishermen. You are a daddy 250 times over,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Saving the turtle for posterity has been a lifelong mission for Chandrasiri but his largesse towards nature does not stop there.</p>
<p>He once helped to hatch a litter of 10 baby pythons and proudly shows off photographs of the writhing mass at his house.</p>
<p>But then he shamefacedly admits: &quot;My wife was not at all pleased. I had to go and release them in the jungle.&quot; TURTLE MAN NEVER TIRES OF SUNSET RITUAL</p>
<p>Chandrasiri never tires of the sunset ritual of scooping up the squirming baby turtles in his net and heading down to the beach as the light gently fades across the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>You can hear the thunderous roar of the waves crashing against the coral reef out to sea. The beach is enveloped in a thin mist of spray. The waves pound down on the shore.</p>
<p>Over goes the net on the sand, out roll the tiny turtles and finally begins the incredible journey on a life than can last up to 200 years.</p>
