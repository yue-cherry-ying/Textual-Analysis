<title>FRANCE: Suez shareholders want sweeteners to back merger.</title>
<headline>Suez shareholders want sweeteners to back merger.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shareholders in Compagnie de Suez are looking for a payout of around 10 percent of its financial assets ahead of any merger with utilities group Lyonnaise des Eaux, Jean-Louis Beffa, head of glassmaker Saint-Gobain, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He told a news conference Saint-Gobain, which holds just over six percent of Suez, along with banking group Banque Nationale de Paris and insurer Axa-UAP wanted the payout. BNP and Axa had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Suez, which has confirmed that it is holding merger talks with Lyonnaise des Eaux, also declined comment. The two companies are to hold special board meetings on April 11 to discuss the merger.</p>
<p>Beffa said that the merger plans seemed reasonable, but contained some element of risk.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that it would not be bad for Suez shareholders, given the disappointments they have had in the past, and given the bet they are ready to take to put their financial assets behind a new strategy, to give them a reasonable share, by redistributing financial assets to them.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to say that out of the 34 billion francs ($6 billion) in financial assets, a distribution of around 10 percent to shareholders would not seem shocking to me,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>This was not just a demand being made by Saint-Gobain.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a demand of BNP, of Saint Gobain, and of Axa...,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Generale des Eaux, another Suez shareholder and rival to Lyonnaise des Eaux, has also said it plans to try to obtain maximum shareholder value from Suez ahead of any merger.</p>
<p>Suez meanwhile cancelled a planned news conference due on Wednesday to present its 1996 results, but a spokeswoman said it would issue a statement after 1600 GMT on Tuesday. This statement would be on the results only, she said.</p>
<p>The company has repeatedly declined comment on the merger talks, apart from its announcement on Friday that it would hold a special board meeting on April 11 to discuss the plan.</p>
<p>Analysts have said that a merger could make sense, since Suez had lost its identity after selling off key assets, including investment bank Banque Indosuez. Lyonnaise could however use Suez's big cash pile to help it expand.</p>
<p>Any heavy demands by Suez shareholders for a big payout, could however diminish the value of such a merger to Lyonnaise.</p>
<p>Suez, which was hit badly by a collapse in property prices, made a 1995 net attributable loss of 3.96 billion francs.</p>
<p>Analysts, forecasting the net profit rather than the net attributable profit, the traditional headline figure in France, expect it to report a 1996 net profit of about 1.147 billion francs, doubling to 2.585 billion in 1997.</p>
<p>Shares in both Suez and Lyonnaise fell on Tuesday in line with the market.</p>
<p>Suez shares were down 1.55 percent at 286.4 francs per share at 1110 GMT while Lyonnaise shares were down 2.96 percent at 558 francs while the CAC-40 blue-chip index was down 3.25 percent. ($ = 5.626 French Francs)</p>
