<p>Polish coach Antoni Piechniczek said only a win was good enough to keep alive Poland's World Cup hopes when they play unbeaten Italy on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We must win, not draw, this match because only a win keeps alive our chances of qualifying,&quot; Piechniczek said before the match in the new 32,000-capacity National Stadium in Chorzow.</p>
<p>He has added Marek Citko and Andrzej Juskowiak to an attack that has scored three goals in two qualifiers which have ended in defeat to England and victory over Moldova.</p>
<p>Poland have two games in hand on both group leaders Italy and second-placed England, whom they meet at home on May 31, and in reality must win them both to maintain any hopes of reaching the finals next year.</p>
<p>Juskowiak of Borussia Moenchengladbach and Citko of Widzew Lodz will be faced with the daunting task of breaking through an Italian defence which has conceded just one goal in four wins to date.</p>
<p>Poland, who finished third in the 1974 and 1982 World Cups, have failed to qualify for the last two finals but Piechniczek believes his team are capable of beating the Italians.</p>
<p>&quot;There is one big danger and that is if they score first,&quot; he said. &quot;If they do that it will be difficult to do them any harm. As long as the score remains 0-0 anything is possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Poland's defence wiby Legia Warsaw sweeper Jacek Zielinski but covering Italy's nifty strikers could prove hard for wing-backs Marek Jozwiak of Guingamp and Pawel Wojtala of Hamburg, who usually play different positions.</p>
<p>Italy were never seriously troubled on Saturday, when they beat Moldova 3-0, and can take another big step on the road to France with a win in Poland.</p>
<p>Coach Cesare Maldini makes just one change from the side that beat Moldova with Fabio Cannavaro replacing Alessandro Nesta in defence.</p>
<p>Although they have met in friendlies since, Wednesday's match is the first World Cup tie between the two countries since Italy beat Poland 2-0 in the 1982 World Cup semifinal in Barcelona with Paolo Rossi scoring both goals.</p>
<p>Teams:</p>
<p>Poland - Andrzej Wozniak, Pawel Wojtala, Tomasz Waldoch, Jacek Zielinski, Marek Jozwiak, Adam Ledwon, Piotr Nowak, Piotr Swierczewski, Marek Citko, Wojciech Kowalczyk, Andrzej Juskowiak.</p>
<p>Italy - Angelo Peruzzi, Alessandro Costacurta, Angelo Di Livio, Ciro Ferrara, Fabio Cannavaro, Paolo Maldini, Dino Baggio, Demetrio Albertini, Roberto Di Matteo, Christian Vieri, Gianfranco Zola.</p>
