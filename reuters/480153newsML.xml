<headline>Greek stocks finish lower on slack turnover.</headline>

<text>
<p>Shares in the Athens Stock Exchange surrendered on Tuesday some of the gains made in the previous two sessions when the index climbed 5.6 percent. Banks and construction retreated 2.35 and 3.25 percent respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;Weakness in Wall Street and other European bourses may have affected sentiment but with Alpha Credit Bank, OTE and other blue chips having strong support, the weakness will be temporary. We're headed for dividend distributions as well,&quot; an analyst said.</p>
<p>The bourse's benchmark index finished 16.36 points or 1.20 percent lower at 1,352.46.</p>
<p>OTE telecom bucked the trend adding 1.65% to close at 5,845, boosted by a buy recommendation by HSBC James Capel. Shares of Titan Cement also cushioned the market index, climbing 2.72% percent.</p>
<p>Turnover was subdued at 11.9 billion drachmas with 2.9 million shares changing hands about half the previous session's business.</p>
<p>Decliners led advancers 167 to 51 with 21 issues unchanged on 239 traded.</p>
<p>The Merrill Lynch call spread warrant on OTE with a strike price of 3,800 drachmas was quoted at 997.00-1035.00. Shares of OTE telecom, the underlying, closed up 95 drachmas at 5,845.</p>
<p>The recently launched ING Baring Financial Products American style call warrant based on a basket of six bank stocks was quoted at $49.20-$50.89. The strike price is set at $99.60 and the warrants expire October 8, 1997.</p>
<p>The recently issued ING Baring Financial Products American- style call warrant on a basket of six blue-chips denominated in drachmas was quoted at 1,799-1,982 drachmas.</p>
<p>The strike price is set at 10,000 drachmas and the warrants expire on February 2, 1998.</p>
