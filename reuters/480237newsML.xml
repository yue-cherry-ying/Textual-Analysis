<title>UK: London gold firm in Europe after Easter holiday.</title>
<headline>London gold firm in Europe after Easter holiday.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Gold started the post-Easter week on a firmer footing on Tuesday, but the white metals were treading on shakier territory.</p>
<p>Dealers said sharp losses on Wall Street on Thursday and Monday had helped to attract investors to gold, buoying prices.</p>
<p>Bullion fixed at $349.85 an ounce compared to $348.15 last Thursday before the London market closed for a four-day holiday.</p>
<p>But silver, platinum and palladium lost ground amid concerns about industrial demand in the aftermath of last week's hike in U.S. interest rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;That seems a likely scenario. It was a bit of a surprise this morning to see gold up and silver down,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Gold edged under the psychological $350 an ounce level in early Europe but dealers said it was well supported just below.</p>
<p>&quot;The $350 level may have been too high for gold. I'd guess $348-$351 will be the range for gold until New York opens later, at which time the range will widen considerably,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The market was shrugging off fresh news regarding Bre-X Mineral Ltd.'s controversial Busang gold deposit, analysts said. Announcements last week that the deposit may not be as rich as previously thought had shaved about $1.00 off the price of gold.</p>
<p>&quot;The problems of Bre-X/Busang are not an issue for the bullion market, as any mine start-up only starts to have an impact until either a gold loan is raised or future production hedged,&quot; brokers GNI said in a report.</p>
<p>Silver, which tumbled amid fund selling in New York markets on Monday, was still hovering just above the psychological $5.00 an ounce level in early European trading.</p>
<p>It was last indicated at $5.03/$5.05, a decline of nine cents from Thursday's London close. For the time being the $5.00 level should provide support but further weakness could target the $4.80 support level dating from mid-February, dealers said.</p>
<p>Platinum was similarly weaker although the market was very quiet, dealers said.</p>
<p>It was fixed at $369.50 an ounce in the morning, compared to $373.50 on Thursday afternoon, in the lowest fixing in five weeks.</p>
<p>Palladium also edged lower to $145.25/$146.25, down $1.25 since Thursday's finish. --Lida Poletz, London newsroom +44 171 542 2936</p>
