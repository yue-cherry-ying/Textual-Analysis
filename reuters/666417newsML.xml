<p>One person was taken to hospital with &quot;a high dose of radiation&quot; on Tuesday after a radiation leak in the nuclear research centre of Arzamas in southern Russia, the Nuclear Energy Ministry said.</p>
<p>A press statement said no radiation had leaked out of the room where the incident happened and the radiation level outside it and in the rest of the town was normal.  </p>
<p>&quot;One man who worked there, he was taken to the local clinic. As for the rest, given that there is a certain level of radiation in the room, they are now de-contaminating it and a commission has left (Moscow) which will deal with this issue,&quot; ministry spokesman Vitaly Nosonov said.</p>
<p>&quot;He's not in a good way. He received a pretty big dose, a high dose and a high dose is 600 roentgen,&quot; he said by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;They were doing some work on the equipment, and they broke the regulations somehow, I don't know what they were doing.&quot;</p>
<p>A statement from the ministry said that radiation levels outside the room and in the town, which is about 50 km (30 miles) from Nizhny Novgorod on the Volga river, were normal.</p>
