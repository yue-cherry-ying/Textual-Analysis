<p>Turkey's planned sales of Turk Telekom, oil refiner Tupras and petroleum distributor Petrol Ofisi are going ahead without delay, the head of the Privatisation Administration (OIB) said.</p>
<p>His comment came as confidence waned in the Islamist-led government's ability to meet its ambitious privatisation targets because of a row with the military over religious activism that is threatening the coalition's future.</p>
<p>Speaking to Reuters on Wednesday evening, OIB chairman Ismail Karakaya said the privatisation plans, which envisage sell-off revenues of $4.5 billion in 1997, were &quot;proceeding as programmed&quot;.</p>
<p>The sell-off targets could be met as long as the government maintained its political support for the programme, he said.</p>
<p>Multi-billion dollar privatisation revenues are a key element of the balanced budget plan devised by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's coalition with conservatives.</p>
<p>Erbakan's recent acknowledgement that the budget target was facing major obstacles has increased pressure to raise money through sell-offs.</p>
<p>The OIB announced on Wednesday that the sale or transfer of companies worth a total $776 million had been approved in March and April. But of this total, only $28.5 million has so far been paid to the OIB.</p>
<p>Karakaya said more privatisations would be put on to the agenda during May. &quot;Privatisation will once more be on Turkey's agenda,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The sales of Tupras and Petrol Ofisi, which have already been proposed to the High Privatisation Board, would first require the resolution of regulatory issues, he said.</p>
<p>The adoption of a new law to ease the tax burden on Tupras and adopt a pricing system in line with market levels is seen as essential, not just for its privatisation but for its survival.</p>
<p>&quot;For these privatisations it is important that the laws connected with regulation are passed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The privatisation chief said a consortium led by Goldman Sachs was continuing an evaluation report on Turk Telekom, the centrepiece of the sell-off programme.</p>
<p>The company said last month the report was expected to be completed by the middle of October which would make it difficult to begin the sell-off process in 1997.</p>
<p>A tender for the sale of part of flat steel producer Eregli Demir Celik Fabrikalari AS was also underway, Karakaya said. An earlier tender process was cancelled due to insufficient buying interest.</p>
