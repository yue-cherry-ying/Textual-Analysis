<headline>BA passengers face strike disruption.</headline>

<p>British Airways Plc (BA) said late on Tuesday that cabin crew who join an impending 72-hour strike will lose perks and face a lock-out unless they promise to work normally in the future.</p>
<p>The promise of immediate sanctions came as cabin crew were due to begin the first of a series of three-day strikes on Wednesday, threatening chaos to thousands of travellers.</p>
<p>&quot;We are asking them to give us an assurance they will work normally before we will rosta them for further flights,&quot; Michael Blunt, spokesman for BA, said.</p>
<p>&quot;If people are going on strike they are preventing our customers enjoying their hard earned holidays, and preventing our business travellers from getting to destinations to win contracts for their companies and we just feel it's inappropriate for people who do that to benefit from their own staff travel privileges,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Blunt said strikers would not be scheduled for work from Saturday and therefore not paid unless they telephoned BA and give them an assurance they would not strike in the future.</p>
<p>He also said that anyone striking on Wednesday would lose their staff travel concessions until March 2000, become ineligible for promotion until the same date, and lose the option of applying for early retirement.</p>
<p>Members of the Transport and General Workers' Union (T&amp;G) were set to begin the strike at 0500 GMT on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Blunt said that last year when a strike threat from its pilots was settled at the last minute it lost 15 million pounds in future bookings.</p>
<p>BA, which operates 1,000 flights a day worldwide, said earlier on Tuesday that it would ask an independent arbitrator to consider the cabin crew union's proposals for saving millions of pounds.</p>
<p>The dispute with its employees follow the airline's plans to save on billion pounds by 2000 through a major restructuring. Earlier negotiations broke down on Sunday.</p>
<p>BA had hoped to save 42 million pounds from its cabin crew operations. But the union's proposals were thought to recommend smaller savings.</p>
<p>T&amp;G has said unless a solution was found it would call for further 72-hour strikes.</p>
<p>BA said its contingency plan, aimed at keeping as many of its flights running as possible, would now swing into action but admitted thousands of passengers may still be grounded.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if the strike is cancelled today, there is likely to be disruption,&quot; a BA spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The airline has cancelled half of its long-haul services from Heathrow on Wednesday and some two-thirds of its intercontinental flights from Gatwick. But worst hit will be short-haul and domestic services from Heathrow.</p>
<p>BA is involved in a separate dispute with ground crew over the sale of its catering division at Heathrow. The workers are expected to announce soon whether they have accepted BA's offer to resolve the row.</p>
