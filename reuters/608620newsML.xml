<p>The absence of veteran politican Etienne Tshisekedi from a transitional government in Kinshasa drew city residents to the newstands on Friday, with some threatening street protests after reading about the decision.</p>
<p>As the city's residents digested the news, ousted Zaire president Mobutu Sese Seko left the West African state of Togo for Morocco on the presidential plane.</p>
<p>Laurent Kabila, whose rebels captured the capital of the former Zaire on May 17, angered many in the city of five million by failing to appoint Tshisekedi prime minister of the new Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>&quot;This is Kabila's first failure. Tshisekedi should be in his government,&quot; businessman Jean-Marie Tshamala told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We are only waiting for Tshisekedi's instruction to take to the streets,&quot; student Kambala Tshala, standing at the same newstand in the Matonge district, chipped in.</p>
<p>Two days behind schedule, self-proclaimed president Kabila late on Thursday announced an incomplete list of 13 cabinet ministers and dropped the position of prime minister.</p>
<p>As soon as he took charge of Africa's third biggest country, Kabila came under intense domestic pressure and some Western encouragement to appoint Tshisekedi to a key post such as the prime ministership.</p>
<p>He brushed aside those calls despite warnings that Tshisekedi, a longtime political foe of Mobutu, remains a hugely popular political figure in the capital of five million.</p>
<p>Senior members of his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL) said six of the ministers on the list, run hourly on Friday by national radio, were not Alliance members.</p>
<p>But the pro-Tshisekedi La Reference newspaper said the Alliance had awarded itself all but four posts.</p>
<p>There was no immediate reaction from Tshisekedi's camp.</p>
<p>But Le Phare, one of the newspapers supporting him, headlined: &quot;Fears for the future&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I am always wary of those who take power by force of arms,&quot; Alain Matama, a civil servant, said in Matonge.</p>
<p>In Togo, witnesses at the airport said Mobutu, who is fighting cancer, was supported on both sides by aides as he climbed onto the plane, which left at 0910 GMT.</p>
<p>Mobutu arrived in Lome from his jungle palace at Gbadolite in northern Zaire on Sunday night, a day after Kabila's rebels marched into Kinshasa.</p>
<p>He initially landed in Togo for a technical stopover but Togolese sources said the government had reluctantly agreed to let him stay longer because of his state of health.</p>
<p>French Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain hinted on Wednesday that France might be prepared to admit Mobutu for medical treatment.</p>
<p>Across the river from Kinshasa, neighbour Congo noted the change of power in former Zaire and said it was ready to support the efforts of the new authorities there to promote democracy.</p>
<p>A statement read on state radio by Foreign Minister Destin Arsene Tsaty-Mboungou said the government wanted to maintain &quot;brotherly relations&quot; with its larger neighbour but it did not mention Kabila by name.</p>
<p>In a tacit acknowledgement of Kabila's decision to rename Zaire as the Democratic Republic of Congo, its tiny neighbour referred to itself as Congo Brazzaville -- the name it used before 1971 when the two nations had the name Congo in common.</p>
<p>&quot;Congo Brazzaville takes note of the arrival of the new authorities and expresses its complete readiness to support their efforts at democratic restructuring,&quot; the minister said.</p>
<p>The statement, agreed by the government at a special cabinet meeting earlier this week, also appealed for international aid to help with an influx of refugees from former Zaire. Aid workers put the total at up to 8,000, mostly Rwandan Hutus.</p>
