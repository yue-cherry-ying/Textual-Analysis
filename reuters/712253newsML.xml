<p>Eliminating the price gap between Japan and the United States for a selection of products would save the Japanese economy about 80 trillion yen, according to a study released on Tuesday by the U.S.-Japan Business Council.</p>
<p>The study, based on 1993 data, was conducted by the U.S. body to show the benefit of deregulating the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Simply eliminating the price gap between Japan and the U.S. for a selection of products would save the Japanese economy about 80 trillion yen,&quot; Michael Jordan, chairman of Westinghouse Electric Corp, told business leaders here.  </p>
<p>Jordan, who is also chairman of the business council, said the 80 trillion yen was about 16 percent of what consumers in the study spent and invested in 1993.</p>
<p>Sixty-five percent of the 80 trillion yen was accounted for by lowered household expenditures, Jordan said. He said large savings would come from greater use of products sold by U.S.-Japan Business Council members.</p>
<p>For example, he said, Japanese consumers would save about 92 billion yen if domestic prices were keyed to the prices offered by U.S. flat glass manufacturers.  </p>
<p>If Japanese manufacturers gave domestic customers the same break he said they gave customers in export markets, an additional 770 billion yen would be saved on the private investment bill, Jordan said.</p>
<p>World prices for beef, pork and wheat in the Japanese market would lower household food bills and restaurant tabs for businesses by over 1 trillion yen.</p>
<p>If lower wholesale prices for U.S. film were passed onto Japanese consumers, they would save about 200 billion yen.</p>
<p>Automotive repairs in Japan would drop by about 18 billion yen if Japanese consumers paid U.S. prices for shock absorbers, Jordan said.</p>
