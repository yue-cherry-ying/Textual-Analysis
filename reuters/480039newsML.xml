<p>Shareholders in Cie de Suez look set to demand a high price for backing its merger plans, in a move which could cool the ardour of its future partner Lyonnaise des Eaux.</p>
<p>Glassmaker Saint-Gobain, which holds a stake of slightly over six percent in Suez, said on Tuesday it was seeking a big payout ahead of any merger and said it planned to sell some of its shares in the holding company.</p>
<p>Saint-Gobain head Jean-Louis Beffa, who suggested a payout equivalent to some 3.4 billion francs ($604.3 million), said his demand was shared by other Suez shareholders including banking group Banque Nationale de Paris and insurer Axa-UAP.</p>
<p>BNP and Axa had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>But analysts said the call for a payout could reduce Lyonnaise's interest in a merger with Suez, whose big cash pile estimated at some five to six billion francs the utilities group needs to finance its expansion.</p>
<p>Suez is seeking an identity after selling many of its key assets, including investment bank Banque Indosuez.</p>
<p>Beffa's comment that Saint Gobain would sell an unspecified portion of its stake in Suez also implied a lack of confidence in the new group, one analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;Asking for a special dividend immediately is effectively saying that this money can be used in a better way than in the new group,&quot; Jerome Labin at brokers Pinatton said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is saying indirectly that you do not believe the new group will show enough profitability,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Suez has declined all comment on its talks with Lyonnaise, except to say that the boards of both companies will hold special meetings on April 11 to discuss a merger plan.</p>
<p>The Suez board was also due to meet on Tuesday afternoon to approve 1996 results, expected to show a return to profit after a net attributable loss of 3.96 billion francs in 1995.</p>
<p>But Suez cancelled a news conference on the results due on Wednesday, apparently to avoid questions about the merger, and said it would issue a statement on its results later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>French newspapers have suggested that Suez and Lyonnaise, which held unsuccessful merger discussions two years ago, would have to steer a fine line to make their alliance work while maintaining the backing of Suez shareholders.</p>
<p>&quot;Suez and Lyonnaise des Eaux seem resolved to carry out this merger, but not at any price. If certain Suez shareholders go too far, they would prefer to cancel rather than get involved in something removing value or implying dismemberment,&quot; Le Monde newspaper said over the weekend.</p>
<p>Beffa said Suez should give its shareholders a special payout in recognition of the fact they had supported it through troubled times, when it was hit by heavy property losses.</p>
<p>He said this payout should represent some 10 percent of financial assets, which he estimated at 34 billion francs -- two-thirds of Suez's total assets of 53 to 56 billion francs.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that it would not be bad for Suez shareholders, given the disappointments they have had in the past, and given the bet they are ready to take to put their financial assets behind a new strategy, to give them a reasonable share, by redistributing financial assets to them,&quot; Beffa said.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to say that out of the 34 billion francs in financial assets, a distribution of around 10 percent to shareholders would not seem shocking to me,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>This was not just a demand being made by Saint-Gobain.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a demand of BNP, of Saint Gobain, and of Axa,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Generale des Eaux, another Suez shareholder and rival to Lyonnaise des Eaux, has also said it plans to try to obtain maximum shareholder value from Suez ahead of any merger.</p>
<p>And although Generale des Eaux head Jean-Marie Messier has denied he might launch a hostile bid for Suez to counter the Lyonnaise merger, industry sources have suggested he would do everything else possible to block it.</p>
<p>Shares in Lyonnaise were down 2.78 percent at 559 francs at 1145 GMT, while Suez shares were down 1.07 percent at 287.8 francs, while the CAC-40 blue chip index was down three percent.</p>
