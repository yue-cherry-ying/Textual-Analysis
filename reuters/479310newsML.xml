<headline>FORECAST -- Flatter U.S. yield curve seen into Q4.</headline>

<p>The U.S. Treasury yield curve is bound to feel the squeeze if the Federal Reserve continues to keep inflation under its heel by lifting interest rates, said economists in a Reuters poll.</p>
<p>On average, the 28 experts surveyed on Monday and Tuesday forecast the spread between the two-year note yield and the 30-year T-bond yield to initially widen to 71 basis points in May from 67 currently.  Then they expect it to flatten to 58 basis points in July, 48 in October and 45 in April, 1998.  </p>
<p>The average forecast calls for the two-year note to rise as high as 6.61 percent by October 1997, then recede back to 6.48 percent by April 1998. Meanwhile, the specialists projected the bellwether 30-year T-bond yield would rise modestly, to 7.17 percent by July before dipping to 6.93 percent a year from now.</p>
<p>Kurt Karl, chief economist at WEFA Inc's U.S. forecasting center, predicted the federal funds target rate would scratch the 6.25-percent surface by yearend. Under Karl's interest rate scenario, the two-year note will rise more than the seven-year note and the fed funds rate will increase more than the two-year note.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's kind of a flattening of the yield curve during the course of this Fed action,&quot; he said. &quot;What we expect to happen would be a flattening throughout most of this year, and then, towards yearend, starting to see some improvement, particularly at the long end,&quot; Karl added.</p>
<p>The idea of more Fed tightening this year is not unprecedented. The latest Reuters Fed poll found 15 of 31 economists are calling for the Federal Reserve to boost the fed funds rate an additional 25 basis points at the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 20.  </p>
<p>And 23 of 28 experts said that by early July, the Fed will have raised that target rate to at least 5.75 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The Fed is ahead of the game and it has a lot of credibility,&quot; said Richard Koss, international strategist at MFR Inc, referring to the Fed's decision last week to increase the Fed funds target rate to 5.50 percent. &quot;If you get some moves, it might be in two-year notes ... But I don't think inflationary expectations have risen at all through this move, and so, the long end really ought to be relatively stable through all this,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Most analysts agreed that the Fed is intent on subduing potential inflation by raising rates to moderate economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;(The Fed) is trying to engineer some moderation in growth to prevent inflation from getting out of hand,&quot; said Carol Stone, senior economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. She said she would not be surprised to see growth forecasts for 1998 dipping below 2.0 percent.</p>
<p>Economists said moderate growth in 1998 could set up a conducive rally environment for the long bond. But if a careless Fed beats up on dead inflation with unecessary rate hikes, the economy could conceivably slump into a recession, others said.  </p>
<p>&quot;All (another) rate hike does for us is increase the chance of a recession,&quot; from about 10 percent to 30 percent, said Smith Barney's Sharp.</p>
<p>Full results of the survey follow.  </p>
<p>Expectations of spread contraction were based on the assumption that the central bank will again raise short-term interest rates near term, the experts said. And tighter monetary policy, coupled with little or no inflation, will prompt the short end of the yield curve to move more swiftly than the long end, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;During a Fed tightening phase without the acceleration of inflation, the yield curve tends to tighten quite a bit,&quot; said Smith Barney economist Bill Sharp. &quot;You're squashing near-term growth with expectations of future inflation (coming) down, so the two-year note goes a little bit higher,&quot; he said.  </p>
