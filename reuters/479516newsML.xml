<headline>Indian cotton ranged on low buying, few supplies.</headline>

<text>
<p>Cotton prices were steady in a narrow price band on the local market on Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Fresh mill buying remained low but negligible supplies kept prices quiet.</p>
<p>&quot;Supplies were affected due to ongoing nationwide strike by the transport operators to protes against service tax and hike in the insurance premium,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>In spot deals Bengal-deshi was quiet at 890/930 rupees per maund (37.32 kg) while Punjab saw-ginned was steady at 1,525/1,660 rupees per maund. F-414 was available at the previous level of 1,880/1,900 rupees per maund.</p>
<p>Gujarat Kalyan (medium-staple) was steady at 13,200/13,500 rupees per candy (355.56 kg).</p>
<p>&quot;Superior varieties too remained steady despite shortage of ready stock as mill buying remained at low ebb,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>Gujarat Sankar-4 (long-staple) was quiet at 16,500/17,000 rupees per candy for the average variety and at 18,000/19,500 rupees for the superior variety.</p>
<p>Sentiment was subdued at the close in the absence of any release of fresh export quota by the Indian government. Reports that the Indian government prefers the export of value-added cotton yarn instead of raw cotton also softened market sentiment. --Bombay Commodities +91-22-265 9000</p>
