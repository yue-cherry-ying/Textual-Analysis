<title>USA: CME lumber futures close up on firmer cash tone.</title>
<headline>CME lumber futures close up on firmer cash tone.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Reports of cash lumber selling at higher prices boosted CME lumber futures from early losses and late fund buying then took futures up to new day's highs late, traders said.</p>
<p>Lumber closed $0.50 to $5.90 per thousand board feet higher with May up $4.50 at $385.00 and July up $4.60 at $376.60 per tbf.</p>
<p>Futures turned up on reports of cash spruce trading in the $378 to $382 per tbf area. Talk of slow cash trade had weighed on futures early despite the February construction spending report showing the fastest rate rise since March of last year, traders said.</p>
<p>Fund buying then lifted prices to new day's highs in late dealings, they said.</p>
<p>Some underlying support was also linked to a lack of reports of a sudden rise in exports from Canada at the start of the new quota year, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;There didn't appear to be a big influx of lumber based on the new quota year, at least to this point,&quot; said Neil Schmaedick, Smith Barney Forest Products analyst.</p>
<p>Schmaedick said this may be part of the reason for developing strength in the cash lumber market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think some retailers have waited to make purchases til after the first of the (quota) year, thinking that they would get lower prices,&quot; Schmaedick said. &quot;At this point that hasn't developed so some people are stepping forward on the retail side and filling in what they need to buy.&quot;</p>
