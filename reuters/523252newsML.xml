<p>Saudi Arabia, still counting the dead and injured in a fire during the Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca, tightened security to prevent foreign pilgrims from overstaying in the country, witnesses said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Saudi authorities have set up checkpoints at all exit routes from Mecca to ensure that non-resident haj pilgrims return to their home countries,&quot; one witness told Reuters by telephone on returning to Riyadh.</p>
<p>&quot;Saudi police and immigration have set up more than 15 checkpoints between Mecca and Riyadh,&quot; said another witness who travelled 970 km (600 miles) by car to the Saudi capital from the holy city.</p>
<p>&quot;They are checking documents, searching personal belongings and questioning people,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>At least 343 people were killed and 1,537 injured when fire swept through tents in a vast pilgrim camp at Mena, 11 km (seven miles) from Mecca, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Foreign diplomats said they were still waiting for Saudi Arabia to list the victims. Officials were still struggling to track down the missing and identify the dead, many of them burnt beyond recognition.</p>
<p>An Indian haj official in Mecca, contacted by Reuters, said pilgrimage staff were conducting a survey to identify the missing and the dead. He said he would not have a final figure for at least 24 hours.</p>
<p>The Riyadh resident said checkpoints could be seen on the 55 km (34 mile) highway leading to the Red Sea city of Jeddah from Mecca, site of Islam's holiest shrine the Kaaba at the centre of the city's Grand Mosque.</p>
<p>Thousands of haj pilgrims, mainly from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, are known to take advantage of their presence in Saudi Arabia and stay beyond their haj visa to seek work in violation of the kingdom's strict immigration laws.</p>
<p>Saudi authorities say such visa violators pose a security threat and they have organised nation-wide campaigns to arrest and deport absconders.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Prince Nayef said previously that more than 14,000 people who stayed over after their pilgrimage were deported last year. More than 1,000 Indians including 150 child beggars were deported in March.</p>
<p>Officials said earlier that 1.8 million people performed the pilgrimage this year, more than 1.2 million of them from abroad.</p>
<p>Saudi newspapers said authorities were implementing stringent measures to uproot visa absconders including holding licensed Mutawef firms (eqivalent to tour operators) responsible for the return of their registered pilgrims to their countries.</p>
<p>Visitors from outside the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council are required to register with Mutawef firms as a prerequisite for obtaining a haj visa.</p>
<p>Besides Saudi Arabia, the GCC includes Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.</p>
<p>Newspapers said the ministry of haj and endowments had asked Mutawef firms to supply lists of incoming and outgoing pilgrims.</p>
<p>&quot;Mutawef firms have to prove to the ministry that a person not on their departure list is either missing because of the fire or dead,&quot; a Riyadh resident just back from Mecca said.</p>
<p>&quot;A missing person could be dead or could very well be someone who made a lucky escape through the checkpoints,&quot; he said.</p>
