<p>The brother of an Australian nurse murdered in Saudi Arabia brushed off on Tuesday what his lawyers said was an appeal for mercy by the lawyer of two British nurses charged with the killing.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not going to be pushed around by the defence lawyers or the press regarding what to do here,&quot; Frank Gilford, 58, said in a statement issued by his lawyers in Saudi Arabia, the International Law Firm (ILF).</p>
<p>&quot;I am surprised, though, that their lawyers are making this appeal before there has been a trial,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Salah al-Hejailan -- the lawyer of Deborah Parry, 41, and Lucille McLauchlan, 31, who were charged with murdering Yvonne Gilford -- denied he had issued a clemency appeal.</p>
<p>&quot;That is absolutely not true,&quot; Hejailan told Reuters.</p>
<p>A statement by Hejailan's firm confirmed a document was sent to the ILF on March 29, but said it was &quot;a rationale for the early waiver of the death penalty&quot; and not an appeal for mercy.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand that some outside observers consider the practice of seeking clemency from the victim's family before the trial to be a 'high risk strategy' in that it could be misunderstood, so they say, as a pre-judgment of guilt,&quot; Hejailan said in the 17-page paper, which was faxed to Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;But in reality and in the Islamic context there is nothing daring or risky about an early approach to the victim's family. On the contrary, it is the culturally accepted way of dealing with and properly channelling otherwise uncontrollable emotions in the aftermath of an alleged murder,&quot; Hejailan said.</p>
<p>Under Islamic sharia law, which is enforced in Saudi Arabia, people convicted of premeditated murder are normally subject to the death penalty unless the victim's family grants clemency.</p>
<p>Parry and McLauchlan were charged with murdering their 55-year-old colleague in her dormitory room at the King Fahd military medical complex in the oil-rich city of Dhahran on December 11. She had been stabbed, bludgeoned and suffocated.</p>
<p>No date for a trial has been set.</p>
<p>Gilford's family in Australia had previously ruled out clemency, saying the two should face the maximum punishment.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a mercy appeal and our client has responded to the extent that he wishes to at this time,&quot; said ILF lawyer Jim Phipps.</p>
<p>Saudi police said the nurses confessed to the murder and the confessions had been filed with a board of three judges.</p>
<p>But Hejailan's firm said the women had withdrawn their confessions, and one of them had retracted a statement saying she had a lesbian relationship with the victim. The women said the confessions had been extracted under duress, the firm said.</p>
<p>The ILF said Gilford responded to the nurses' claims of duress with disbelief. &quot;How can I take their claim seriously when their own lawyer says the authorities have been fair,&quot; Gilford said in the statement.</p>
<p>Hejailan has maintained that the nurses have been treated well since their arrest.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not at all inconsistent that the nurses maintain that the confession was given under duress but to say overall that the treatment of the nurses has been fair and balanced,&quot; Hejailan's colleague Robert Thoms said on Tuesday.</p>
