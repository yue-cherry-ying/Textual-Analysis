<title>SLOVAKIA: Slovak central bank sees crown pressure easing.</title>
<headline>Slovak central bank sees crown pressure easing.</headline>

<p>The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) said on Friday it expected the pressure on the Slovak currency to ease in the coming days and that the crown rate against hard curencies should then stabilise.</p>
<p>&quot;Our strategy of keeping the crown market short of liquidity and thus preventing speculative crown borrowing and subsequent short selling into hard currencies seems to be working and that is why we expect the downward pressure to ease in the near future,&quot; NBS Treasury Director Frantisek Szulenyi told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Szulenyi would not disclose at which levels the NBS would be satisfied with the crown rate.</p>
<p>The Slovak and Czech crowns have for the past week been under strong speculative pressure, mainly from foreign banks.</p>
<p>The Czech National Bank (CNB) has intervened several times on the market to boost the ailing currency this week, but the NBS has only indirectly intervened through its regular fixing.</p>
<p>Another NBS official, Chief Dealer Peter Andresic, rejected media reports on Thursday that the NBS had told local banks they did not have to quote crown depo rates to foreigners.</p>
<p>&quot;We have only told them that they do not have to quote deposit rates as they had to under the original agreement between the NBS and the eight reference banks,&quot; Andresic said.  </p>
<p>The agreement between NBS and the eight largest banks -- known also as the reference banks -- stipulated that the reference banks must quote minimum amounts of 20 million Slovak crowns with certain small spreads on their quotations.</p>
<p>&quot;This obligation will not be valid for some time due to the specific situation on money and FX markets,&quot; Andresic said.</p>
<p>&quot;But this applies to the entire banking sector, including trading with depo funds among local banks, and it cannot be understood as a measure against foreign banks,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Traders on the money market said the banks were not quoting crown deposit rates due to a liquidity squeeze resulting from the NBS strategy of keeping the banking sector short to discourage speculative short selling of crowns.</p>
<p>Dealers said some banks were only willing to offer crown depo rates for 1,000 percent, though no deals at such high levels were so far confirmed.</p>
<p>The liquidity crunch and tight foreign exchange position pushed Slovak banks to cut liquidity on the FX spot market.</p>
<p>Dealers added the Slovak banks were only quoting one million in dollars and 1.5 million in marks, but that the banks kept quoting both bid and offer and which maintained the convertibility of the crown.</p>
