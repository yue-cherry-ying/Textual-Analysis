<p>French shares closed sharply lower on Tuesday, catching up with two big falls on Wall Street posted while Paris was closed for Good Friday and Easter, brokers said.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 index ended 74.86 points or 2.82 percent lower at 2,581.82 after steadying near the close. It had reached a low of 2,556.15 during the day.</p>
<p>April futures were 87 points lower at 2,571.</p>
<p>The market closed just before the release of the U.S. National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) index for March, which rose to 55 from 53.1.</p>
<p>The biggest loser was Franco-Belgian CLF-Dexia France, down 7.58 percent at 561 francs. Dexia announced a 13.1 percent rise in 1996 net income to 19.4 billion Belgian francs and said it expected a further rise in its 1997 results.</p>
<p>The bank said it had the means for acquisitions but had no candidates in sight. Brokers Cheuvreux de Virieu issued a sell recommendation.</p>
<p>Michelin, up 0.45 percent at 336 francs, was the sole gainer of the blue chip shares after a late recovery.</p>
<p>Chargeurs Intl rose 1.74 pct to 356 francs.</p>
<p>Lyonnaise des Eaux, down 3.65 percent at 554 francs, underperformed the market as analysts said investors were scaling down their expectations of benefits from a possible merger with Cie de Suez.</p>
<p>Suez was 1.72 percent lower at 285.9 francs ahead of the publication of its 1996 results.</p>
<p>Suez and Lyonnaise said on Friday they were in merger talks and would make a proposal to special board meetings on April 11.</p>
<p>Saint-Gobain, which has more than six percent in Suez, said it wanted Suez to make a special payment of 10 percent of its financial assets, which it put at 34 billion francs, to shareholders. This would be 22 francs per Suez share.</p>
<p>Saint-Gobain closed down 4.93 percent at 810 francs amid price worries after a profit warning by rival Pilkington Plc of Britain last week.</p>
<p>Saint-Gobain chairman Jean-Louis Beffa said European glass prices would take time to recover.</p>
