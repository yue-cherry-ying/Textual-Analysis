<p>South Korea has approved a second joint venture project in North Korea, a $5.8 million investment in a water bottling plant, a unification ministry statement said on Friday.</p>
<p>The ministry also said that leading consumer electronics maker LG Electronics Inc was one of four companies given the go-ahead to seek business opportunities across the border.</p>
<p>LG was eyeing a $4.5 million investment assembling colour televisions in Pyongyang or the western port city of Nampo, the statement said.</p>
<p>Textile maker Taechang Co would take a 60 percent stake in the bottling project with a North Korean trading firm in the eastern province of Kangwon.</p>
<p>The venture aimed to bottle 76,000 tonnes of mineral water each year for export to the South, a company official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The North Korean side was very aggressive in wanting to form the joint venture,&quot; the ministry statement said.</p>
<p>The spate of approvals indicated some thawing in South Korea's attitude towards investment in its impoverished neighbour, where industry has collapsed and citizens are going hungry because of chronic food shortages.</p>
<p>The only other approved joint venture from South Korea is Daewoo Corp's $5.12 million investment in a clothing maker in Nampo, which began operations last August.</p>
<p>South Korea's investment in the North has been negligible even though its stated policy is to promote economic exchanges to achieve national reconciliation.</p>
<p>The two Koreas have been technically at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended with a truce.</p>
<p>Hardliners in the South oppose investments that they say will only prolong the life of a hostile government in the North and benefit its armed forces by shoring up the country's industrial base.</p>
<p>The Seoul government also frets that large investment projects in the North supported by resident South Koreans could become hostage at times of political crisis.</p>
<p>But South Korea's mighty industrial conglomerates are anxious to enter the country, albeit with small and relatively risk-free investments.</p>
<p>Of the three other companies approved to search for business in the North, Hanwha Co planned to invest $900,000 in a plant to make plastic floor mats, transferring production from existing operations in the South.</p>
<p>Shinil Leather Garment Ltd wanted to process and make leather garments in Rajin or Sonbong within a free trade zone bordering China and Russia. It envisaged a $3 million investment, the ministry statement said.</p>
<p>Miheung Foods Co wanted to harvest and process seafood in a $150,000 venture.</p>
<p>&quot;Our government will seriously consider any further applications from local companies depending on the development of inter-Korean relations and North Korea's attitude,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Approvals were given with priority for small- and medium-sized firms, though large companies were also included,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The government also considered targetted areas, sectors and the scale of investment, as well as the enthusiasm of firms that wanted to invest and the response from the North Korean side,&quot; the statement added.</p>
