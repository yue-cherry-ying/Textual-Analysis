<title>NORWAY: Norway begins mediation in stalled wage talks.</title>
<headline>Norway begins mediation in stalled wage talks.</headline>

<p>Norwegian state-appointed mediator Reidar Webster began an effort on Tuesday to broker a compromise in deadlocked nationwide wage talks between workers and management.</p>
<p>&quot;I will listen to the views of the parties today and then I will consider what to do,&quot; Webster told reporters before the mediation got underway.</p>
<p>Webster chaired a meeting with the delegations of the Trade Union Confederation (LO) and the Confederation of Trade and Industry (NHO).</p>
<p>He has until midnight (2200gmt) on Sunday to mediate a deal betweeen the parties, whose negotiations collapsed on March 19 after five days of talks.</p>
<p>LO, which is expected to call strikes if the mediation fails to produce agreement, broke off the talks with NHO because the latter refused to accept early retirement for some workers.</p>
<p>The parties also disagreed on whether some local groups were entitled to negotiate extra wage increases on a central basis in the talks, which are supplementary only to the two-year central wage talks which took place last year.</p>
<p>NHO says last year's nationwide talks meant real term wage growth of nearly three percent, helping to fuel inflation and hurting the competitiveness of Norwegian export industry.</p>
<p>LO chairman Yngve Haagensen, citing Norwegian law, was tightlipped about what strike action may be taken.</p>
<p>&quot;When we are in a labour conflict the state mediator, in accordance with the law, asks us to refrain from taking action for two weeks,&quot; he said in response to a question.</p>
<p>Asked if he expected mediation to be tough, he said: &quot;No worse than other wage talks&quot;.</p>
<p>A series of strikes hurting the offshore and manufacturing industries marred Norway's labour scene for a few months last year after state-led mediation failed to bring parties together in time.</p>
