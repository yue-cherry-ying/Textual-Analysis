<p>Wales national soccer manager Bobby Gould apologised on Tuesday for comments made to disgruntled Nathan Blake -- but denied he was a racist.</p>
<p>Bolton striker Blake said earlier on Tuesday that he had refused to play in Wales' World Cup qualifier against Belgium on Saturday because of comments made by Gould last week in training and after Wales's match against the Netherlands last November.</p>
<p>Speaking on BBC Radio 5, Gould denied that he had been racist but apologised for &quot;any misunderstanding.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The situation was that I was selecting teams for a five-a-side,&quot; said Gould. &quot;I told some players to put on yellow bibs, some to put on green and said 'Nathan, you stay with the blacks,' those with black sweaters on.</p>
<p>&quot;For that I apologise but never in my life have I been taken to task over racism.&quot;</p>
