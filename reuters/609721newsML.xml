<title>USA: Fed refrains from open market operations.</title>

<p>The Federal Reserve refrained from open market operations, as expected, during their usual intervention period on Friday.</p>
<p>The Fed injected reserves into the banking system on Thursday via five-day fixed system repurchase agreements.</p>
<p>Analysts interpreted Thursday's operation as an attempt by the central bank to provide the market with sufficient liquidity to span the long Memorial Day Holiday weekend.</p>
<p>By Tuesday, the Fed should get a more accurate estimate on currency demand over the holiday and will likely come in with multi-day day system RPs, analysts said.</p>
<p>With the add need growing in coming weeks, analysts said a permanent injection of reserves could come any time during this period via an outright purchase of bills or, less likely, a coupon pass.</p>
<p>The Fed has performed a bill pass within two weeks after Memorial Day for six of the last seven years, though the add need this year is not so large as to make one a sure bet, analysts said.</p>
<p>At midmorning on Friday, the federal funds rate was trading at 5-3/8 percent, below its 5-1/2 percent target rate.</p>
