<text>
<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates pared their initial rise to close up 25 basis points at 18.25 percent on Thursday after the peso reversed early weakness to close firmer, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market opened under pressure, which eased considerably after trade balance data were released,&quot; a fixed-income analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;The peso, which had been sold off, was then in demand and that boosted market liquidity,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Benchmark 48-hour peso contracts closed 1.8 centavos firmer at 7.9060/7.9110 per dollar.  </p>
<p>The Finance Ministry revised March's trade surplus to $636 million, up from a preliminary figure of $565 million.</p>
<p>Overnight Cetes rates had opened up at 19.25 percent.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico drained 1.214 billion pesos from the secondary market by placing three direct sales of Cetes and two repos.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper meanwhile ended down 20 basis points at 19.75 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said secondary rates could ease further on Friday in response to milder than expected inflation data released in late trade.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico announced the consumer price index increased by 1.08 percent, compared to an average forecast of 1.11 percent in a previously conducted Reuters survey MEX22.</p>
<p>Liquidity of 176 million pesos was scheduled to return to the system on Friday from prior central bank participation.</p>
