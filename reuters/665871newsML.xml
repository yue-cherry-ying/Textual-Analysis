<p>The southern African economic bloc of 12 states should unite in the battle against AIDS in one of the world's worst affected regions, the EU's South Africa ambassador Erwan Fouere said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Speaking at the presentation of two EU-sponsored research documents on the integration of HIV/AIDS into development by the University of Natal's economic development unit, Fouere said the outlook was grim for the Southern African Development Community (SADC).</p>
<p>United Nations figures showed 14 million people in sub- Saharan Africa had Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) </p>
<p>&quot;I am sure it is going to get worse. The statistics are very alarming, and because the frontiers are so porous and the migratory movements are so enormous it is very difficult to control the increase of infections,&quot; Fouere said.</p>
<p>&quot;It will make much more sense for the region to get together to deal with the problem than if each country dealt with it individually.</p>
<p>&quot;SADC have now adopted health issues, and AIDS in particular, as an important item on their agenda. I think it is about time because this is an issue that has been confronting us and is getting worse and worse,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The research, which took over two years, investigated ways of integrating HIV/AIDS into development planning by national and provincial governments and business, said Alan Whiteside of the university's economic research unit.</p>
<p>It also looked at the implications of the HIV/AIDs epidemic in the provision of development assistance by the EU.</p>
<p>Whiteside said ante-natal testing in Botswana and Zimbabwe showed that over 30 percent of pregnant women in major centres were HIV positive. About six percent of South Africans, or some 2.5 million people, had AIDS and would die.</p>
<p>&quot;In practice, the net cost to the economy will be virtually impossible to quantify. Much will depend on the way in which the economy responds to the inevitable changes in relative prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Eventhough the net effect of these changes cannot be accurately documented, it is clear there will be an adverse impact,&quot; the research documents said.</p>
