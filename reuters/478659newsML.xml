<p>Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino said on Tuesday that the feared Shik secret police were &quot;no more&quot; and anyone describing himself as a Shik agent was &quot;a liar&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Since yesterday, there is no more Shik in Albania,&quot; he said during a meeting in the town of Gjirokaster with rebel leaders who seized control of the south last month.  </p>
<p>Fino said he and President Sali Berisha had met Shik boss Bashkim Gazidede and his deputy Bujar Rama three days ago and formally accepted their resignations.</p>
<p>Local reporters said Fino told the meeting that Finance Minister Arben Malaj, who was accompanying him in Gjirokaster, had stopped all funds for the sinister, black-leathered Shik police on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to build a new intelligence service, with a new face,&quot; Fino said. &quot;From now, anyone who identifies himself as a Shik officer is a liar.&quot;</p>
