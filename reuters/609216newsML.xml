<p>The Dow Jones industrial average soared to a record close on Friday, and bonds ended a short session slightly higher before the three-day U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The dollar ended a volatile week lower.</p>
<p>A wave of buying sent stocks leaping as Wall Street prepared for the three-day Memorial Day holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq's inability to keep up with the Dow's ascent into record ground had been seen by market analysts as a potential Achilles' heel for Wall Street.</p>
<p>But high technology and smaller-name stocks began closing the gap on blue chips over the past three weeks. And with many traders exiting early Friday ahead of the holiday, the bulls easily carried the day.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been a real change in sentiment in the smaller cap stocks and in high technology stocks towards a more positive view,&quot; said James Volk, director of equity trading at Jensen Securities.</p>
<p>The stock market got relief this week from a Fed decision not to raise interest rates but after this week's sharp gains, any renewed worries that the central bank will raise rates at its next meeting in early July will put fresh selling pressure on stocks, said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer of Value Line's Asset Management division.</p>
<p>Next week could lead to choppy trading as investors fret over the long-bond yield possibly cracking the key 7 percent level, said Gregory Nie, technical analyst at EVEREN Securities.</p>
<p>Bonds were quiet, with the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond up 1/32 at 95-15/32 and yielding 6.99 percent.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average was up 87.78 points, or 1.21 percent, at 7,345.91, setting its 20th record so far this year as it beat its May 15 milestone of 7,333.55. For the week it closed up 151.24 points.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index set a new high, closing up 17.12 points at 1,389.72, its first record since late January, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 11.37 to a new high of 847.03.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to 115.65 yen by the close from 116.13 on Thursday and fell to 1.6930 marks from 1.6945.</p>
<p>Grain and soybean prices fell after weather forecasters predicted showers next week in the U.S. Midwest, which should benefit newly planted crops.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for July delivery closed 10-1/2 cents a bushel lower at $8.36 and corn for July delivery fell 2-3/4 cents a bushel to $2.70-1/2.</p>
<p>Wheat prices also closed mostly lower, with wheat for July delivery ending at $3.75 a bushel, down 2-1/4 cents.</p>
<p>At the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee closed mostly lower in thin trade ahead of the long weekend as speculators took profits after a two-day rally. Coffee for July delivery ended 3.45 cents a pound lower at 256.85 cents.</p>
<p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil prices closed lower in a last-minute sell-off. Crude oil for July delivery fell 23 cents to close at $21.63 a barrel.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index ended 10.0 higher at 4,661.8, falling 32.1 from last Friday. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average rose 131.61 points or 0.66 percent to end at 20,009.00, down 315.73 from last week.</p>
