<p>Miles Simon and 19-year-old Mike Bibby led Arizona to its first national collegiate basketball championship Monday, winning a gutty 84-79 overtime victory over defending champion Kentucky.</p>
<p>Simon, the Final Four Most Valuable Player and Arizona's team leader although a junior, scored 30 points. Bibby, the impossibly cool freshman point guard, contributed 19 points, a team-high nine rebounds and four assists while helping break the fearsome Kentucky fullcourt press with seeming ease.</p>
<p>&quot;I knelt down,&quot; said Simon. &quot;I was glad it was over. It was a war. It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What a great game, what a great effort,&quot; said Arizona coach Lute Olson.</p>
<p>Most of the game was played at lightning speed with one electric play after another. But it was settled at the foul line, where neither speed nor defence matters at all.</p>
<p>Arizona scored 34 of its points at the stripe, on 41 free throws. Kentucky was just 9-for-17 from the line.</p>
<p>Arizona scored all 10 of its points in the extra session on free throws while Kentucky missed both its foul shots in overtime, scoring only on a power drive by Anthony Epps, whose three-pointer had sent the game into overtime, and a too-late three-pointer by Cameron Mills with 6.4 seconds to go.</p>
<p>Arizona, a fourth seed, became the first team in NCAA Tournament history to beat three regional top seeds -- nationally top-ranked Kansas, North Carolina and the defending champions.</p>
<p>(Corrects to make clear Arizona first to beat three top seeds).</p>
<p>&quot;No one thought we'd do it, no one thought we'd be here,&quot; Olson told the crowd from centre court. &quot;Three number one seeds went down. This is one tough, young group of 'Cats.&quot;  </p>
<p>Usually, Kentucky's trademark all-out defence cracks opponents, but this time they were the ones who got tired and error-prone as the Arizona guards -- Bibby, Simon, Michael Dickerson and valuable reserve Jason Terry -- were unfazed by the fullcourt press.</p>
<p>&quot;It affected us a little,&quot; said Bibby, &quot;but we stayed confident with the ball and kept waiting for our shots to fall. Miles (Simon) stepped up again. That's the best game I've seen him play yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We were tired in overtime,&quot; said Scott Padgett, Kentucky's high scorer with 17 points. &quot;They handled the pressure, we didn't. We turned it over. We didn't get the ball inside and we got into foul trouble.</p>
<p>&quot;They are very quick and sometimes we had big guys on little guys, and that didn't work.&quot;</p>
<p>Ron Mercer, Kentucky's sophomore star who is entering this year's NBA draft said: &quot;They went out and played outstanding defence.</p>
<p>&quot;Every time I curled around (a screen) they had somebody waiting for me. They made it tough for me to score,&quot; added Mercer, who finished with only 13 points shooting 5-for-9 from the field.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought I did a good job on Mercer,&quot; said Dickerson. &quot;I played him tight. I played him to one side, tried to bother him. He's a great player. Amazingly, they cracked and got tired and we didn't.&quot;</p>
<p>The exciting contest featured 20 ties and 18 lead changes.</p>
<p>In the second half neither team led by more than three points from the 17:01 mark until two Bibby free throws put Arizona up 72-68 with one minute to go. Kentucky point guard Wayne Turner fouled out on the play. &quot;Yeah, I thought we had it won,&quot; said Bibby.</p>
<p>But Mercer sank a clutch 23-footer to cut it to 72-71 with 43 seconds left in regulation.</p>
<p>With 20 seconds left, Bibby found forward Bennett Davison under the basket for a hoop that put Arizona up by three, 74-71, but then Epps, Kentucky's senior point guard, hit the three-pointer with 13 seconds to go that sent the game into overtime at 74-74.</p>
<p>Davison swished two free throws 25 seconds into the extra session to put Arizona up for good.</p>
<p>Kentucky centre Nazr Mohammed clanked two free throws off the front rim with 4:11 to go. Donnell Harris returned the favour at 4:09, but after clanging another one at 2:26 made the second to put Arizona up 77-74.</p>
<p>Terry swished two to make it 79-74 at 2:01 and finally, with just 1:45 to go Epps made the first basket of the extra session, a power drive to cut it to 79-76.</p>
<p>Bibby missed a desperation shot with 7 seconds on the 24-second clock but Harris got the rebound and Padgett fouled Harris, who spiraled the first of two foul shots down the drain to make it 80-76.</p>
<p>Mercer fouled out and then Padgett fouled Simon, who made four free throws in a row to make it 84-76 before Mills's three-pointer.</p>
<p>&quot;When I shot my last free throws I had chills running through my body,&quot; said Simon.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been one common denominator in our losses, and that's when we foul and put the other team to the line,&quot; said Kentucky coach Rick Pitino. &quot;But that's a credit to them, drawing the fouls.&quot;</p>
<p>The lead went back and forth in the first half, never getting higher than six points and Arizona was up 33-32 at the intermission.</p>
<p>Entering the contest, Kentucky had already won six national titles, made a record 38 Tournament appearances and 12 Final Fours. Arizona was in its third Final Four and first championship game.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't how I could be more excited than this,&quot; said Olson. &quot;This is the biggest thing in my life. I'm so proud of these guys. All year long it's been a question of them never saying die.&quot;</p>
<p>Added Pitino: &quot;This team, there's no fluke. Arizona, they're a great basketball team who got better and better.&quot;</p>
