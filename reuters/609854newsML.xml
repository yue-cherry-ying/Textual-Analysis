<p>Bonds were steady in quiet trade on Friday afternoon after tracking German Bunds lower in early dealings ahead of a U.S. holiday on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Uncertainty ahead of the first round of the French elections this weekend made operators wary; a ruling centre-right victory was partly priced in, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;A socialist victory could lead towards a weaker Euro, and that would send yields higher,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Merita analyst Jukka Lepomaki said it seemed a majority was expecting a conservative win, but there could still be a positive reaction in Germany, and Finland would follow.  </p>
<p>&quot;But the spread over Germany is really tight now,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The 2006 bond yield gap over the 2007 Bund was stuck at 29</p>
<p>basis points.</p>
<p>France has insisted that countries wishing to join EMU</p>
<p>should stick to a Maastricht treaty criterion limiting budget</p>
<p>deficits to three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this</p>
<p>year but the opposition Socialists have argued for a flexible</p>
<p>interpretation of the treaty.</p>
<p>The forex market was also calm, dealers said, with the</p>
<p>markka moving between 3.01 and 3.02 per mark.</p>
