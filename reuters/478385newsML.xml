<p>Prices of Poland's 15-percent two-year bonds are expected to ease at Wednesday's joint 800 million zloty tender while the minimum price of 12-percent five-year bonds is seen flat, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said investors were likely to test higher yields following recent rises in T-bill, NBP-bill yields and market rates caused by the central bank monetary tightening.</p>
<p>&quot;The two-year bond maximum yield is expected to rise as the market would try to price in the tightening after NBP raised the cost of short money and sold 91-day NBP-bills at higher yields,&quot; said Andrzej Hirsz from Bank Gdanski SA.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Poland has recently raised the maximum 14-day reverse repo rate to 22.15 percent from 21.65 percent and average yield of 91-day NBP-bills to 22.15 from 22.00 percent in a bid to curb fast growing credit action.</p>
<p>Analysts expected the maximum yield of the two-year paper, maturing June 12, 1999, to inch up to 20.10 percent from 20.01 percent at the last fixed bond auction on March 5, 1997.</p>
<p>The maximum yield of the five-year paper, maturing on June 12, 2002, was expected to stay flat at 18.15 percent after the finance ministry had rejected most of the 357 million zlotys worth of the bids at the last auction and sold only 40 million.</p>
<p>Dealers expected the Treasury to reject some bids despite its large financing needs to limit price falls for the longer paper, after it kept five-year bond's maximum yield flat at 18.50 percent at the last primary tender.</p>
<p>They said Wednesday's auction was likely to be undersubscribed with total demand of around 600 million zlotys against the treasury's 800 million offer as they saw no factors that could boost demand over last auction's levels.</p>
<p>Foreign demand, which accounted for about half of last auction's bids was seen below last month's levels and shifting from longer paper. Dealers saw equal demand for two-year and five-year paper after the yield of the two-year bond rose to 21.01 percent from 20.65 percent.</p>
<p>But some said the expected steady decline in inflation was still making the five-year bonds more attractive for foreign players.</p>
<p>The settlement date for this auction is April 12, 1997.</p>
