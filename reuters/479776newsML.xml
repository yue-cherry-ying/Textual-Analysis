<p>Tony Blair sought on Tuesday to head off Conservative charges that his opposition Labour party would sell out British interests in Europe by making his most sceptical speech yet about plans for economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>In a speech on the opening day of his formal campaign for the May 1 election, Blair stressed the &quot;formidable obstacles&quot; in the way of Britain's joining EMU in the first wave and said he was not even sure the project would start on schedule in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;We would not join in any fudged single currency or one not in Britain's interest. Period,&quot; Blair told 300 businessmen in Derby, central England.</p>
<p>Aides described the tenor of the speech as deliberately Euro-sceptical and said Blair wanted to erect his party's defences against an expected Conservative onslaught right at the start of the campaign.</p>
<p>Elaborating on the speech, a senior aide said Blair was worried that the British economic cycle was not synchronised with that of its main European partners, making the idea of a single monetary policy inappropriate.</p>
<p>&quot;Until this changes, it's hard to see how Britain could enter (EMU),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Blair said Labour, if it wins the election as polls suggest, would give Britain a fresh start in its dealings with Europe.</p>
<p>But his speech conspicuously omitted any references to the potential benefits of a single currency for Britain.</p>
<p>Instead, he stressed that any decision to scrap the pound would have to be endorsed by a referendum.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me make it absolutely clear: if the issue of Britain joining a single currency in the next parliament arises, and I stress the 'if', just as our manifesto will stress the 'if', then the final say will be with you, the British people, in a referendum.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question of it being imposed on the country, slunk through undercover or by a sidewind. Even for such a proposition to be made, we would have to be absolutely sure that it would be in Britain's interests -- British jobs, British investment, British industry,&quot; the Labour leader said.</p>
<p>The ruling Conservatives have seized on past comments by Blair that he would not be isolated in Europe as a sign that Labour would put the EU's interests before Britain's.</p>
<p>But Blair said Labour's commitment to a referendum on the single currency was a guarantee that he would put British interests first in his dealings with Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no single currency without the people saying so. It will be Britain's interests first, second and third. No other judgement will apply,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Blair said it was right that Britain should keep its options open on whether to join EMU -- a position also adopted by the Conservatives -- because it would be affected by a single currency whether it was a member or not.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;We have already pointed out the formidable obstacles that lie in the path of joining in the first wave, if indeed that happens on schedule.&quot;</p>
