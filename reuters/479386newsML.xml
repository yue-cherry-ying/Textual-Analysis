<title>FRANCE: French far-right fake police get suspended terms.</title>
<headline>French far-right fake police get suspended terms.</headline>
<dateline>STRASBOURG, France 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Four members of France's far-right National Front who pretended to be policemen and &quot;arrested&quot; two anti-Front protesters were each sentenced on Tuesday to one-year suspended prison terms.</p>
<p>They were also stripped of their right to vote or to stand for office for two years.</p>
<p>The state prosecutor had asked a court that the rightists be jailed for six months with another six months' jail suspended.</p>
<p>The four, an elected regional councillor and three members of the Front's security service, stopped and searched two youths seeking accommodation on Sunday in a hotel where Front delegates were staying in the eastern town of Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The youths were among some 40,000 protesters who took part in a march against a congress held in the town by Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front.</p>
<p>The charge of &quot;making illegal arrests and wrongfully assuming the functions of officers in the criminal police&quot; made the accused liable to up to five years in prison.</p>
<p>The court earlier sentenced 13 young people to terms ranging from a suspended month in jail to eight months in prison for rioting during the weekend protest against the National Front.</p>
<p>Fifteen young people were on trial, accused of stoning police or looting shops.</p>
<p>Two Germans among them were granted a request to be given time to prepare their defence. They will remain in detention and be tried on April 17. All those sentenced were French.</p>
<p>The state prosecutor told the court the main troublemakers had escaped arrest.</p>
<p>Trouble broke out after the march went off peacefully. Rioters clashed with police as they tried to march towards the conference centre and later smashed some 20 shop windows. The three-day congress ended on Monday.</p>
