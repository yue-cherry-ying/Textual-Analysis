<title>USA: Justice Department probing Internet registrations.</title>
<headline>Justice Department probing Internet registrations.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-07-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into the business of registering Internet addresses, a spokewoman for the agency confirmed on Monday.</p>
<p>Last week, the leading registration company, Network Solutions Inc, revealed it had received a request for documents from the Justice Department as part of the probe.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking at the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the Internet address registration industry,&quot; a spokeswoman for the department said.  </p>
<p>All Internet addresses end with a short designation, usually three letters, known as a top-level domain.</p>
<p>Under a contract with the National Science Foundation, Herndon, Virginia-based Network Solutions has a monopoly to register Internet addresses in the most popular domains, including &quot;.com&quot; for commercial sites and &quot;.org&quot; for sites run by non-profit entities.</p>
<p>The company has struggled to cope with surging demand for Internet addresses, dozens of lawsuits arising from alleged trademark infringements in address names, and difficulty collecting fees from some Internet users.  </p>
<p>In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in preparation for a public stock offering, Network Solutions said it received on June 27 a &quot;civil investigative demand&quot; from the Justice Department.</p>
<p>The demand requested documents and information from the company and its corporate parent, Science Applications International Corp. The government investigation followed a private lawsuit filed against the company in March alleging violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act.</p>
<p>Network Solutions officials were not immediately available for comment.  </p>
<p>The company is not aware of the scope or nature of the investigation, it said in its filing.</p>
<p>In its IPO, the company plans to raise $35 million. It has not revealed how many shares will be sold or at what price.</p>
<p>For the three months ending March 31, the company had income of $516,000 on revenues of $8.7 million, compared to a loss of $1.1 million on revenues of $2.3 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>The filing comes amidst a period of upheaval and uncertainty for Internet address registrations.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation has said it will not renew its exclusive agreement with Network Solutions when the pact expires in March 1998.</p>
<p>A group of Internet organizations and companies has proposed a new scheme for assigning addresses through at least 28 competing registrars, but the plan may not go into effect. The federal government has established an interagency taskforce to examine possible solutions, and last week the Commerce Department asked for comments from the public on the issue.</p>
