<p>Sylvan Learning Systems Inc., an educational services provider, said Friday it expects its second-quarter earnings to rise by about $1.5 million as it records a net gain and several expenses and investments.</p>
<p>The previously announced gain of $30 million comes from a break-up fee that Sylvan received after National Education Corp., a traditional textbook publisher, called off their proposed merger in April to accept a higher offer from Harcourt General Inc. instead.</p>
<p>The net gain for the quarter ending June 30 would be $28.5 million after transaction-related costs. Of this, Sylvan said it has to pay about $1 million in taxes.</p>
<p>Sylvan expects to make about $22 million in investments and expenditures in its second quarter to boost future earnings. These include about $10 million in promotional and channel support programmes in its testing division and $7 million in stock to set up a not-for-profit foundation.</p>
<p>Also included is $5 million in stock that Sylvan will contribute to fund the development of national advertising programmes for Sylvan Learning Centres operated by franchisees.</p>
<p>The Baltimore, Md.-based company also took a loss of about $4 million on assets due to strategic changes made as a result of the proposed merger with National Education, it said.</p>
<p>Sylvan's stock fell 25 cents to $35.375 on Nasdaq.</p>
