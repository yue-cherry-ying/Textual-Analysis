<headline>Kmart April same store sales off.</headline>
<dateline>TROY, Mich. 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Kmart Corp said Thursday same store sales for the four weeks ended April 30 fell 0.8 percent on a consolidated basis.</p>
<p>U.S. Kmart same-store sales in April also fell 0.8 percent.</p>
<p>Results exclude sales of the discontinued Builders Square operations.</p>
<p>Kmart reported total consolidated sales for the four weeks ended April 30 of $2.268 billion, down 2.2 percent from $2.319 billion for the same period last year.  </p>
<p>Sales from consolidated operations for the 13 weeks ended April 30 were $7.263 billion, up 4.1 percent from $6.975 billion for the first fiscal quarter of 1996.  On a comparable store basis, consolidated sales rose 5.5 percent and U.S. Kmart sales rose 5.7 percent for the same period.</p>
<p>&quot;Kmart's sales for the quarter were on plan although April sales were at the low end of expectations,&quot; Floyd Hall, chairman, said in a statement. &quot;We did experience a broad decline in traffic beginning in the second week of April, which affected primarily weather-sensitive items such as horticulture and selected apparel areas.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the home fashions business was strong, fueled by a strong performance by the Martha Stewart Everyday domestics launch.</p>
<p>Kmart rolled out 110 Big Kmart high frequency store conversions during the month, producing strong performance in consumables.  Other areas showing particular strength for the month included do-it-yourself, children's apparel, health and beauty accessories, and photography, Hall said.</p>
<p>Kmart has 2,122 U.S. Kmart retail outlets, and operates 123 stores internationally.</p>
