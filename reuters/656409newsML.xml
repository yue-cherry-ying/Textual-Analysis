<headline>Turk MP with 2 wives spurns job as women's minister.</headline>

<p>A Turkish MP with two wives said on Thursday he had rejected the post of minister for women's affairs after the job offer provoked &quot;bitter criticism&quot;, state-run Anatolian news agency reported.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not logical to make bitter criticism without knowing me...I do not accept the post. I am very sorry,&quot; the agency quoted deputy Salim Ensarioglu as saying.</p>
<p>Ensarioglu, from secularist Tansu Ciller's True Path Party, is one of two coalition deputies who is known to have more than one wife, as allowed by Islamic sharia law. Moslem but secular Turkey does not recognise religious marriages.</p>
<p>Ensarioglu said Women's Ministry officials had criticised his posting, which he had been offered on Tuesday amid a row between the Islamist-led government and powerful secularists over demands for a crackdown on religious activism.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not know who decided to appoint him as our minister,&quot; a ministry official told Reuters when asked about his selection.</p>
<p>Former women's minister Isilay Saygin ordered provincial governors in March to identify unofficially married couples and marry them officially. She resigned in May, saying Islamist-led ministries had made her position untenable.</p>
<p>Eighty-five percent of Turkish couples choose to have both official and religious ceremonies, but the vast majority of men have only one wife, according to ministry figures.</p>
