<p>Guangdong Finance Trust and Investment Corp is considering tapping international debt markets with a new issue, a company executive said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Zeng Zhong Sheng, manager of the company's International Finance Department, said the company is considering issuing debt of at least US$85 million with a maturity of at least five years.</p>
<p>He also said the company plans to seek ratings from Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's Corp.</p>
<p>Zeng said the company is likely to focus on Asian investors for its upcoming issue, but it also has preliminary plans to tap the U.S. Yankee and Eurobond markets to diversify its investor base.</p>
<p>Zeng was speaking at the signing of the company's recently completed US$85 million loan facility.</p>
<p>The facility has a final maturity of five years. It pays an interest margin of 50 basis points over the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate. Fees are 50 basis points.</p>
<p>Hongkong Bank China Services and Societe Generale Asia are the arrangers of the facility.</p>
<p>Proceeds of the loan are to be used for several key projects in Guangdong Province, Societe Generale Asia said in a release.</p>
<p>A total of 16 banks in addition to the seven arrangers and co-arrangers joined the syndication.</p>
