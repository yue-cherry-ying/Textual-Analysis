<p>Oman's Sultan Qaboos bin Said expressed the hope on Tuesday that his talks with Indian leaders would bolster relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>Qaboos, who arrived on his first official visit to the South Asian country, is scheduled to have talks with President Shankar Dayal Sharma, Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and other leaders during his four-day tour.</p>
<p>&quot;I am looking forward to talks with the Indian Prime Minister and hopeful these talks will bear benefit for both countries,&quot; Qaboos told reporters after a ceremonial welcome at the Presidential Palace.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very happy to pay my first state visit to India,&quot; Qaboos, accompanied by 14 ministers and aides, said.</p>
<p>Qaboos last month cancelled a trip to India citing bad weather on the flight route over the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>The two nations are due to sign agreements on double taxation, investment protection and science and technology during the Sultan's visit, Omani officials said.</p>
<p>The countries key members of the recently inaugurated 14-member Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation.</p>
<p>Both countries have carried out a feasibility study for a proposed underwater gas pipeline from Oman to India. But Indian officials say the project has been bogged down by a lack of political will on both sides and cash.</p>
