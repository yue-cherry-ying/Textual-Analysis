<title>UK: Copper price seen falling by end-June - Bloomsbury.</title>

<p>Although there remains the potential for supply disruptions and tightness in copper in the short-term, by the end of June prices should be falling, industry specialists Bloomsbury Minerals Economics (BME) said.</p>
<p>&quot;By late June we expect supply disruptions to be over and we expect prices to fall to $1.00/lb, in anticipation of surging supply and seasonally weak demand,&quot; BME said in its latest 'Copper Briefing Service'.</p>
<p>In the near-term BME sees copper averaging $112.50/lb, due to tightness in the Chinese market, which could force their re-entry as buyers on a large scale.</p>
<p>Also, there is a high risk of supply disruptions, and, more importantly, the increased awareness of the chances of the remaining short positions being squeezed again in May and possibly early June by the small group of companies that still hold the bulk of LME warrants.</p>
<p>Further ahead, BME said that improving production prospects in the African copperbelt will be offset by the better outlook for consumption, reducing the predicted surplus for 1997/1999.</p>
<p>Copper prices are now likely to repeat the cycle seen from late 1990 through 1992, the comparable phase of the previous cycle.</p>
<p>&quot;That is, we now expect a long series of mini-peaks up to around $112.5/lb, a floor of around 97.5 cents/lb and an average level of around $105/lb,&quot; BME said.</p>
<p>China is likely to be an important moderating influence, cutting back on purchases when prices exceed $1.10 and buying heavily when the market is believed to be near the bottom of the range - say below $1.00/lb.</p>
