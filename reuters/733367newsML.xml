<p>The White House on Tuesday told representatives of the tobacco industry that it may seek additional changes to the tobacco settlement reached in June, a senior administration official said.</p>
<p>Tobacco industry representatives met with members of a White House task force that is reviewing the $368.5 billion settlement reached with state attorneys general and the industry last month. President Bill Clinton has said parts of the deal would place &quot;unreasonable restriction&quot; on regulation of tobacco by the federal Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>&quot;We made clear to them that while we see the settlement as a real opportunity, we will insist that it be strengthened in certain areas, including FDA authority, as the president said last week, (and) perhaps other areas as well,&quot;  White House domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed told reporters following the meeting with industry representatives.</p>
<p>&quot;We also gave them a clear message to take back to New York, which is that if this settlement is going to work, they have a responsibility to look out for our bottom line, which is reducing smoking, especially among kids,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton also had some questions about incentives for compliance with the agreement and whether any penalties would be imposed on the industry if it failed to stick to the terms of the settlement.</p>
<p>The meeting with tobacco industry representatives was one of a series of sessions that the task force, headed by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Reed, has held to review the proposed settlement between 40 states and the tobacco industry. The task force has already met with health officials and state attorneys general. A session with tobacco farmers is scheduled for Wednesday.</p>
<p>Shalala said the meeting was not a negotiating session, but an opportunity to hear the industry's thinking behind a number of provisions in the agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;They simply answered our questions,&quot; Shalala said. She said the agreement does not explain all the reasoning behind its provisions and the task force had a series of questions.</p>
<p>&quot;We had an excellent meeting,&quot; said Phil Carlton, an attorney for RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. &quot;We explained the deal in its present form and listened to what they had to say about it.&quot; RJR's R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. is the second biggest tobacco company in the United States.</p>
<p>The settlement requires tobacco companies to pay $368.5 billion over 25 years in exchange for a cap on liability at $4 billion a year and restrictions on the ability of plantiffs to bring class-action lawsuits. Some of the $368.5 million would be earmarked for public health and anti-smoking programs.</p>
<p>The FDA's jurisdiction over nicotine was recently upheld by a federal court, and health advocates are adamant that any settlement not dilute it.</p>
<p>The accord requires the industry to recognize FDA authority but critics say the language creates loopholes and sets impossible standards for the agency. For instance, the FDA could not phase out nicotine unless it could guarantee that no black market would emerge.</p>
<p>Separately, a Senate Appropriations Committee subcommittee Tuesday declined to recommend funds for a Clinton initiative aimed at enforcing anti-teen smoking regulations.</p>
<p>On a voice vote, the subcommittee on agriculture passed a $50.5 billion spending bill for the Agriculture Department and FDA, but included no funds for the anti-smoking initiative.</p>
<p>Last week, the House Appropriations Committee approved $24.3 million for FDA anti-smoking enforcement activities, about $10 million less than Clinton requested.</p>
<p>After Tuesday's meeting, subcommittee Chairman Thad Cochran, a Mississippi Republican, said funding for the FDA enforcement activities should instead come from the proposed tobacco industry settlement.</p>
<p>The full Senate appropriations committee will meet Thursday on the spending bill for fiscal year 1998. In addition, the House is expected to take up the agriculture and FDA spending package this week.</p>
