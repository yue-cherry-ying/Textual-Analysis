<title>BAHAMAS: Leading Bahamas politician resigns from parliament.</title>
<headline>Leading Bahamas politician resigns from parliament.</headline>
<dateline>NASSAU, Bahamas 1997-07-08</dateline>

<p>Lynden Pindling, who led the Bahamas to independence from Britain and spent 25 years as its prime minister, faced his first day outside of formal political life on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pindling, 67, who is suffering from prostate cancer, bade his formal farewell to the House of Assembly in a 30-minute address on Monday. Wednesday would have marked the completion of exactly 41 years as a member of the assembly.</p>
<p>&quot;I am done now, Madame Speaker,&quot; he said. &quot;I have reached the end of my political journey. I have run my course. I did my best.&quot;</p>
<p>Pindling was Bahamas prime minister from 1967 to 1992. But his reputation was badly tarnished by corruption allegations.</p>
<p>Pindling resigned as leader of the Progressive Liberal Party in April after the party's resounding loss to incumbent Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham's Free National Movement. Pindling was one of few PLP candidates to retain his seat in parliament as the FNM took 34 of 40 seats.</p>
<p>Ingraham, a one-time protege of Pindling's, had become his political rival, quitting the PLP in 1984 after opposing corruption.</p>
<p>The Bahamas, home to about 254,000 people, is a chain of hundreds of islands in the Atlantic Ocean east of Florida and the Caribbean.</p>
