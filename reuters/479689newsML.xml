<p>&quot;Anti-aging&quot; hormones that have become popular recently have not been proven effective against the aging process and people must be cautious about taking them, U.S. health officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, said it was beginning a consumer education campaign, including television spots, on the hormones sold over-the-counter such as melatonin and DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone).</p>
<p>The institute said it is possible that research will eventually show that these hormones do have health benefits, but that controlled scientific studies are not yet available. In the meantime, scientists are concerned that the hormones could also have dangerous side effects or health risks.</p>
<p>Other hormones such as estrogen, testosterone and human growth hormone are available by prescription, and have health benefits, although they too are now being touted by some as weapons against the aging process.</p>
<p>Melatonin also can affect the body's sleep/wake cycle, although research is still underway to better understand the hormone's role in sleep.</p>
