<headline>WTO rules for US in EU beef ban -- US trade group.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>The World Trade Organization has ruled that the European Union unfairly barred U.S. meat shipments in the &quot;hormone beef&quot; dispute, a U.S. trade group official said Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We've heard from several sources it (the WTO interim report) is favorable to our side,&quot; said Chuck Lambert of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. &quot;We're willing to work with the admnistration and the Europeans to see this issue is resolved.&quot;</p>
<p>Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said a U.S. victory &quot;would be very positive news for us.&quot;</p>
<p>A European Union spokeswoman in Washington confirmed the report had been issued but, &quot;We are not going to comment.&quot;</p>
<p>The WTO ruling was distributed late Wednesday. The U.S. trade representative's office was not available to discuss the report.</p>
<p>Further discussions were possible but interim reports usually provide the basis for final rulings.</p>
<p>Under an adverse WTO ruling, the EU could drop the ban, appeal the decision or compensate the United States for a continued ban.</p>
<p>NCBA says the ban cost at least $100 million a year.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is the first milestone toward getting a positive resolution,&quot; said NCBA's Lambert.</p>
<p>The trade group says without the ban, which went into effect in 1989, U.S. sales of high-quality beef to Europe could have grown to $250 million a year.</p>
<p>EU banned imports of beef grown with use of synthetic growth hormones on health grounds. The United States said the hormones were identical to natural hormones and were used safely.</p>
<p>Glickman told Reuters that he had not seen the WTO interim report but said if reports of a U.S. victory were correct, &quot;this is obviously very consistent with what we have believed since the beginning, which is sound science will show the EU beef ban is inconsistent with accurate and sound science. We will be extremely happy is this report is true.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would be very positive news for us, we've been fighting this thing for a long time,&quot; he added.</p>
