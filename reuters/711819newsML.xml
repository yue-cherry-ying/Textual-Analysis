<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Monday said a U.S. black human rights activist once convicted of hijacking an aircraft should not have been allowed to enter Australia and should be deported.</p>
<p>Howard said he was &quot;horrified&quot; to hear former Black Panther Lorenzo Ervin had been in Australia since July 4.</p>
<p>&quot;It is quite wrong that somebody like that should have got into the country in the first place,&quot; Howard said in a radio interview. &quot;I think somebody with that sort of background ought not to remain in Australia and I hope he doesn't.&quot;</p>
<p>Ervin, who was invited to Australia for a four-week speaking tour by anarchist group Angry People, was convicted in the United States in 1969 of hijacking a plane to Cuba. He was given two life sentences, but released from jail in 1983.</p>
<p>Howard said Ervin had apparently misrepresented his past when he applied for a visa to visit Australia and had used a different surname.</p>
