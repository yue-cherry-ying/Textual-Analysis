<p>The European Commission failed despite three hours of talks on Thursday to agree how to solve a row over European Union imports of Norwegian salmon which has strained relations between Oslo and Brussels.</p>
<p>A spokesman for EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, responsible for the dossier, said the EU executive would hold an extrordinary meeting to decide the issue on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>Brittan had put forward a proposal agreed in last-ditch talks with Norwegian negotiators on how to resolve the fish dispute without the Commission imposing an anti-dumping duty of 13.7 percent on imports of farmed salmon from Norway.</p>
<p>His spokesman said there was severe time pressure as the deadline for a Commission decision was on Sunday, but refused to give details about the talks.</p>
<p>&quot;It is quite unusual, they want more time. They have wanted to discuss some of the issues in greater detail,&quot; he told reporters. Sunday's meeting will start at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT).</p>
<p>The Norwegian news agency NTB said the proposal included the levying of an export duty, which would be collected in Norway, instead of an EU import duty on the salmon in a bid to increase the price on the market. It said EU Fisheries Commissioner Emma Bonino opposed this solution.</p>
<p>Oslo has repeatedly said it wants to solve the issue through dialogue, rather than through confrontation with unilateral trade measures.</p>
<p>Norway's salmon exports to the EU are worth some 5.5 billion crowns ($778 million) annually.</p>
<p>The EU executive argues that the country's producers receive state subsidies and dump the fish on the EU market at less than the cost of production.</p>
<p>Scottish and Irish competitors say Norway, the world's biggest producer, is flooding the market and depressing prices.</p>
<p>Norway, which like the EU is part of the 18-nation European Economic Area, strongly rejects the allegations, saying Scottish producers have actually increased their market shares.</p>
<p>The trade conflict is seen in Norway as the most serious dispute with the EU since Norwegians rejected membership of the bloc in a 1994 referendum.</p>
<p>Last month, Norwegian Prime Minister Thorbjoern Jagland urged the European Commission not to impose the anti-dumping duties, saying in a letter to European Commission Jacques Santer the matter may &quot;lead to most unfortunate complications in the relations between the European Union and Norway&quot;.</p>
<p>Several EU countries are opposed to the idea of imposing import duties on salmon, but the EU executive has the power to impose provisional duties without the consent of member states.</p>
