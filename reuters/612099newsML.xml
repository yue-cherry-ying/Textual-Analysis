<headline>End draws nears for Power NZ takeover battle.</headline>

<p>The end is drawing near for the battle for control of Power New Zealand Ltd after two-and- a-half years of protracted haggling over the country's biggest listed power distributor, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>The protagonists -- unlisted Mercury Energy and Kansas-based UtiliCorp United Inc -- finally got together this week in a deal to share control through a 50/50 joint venture.</p>
<p>The pair together own 64 percent of Power NZ and are proposing to buy out minority shareholders for NZ$6.0 (US$4.15) a share after lodging an application with the New Zealand Commerce Commission to seek 100 percent.</p>
<p>Bancorp Advisory Services has been commissioned by the Power NZ board to carry out an independent appraisal on the offer.</p>
<p>If the partners succeed,the NZSE-40 Capital Index company faces possible delisting after a brief but controversial presence on the New Zealand Stock Exchange boards.</p>
<p>Power NZ debuted in December 1994 having made the transition from a local authority-style power board to a company.</p>
<p>No sooner had it listed than a battle for control began.</p>
<p>Power NZ had enlisted UtiliCorp as a &quot;cornerstone&quot; shareholder, enabling it to share technology and giving it a measure of protection against predators.</p>
<p>Aucklanders, many of them first-time shareholders thanks to a large scale share allocation to customers, watched in astonishment when Mercury entered the fray virtually on day one, with bids and counterbids driving offers as high as NZ$10 per share against its listing price of just NZ$3.40.</p>
<p>Capital appreciation aside, the company has paid out big dividends -- almost enough to cover Mercury's holding costs.</p>
<p>Unlisted Mercury is New Zealand's largest power supplier with 18.0 percent market share against Power NZ's 13.0 percent.</p>
<p>Lying uncomfortably between Power NZ's Waitemata network to the north and its Valley Power assets in the south, Mercury argued it could achieve substantial benefits from a merger with Waitemata and from the divestment of Valley Power.</p>
<p>Power NZ and UtiliCorp countered by saying modern distribution technology made such geographical issues irrelevant.</p>
<p>As if to prove that point, Power NZ launched a bid for Wellington's EnergyDirect Ltd at the other end of the North Island. But that failed.</p>
<p>One result of this week's announcement will be that both Mercury and Power NZ will cooperate to capture cost savings.</p>
<p>However, the parties have several hurdles to clear first.</p>
<p>They first need sanction from the Overseas Investment Commission, which rarely turns down applications, and also the approval of the Commerce Commission.</p>
<p>Don Turkington, principal at Cavill White Securities, said a successful takeover by the joint venture may not be a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>&quot;People who wouldn't sell at eight dollars may be even less inclined to sell at six, so whether they can get to 90.0 percent in order to compulsorily acquire balance I don't know,&quot; he said. &quot;It's always a negative thing for the market to have companies removed from the board but Power NZ was on for such a short time before it became part of a takeover attempt that it hasn't had a two-way market at all. It's been very illiquid.&quot;</p>
<p>One major positive development would be the removal of a barrier to Mercury's partial listing, scheduled for mid-1998, which would be the biggest float since Telecom.</p>
<p>Mercury on Friday announced a 25 percent increase in annual net profit to NZ$82.1 million.</p>
<p>US$1.NZ$1.44</p>
