<headline>Sytrol sets higher Syrian Light crude June price.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Syria's state oil company  Sytrol and some term lifters have agreed to set the June price of Syrian Light at Dated Brent -77 cents, five cents up on May's price, traders said on Friday. &quot;Yes, some people have already agreed,&quot; one term lifter told Reuters when asked if an agreement has been reached on the June price for Syrian Light. Three lifters said the price was set at a 77 cents discount to Dated Brent - a compromise between Sytrol's original asking price of Dated Brent -60 cents and lifters' bids of a rollover from May or even lower prices. It was not immediately known if agreement has been reached over the June price for Syria's heavy crude Souedie but one lifter said the latest talk was around Dated Brent -$4.40.</p>
<p>The May price was set at Dated Brent -$4.65.</p>
