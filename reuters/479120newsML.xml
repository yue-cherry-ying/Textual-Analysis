<p>The latest dip in the stock market will probably not cause investors to sell off their holdings in stock mutual funds, the Investment Company Institute's top economist said Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Typically, you don't see mutual fund holders flocking to their brokers and redeeming their shares,&quot; Brian Reid, head economist for the mutual fund industry trade group, told reporters after speaking at the National Economists' Club luncheon in Washington.</p>
<p>Reid said historically big market dips have not resulted in mass redemptions. Stock mutual fund investors tend to divest over long periods of poor market performance rather than during short-term declines, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on past experience, what typically happens when you have a drop like we have had is that sales taper off and redemptions may pick up slightly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He added that stock mutual fund investors are less likely to respond to short-term market drops by selling their holdings because they generally view them as long-term investments. In addition, such sales can be costly, with added brokerage fees.</p>
<p>Separately, Reid said the huge increase in stock mutual fund investments over the past several years is not to blame for the rise in the stock market over the past few years.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to me that it's driven by the fundamentals. One of the things that we certainly have experienced over the last several years is a sharp increase in corporate profits and an exceptionally long and positive rise in the economy, including productivity,&quot; Reid said.</p>
