<title>UK: North Sea Brent crude market heads out of contango.</title>
<headline>North Sea Brent crude market heads out of contango.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Trading activity on the wet Brent crude market remained subdued on Thursday, but outright levels firmed sharply, and weekly CFDs headed out of contango.</p>
<p>June Brent futures were trading a hefty 55 cents firmer at $18.71 a barrel, after NYMEX futures spearheaded a strong technical rally.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs for next week (May 12-16) firmed to around July Brent -24/-22 to move in line with the following two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;The contango has flattened out, the first three weeks are at the same levels,&quot; said one paper trader. &quot;I think the market is heading for backwardation.&quot;</p>
<p>Brent intermonth spreads also firmed, taking June/July to -6/-4 cents, having traded earlier at -8 cents.</p>
<p>A Brent cargo loading May 19-21 changed hands on a Dated-related basis, while the two cargoes nominated loading dates on Thursday were both kept by equity holders ahead of the five o'clock deadline.</p>
<p>Discussion on other North Sea grades was thin, with many European refiners away from their desks because of the Ascension Day holiday. A Forties and an Ekofisk cargo were heard traded, but this was not confirmed.</p>
<p>The West African market was quiet but differentials held steady, supported Asian buying interest and scarce May avails low.</p>
<p>A European trader said although most of the end May barrels have already found homes, mostly in the United States and Asia, there was at least one third decade May Qua Iboe unsold with the asking price around Dated Brent plus low 50s.</p>
<p>&quot;One week ago I would have said that they (West African grades) will be coming down but only because there were many, many cargoes in the last decade unsold,&quot; the trader said. &quot;But now I think there are a few cargoes unsold.&quot;</p>
