<title>NETHERLANDS: ARA oil storage rental rises, but rates capped.</title>
<headline>ARA oil storage rental rises, but rates capped.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Volume rented out by oil storage companies in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp market has steadily grown and there are signs trading companies may be buying up more space, although rates are rooted to last year's levels.</p>
<p>So say marketing and sales staff at Dutch and Belgian storage companies.</p>
<p>Many say they have rented out around 75 percent of their capacity, sharply up from the start of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;A year ago, only about 30 percent (of our storage capacity) and it wasn't much better at the turn of the year,&quot; one storage employee said.</p>
<p>Quite how much of the rented space is actually in use is, however, debated. Some say almost all of it is full, but figures suggest there is still quite some capacity left.</p>
<p>Dutch oil consultant Pieter Kulsen says there is clearly scope to store more product, particularly gas oil. This week, independent storage companies in the ARA region held some 1.6 million tonnes of gas oil. This is short of the peak over the last three years, in September 1994, of 2.9 million tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;The companies have certain flexibility to change from one product to another. Capacity has changed in recent years, but there is scope to store maybe another million tonnes (of gas oil),&quot; Kulsen said.</p>
<p>Some storage companies themselves say that trading companies are becoming interested in renting space over the coming months, in the hope that gas oil contango widens. A few hint that a certain trading companies have already bought space.</p>
<p>The contango of IPE gas oil futures from July to October at the moment averages $1.50 per tonne per month, a little short of what is necessary to induce storing.</p>
<p>While the prospects are favourable for storage companies, rates have barely changed from last year's lows.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot really complain. The space has filled up, but we have had to go down with our prices and the competition means we cannot now rise,&quot; said one storer.</p>
<p>A typical rate for storing a cubic metre is around $1 per month -- slightly more for gasoline, slightly less for gas oil. Two years ago, the rates were on average 50 percent higher.</p>
<p>One minor bonus, at least, is the strength of the dollar which is around 10 percent stronger than it was a year ago against both the Dutch guilder and the Belgian franc, but many still express dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still too cheap. These are almost cost prices,&quot; a Dutch storer said.</p>
