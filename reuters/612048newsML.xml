<p>German Bunds hauled themselves back up in early Friday trade, recovering slightly from a bruising sell-off in the past two sessions.</p>
<p>Traders said key technical support were close at hand, but since the levels were violated late on Thursday, their strength may well not hold if another selling bout emerges.</p>
<p>First support comes in the 100.80/83 region for the June contract, where a Fibonacci retracement level combines with a congestion area.</p>
<p>By 0646 GMT, the future was trading comfortably above this level at 100.88, up 15 basis points on the day.  </p>
<p>Charles Diebel, senior fixed income analyst at Technical Data in London, said the recent weakness in Bunds stemmed from growing doubts about the strength of Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are seeing here is a growing general consensus that Germany is just not going to make the three perecnt deficit target,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said this had prompted some investors to move down the yield curve into shorter-dated maturities, and was encouraging more international convergence plays between German and European high-yield markets.  </p>
<p>Cash Bunds, however, have held up well in the storm of selling which has hit futures in the past few days.</p>
<p>The cash July 2007 benchmark was trading at 100.68 for a bid yield of 5.902 percent by 0714 GMT.</p>
<p>Some analysts said they thought investors had been hedging underlying cash positions by selling futures, adding to the weakness already instilled by domestic budget concerns.</p>
<p>For this session, analysts said an absence of key economic data and the prospect of a long weekend in Britain should enable the market to calm down a little as positions are squared for the week.  </p>
<p>&quot;I would expected the market will range trade today with a slightly firmer bias,&quot; said Diebel. &quot;People in London will be squaring up before the long weekend and I should think we'll see some bids coming through there to cover shorts.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts at DMG futures and options in Frankfurt said that after Bunds made a positive early move above the 100.85 level, the chances for a bounce up to the 101.00 to 101.10 region had improved.</p>
<p>But any rally beyond 101.15/25 was unlikely, analysts said.</p>
