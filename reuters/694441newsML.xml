<p>British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook flew into Hong Kong on Saturday and scolded China for its plan to send a big military force with armoured cars into the territory just hours after Monday night's handover.</p>
<p>He said he intended to tell Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa he expects China to honour its treaty pledges to preserve Hong Kong's freedoms and to hold elections here within 12 months.</p>
<p>Cook arrived in Hong Kong with heir to the throne Prince Charles ready for a gala handover ceremony to transfer the 156-year-old colony to Chinese sovereignty.</p>
<p>Two days away from the historic event, Britain and China are locking horns over China's plan to send 4,000 troops into Hong Kong with armoured personnel carriers at dawn on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Cook acknowledged that the 1984 Sino-British treaty on the handover gave China the right to move troops into the territory.</p>
<p>&quot;The Joint Declaration does give China the right to position troops of the PLA in Hong Kong,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;We regret the scale at which the initial deployment is being made and in particular we regard the provision of armoured personnel carriers as unecessary and inappropriate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Cook said however that the most important thing about the sovereignty transfer was how Hong Kong fares over the next half century, China having promised to leave its way of life intact.</p>
<p>&quot;A smooth handover during the 50 hours when international celebrities are on the ground is important.</p>
<p>&quot;But much more important for local people are the 50 years for which the terms of the Joint Declaration will remain in force,&quot; Cook said.</p>
<p>Britain was determined, he said, that throughout that period &quot;the people of Hong Kong will continue to enjoy the two key benefits which Britain leaves in place on June 30&quot;.</p>
<p>These were prosperity and &quot;the freedoms of Hong Kong which enable its residents to enjoy free speech, civil liberty and democratic elections&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Britain has compelling reasons for ensuring those twin features of Hong Kong endure. We have an immense stake in the prosperity of Hong Kong.&quot;</p>
<p>Former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who signed the treaty that gives Hong Kong back to China, was also in Hong Kong at the weekend ready for the handover ceremony and chided Beijing for the way it was bringing in its garrison.</p>
<p>She said it was not the size that mattered, but the style of the move, especially if it rekindled memories of Beijing's bloody 1989 anti-democracy crackdown around Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had 9,000 here -- it's not only what you have, it's the way in which you do it,&quot; said Thatcher, who arrived on Friday. &quot;The 4,000 seem to be coming in with armoured personnel carriers and that is very unwise. After all, it was that kind of carrier that was, I believe, used in Tiananmen Square.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not only they are coming in, it's more the manner in which they are doing it and what the manner reveals is, I'm afraid, that people in the Communist government are not as sensitive about the people as they should be.&quot;</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Sir Donald Tsang said how the army behaved in the territory in future was far more important than how they would arrive on July 1.</p>
<p>&quot;While the manner in which it's arriving is important, I think...the most important thing is how the PLA behaves in Hong Kong,&quot; Tsang said.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether they are going to abide by the laws of Hong Kong is far more important than considering how, where exactly it will be deployed,&quot; Tsang said on government-funded radio.</p>
