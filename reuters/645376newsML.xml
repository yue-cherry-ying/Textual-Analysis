<p>Sinn Fein, political wing of the outlawed IRA, was poised to gain a foothold in Ireland's parliament for the first time since the nation's birth in the 1920s, according to early election estimates on Saturday.</p>
<p>Provisional counting in the border constituency of Cavan Monaghan suggested Sinn Fein's Caoimhghin O Caolain would comfortably win a parliamentary place, the first time the party has won a seat in the Irish Republic since 1981.</p>
<p>If confirmed, the result would cap a spectacular year for Sinn Fein, which normally polls a paltry two per cent of votes in Irish elections but has seen its share of votes in Northern Ireland polls increase from 11 to 17 percent in five years.</p>
<p>Previous successful Sinn Fein candidates refused to take up their seats but O Caolain plans to participate and use his parliamentary leverage to win concessions from the British and Irish governments in Sinn Fein's campaign to end British rule of Northern Ireland and unite the region with the Irish Republic.</p>
<p>The party, led by Gerry Adams, says it is a separate organisation from the Irish Republican Army, the Catholic-backed guerrilla force whose war against Britain is at the heart of a 28-year conflict which has killed 3,200.</p>
<p>Two other Sinn Fein candidates had outside chances of winning seats, according to early counts, and many of the party's candidates were recording a dramatic increase in their share of the vote since the last election in 1992.</p>
<p>With an exit poll and initial tallies predicting a hung parliament, the support of smaller parties like Sinn Fein could be crucial for any coalition trying to cobble together a majority.</p>
<p>But both of Ireland's competing coalition blocs have ruled out a deal with the party while its IRA allies resort to violence.</p>
<p>The government of Prime Minister John Bruton and his former ally, British Prime Minister John Major, both banned contact with Sinn Fein while the IRA continued its violent campaign.</p>
<p>But Bruton and Britain's new premier, Tony Blair, authorised talk at official level last month to explore Sinn Fein's attitude towards getting the IRA to declare a lasting truce.</p>
<p>&quot;Caoimhghin O Caolain's expected election will be an endorsement of Sinn Fein's peace strategy,&quot; said Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, who was present at the count.</p>
<p>O Caolain said he would wait to see the full results of Ireland's election before deciding on any parliamentary alliances.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein also fields candidates in Northern Ireland in British elections and scored its best ever result there in Britain's May 1 poll when Adams and senior strategist Martin McGuinness each won a seat.</p>
<p>But they have refused to take part in Britain's parliament, however, as this would entail swearing allegiance to the Queen.</p>
<p>The party remains barred from Northern Ireland peace talks sponsored by the British and Irish governments because the IRA has failed to restore a 17-month ceasefire it ended in February 1996 with a huge bomb in London.</p>
<p>But Sinn Fein insists it is committed to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict and demands entry to the peace talks without delay or preconditions.</p>
<p>The party decided in 1986 to abandon its long-standing policy of boycotting the Irish parliament, but until now has failed to capture any seats in subsequent elections.</p>
