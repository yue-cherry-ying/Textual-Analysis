<p>Globe Telecom said it expects to double its cellular telephone subscribers and post a more than fivefold growth in subscribers for its landline services by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Globe, a joint venture company of Ayala Corp and Singapore Telecoms Ltd, had 50,000 cellular subscribers and 12,000 landline subscribers at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Targets for this year have been set at 100,000 subscribers for its cellular phone service and 67,000 for the landlines, outgoing president Filemon Berba told reporters after the stockholders' meeting late on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to be aggressive in this business. We had to scale backward and now our intention is to move forward again. No, we don't feel that it's an unusually aggressive target,&quot; chairman Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala added.</p>
<p>The 50,000 subcriber base for its cellular phone service accounts for only 5.0 percent of the market. The company has rolled out 112,000 landlines.</p>
<p>Mobile communications vice president Manuel delos Santos said the company is still reviewing its tariff schedule to attract more subscribers.</p>
<p>The company has purged more than 30,000 subscribers since last June due to the massive subscription fraud. It posted a loss of 750.872 million pesos last year due to the fraud.</p>
<p>However, Ayala said the problem has been checked.</p>
<p>&quot;We are developing a more advanced billing system to cope with the demands of a rapidly growing subscriber base. Strict screening procedures for dealers and subscribers are in place as well as improved procedures on credit management and fraud containment,&quot; the company said in its annual report released on Monday.</p>
<p>The company, which has been posting losses since 1992 due to a massive capital expenditure programme, expects to have a turnaround by 1999.</p>
