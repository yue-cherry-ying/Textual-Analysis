<p>Mad Maurice, also known as the Jellied Eel, defends his world gut-barging title on Friday in one of the most bizarre events to be staged in London's Royal Albert Hall.</p>
<p>The Brawl in the Hall features the owners of some of the biggest bellies outside Japan's sumo fraternity. Stripped to the waist, the five men will attempt to bounce their opponents off a 12-foot by eight-foot mat using gut power alone.</p>
<p>Gut-barging is popular again in pubs and nightclubs among Britons carrying stupendous stomachs thanks to their huge beer intake.</p>
<p>The porcine pastime was big business during the 19th century, especially in ports and industrial towns where workers were often provided beer and ale free by factory and foundry proprietors.</p>
<p>Interest renewed about 12 years ago but it is only in the last five years that it has taken off as a spectator sport again, particularly in the English Midlands and Scotland.</p>
<p>&quot;There is amazing interest because it's put the fun back into sport. It's for the Joe Bloggs of Britain,&quot; a spokesman for the promoters said.</p>
<p>Friday's challenge will take place before a concert by the 1970s punk group, the Stranglers, and in front of 3,500 spectators.</p>
<p>Facing Mad Maurice, mystifyingly called the Belgian from Melksham, a village in western England, was declared the first world gut-barging champion last year. He faces four contestants in Friday's bout in a sold-out venue primarily used for classical concerts.</p>
<p>Fred Zeppelin, labelled the bad-tempered barger from Baden Baden, will represent Germany. The World Gut Barging Association claim, rather unconvincingly, that Fred is the current boar-hurling champion of Schleswig Holstein under the pseudonym of Kaiser Bill's Fatman.</p>
<p>French honour will be defended by Les Cargo, the Trifle Tower. Although resident in Somerset, western England, Les claims to be descended from an ancient French family of truffle pig breeders. &quot;Losing is what Les is best at,&quot; the association states.</p>
<p>Cliff White, tattooed from neck to waist, gut-barges for Britain while the Boston Globe, real name unknown but said to be a whaler from Nantucket, is the American representative.</p>
<p>Gut-bargers receive an appearance fee and there is a large &quot;underworld&quot; of competitions in pubs and working mens' clubs.</p>
<p>But the association, set up in April 1996, is working towards building a national registry of what would be called athletes in any other sport, and there is talk of setting up a &quot;premier league&quot; involving competitions throughout the country.</p>
