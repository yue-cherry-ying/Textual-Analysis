<p>England's celebrated saint Thomas Becket -- the &quot;turbulent priest&quot; murdered in Canterbury Cathedral for refusing to take orders from a king -- is being honoured in an exhibition that brings Anglicans and Catholics closer together.</p>
<p>The centrepiece of the exhibition is a shirt on loan from Rome that is said to have belonged to the 12th-century martyr whose violent death turned Canterbury into a place of international pilgrimage and later the seat of the Church of England.</p>
<p>&quot;This exhibition has great ecumenical significance,&quot; said Canon Peter Brett, who helped put the &quot;Power to Inspire&quot; exhibition together.</p>
<p>Brett said the loan of the shirt from the Catholic Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome showed a unity of faiths during celebrations of the 1,400-year anniversary of the birth of Christianity in England.</p>
<p>&quot;An exhibition of this sort will have its effect on Christians of all denominations. It has great potential for mission,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was slaughtered in 1170 by four knights of King Henry II for his persistent refusal to let the Church come under royal edict.</p>
<p>Becket maintained the church was only accountable to God, prompting the king to fly into a blind rage and utter one of the most famous phrases in religious history; &quot;Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?&quot;.</p>
<p>It has never been clear whether this was meant to be an order to kill or a rhetorical question shouted in desperation. But four of the king's knights went to Canterbury to find Becket and killed him inside the church with their swords.</p>
<p>One of the exhibition's main items is a large shirt dating from the mid-12th century which Church officials believe belonged to Becket.</p>
<p>It was made for a very tall man which corresponds with contemporary descriptions of Becket as being about six and a half feet (2.2 m) tall.</p>
<p>&quot;The likelihood of this shirt belonging to Becket was very, very great,&quot; Brett said.</p>
<p>Other items include a gold and enamel casket which is one of the oldest and best preserved objects depicting Thomas's martyrdom.</p>
<p>It was bought for the nation by the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Victoria and Albert Museum for 4.2 million pounds ($6.9 million) at auction last year.</p>
<p>The exhibition also includes a large collection of small badges sold to pilgrims who came to the cathedral in the 300 years following Becket's death.</p>
<p>Thomas Becket was made archbishop in 1162 and immediately came into conflict with King Henry. He was forced to flee to France for two years, returning in 1170, whereupon he promptly excommunicated various allies of the king who held influential positions in the church.</p>
<p>Becket is reputed to have said;  &quot;I accept death in the name of Jesus and his church,&quot; as the knights delivered the fatal blows.</p>
<p>The four knights were never brought to justice but all repented and left to fight in the Crusades. One of them, William de Tracey, later bequeathed all his worldly possessions to the monks of Canterbury in an act of penance.</p>
<p>Becket's fame as a martyr made Canterbury Cathedral one of the most venerated pilgrimage shrines of the English Middle Ages. After the rift with the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century, the cathedral became established as the seat of the head of the Anglican Church of England. ($ = 0.612 British Pounds)</p>
