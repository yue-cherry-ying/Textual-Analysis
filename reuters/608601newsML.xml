<p>Cool, wet weather earlier this week stalled seeding operations in many parts of Canada's Prairies, Pioneer Grain Co Ltd said in its crop report for the week ended May 21.</p>
<p>Snow, rain and cool temperatures halted spring seeding and harvest in British Columbia's Dawson Creek region and Alberta's Peace River Valley and set work back by one week.</p>
<p>Twenty to 25 percent of crops were seeded and if warm, dry weather does not return soon, some fields may not get seeded this year, the report said.  </p>
<p>Parts of Alberta saw 20 cm (8 inches) of snow this week.</p>
<p>North Alberta seeded 30 percent of crops and the central region seeded 80 percent of crops but the snowstorm earlier this week halted seeding operations. One week to 10 days of good weather was needed to finish seeding, Pioneer said.</p>
<p>More than 90 percent of southern Alberta's crops were seeded with operations expected to be complete within days.</p>
<p>More precipitation was needed in arid southern Alberta.</p>
<p>Parts of northern Saskatchewan were up to 50 percent seeded but cool, wet weather over the past weekend slowed plantings to a near standstill. General crop conditions were rated good to very good but warm weather was needed.</p>
<p>Southwest Saskatchewan saw warm, dry and windy weather in the past week with durum wheat 85 percent seeded and flax 39 percent seeded. Seeding should be completed in two weeks.</p>
<p>Southeast Saskatchewan, however, saw snow, strong winds and cloudy sikes. Seeding was 40 to 50 percent complete.</p>
<p>Crop seeding and germination in eastern Saskatchewan and Manitoba were slowed by cold temperatures and precipitation.</p>
