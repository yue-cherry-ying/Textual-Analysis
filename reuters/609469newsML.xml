<headline>Consuming nations issue warning on oil supplies.</headline>

<p>Industrialised oil consuming nations expressed serious concern about the security of their oil supplies on Friday and urged governments to hold on to spare stocks needed to guard against crisis.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency of 24 mainly Western nations said after ministerial talks that energy security remained its top priority despite fewer emergencies since it was founded to combat price shocks during the 1970s.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the evolution of the oil markets towards greater competition, transparency and efficiency, oil security remains a serious concern, particularly given the prospect of increasing import dependence...and the increasing concentration of remaining oil reserves in the Middle East,&quot; said a communique issued after the talks.</p>
<p>The warning follows controversy over recent sales of U.S. government stocks and a decline in stocks held by private oil companies in an effort to economise.</p>
<p>The IEA has criticised the sales from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a time when America's imports are rising.</p>
<p>But U.S. Energy Secretary Federico Pena told reporters a balanced budget deal hammered out with congressional leaders last week would &quot;now avoid the need to sell for deficit reduction purposes&quot;.</p>
<p>The IEA communique urged nations to &quot;maintain -- and, in member countries with weak stocks positions, improve -- the level of IEA emergency stocks&quot;.</p>
<p>The agency requires members to hold oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports and release oil in the event of serious market turmoil. The IEA has used the weapon once, at the start of the Gulf War in January 1991.</p>
<p>An IEA official said the strategic reserve in the United States held enough oil to cover 75 days of imports. But the United States did reach the IEA's target when oil industry stocks over which Washington has some control were included.</p>
<p>Oil prices hit six-year highs last year as oil companies cut inventories to the bone and increases in demand, especially in fast-growing Asian economies, outstripped new oil supplies.</p>
<p>The prices have since stabilised around $20 a barrel but are running at $3 a barrel more on average than the post-Gulf war period between 1991 and 1995.</p>
<p>Oil prices in real terms, however, are barely higher than when the IEA was founded to cope with the 1974 oil shock.</p>
<p>IEA officials say six Gulf countries from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), including Saudi Arabia and Iran, control 65 percent of proven oil reserves and the figure is rising as North Sea supplies gradually dry up.</p>
<p>Countries from the IEA's parent, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, rely on imported oil, including big flows from the Middle East, to cover just over half their needs.</p>
<p>Despite OPEC output at a 17-year high of 27 million barrels a day, record consumption has kept markets tightly balanced.</p>
