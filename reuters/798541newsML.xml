<title>UK: Minor metals - Shorts knock antimony, cobalt firm.</title>
<headline>Minor metals - Shorts knock antimony, cobalt firm.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-08-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Antimony prices found little respite from downside pressure during trading in minor metals over the past week, although traders said that the market is starting to bottom out towards $1,800 a tonne.</p>
<p>Elsewhere cobalt remained firm while the other metals in the sector, gripped by slow summer conditions, remained little changed and largely neglected. But according to several traders consumers are lining up for a fourth quarter buying spree which is likely to underpin or drive prices higher.</p>
<p>Far Eastern shorts are believed to behind the downside move in antimony which over the week has fast approached critical support at $1,800 a tonne.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected the market to bottom soon which was already finding consumer covering. The lower prices have prompted some Chinese producers, major suppliers of the metal used in batteries and as a fire retardant, to run production down.</p>
<p>&quot;They are waiting for prices to turn,&quot; a trader said.  Referring to the shorts one trader suggested that their strategy was to offer small parcels of metal into a thin market which in turn drives prices lower.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole purpose is to knock a thin market and then cover back at cheaper levels&quot;.</p>
<p>Others in the market were quick to disagree with this scenario.</p>
<p>They said that the price was drifting lower in the summer torpor amid the lack of brisk activity from consumers. &quot;Any market lacking buyers will fall its as simple as that,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>A loss of production at Canada's Falconbridge Ltd Sudbury, Ontario, facility and low levels of nearby stock underpinned cobalt.</p>
<p>Traders said global stocks were extremely low and consumers that traditionally cover in the fourth period were becoming sensitive to improved market fundamentals.</p>
<p>Workers at Sudbury have been on strike since August 1. The facility produced 1,600 tonnes of cobalt, including custom feed, in 1996.</p>
<p>One source said that five tonnes a day is being lost due to the strike.</p>
<p>Usually during the slow summer period in the Northern Hemisphere consumers can find enough material to meet their requirements.</p>
<p>The strike is going on against the backdrop of low production from  Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Traders' stocks are also believed to be minimal.</p>
<p>One trader estimated that stocks held world-wide was around 1,000 tonnes, compared with approximately 18,000 tonnes at the end of 1993.</p>
<p>The trader estimated the stocks/weeks consumption  ratio is currently at critical levels at around two-weeks.</p>
<p>With the brisk fourth quarter fast approaching supply and demand will become a major concern to the market.</p>
<p>Traders will also continue to eye cobalt stockpile sales from the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). The August tender of around 500,000 pounds of material was oversubscribed by nearly five times the amount on offer. Bids totalled more than 2.4 million pounds.</p>
<p>The DLA is likely to tender between 500,000 and 600,000 tonnes of cobalt in September, below the expected 1.5 million pounds, traders said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, tungsten ferro moved higher against the backdrop of a lack of Chinese shipmates. The other main producer, Russia, was also showing a coyness to deliver into a market with a supply shortness.</p>
<p>Molybdenum slipped on Chinese offers, while indium drifted also in a thin market lacking in consumer enquiry.</p>
