<p>South Africa was determined not to let its new-found democracy and openness to the rest of the world result in it being invaded by organised crime and money launderers, Justice Minister Dullah Omar said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It has become open season for well-organised crime and drug syndicates, which are making millions of rands in profits using sophisticated and ingenious methods to evade the police and customs,&quot; he said at the opening the 1997 KPMG International Forensic Accounting Network Conference.</p>
<p>Money laundering had been made easier by the internationalisation of economies and financial services, Omar said, and a movement towards deregulation of national economies and markets.</p>
<p>Until recently, South African law provided no legal way in which information could be gathered to track down money launderers, carry out investigations in foreign countries or repatriate the proceeds of any crime or the criminals involved.</p>
<p>This situation was remedied last year with the passing of several acts in parliament. In addition, the Office for Serious Economic Offences had been formed to help track down economic criminals of various kinds.</p>
<p>Omar said he was encouraged that the business community had started showing a more positive attitude in reporting commercial crime and was co-operating with the police.</p>
<p>A survey had shown that in 1994, 20 percent of businesses canvassed had reported economic crime to the police. A follow-up survey in 1996 found that this had grown to 53 percent.</p>
