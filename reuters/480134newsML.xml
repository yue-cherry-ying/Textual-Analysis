<p>Dutch financial services group ING Groep NV (ING) said on Tuesday it is combining its ING Barings investment banking unit with its ING Bank International corporate banking unit.</p>
<p>ING spokesman Ruud Polet said the two subsidiaries had been co-operating since the Dutch group bought British merchant bank Barings in March 1995 after it collapsed from derivatives trading losses in Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;We are formalising now an organisational structure that was already practiced in our activities,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the new name for the combined business had not yet been decided, but ING Barings would be logical.</p>
<p>Polet said all business units within the ING Corporate and Investment Banking executive centre would be combined as part of the process. A total of 9,000 staff are employed within these business units.</p>
<p>He also said the management structure of the combined business would change, with details to be provided on Thursday by executive board chairman Aad Jacobs at a news conference for ING's 1996 results.</p>
