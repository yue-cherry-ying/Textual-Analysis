<p>Hong Kong's new government said it would introduce legislation on Wednesday to suspend pre-handover labour laws boosting workers' rights, but trade unions said they would continue fighting against a &quot;tycoon dictatorship&quot;.</p>
<p>The government, led by Beijing-backed chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, announced on Tuesday that the laws adopted by the colonial legislature just days before China dissolved it would need a &quot;proper and thorough scrutiny of the implications&quot;.</p>
<p>The laws boosting union strength have aligned the unelected government, which took over on July 1 after China regained sovereignty over Hong Kong from Britain, with powerful industrialists in a struggle against labour groups.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's industry-backed Liberal Party says the laws will damage the economy.</p>
<p>James Tien, a member of the Provisional Legislature and also a clothing and property magnate, told the South China Morning Post:</p>
<p>&quot;If we don't abolish them quickly, it will not only undermine investors' confidence in Hong Kong, it will also ruin the harmonious employer-employee relationship.&quot;</p>
<p>But Lee Cheuk-yan, general secretary of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (CTU), told Reuters: &quot;Even if they repeal the law, we can still try to use our industrial strength for collective bargaining, but the law would have given us a very much established channel.&quot;</p>
<p>He said industrial tycoons dominated the new Executive Council and Provisional Legislature, where their influence was untempered by elected lawmakers. Elections are due to be held next May.</p>
<p>&quot;If (the Provisional Legislature) does more than the minimum, it would give a very clear message, it would be a patronage of tycoons and they don't care about the rule of law.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the last-minute laws gives unions the right to use collective bargaining in negotiating workers' pay packages.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very basic right enshrined in the International Labour Convention and it's a basic right enjoyed by our competitors in Asia and elsewhere,&quot; said Lee.</p>
<p>He began a five-day hunger strike in protest against the government's proposal to suspend the labour laws, local radio reported late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Analysts have repeatedly warned that Hong Kong's competitiveness is already threatened by its high labour costs and soaring property prices which slash profit margins.</p>
<p>But some say that greater union bargaining power, which would almost certainly drive up wages, would upset employers' but may not be a total disaster.</p>
<p>&quot;(The laws) shift more negotiating power to labour, so employers have less negotiating power, it's understandable they're not overly happy about the provisions of the law,&quot; said Michael Martin, assistant chief economist with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council,</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, if the average Hong Kong worker is receiving a higher income, it means they have a higher disposable income and can consume more, and stimulate the economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Martin said other nations around the world had identified collective bargaining as a fundamental workers' right and there was a push for members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to support it. Chinese-ruled Hong Kong is a WTO member, and negotiations are under way for the admission of China proper.</p>
