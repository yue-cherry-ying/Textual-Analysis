<title>USA: Clinton to waive parts of Helms-Burton law again.</title>
<headline>Clinton to waive parts of Helms-Burton law again.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-07-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton has decided to waive controversial portions of the Helms-Burton Act designed to crack down on foreign companies doing business in Cuba, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Under the 1996 law, Clinton must decide every six months whether to waive those parts of the law that allow American citizens to sue in U.S. courts foreign firms deemed to have profited from U.S. property confiscated by Cuba after its 1959 communist revolution.  </p>
<p>The U.S. official, who asked not to be named, said the decision was expected to be announced later on Wednesday by Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Stuart Eizenstat.</p>
<p>Clinton has twice before waived the controversial portions of the law, in July 1996 and January 1997. He was required by the law to make his decision on the matter by midnight EDT Wednesday (0400 GMT on Thursday).</p>
<p>The Helms-Burton Act, designed to bring pressure to bear on Cuba to adopt democratic reforms, was signed into law in March 1996, a month after Cuban warplanes shot down two civilian aircraft, killing four Cuban-Americans on board.</p>
<p>The law, named for its Republican sponsors Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Representative Dan Burton of Indiana, has been bitterly criticised by Canada and the European Union, who fear that their companies may be subject to lawsuits under the provisions that Clinton suspended on Wednesday.</p>
