<p>The Bank of China has launched forward trading of yuan against the U.S. dollar from Tuesday to reduce risks to clients, the China Securities said.</p>
<p>The trading, the first such business conducted by a domestic bank, has been approved by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The Bank of China has started the trading at its head office and in 12 branches including those in Shanghai, the northern port city of Tianjin and southern boomtown of Shenzhen, it said.</p>
<p>The forward yuan-dollar trading was designed to reduce risks and prevent losses to clients involved in foreign exchange trading, it said. Risks were brought by fluctuations of foreign exchange rates.</p>
<p>The trading would have a maximum period of 120 days and would cover nine types, including seven-day, 20-day, one-month, and three-month. Exchange rates would be based on rates published daily by the bank's head office.</p>
<p>All domestic institutions and foreign-funded firms that have accounts at the bank's head office and the 12 branches would be allowed to conduct the trading, it said.</p>
