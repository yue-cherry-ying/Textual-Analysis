<headline>FOCUS-Eurobourses slightly firmer, dollar stable.</headline>

<p>The major European bourses were slightly firmer on Friday despite a weaker close on Wall Street overnight and the dollar appeared to have stabilised against the yen after its recent rise.</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 index was up just 2.9 points at 0930 GMT in what dealers described as a tight market.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a sellers' strike. It's all bids. Everytime the market-makers sell something there's just nowhere to go and get it back,&quot; said a senior dealer.</p>
<p>Defence stocks were the big corporate feature with GKN boosted by a court ruling and other defence shares rising as fears eased of a tougher British government line on military exports.</p>
<p>In Germany leading shares edged up in early trade but were not seen staging any major rally with holidays in the United States and Britain on Monday dampening trade and making significant dollar movements unlikely.</p>
<p>The IBIS-DAX index of electronic business gained nearly half a percent early on before slipping back to 3,591.95, 11.87 points up on the day.</p>
<p>Volkswagen gained 18.0 marks to 1,155 marks, pushing through a technical resistance point of 1,150, and Daimler was up 75 pfennigs at 132.40. Dealers said there had been buy recommendations in the motor sector.</p>
<p>Dresdner Bank stood 39 pfennigs lower at 61.70 after reporting first quarter operating profit before provisions up 10 percent. It said it was cautiously optimistic for 1997 results and dividend as a whole.</p>
<p>Earlier, it denied media reports it was interested in taking a stake in Postbank, the state-owned bank currently tied to the postal system.</p>
<p>On the Paris bourse stocks opened higher on the last trading day before the first round of the parliamentary election, helped by a poll showing the centre-right going into Sunday's voting with a lead, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is reacting to the poll published in the (Swiss) Tribune de Geneve, but we're advising people to protect themselves against an adverse reaction on Monday,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Publication of polls is banned in France from one week before the elections under French law.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was up about a quarter of a percentage point helped in part, traders said, by higher bond prices.</p>
<p>    On the currency front dealers said the dollar was   stuck to</p>
<p>familiar ranges just below 116 yen and above 1.69 marks, finding little impetus to break either way.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar is lacking a bit of interest, to be honest. We've got a long weekend coming up and some of the banks are off,&quot; said a senior dealer at a British merchant bank.</p>
<p>Against the yen, the dollar was virtually unchanged at 115.82 against 116.05 in late Europe on Thursday.</p>
<p>Traders said the dollar was relegated to the side-lines as the market eyed a stumble in sterling, punished by speculation Bank of England Governor Eddie George might not be reappointed at the end of his five-year term next year.</p>
<p>&quot;Most interest is on sterling and its crosses after the well-publicised dispute between (finance minister) Gordon Brown and Eddie George,&quot; said the trader.</p>
<p>George, an anti-inflation hawk, has criticised Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown for transferring the Bank of England's regulatory role to a strengthened Securities and Investment Board.</p>
<p>The pound was down from late Thursday levels in early European trading but off its overnight lows against the mark and dollar at around 2.7520 marks and 1.6250 dollars.</p>
<p>STOCK PRICES AT 0930 GMT</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 was up 2.9 points at 4,654</p>
<p>The Paris CAC-40 index was up 9.72 points at 2,751.57.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's DAX index was up 11.87 at 3,591.95.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 0930 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar stood at 1.6930 marks and 115.82 yen compared with 1.6947 marks and 116.05 yen in late European trade on Thursday.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $341.65 versus a $342.75 close in London on Thursday. Silver was off a cent at $4.68.</p>
