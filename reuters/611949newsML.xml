<headline>Turkey's Ciller says elections can solve crisis.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Turkey's deputy prime minister, Tansu Ciller, said elections could solve the country's deepening government crisis, heightened on Friday by the resignation of a coalition deputy.</p>
<p>&quot;We can see a road leading to elections. The solution is the people, your decision,&quot; she told a meeting of businessmen. &quot;Whatever we do, we will do together. We will open the way to the ballot box,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Earlier, the resignation of an MP dealt a fresh blow to the the government of Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, already hit by the departure of three ministers from the secularist wing of his coalition.</p>
<p>Anatolian news agency said deputy Samil Ayrim quit Ciller's conservative True Path Party, after he had been quoted in the Turkish press as saying he would step down in a row over the government's Islamist leanings.</p>
<p>The agency also said one of the True Path's deputy chairmen, Necmettin Cevheri, resigned his post. Cevheri was formerly close to True Path leader Ciller, who was Turkey's first woman prime minister and is now the foreign minister.</p>
<p>&quot;I have forwarded my resignation to the chairwoman this morning,&quot; Anatolian quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>The MP's resignation leaves the coalition with 279 MPs, a slim majority in the 550-member parliament.</p>
<p>Intense pressure from the army for Erbakan to crack down on Islamist activists has opened up serious cracks in the 11-month-old coalition.</p>
<p>Erbakan won an opposition censure motion this week by only half a dozen votes. He was helped by six MPs from a small right-wing party who backed the government.</p>
<p>The Hurriyet daily quoted Ayrim as saying he wished he had withdrawn support for Erbakan at the censure motion. &quot;I have realised how wrong I was,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The cabinet failed to hold a scheduled meeting on Thursday for the eighth week running amid reports that Ciller had asked Erbakan to hand her the reins of power.</p>
<p>&quot;Democracy is the solution. The people and the ballot box are also the solution for social compromise and secularism. That ballot box will come into play sooner or later,&quot; Ciller said.</p>
<p>Erbakan's Islam-based Welfare Party is facing a case in the constitutional court that could lead to its closure on grounds that it threatens Turkey's official secularism.</p>
