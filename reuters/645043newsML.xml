<p>Belgium sounded a clear warning to European group seven leaders The Netherlands on Saturday by routing San Marino 6-0 in their World Cup qualifier.</p>
<p>Arch-rivals The Netherlands and Belgium are now both on 15 points from six matches but the Dutch are still ahead on goal difference.</p>
<p>The other teams in the group, Turkey and Wales, are virtually out of the reckoning for first or second place while group weaklings San Marino are left without points.</p>
<p>Belgium, who appeared down and out when they were thrashed 3-0 at home by the Netherlands last December, have found a new lease of life after switching coaches and revamping their team.</p>
<p>They have won their last three games, including crucial away victories against Wales and Turkey, and are aiming for group victory by beating the Netherlands at home in September, which would secure access to their fifth successive World Cup finals.</p>
<p>Second place would force them into a play-off against a second-ranked team from another group.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to go for the group victory,&quot; Belgium captain Franky Van der Elst said. &quot;We may go down 3-0 or 4-0 over there but we could win also. Today we showed that our strikers are lethal, we are armed (to beat the Dutch),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Brimming with confidence, Belgium quickly stamped their authority on the match and could already have been 4-0 up when midfielder Lorenzo Staelens opened the scoring in the 16th minute.</p>
<p>They added four more goals before the break, Lokonda Mpenza scoring twice and Luis Oliveira and libero Eric Van Meir both once.</p>
<p>But Belgium, who have often struggled in the past to topple weaker opponents, found it difficult to keep the momentum going after the interval.</p>
<p>&quot;It could have been 8-0, 9-0 or 10-0 after the first half. And we wanted to keep going in the second half. But then there were some poor passes, some misunderstanding, and we could not find our rhythm again...the second half leaves a bit of a bad feeling,&quot; Van der Elst said.</p>
<p>The only second-half strike came five minutes from time when Staelens headed a corner kick into the net.</p>
