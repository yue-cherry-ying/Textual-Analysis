<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan Interior Minister resigns.</title>
<headline>Taiwan Interior Minister resigns.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Taiwan's Interior Minister Lin Feng-cheng, under fire for a spate of violent crimes on the island, has tendered his resignation to Premier Lien Chan, his office said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Lin was the second cabinet official to resign on Thursday, following the resignation of Ma Ying-jeou, minister without portfolio and a popular politican.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have delivered Minister Lin's resignation to the premier's office this morning,&quot; an aide to Lin told Reuters by telephone. He declined to give details.</p>
<p>Public discontent over the government's failure to keep law and order has erupted since the strangled body of renowed actress Pai Ping-ping's teenage daughter was found naked in a river last month.</p>
<p>Police said 17-year-old Pai Hsiao-yen had been kidnapped and murdered. The killers remain at large.</p>
<p>More than 50,000 people marched in Taipei on Sunday protesting against Pai's murder and demanding a cabinet reshuffle and Lien's resignation.</p>
