<p>State-owned Air France Europe limped into Europe's new &quot;open skies&quot; on Tuesday as ground staff and pilots extended a strike in protest at the airline's merger with big brother Air France.</p>
<p>The stoppage highlighted labour disputes that dog French airlines on the day that Air France took a key step towards a full merger with the former Air Inter, set for September, leasing the domestic carrier's activities and staff.</p>
<p>&quot;The French airlines' domestic problems run deep, and deregulation in Europe will come as a painful eye-opener. Industrial unrest is likely to continue,&quot; said Chris Avery, airline analyst at Paribas Capital Markets.</p>
<p>After the strike hit travellers on the busy Easter holiday weekend, Air France Europe (AFE) was forced to cancel most morning flights from Paris' Orly airport when ground staff voted to continue their stoppage for another 24 hours.</p>
<p>An AFE spokeswoman said all flights scheduled after two p.m. (1300 GMT) left normally as many employees went to work.</p>
<p>Unions at Air France Europe have cited the absence of negotiations on the unifying of their more generous pay and employment terms with those of parent company Air France.</p>
<p>Management says those terms need to be brought into line with those of lower-cost competitors such as British Airways.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately the strike is the only form of labour dialogue we can have with our management. For the past four months management has said 'no' to all our proposals,&quot; said Marcel Thibault, representing two ground staff unions among those which met management on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The AFE spokeswoman said it cancelled all flights until mid-morning save a few shuttle services to Marseille, Nice and Toulouse.</p>
<p>Air travel was also disrupted by a one-day strike by staff at the city's airport authority, Aeroports de Paris, against planned job cuts, which blanked out flight information screens and caused delays in baggage-handling and departures.</p>
<p>Ground staff strikes forced Air France Europe to cancel many flights on Saturday and all flights on Sunday.</p>
<p>Junior Transport Minister Anne-Marie Idrac said on Monday she was appalled by the wave of strikes, saying they jeopardised the state airlines' future as French air space opened up to competition under European open skies rules.</p>
<p>With more than 20 million passengers a year, France has the lion's share of European Union air travel but experts say that a sea change is unlikely in the short term at least.</p>
<p>Orly, the only French airport likely to attract European companies for domestic flights, is saturated. Traffic already exceeds the ceiling of 250,000 flights a year which the government set in 1993, leaving no slots free for new operators.</p>
<p>Asked whether deregulation would have an impact in France, Avery said: &quot;In the medium term, yes. On Day One it's unlikely there will be any unleashing as occurred in the United States in 1978. But deregulation will continue to come and it's a tide that cannot be reversed.&quot;</p>
<p>Air France plans to test the open skies rules from May 5, challenging a Lufthansa bastion with the launch of a Frankfurt-Berlin service. It also plans a British domestic link-up, possibly in partnership with Jersey European.</p>
<p>Air France is slated for privatisation but no date has been set. Chairman Christian Blanc said in January he wanted to hold the sale later this year or early in 1998, with employees owning between 20 to 30 percent of the shares.</p>
<p>Jean-Claude Baumgarten, his special adviser, told Reuters on Friday that the group was on track for break-even in late 1997.</p>
