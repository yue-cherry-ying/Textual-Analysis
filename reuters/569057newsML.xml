<title>BULGARIA: Bulgaria lev ends up as investors eye local debt.</title>
<headline>Bulgaria lev ends up as investors eye local debt.</headline>
<dateline>SOFIA 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>The Bulgarian lev firmed at close on Thursday to 1,505-1,506 per dollar from 1,510-1,512 as foreign currency supply from investors buying domestic debt paper persisted.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade was quiet and in light volumes. The lev gained some five to six (levs per dollar) from the morning as investors offered foreign currency to buy treasury paper while demand was low,&quot; a commercial bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Local and foreign investors have been actively selling foreign currency for levs to invest in high-yield local debt instruments since March as Bulgaria's macroeconomic performance improved after an interim cabinet took office.</p>
<p>Interest in domestic bad debt bonds, also has been running high as they can be used as means of payment in local sell-offs.</p>
<p>The central bank was was not seen in the market today, traders said.</p>
<p>The mark was bid at 873-880 levs and was offered at 882-889 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Demand for marks remained low on the local market this week despite an earlier announcement by government officials that the lev could be pegged to the mark rather than the dollar, as an anchor currency in a fixed exchange rate regime due to be introduced in mid-year.</p>
<p>Traders attributed low interest in the German mark to its small local market share of two to three percent of daily interbank turnover for the past several weeks.</p>
<p>Dollar trade accounts for 45 percent of the domestic forex daily turnover and the lev exchange rates for other major currencies are adjusted to their spot rates against the dollar on international markets. -- Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-981-4145</p>
