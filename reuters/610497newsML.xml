<headline>Australian rate cut may not squeeze bank margins.</headline>

<p>Australian banks will not necessarily see their margins eroded further after Friday's official interest rate cut although it was too soon to identify a bottom line impact, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure it will have a major impact,&quot; said analyst Michael Pulman of ABN Amro Hoare Govett.</p>
<p>&quot;It will depend on just where the variable rates of the banks settle. If they only cut them by 0.35 percent, I would think that would fairly adequately offset the pressure.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia cut the official cash  rate to 5.5 percent from 6.0 percent.</p>
<p>Rates were last cut in December 1996 when the official cash rate was brought down to 6.0 percent from 6.5 percent.</p>
<p>Since then competitive conditions in the home loan market have meant a reduction of about 0.7 percentage points without a corresponding cut in official rates.</p>
<p>To protect their home loan business from mushrooming mortgage originators, banks have been forced to cut their rates, with consequent pressure on margins.  </p>
<p>This pressure manifested itself in a sharp selloff of bank shares last week after National Australia Bank Ltd and Westpac Banking Corp posted stronger first half profits, but confirmed domestic margins were narrowing.</p>
<p>How much of the cut was absorbed by the banks was obviously a key issue in any discussion on margins, with analysts noting that less than the full amount had been passed on by three of the big four banks that had released a response so far.  </p>
<p>&quot;Having already cut housing rates by 70 basis points earlier in the year without a corresponding cut in the cash rate, you could say thay have passed on most of this rate cut already,&quot; said Steven Kench of Prudential-Bache Securities (Australia) Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;The difference is just the competitive nature of the housing market.&quot;</p>
<p>Other analysts echoed similar sentiments, saying the tighter conditions meant banks were likely to be judicious in pricing.  </p>
<p>&quot;Given they have only brought it down 35 points and not the full 50, they are obviously not willing to go any further than they have to,&quot; said an analyst at a Melbourne stockbroker.</p>
<p>Kench noted the same pricing pressures, but said it was too soon to detail a definitive effect although he conceded it could hurt banks further down the line.</p>
<p>&quot;It depends on the ability of the banks to manage the interest rate cut within their balance sheets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But it has the potential to add some more pressure.&quot;  </p>
<p>By Friday's close, NAB shares were 34 cents higher at A$18.79 and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd shares were 13.5 cents higher at A$8.315.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank were up four cents at A$14.13 while Westpac, yet to release its response to the rate cut, was five cents lower at A$7.19.</p>
