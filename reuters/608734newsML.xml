<p>- The largest Czech leasing company, Skofin, confirmed that it will not increase its prices, despite the recent developments with the crown.</p>
<p>- More banks followed Komercni Banka, IPB bank and CSOB in increasing their interest rates. Moravia Banka increased its Prime rate yesterday to 17.2 percent and its base rate to 20 percent.</p>

<p>MLADA FRONTA DNES - It is still unclear as to what changes will take place in the cabinet, even after a meeting of coalition leaders and President Vaclav Havel yesterday. The Christian Democrats still insist they will not replace any of their ministers, and a battle within the Civic Democratic Party over whether to replace Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik continues.</p>
<p>- Parliament yesterday accepted the cabinet's report on the state of the economy. The proposal from the opposition Social Democrats (CSSD) to help the economy, in which CSSD called for the dismissal of Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik and Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, did not pass.</p>

<p>- Revenue from the sale of products and services in the agrarian sector in March reached a total of 4.757 billion crowns, and increased by 2.4 percent year-on-year. After subtracting inflation, sales increased year-on-year by 0.2 percent.</p>
<p>- Beginning today, Komercni Banka will increase its fines on overdrafts to 100 percent from 50 on client deposits.</p>

<p>- The president of the Economic Chamber, Zdenek Somr, said yesterday that if higher interest rates remain in the banking sector longer than one week, it will have a dramatic effect on the business sector. He called for devaluation of the crown if the high interest rates will be long-term, in which case the import deposit system would no longer make sense.</p>
