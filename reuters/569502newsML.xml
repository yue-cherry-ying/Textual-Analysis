<headline>TV's family hour &quot;no place for kids&quot; - U.S. study.</headline>

<p>Children today were more likely to hear foul language on prime-time television during what traditionally has been called the &quot;family hour,&quot; a conservative media watchdog group said in a study Thursday.</p>
<p>But there has been a drop in sexual references in shows broadcast between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. Eastern Time, the Media Research Centre said in a new report comparing shows aired in February with those in the fall of 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;If your children watch network TV between 8 and 9, the so-called family hour, they have, on average, an 88 percent chance of hearing a swear world like 'ass,' or 'bastard' or 'bitch,' or even an altered version of the f-word,&quot; Media Research Centre Chairman Brent Bozell told a news conference.</p>
<p>Researchers tracked 144 programmes totalling 93 hours of programming in February. Overall, a third of the shows had at least one obscenity, according to the study. In particular, it found 0.88 obscenities per programme hour, up from 0.62 obscenities per programme hour in the fall of 1995.</p>
<p>References to sex outside of marriage outnumbered references to sex within a marriage by a ratio of 3.6 to 1. That was down from the 1995 level of 8 to 1.</p>
<p>Nielsen figures show the networks have more than 13 million prime-time viewers age 17 and under, and that young viewership is especially high in the first hour of prime time, according to the researchers.</p>
<p>The Media Research Centre said the Fox network -- which airs shows such as &quot;Melrose Place&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot; -- was the most &quot;foulmouthed&quot; and &quot;sexually obsessed&quot; network. A Fox spokesman was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>In general, the study found that just under a third of the programmes in the 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. slot received a TV-G rating -- or &quot;suitable for all ages&quot; -- under the TV industry's recently introduced ratings system.</p>
<p>&quot;The findings of this year's study leave little doubt that the old family hour is now mostly a fiction and the spirit that once supported it is for all intents and purposes dead,&quot; Sen. Joseph Lieberman told the news conference.</p>
<p>The Connecicut Democrat is a sponsor of legislation that would waive anti-trust rules and allow TV networks to develop voluntary guidelines on sex, language and other issues.</p>
<p>Martin Franks, senior vice presdient at CBS Inc. -- which Lieberman praised for its programming -- said his network was &quot;proud&quot; of its &quot;family-friendly&quot; shows broadcast at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>&quot;Having said that, the Congress killed off the family viewing hour in the name of 'competition and viewer choice' when it decided to go from five channels to 500 channels,&quot; he added, referring to the explosion in alternatives to network programming.</p>
<p>House Speaker Newt Gingrich has urged the television networks to re-establish family programming during the first hour of prime time each night.</p>
<p>Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, said the networks used to reserve the first hour of nightly programing for shows like &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; that were suitable for all viewers.</p>
