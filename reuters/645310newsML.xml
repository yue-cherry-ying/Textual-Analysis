<p>President Bill Clinton on Saturday called for &quot;swift and severe&quot; punishment for those who commit hate crimes and said he will convene a White House conference on the problem in November.</p>
<p>&quot;It is time for us to mount an all-out assault on hate crimes, to punish them swiftly and severely, and to do more to prevent them from happening in the first place,&quot; Clinton said in his weekly radio address, devoted to what he called &quot;one of America's greatest challenges.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton pointed to a recent incident in a white suburb of Atlanta in which a black couple faced racial epithets when they moved into their new home, and the beating of a man in Washington because he was gay. He also cited a Jewish student in Los Angeles whose dormitory room was bombed.</p>
<p>&quot;Such hate crimes, committed solely because the victims have a different skin colour or a different faith or are gays or lesbians, leave deep scars not only on the victims, but on our larger community,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>&quot;They tear us apart when we should be moving closer together,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;They are acts of violence against America itself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To truly move forward as one community, it is just not enough to prevent acts of violence to our bodies, we must prevent acts of violence to our spirits,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Clinton said he has asked Attorney General Janet Reno to review laws involving hate crimes before the conference.</p>
<p>Clinton offered no specific details in his remarks but said the November conference will ask law enforcement experts and Justice Department and congressional officials to &quot;take a serious look at the existing laws against hate crimes and consider ways to improve enforcement and strengthen them.&quot;</p>
<p>According the latest figures complied by the FBI, there were 7,947 hate crimes committed in the United States during 1995, involving 10,469 victims.</p>
<p>The crimes, which were spread over 45 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, involved racial bias in 61 percent of the cases and religious persecution in 16 percent. Bias because of sexual orientation was blamed in 13 percent of the cases.</p>
