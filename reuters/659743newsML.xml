<headline>Public divided on immunity for tobacco cos - poll.</headline>

<text>
<p>A Business Week/Harris Opinion poll released Friday showed the American public nearly evenly divided on whether tobacco companies should be given immunity from future legal claims as part of a settlement.</p>
<p>The poll found that 49 percent of respondents opposed tobacco companies getting immunity, even if the companies agreed to restrictions on sales and advertising and also agreed to pay smokers for existing claims.</p>
<p>But 45 percent of the 1,001 people polled said the companies should be given immunity, Business Week said in a news release.  </p>
<p>The companies are negotiating a possible settlement with regulators and the health-care community.</p>
<p>The poll also found that 71 percent of respondents think the tobacco companies lied about the health risks of smoking cigarettes, while 23 percent said they thought the companies told the truth. One percent said they did not know, and five percent refused to respond.</p>
<p>Asked specifically if they thought the companies had lied concerning the addictive nature of tobacco, 77 percent of those polled said the companies lied, while 15 percent said they told the truth. One percent did not know, and seven percent refused to answer.</p>
<p>The poll was conducted between June 6 and June 10, and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
