<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton pledged to Central American leaders on Thursday that he will permit no mass deportation of the region's illegal immigrants in America who could be sent home under a new U.S. immigration law.</p>
<p>At a one-day summit with presidents of eight countries in the region, Clinton preached a message of hemispheric harmony, trying to calm Central American sensitivities that the United States abandoned them when the Cold War ended and the region was no longer as strategically important.</p>
<p>Saying the United States &quot;must not just be neighbours but real partners&quot; with Central America, Clinton promised to push the U.S. Congress to approve an expansion of products the countries may export tariff-free to America to include textiles and others, while he pursues the broader goal of a free-trade agreement of the Americas by 2005.</p>
<p>The expansion would cost the United States an estimated $2 billion (corrects from $5 billion) in lost tariffs over five years. The balanced budget agreement that Clinton concluded with Republican leaders of Congress a week ago accounts for the lost tariff revenue.</p>
<p>Meeting in the ornate National Theatre on a bright sunny day, the only real concrete measure concluded by the leaders at the first U.S.-Central American summit in almost 30 years was an &quot;open skies&quot; agreement to liberalise commercial air travel between the United States and Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.</p>
<p>It will eliminate restrictions on how often airlines can fly, the kind of aircraft they use and the prices they can charge.</p>
<p>Fears of a mass deportation of Central Americans living illegally in the United States have swept the region because of a hard-hitting immigration law. The U.S. government estimates 300,000 people from this region are living illegally in the United States and could be affected by the law.</p>
<p>Clinton said he was not required to trigger the law until Sept. 30 and that between now and then he would work with Congress to try to soften it. He pointed out the law was more directed at illegal immigration at the U.S. border, in the workplace and in the courts.</p>
<p>&quot;As to people who are generally not in America legally, there will be no mass deportations and no targeting of any citizens from any country,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;They will have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he believed some in Congress would recognise with him that people from Central America are in a &quot;rather special category&quot; because many people from the region fled civil wars in the 1980s in which the United States was involved, such as El Salvador and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>That was music to the ears of El Salvador's President Armando Calderon Sol. He said it was &quot;very refreshing&quot; to hear Clinton recognise the &quot;human drama&quot; Central Americans are experiencing in the United States &quot;as a result of what happened here in what was the theatre of operations for the Cold War.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. officials said the Central American presidents told Clinton during the summit they were particularly concerned about the social burden the returning immigrants would cause on their return, including the loss of cash they sent home from America.</p>
<p>Central American leaders were appreciative that Clinton wanted to expand free trade with the region as well. Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu said the region did not want to &quot;just hold out a hand and receive aid&quot; but are &quot;ready to compete&quot; for trade.</p>
<p>At the summit were leaders of the five traditional Central American countries -- Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica -- plus neighbouring Panama and Belize, and the Dominican Republic, a Caribbean island nation.</p>
