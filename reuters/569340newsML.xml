<p>China urged Japan on Thursday to take action against a Japanese parliamentarian for landing on one of a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea.</p>
<p>&quot;The Japanese government...should take action against the people who illegally landed on the Diaoyu Islands,&quot; Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a news briefing without saying what Beijing had in mind.</p>
<p>The Japanese prefecture of Okinawa administers the disputed islands, called the Diaoyus by China and Taiwan, and the Senkakus by Japan. All three countries claim sovereignty.</p>
<p>&quot;They (Japanese government) also think the landing on the Diaoyus is illegal,&quot; Shen said. &quot;We think the most important question now is (if) the Japanese government takes measures against the Japanese who landed on the Diaoyus.&quot;</p>
<p>Shingo Nishimura, a conservative member of Japan's main opposition New Frontier Party, and three other people on Tuesday landed on one of the islands to inspect security and hold a brief commemorative ceremony.</p>
<p>The Japanese government was quick to distance itself from Nishimura's group, which included former cabinet minister Shintaro Ishihara, author of the 1980s nationalist treatise &quot;A Japan That Can Say No&quot;.</p>
<p>The dispute over the uninhabited rocky outcrops in the East China Sea threatens to put China and Japan on a new collision course just as ties are returning to normal.</p>
<p>The waters surrounding the islands are rich fishing grounds and are believed to contain unexploited oil and gas reserves.</p>
<p>Japan has claimed the islands, located between Taiwan and Okinawa, since 1895, while China says it has owned them for centuries.</p>
<p>Shen said there were certain differences between China and Japan over the islands but that Beijing advocated holding talks to resolve them.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always advocated settling this problem at an appropriate time through peaceful dialogue.&quot;</p>
<p>Shen said Tokyo was not trying hard enough and should take effective measures to prevent illegal landings in future.</p>
<p>In Taipei, Taiwan demonstrators threw eggs and scuffled with police on Thursday as they tried to storm Japan's de facto embassy in Taipei to protest against the landing.</p>
<p>The sovereignty row ignited fiery nationalist passions in Chinese communities in Hong Kong and Taiwan last year after a Japanese right-wing group built a makeshift lighthouse on one of the islands.</p>
<p>A Hong Kong activist who joined a protest flotilla last September drowned when he jumped into stormy waters to press China's claim.</p>
<p>The latest episode has been an embarrassment for Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who hopes to exchange visits with his Chinese counterpart Li Peng this year to mark the 25th anniversary of bilateral ties.</p>
<p>In recent months, Beijing-Tokyo ties, including a resumption of Japanese grant aid, have got back on track after they were frozen over China's nuclear testing.</p>
