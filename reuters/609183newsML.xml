<p>Red Cross negotiators from rival North and South Korea on Friday reached basic agreement on the supply of thousands of tonnes of grain from the prosperous South to its hungry Stalinist neighbour, Seoul officials said.</p>
<p>After a resumption of stalled Inter-Korean Red Cross talks in Beijing, Seoul had agreed to supply 40,000 tonnes of food worth $8.0 million to Pyongyang by the end of July, said Chang Moon-ik, spokesman of the South Korean embassy in Beijing.</p>
<p>Details of transportation and packaging would be completed during a second day of talks between Red Cross negotiators in the Chinese capital, Chang said.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically the North Koreans accepted our proposal,&quot; he said. &quot;If this is delivered smoothly we'll (supply) a second batch.&quot;</p>
<p>The last round of talks between Red Cross officials of the two rival Koreas ended in failure on May 5 after the famine-threatened North demanded to know the exact amount of aid it could expect before discussing moves to speed up delivery.</p>
<p>Seoul later agreed to reveal the size of the planned donations, which will be made up mostly of corn but will include flour, powdered milk and instant noodles.</p>
<p>Lee Byung-woong, secretary general of the South Korean Red Cross delegation, was pushing northern counterparts to accept direct transport through the town of Panmunjom that straddles the highly militarised border between the two Koreas, Chang said.</p>
<p>Capitalist Seoul and Communist Pyongyang have been technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean civil war ended only in a truce, and decades of mutual mistrust have made even basic food aid a delicate diplomatic affair.</p>
<p>North Korea, which takes self-reliance as its guiding ideology, has sought to limit any direct contact involved in taking southern grain, while Seoul wants to maximise exchanges and to make sure its aid is clearly labelled as such.</p>
<p>Direct shipping across the border would allow significant savings for a humanitarian effort aimed at helping Pyongyang's own citizens avoid famine, Chang said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a commercial deal, it is a donation to save the North Korean people (from) hunger,&quot; he said, but added Seoul was willing to consider other entry routes for the grain.</p>
<p>North Korea should allow three of its main ports to be used, while the aid could also be shipped from the Chinese city of Dandong, although such options would raise costs, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We strongly suggest to North Korea to use the inland transportation,&quot; Chang said.</p>
<p>Transportation through China was difficult to arrange, as current delays involved in the shipment of 15,000 tonnes of corn donated by southern civic groups had shown, he said.</p>
<p>Packaging was a key issue, as aid should be clearly labelled as coming from the South Korean Red Cross and private donors in the South were keen to have the names of their organisations emblazoned on their gifts, he said.</p>
<p>North Korea had accepted that donated instant noodles would not be taken out of their labelled packets before distribution, an issue on which it had previously taken an aggressive stance, he said.</p>
<p>South Korea had agreed to be responsible for all transportation costs for the food aid, while Pyongyang would pay for unloading, he said.</p>
