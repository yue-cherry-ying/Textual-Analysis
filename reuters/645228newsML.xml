<p>Poland's large CPN SA petrol station network has increased its margins on fuel prices, freed by the country in February, by around four groszes a litre over two months, Dziennik Prawa i Gospodarki daily said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The newspaper said that between March 24 and the end of May, state-owned CPN's margin on a litre of 94 octane petrol rose by five groszes to 15 groszes, while it increased four groszes for 98 octane and for 95 octane unleaded fuel.</p>
<p>The margin on diesel was up by three groszes to between 16 and 18 groszes, the paper said.</p>
<p>A May report by the private Polish Liquid Fuels Chamber said Poland had 5,234 petrol stations in January of which 26 percent belonged to CPN, and Dziennik Prawa i Gospodarki said CPN's market position allowed it to dictate fuels prices.</p>
<p>It said the network's prices varied by region and had remained flat in some areas since early May while in others they had risen this month.</p>
<p>CPN officials could not immediately be reached for comment on Saturday.</p>
<p>Prices have been keenly watched since the finance ministry in February freed them for domestically produced fuels and lifted administrative limits on profit margins applied to engine fuel trade.</p>
<p>The ministry also ended a requirement that producers and distributors of fuel had to inform tax offices in advance of price rises, which could then be held up for three months.</p>
<p>The moves were designed to allow investment by refineries during restructuring which is to make the industry competitive before foreign rivals are admitted to the market at some time in the next few years.</p>
<p>Late last month the ministry increased excise tax on petrol by three groszes per litre to ensure 1997 budget revenues were met. Last week, Finance Minister Marek Belka said he did not expect the increase to significantly lift the price of petrol or boost inflation. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700</p>
