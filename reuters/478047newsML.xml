<p>U.S. blue chips finished slightly higher on Tuesday, pausing for breath after their sharp two-session sell-off.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials rose 28 points to close unofficially at 6611. Analysts were quick to caution, however, that the gains put only a small dent in the nearly 300-point drop the Dow industrials have suffered since last Thursday.</p>
<p>And several said that, despite the welcome respite, the outlook will remain extremely uncertain at least until the questions that triggered the decline go unanswered.  </p>
<p>&quot;My sense is we're still in the midst of a painful period that still has a way to go,&quot; said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co. &quot;But there's still a lot of uncertainty ahead and will be until we have a better handle on what the Federal Reserve will do next.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts noted that pharmaceutical and finance stocks posted a solid day, notable because the groups have ridden lead-car through the market's roller-coaster ride this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The two leadership groups, banks and drugs, were trying to reassert their leadership today,&quot; said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.  </p>
<p>Chase Manhattan Corp gained 1-5/8 to 95-1/2, Citicorp rose 4-1/4 to 112-1/2 and Dow component J.P. Morgan &amp; Co Inc added 1-5/8 to 99-7/8.</p>
<p>Among drug companies, Dow stock Merck and Co Inc rose 2-3/8 to 86-5/8 and Pfizer Inc rose 7/8 to 85.</p>
<p>Another key sector, technology, failed to fully shake off the effects of its malaise. Analysts said any real reversal in the downturn would likely first take root among tech stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;I think anyone watching for a bottom should watch the techs,&quot; said Richard Cripps chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker.  </p>
<p>&quot;Last July, the techs were the first group to go lower, first to bottom and first to turn higher again,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While the group as a whole failed to match the modest rally in blue chips, some of the sector's bellwether stocks did show signs of life. Microsoft Corp rose 1-9/16 to 93-1/4 and Intel Corp rose 3/16 to 139-5/16.</p>
<p>Interest rates edged a trace lower on the day, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond easing two basis points to 7.08 percent, despite a stronger-than-expected National Association of Purchasing Management report today.  </p>
<p>But with critical monthly payrolls, wage and unemployment data due Friday, the interest rate outlook remains far from clear leaving market matters looking anything but certain.</p>
<p>&quot;We're probably going to have more days like today for a while, up 20 points and then down 20,&quot; Bleier said. &quot;But if rates go through 7.20 percent, all bets are off.&quot;</p>
<p>Among individual issues, database software firm Informix Corp sank 5-7/32 to 9-29/32 and electronic systems design software maker Quickturn Design Systems Inc lost 7-3/4 to 8-1/4, both after profit warnings.  </p>
<p>Catalina Marketing Corp, a provider of in-store electronic marketing programs for consumer-goods companies, sank 10-3/4 to 29-7/8, also after warning of disappointing quarterly results.</p>
<p>Embattled Canadian mining company Bre-X Minerals Ltd rebounded a bit, rising 3/4 to 2-1/2 on Nasdaq after being halted all day Monday. Frantic trading in the stock caused computers at the Toronto Stock Exchange to crash.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index rose 2.52 points to 759.64.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite fell 4.77 points to 1216.93.</p>
