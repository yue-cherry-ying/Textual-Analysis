<title>USA: Midco gasoline diffs jump on strict Explorer rules.</title>
<headline>Midco gasoline diffs jump on strict Explorer rules.</headline>

<p>Midcontinent gasoline differentials firmed one cent by late Thursday as the market digested news that the Explorer Pipeline had tightened rules on shipments from the Gulf Coast for the remaining three cycles of May.</p>
<p>Group Three unleaded diffs firmed one cent, with prompt deals done at 4.0 cents over June futures and any-month parcels sold for 2.50 cents over, traders said.</p>
<p>Chicago unleaded also firmed a penny by late day to 2.25 cents over June NYMEX for spot material and 1.75 cents over for any-month material, traders said.</p>
<p>The pipeline company, running at full throttle, has fallen about five days behind its schedule for delivering refined products from Texas to Midwest markets.</p>
<p>Usually, it allows clients to nominate deliveries for specific cycles, with the option of later switching their reservation of line space to other cycles during the same month.</p>
<p>But the company annnounced to clients late Wednesday that &quot;transfer of line space between cycles will not be allowed&quot; for the remaining 13th, 14th and 15th ten-day cycles of May because the pipeline is running at capacity.</p>
<p>Realizing they had to have physical barrels in hand or lose their space allowances on cycles they had already designated, refiners and traders switched into a buying mode on Thursday.</p>
<p>And continued delays on receiving shipments increased the desire to obtain material, particularly of gasoline, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Explorer has been running behind on gasoline for about a month because so much distillate is coming up the line, so they can't get enough gasoline in,&quot; one Group Three player said.</p>
<p>Indeed, an Explorer spokesman confirmed that for the last five cycles the company had been running about 60 percent distillate and 40 percent gasoline -- the opposite of the usual 60 percent gasoline and 40 percent distillates ratio.</p>
