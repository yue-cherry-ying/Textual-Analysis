<headline>Oklahoma City bombing trial takes dramatic twist.</headline>

<p>The trial of accused Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh took a surprising turn on Friday when a witness said she saw two men leave a Ryder rental truck outside the federal building just before the blast.</p>
<p>But Daina Bradley, who lost two children and her mother in the explosion as well as one of her legs, gave confusing testimony that contradicted her past account of seeing only an olive-skinned man leave the truck prosecutors say was turned into a bomb to destroy the Alfred P. Murrah federal building.</p>
<p>A nervous, clearly upset Bradley admitted that she told defence lawyers only a week ago that she saw a second man, whom she described as a white male, leave the truck but that the man was not McVeigh.</p>
<p>But within seconds the 21-year-old woman, with a history of mental illness, admitted on the witness stand that she had later told prosecutors she was not certain if the second man was McVeigh or not.</p>
<p>Prosecutors maintain that the 29-year-old McVeigh, a decorated Gulf War veteran, carried out the April 19, 1995, explosion that killed 168 people on his own while McVeigh's lawyers claim that the real bomber was killed in the explosion. If convicted McVeigh could face the death penalty.</p>
<p>Bradley's testimony was crucial for the defence contention that the bombing was carried out by another man.</p>
<p>In her original account of what she saw, Bradley said only one man got out of the truck. She said he was olive-skinned and wore a jacket, jeans, tennis shoes and baseball cap, fitting the description of &quot;John Doe No. 2&quot; -- a suspect authorities searched for after the bombing but never found.</p>
<p>Bradley said that in repeated meetings with attorneys and investigators in the two years after the blast she had stated that she had seen only one man get out of the Ryder truck.</p>
<p>Bradley was subpoenaed to testify as a defence witness. Under cross-examination by prosecutors, she said she had been in mental health institutions from the age of seven until she was 16 and had been given &quot;lots&quot; of medication that caused her &quot;to lose memory of who I was and (of) people around me.&quot;</p>
<p>Bradley's mother and two children were killed in the blast and her sister seriously injured. Bradley was trapped under the rubble for five hours and a leg had to be amputated to free her.</p>
<p>When the prosecution began its cross-examination, Bradley said: &quot;I need to talk to my lawyer&quot; and federal Judge Richard Matsch called a 20-minute recess to allow her to do so.</p>
<p>Bradley, who had an appointment at the Social Security office on the first floor of the Murrah building, said she looked out of the window and saw a yellow Ryder truck pull up outside shortly before the explosion. &quot;I seen two men get out the truck,&quot; she told the court, adding that both men walked quickly away.</p>
<p>Bradley said the first time she had told anybody about a second man was at a meeting last week with defence attorney Cheryl Bradley.</p>
<p>Under cross-examination, Bradley stuck to her testimony about the two men. She said she did not recall a lot of things after the bombing. &quot;You could tell me one thing one week and I would forget the next week,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Bradley's testimony about &quot;John Doe No. 2&quot; supports a defence theory that unidentified people carried out the bombing.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers suggested at the start of their case on Thursday that an unidentified leg found in the rubble could have belonged to the real bomber who may have died in the blast.</p>
<p>Vicki Beemer, a clerk at Elliott's Body Shop in Junction City, Kansas, testified on Thursday that a man calling himself Robert Kling was with another man when he came to pick up the Ryder rental truck allegedly used in the bombing. But she could  not remember what either man looked like.</p>
<p>The government says Kling was really McVeigh, whom it portrays as an extreme right-winger who bombed the federal building to avenge the deaths of 80 Branch Davidian cult members in a confrontation with federal agents at Waco, Texas, in 1993.</p>
