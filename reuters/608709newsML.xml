<p>Slovakia's President Michal Kovac on Friday refused to vote in referendums he himself ordered and which western diplomats said would test whether post-communist Slovakia was ready to join the West.</p>
<p>Slovaks on Friday began voting on whether they want their country to join NATO, and whether the president should be directly elected by citizens, instead of by parliament.</p>
<p>But polling was thrown into chaos by a row tied to a feud between the president and the prime minister.</p>
<p>Some polling stations held no ballots at all, while others offered only voting papers which did not have the question on the election of the president.</p>
<p>&quot;I blame the Premier Vladimir Meciar and the Interior Minister Gustav Krajci for this confusing situation,&quot; Kovac told journalists, after refusing to cast a ballot which did not include the question on presidential elections.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the interior minister has committed the serious crime of thwarting a referendum by falsifying the ballots,&quot; Kovac said. &quot;But this is for the prosecutor to judge.&quot;</p>
<p>The vote on presidential elections is seen as a way for the opposition to stop Meciar assuming presidential powers when the term of his political enemy Kovac ends next March.</p>
<p>Under the current constitution, if parliament is unable to muster a three-fifths majority to elect a new president, which neither the ruling coalition or opposition appear likely to achieve, presidential powers would pass to the prime minister.</p>
<p>Meciar has been fighting a fierce battle to have the referendum on presidential elections cancelled.</p>
<p>Polls were to open on Friday from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. (1200 to 2000 GMT) and again on Saturday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. (0600 to 1200 GMT), with the results to be made public on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;The referendum has already been totally discredited and will have no legal significance,&quot; a western diplomat in Bratislava said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is tragic, because all it serves is to damage yet again not only Slovakia's image abroad but the concept that the country has of itself,&quot; the diplomat said.</p>
<p>&quot;After this, it's out of the question that Slovakia will be invited to join NATO in the first round of enlargement,&quot; said Kovac.</p>
<p>Meciar has repeatedly proclaimed Slovakia's wish to be among the first post-communist countries to join NATO and the European Union.</p>
<p>The West has said Slovakia is unlikely to be invited to join NATO at an alliance summit in Madrid in July because of shortcomings in its democratic reforms.</p>
<p>Ballot papers carrying only three questions on NATO membership were distributed throughout Slovakia, but some mayors refused to accept them, insisting they were illegal as they lacked the seal of the Central Referendum Committee.</p>
<p>&quot;How dare the government play such dirty  tricks on us,&quot; said one angry voter who refused to use a three-question ballot. &quot;The communists were mere amateurs compared with these.&quot;</p>
<p>According to theCentral Referendum Committee, many potential voters refused to accept the three-question ballots.</p>
<p>The EU is currently investigating candidate countries for admission to the Union to see if they meet its political and economic criteria.</p>
<p>Before the start of the referendum western diplomats said the way the plebiscite was carried out would be a yardstick of the Meciar government's commitment to democracy.</p>
<p>&quot;But now the only conclusion is chaos, and chaos is damaging,&quot; a diplomat said.</p>
