<p>Suspected Moslem guerrillas have killed 28 people, including women and children, in two raids in northern Algeria this week, an Algerian newspaper said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Rebels, armed with hatchets and shotguns, killed 22 villagers in Seghouane hamlet near Medea town, some 70 km (45 miles) southwest of Algiers, El Watan newspaper said.</p>
<p>Among the victims were women and children and a whole family of nine members decimated in the raid on Thursday night, it said.</p>
<p>In another raid on Wednesday night, rebels cut the throats of six peasants in Bourouss village in Tipaza province, 60 km (40 miles) west of Algiers, El Watan added.</p>
<p>The reported massacres in the two villagers coincided with bomb attacks in Algiers this week.</p>
<p>Eight people were killed and 10 others were wounded on Thursday when a bomb ripped through a minibus operating in El Harrach district southwest of Algiers, Al Khabar newspaper said on Saturday.</p>
<p>A bomb on Wednesday wounded 40 people aboard a train in El Harrach, according to residents.</p>
<p>At least 200 civilians have been killed in the outbreak of violence since the June 5 general election in Algeria, Al Khabar added.</p>
<p>President Liamine Zeroual has barred radical Islamists from this month's election but allowed moderate Moslem fundamentalists to compete in the poll.</p>
<p>An estimated 60,000 people have been killed in Algeria since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a huge lead.</p>
