<p>The decision on which countries will take part in a common European currency is expected in late-April of 1998, a European Commission spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The timing of the fateful decision is among several issues EU finance ministers and central bankers will discuss at a informal meeting this weekend in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>While a precise date might not be set at the seaside resort of Noordwijk, the logistics of the EU decision-making process suggests a late-April timetable, the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the soonest that we can imagine a decision on participating countries,&quot; a Commission spokesman told reporters.</p>
<p>Before the decision is taken several hurdles must be overcome, including separate reports by the European Commission and the Frankfurt-based European Monetary Institute (EMI) on the degree of economic convergence within the 15-nation bloc.</p>
<p>Countries wishing to join economic and monetary union (EMU), expected in 1999, must meet various criteria set out in the Maastricht treaty on deficits, debt, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates.</p>
<p>Reliable economic data for 1997, used to make the assessment, is expected towards the end of February 1998, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Once available, both the Commission and the EMI will need about two weeks to come up with their convergence reports which are designed to assess objectively how each country stands in relation to the criteria.</p>
<p>After the evaluation, there is approximately a six-week consultation period with the European Parliament which will offer its own thinking on the candidates.</p>
<p>The parliament's views, however, are not in any way binding, but more a formality in line with the treaty.</p>
<p>It is after this period that EU finance ministers, voting under a qualified majority, determine which countries actually join the single currency.</p>
<p>In addition to the convergence report, the Commission will separately offer an opinion on which countries are fit for membership, an added responsibility not assigned to the EMI, the spokesman added.</p>
<p>The Commission's EMU recommendations might be made known at the time of its convergence report, he added.</p>
