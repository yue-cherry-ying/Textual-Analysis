<p>President Boris Yeltsin signed a pact on Friday with neighbouring Belarus that added details to their marriage contract but left their union somewhat less than the all-embracing merger envisaged by some.</p>
<p>In the midst of an effervescent bout of activity that will also see him sign a post-Cold War treaty with NATO on Tuesday, Yeltsin also confirmed a permanent replacement for the defence minister he dramatically sacked for failing to reform the army.</p>
<p>Russia's communist-dominated parliament protracted the agony over a budget crisis by ordering the government to find new revenues before it will consider drastic spending cuts.</p>
<p>The 66-year-old Yeltsin, who three months ago appeared destined to spend the remainder of his second term as a virtual invalid after heart surgery, seemed to revel in the action.</p>
<p>He made a rare meet-the-people outing to his granddaughter's Moscow high school on Friday. Underlining his determination to see through market and democratic reforms in his remaining three years in the Kremlin, a trim and buoyant Yeltsin explained his plans to the teenagers and told them he was &quot;optimistic&quot;.</p>
<p>He was similarly upbeat at a glittering Kremlin ceremony later in the day to sign a charter intended to fill out details of the Russia-Belarus Union Treaty signed on April 2.</p>
<p>Embracing President Alexander Lukashenko, he said: &quot;This is a special day in the lives of the Russian and Belarus people.&quot;</p>
<p>But the union was a far cry from the milestone event once planned to change the destinies of the two states, though it did contain strong words on defending democracy and human rights.</p>
<p>Kremlin liberals, aiming to stop the authoritarian Lukashenko and his Soviet-era economics from gaining a foothold in Russia, had watered down the original treaty.</p>
<p>Differences later emerged over the charter, with Moscow pressing Minsk to accept a merger so complete it would amount to a virtual takeover of Belarus by Russia, 15 times its size.</p>
<p>The resulting compromise, Lukashenko said before the Kremlin ceremony, meant that the union, which is still to be ratified by both parliaments, contained nothing essentially new.</p>
<p>Yeltsin made clear the two countries would no longer pursue the aim of forming a single state. Supranational bodies, led by Yeltsin and Lukashenko will run the union. Any decision taken by these bodies needs the approval of both presidents separately.</p>
<p>Opinion polls show that the majority of the people in both former Soviet republics support the idea of close integration and a 15,000 strong rally greeted the accord in the Belarussian capital Minsk.</p>
<p>Integration with Belarus is a step toward extending Moscow's influence right back to the western frontier of the old Soviet Union, bordering Poland. Supporters of the deal see it as an appropriate response to Polish intentions to join NATO.</p>
<p>Yeltsin says Russia remains strongly opposed to the western alliance's plan to expand eastward but concluded an accord with NATO last week to give Moscow a say in its affairs and some assurances that expansion will not alter the military balance.</p>
<p>The NATO-Russia Founding Act will be signed in Paris on Tuesday by Yeltsin and leaders of the 16 NATO members, in spite of parliamentary opposition in Moscow.</p>
<p>Deputies in the State Duma lower house said they were likely to declare their opposition after hearing a speech from Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov. But they cannot undo the treaty.</p>
<p>While Moscow is slowly putting its external affairs in order after the Cold War, making peace with NATO and edging its way into international bodies like the Group of Seven main industrial nations, its huge armed forces remain underfunded.</p>
<p>In an extraordinary outburst on national television on Thursday, Yeltsin sacked his defence minister, Igor Rodionov, for failing to tackle reforms of the army aimed at slimming down the forces and making them more professional.</p>
<p>On Friday, he confirmed General Igor Sergeyev, head of the Strategic Missile command, as Rodionov's permanent replacement.</p>
<p>Sergeyev, 59, is a respected career officer and intellectual whom the Kremlin's civilian defence planners are banking on to reform the army -- without asking for more money.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia's armed forces...must be compact but effective, fully in line with the economic potential of the state,&quot; a Kremlin statement quoted Yeltsin as telling Sergeyev on Friday.</p>
<p>Yet many analysts agree with Rodionov that army reforms without new spending and investment is a near-impossible task.</p>
<p>The lack of money, however, is as tangible as the army's problems with low pay and rusting equipment. Ministers were due to present plans to parliament on Friday for 20 percent spending cuts forced on them by a huge tax shortfall.</p>
<p>But before they got the chance, the communist-dominated Duma voted overwhelmingly not to listen to the scheme. The deputies demanded the government present plans to raise new revenue by June 1. Only after that will they consider the cuts.</p>
