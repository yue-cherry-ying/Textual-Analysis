<p>The AEX index of 25 leading Dutch shares is wrestling with the 800 level a week after crossing it for the first time, but is widely seen as coasting to fresh peaks on a continued influx of institutional cash.</p>
<p>The Dutch blue chip index has advanced 24 percent since the end of 1996 and soared a huge 42 percent from this time last year, boosted by strong company results, low inflation and interest rates and a powerful dollar.</p>
<p>And apart from a small setback on recent bond market weakness, analysts see little on the horizon to deflate prices.</p>
<p>&quot;Our technical analyst says in the very short term we're going to 830 and he has a target of 875 for six months, so another 10 percent rise is in view,&quot; said Ruud Haan, an equity strategist at ING Barings.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon the index was 2.21 points higher at 803.05, within sight of the 803.93 closing high set on May 21 and the intra-day high of 807.98 reached on May 22.</p>
<p>&quot;You might see a correction and it might go down 30 points or so, just on the back of the bond market, but you could see a counter-reaction, a bounce, just as quickly,&quot; SNS Securities senior trader Derk Jan Brouwer said.</p>
<p>&quot;If 800 is going to hold, either now or in a couple of weeks' time, from then on you can see a rally to 850 or so, although it could be two months or in six months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;That's on low inflation, low interest rates, a stable or a somewhat better dollar, good company results and most of all the flow of money from pension funds and private clients.&quot;</p>
<p>A savings boom has left institutions flush with cash and their keenness to get the best return on investors' money has given them the appetite to invest in shares, say analysts.</p>
<p>But traditional caution has left some institutions on the sidelines during Dutch market dips and this could make them more determined to buy during future setbacks.</p>
<p>&quot;Not all the financial institutions have invested all their cash flow over the last couple of months, so there will be a point when they will have to buy into the market,&quot; said Brouwer.</p>
<p>&quot;Some have missed the corrections we saw in July last year and a couple of months ago of 10 percent each, because the market went up just as quickly as it went down ...and that means they still have money to invest,&quot; Brouwer added.</p>
<p>Dennis Ederzeel, analyst at Delta Lloyd Bank, said he was considering raising his year-end forecast of 700 for the AEX but saw future downward pressure on the index.</p>
<p>&quot;The general view at our bank at the moment is that the market is overvalued. A level of 800 is high and is driven by sentiment and liquidity. It's not driven by fundamental factors and Dutch interest rates could rise a little towards the end of the year, which is negative for the market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The strength of the dollar is a positive thing for the stock market, but the side effect is that our imports are more expensive, which will add a little to inflation,&quot; he said, pointing out the guilder had fallen against other major currencies as well.</p>
<p>The picture on corporate earnings reports could also change during the year as last year's second, third and fourth quarters were strong, Ederzeel said, which could raise the base for comparisons and pave the way for what could be perceived as unexciting growth.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment the AEX can go a little bit higher. Nothing is really worsening at the moment. It's just the whole sentiment thing and liquidity,&quot; he said, adding, however that sentiment could change rapidly.</p>
<p>&quot;On the one side the company earnings forecasts are a bit better but inflation is a little bit worse. If we're going to do something about our target, we're going to raise it I think, keeping liquidity and sentiment in mind -- it seems that the whole country is crazy about investing money.&quot; -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040</p>
