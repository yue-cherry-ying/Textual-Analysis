<p>European stock markets were mixed to lower by mid-afternoon on Thursday, refusing to follow an opening rally on Wall Street, despite widespread relief that U.S. consumer prices for July showed no inflationary threat to the roaring bull market.</p>
<p>The dollar rallied after piercing a big chart resistance point at 116.80 yen, which helped it to retrace losses against the mark too, as one piece of U.S. economic data after another showed the U.S. economy could plough ahead leaving barely a ripple in prices paid by consumers.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures were in line, and now everyone is watching the currency market,&quot; said one share dealer in London. &quot;Everyone is looking for a correction, but whether the catalyst will be the currency or Wall Street or whatever I don't know,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>July U.S. consumer prices rose 0.2 percent as expected, as did July industrial output. Capacity use fell to 83.1 percent in July from a revised 83.3 percent in June, showing that the U.S. economy is expanding the engine to power its economy even faster than it hits the accelerator.</p>
<p>&quot;With capacity utilization down to 83.1 percent, we are even further away from the inflationary pressure point than we were before this release. This will not do anything to change the Federal Reserve's view (that interest rates do not need to rise),&quot; said Lou Crandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson.</p>
<p>Wall Street quickly jumped to a 60 point gain on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but within half an hour of the price data was trading just 34 points up at 7964.</p>
<p>The pound remained stubbornly above 2.90 marks which restrained prices in British shares, where exporters are troubled by the stong currency. The strong pound makes British exports less competitive abroad and allows foreign rivals to price keenly in the U.K. market.</p>
<p>London shares lost early gains, and the FTSE-100 index of leading shares was showing a loss on the day of around five points.</p>
<p>The Paris bourse was mixed after a 2.5 percent drop on Wednesday, and dealers expected any upside to be limited by the end of the day as investors square their books and pack up for the mid-August long weekend.</p>
<p>German shares in late electronic trade were little changed after closing lower in the main bourse session. Prices have veered in a 90-point band on the IBIS-DAX index, but appeared to be firmly supported above 4,200 a level many dealers see as psychologically crucial. CURRENCIES</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 1.8440 marks and 116.36 yen, compared with 1.8547 and 117.70 in late European trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1430 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index was down 11.7 points at 4,991.9.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The DAX index was down 47.05 points at 4,234.56</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 index was down 3.79 at 2,920.05.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was $1.10 an ounce firmer in London at $326.15. Silver was four cents firmer at $4.52.</p>
