<title>LITHUANIA: Lithuanian shares ease, dealers divided.</title>
<headline>Lithuanian shares ease, dealers divided.</headline>

<p>Lithuanian share indices slid in slow trading Friday, and brokers were divided over whether activity would pick up next week.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think turnover will rise next week,&quot; said Robertas Berzinskas, a broker with Vilniaus Bank. &quot;I expect the situation next week to be very similar to this week, and I don't see anything to suggest that turnover would go up.&quot;</p>
<p>The index of the official list of shares slipped a tiny 0.36 point to 922.15 points. Group A shares fell 21.12 points to 1989.53 points.</p>
<p>Despite the fall, some brokers remained optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;Today there's a good mood on the market because the most popular share prices moved up,&quot; said Tomas Andrejauskas, a broker with Suprema.</p>
<p>Andrejauskas said the sliding indices were due to the fact that Lithuanian Gas and Lithuanian Energy were both down while Klaipeda Stevedoring Company (KLASCO) stayed the same at 11.50 litas.</p>
<p>&quot;We had good trading today. The prices moved up a little today and I think turnover will follow on Monday,&quot; Andrejauskas said.</p>
<p>Lithuanian Gas was down only slightly, to 1.80 litas from 1.81 litas. Lithuanian Energy fell to 2.35 litas from 2.45 litas.</p>
<p>Turnover on the central market was a paltry 480,000 litas while block trades accounted for 1.5 million litas, down from 4.6 million litas on Thursday.</p>
<p>Hermis Bank led block trades, turning over 676,000 litas at a price of 169.00 litas.</p>
<p>&quot;Hermis Bank said three months ago that they would buy their own shares,&quot; one broker said. &quot;I think they might be buying them.&quot;</p>
<p>Hermis traded at 175.10 litas on the central market in low volume of 8,700 litas.</p>
