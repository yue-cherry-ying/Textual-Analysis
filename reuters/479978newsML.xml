<p>Women infected with the virus that causes AIDS and who smoke during pregnancy are more likely than non-smokers to pass the virus on to their babies, a study released on Tuesday found.</p>
<p>The study, by researchers at Thomas Jefferson University and the New York state health department, found that one-third of the women in the study who smoked and did not take virus-fighting drugs passed the HIV virus on to their child.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, the risk of passing on the virus from pregnant mother to child is about one in four, although this can be reduced to about one in 10 if an HIV-infected mother takes anti-retroviral drugs such as AZT.</p>
<p>The study was reported in the April issue of &quot;Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes and Human Retrovirology.&quot;</p>
<p>Lead researcher Dr. Barbara Turner, a medical professor at Thomas Jefferson, said in a release that nicotine in cigarettes is toxic to blood vessels and can promote premature rupture of membranes surrounding a fetus.</p>
<p>&quot;Our study shows that smoking may be especially dangerous for HIV-positive pregnant women, because its effects may increase the baby's exposure to blood and other maternal secretions that contain the virus during delivery,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The study was based on an analysis of 901 HIV-infected New York state residents receiving health assistance, and their babies born between 1988 and 1990.</p>
<p>Turner said drugs that fight HIV might eliminate the effects of smoking on transmission of the virus, &quot;but smoking is still associated with low birthweight babies and poor birth outcomes for this very vulnerable population.&quot;</p>
