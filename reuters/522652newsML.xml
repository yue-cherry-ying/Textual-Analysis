<p>Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov blasted Russia's new reformist cabinet on Saturday, saying it would deepen social divisions, and called for a campaign of protests to oust President Boris Yeltsin from power.</p>
<p>Speaking to delegates at the fourth party congress in central Moscow, Zyuganov said the Communists would press for changes in Russia's constitution, which places most power in the hands of the president at parliament's expense.</p>
<p>&quot;The actions of the reshuffled government deprive the country of perspectives for reviving the national economy and improving the life of the workers,&quot; said Zyuganov.</p>
<p>Last month Yeltsin ordered a radical shake-up of the government that drafted economic liberals Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov into key positions in a bid to kickstart Russia's stalled market reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;This government will undoubtedly carry out policies murderous for Russia,&quot; said Zyuganov, who peppered his address with quotations from Lenin, Josef Stalin and Russian nationalist poets.</p>
<p>Behind him on the podium stood a large bust of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin and a banner bearing the defunct superpower's insignia, a hammer and sickle.</p>
<p>Zyuganov, defeated by Yeltsin in last year's presidential race, said his party should devote more resources to extra-parliamentary protests within the framework of the law.</p>
<p>The party will also start gathering signatures calling for Yeltsin's resignation, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The wider and more organised the petition is, the more easily and organically it will grow into a nationwide strike,&quot; Zyuganov said.</p>
<p>After his address, Zyuganov led some 150 delegates to Red Square to pay their respects and lay wreathes at the mausoleum in front of the Kremlin that houses Lenin's mummified corpse.</p>
<p>The Communists are the largest faction in the State Duma -- lower house of parliament -- but lack political clout under the present constitution, drawn up by Yeltsin after he forcibly dissolved the old Soviet legislature in 1993.</p>
<p>Their planned petition would carry no legal force and pose no direct threat to Yeltsin or his government.</p>
<p>Party sources told Reuters the petition and other planned protests were aimed mainly at keeping the Communists in the public eye over the coming months.</p>
<p>Parliamentary polls are not due until 1999 and the next presidential election, in which Yeltsin will not stand, is set for the year 2000.</p>
<p>Zyuganov said his party would try to mobilise opposition to the government on public holidays on May 1 and May 9, hoping to build on a nationwide day of action last month that brought millions onto the streets to protest against unpaid wages.</p>
<p>But sounding a more cautious note, he added: &quot;A vote of no-confidence in the government, for which we Communists intend to work, would on its own (divorced from the wider struggle) end not with the cabinet's resignation but with its even more harmful mutation and a dissolution of the Duma.&quot;</p>
<p>Party sources said the Communists did not favour early parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>As Zyuganov rallied his supporters, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin -- a possible rival of the Communists in the next presidential race -- called for greater cooperation between the country's democratic and reformist parties.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin told a congress of his centrist Our Home is Russia party that it should be ready to field its own presidential candidate in 2000, though he stopped short of proposing himself.</p>
<p>Critics say Chernomyrdin lacks the charisma to be able to succeed Yeltsin as president, despite the backing of influential financial groups. Supporters say he would have a chance of winning an election if the state machinery united behind him.</p>
