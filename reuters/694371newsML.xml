<p>Cassam Uteem was  re-elected on Saturday as president of the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius.</p>
<p>In a unanimous vote by parliament, Angidi Chettiar was elected vice-president. Both jobs are largely ceremonial because the head of government on the island is the prime minister.</p>
<p>The two motions for the elections were proposed by the Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam and seconded by former deputy prime minister and now leader of the opposition Paul Berenger.</p>
<p>Uteem was first elected president in 1992. Ramgoolam and Berenger had already agreed on renewing Uteem's term before their coalition goverment collapsed last week.</p>
<p>&quot;I can say to this house without any fear of contradiction and without any hesitation that he (Uteem) has always shown fairness, sincerity of purpose, a sharp logical mind and decency,&quot; Ramgoolam told parliament.</p>
<p>Chettiar replaces Rabindranath Ghurburrun. Since 1952, Chettiar has been a member of the Labour Party that is led by Ramgoolam.</p>
