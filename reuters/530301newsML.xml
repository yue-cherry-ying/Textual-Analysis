<p>Beetles with a taste for glue have forced Ireland's National Museum to take down a priceless painting by the Italian baroque artist Caravaggio.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week we inspected the painting after reports that beetles were seen flying around it,&quot; the Director of the museum, Raymond Kevany told Irish radio.</p>
<p>&quot;There were indeed insects on the back of the painting which turned out to be biscuit beetles which have an appetite for glue.&quot; So the &quot;Taking of Christ,&quot; was taken down for a while to remove the infestation.</p>
<p>The painting hung unnoticed for decades in a Jesuit house in Dublin until a member of the gallery visited it and recognised it was a work by Caravaggio, who died in 1610 at the age of 37.</p>
<p>The Order later gave the painting to the museum where it has been acclaimed as one of the artist's finest works.</p>
