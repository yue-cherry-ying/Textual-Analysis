<p>U.S. high-grade and high-yield corporate bond prices firmed on Thursday (corrects from Tuesday) following gains in the Treasury and stock markets, traders said.</p>
<p>Confirming the renewed optimism of corporate bond investors, Ford Motor Co sold $500 million in 100-year bonds, its first-ever century bond deal, market sources said.</p>
<p>Ford's deal, which priced to yield 7.81 percent, was also the first new 100-year issue since the volatility in the Treasury and stock markets in early April. Sources said the sizable offering was placed roughly one hour after being announced, an indication of strong investor demand.  </p>
<p>&quot;This showed that there is demand for longer-duration paper and that people are more bullish about the direction of the bond market,&quot; said a source close to the deal.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns &amp; Co Inc was the lead underwriter.</p>
<p>Other high-grade issuers also capatalized on the healthy market conditions late on Thursday:</p>
<p>-Salomon Inc sold $500 million in five-year notes to yield 7.327 percent.</p>
<p>-Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc sold $400 million in seven-year notes to yield 7.448 percent.  </p>
<p>-First Industrial LP sold $150 million in 10-year notes to yield 7.605 percent and $100 million in 30-year bonds with a five-year put, to yield 7.185 percent via JP Morgan Securities Inc.</p>
<p>-HSBC Americas sold $200 million in 30-year capital securities to yield 8.38 percent in a 144a offering via HSBC Capital Markets and Lehman Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>In the high-yield market, GST Telecommunications Inc was the only issuer of the day. The competitive local exchange carrier sold $265 million in senior secured notes with a three-year interest reserve, through a subsidiary.</p>
