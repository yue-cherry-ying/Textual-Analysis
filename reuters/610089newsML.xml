<headline>NYMEX natgas called down slightly with cash, OTC.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures were expected to open down slightly Friday, in line with reports of softer physical and over-the-counter prices, industry sources said.</p>
<p>June over-the-counter trades were reported at $2.18 and $2.19, with the bid and ask range now $2.17-2.19.</p>
<p>On ACCESS, June waffled between $2.193 and $2.21, last trading down 0.3 cent at $2.193. Other months finished narrowly mixed.</p>
<p>In the morning cash, Henry Hub was quoted between $2.16 and $2.20, down from Thursday's range of $2.20-2.23.  </p>
<p>NYMEX will be closed Monday for U.S. Memorial Day.</p>
<p>While some expected a pullback ahead of the holiday weekend, few expected the market to break down, noting good support just below current levels.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no weather but the board still won't break down,&quot; said one Midwest trader.</p>
<p>Forecasts for next week call for normal to slightly below-normal weather for the upper two-thirds of the nation, with some above-normal temperatures expected in Texas and parts of the Southeast.</p>
<p>Technical traders agreed there was little reason for a breakout. June support and resistance were still seen at $2.15 and $2.30, respectively. Major buying was likely at the $2.05 double bottom, with good selling expected at the contract high of $2.43.</p>
<p>In Thursday's cash, Gulf Coast swing prices were steady to up slightly Thursday to the high-teens. Midcon pipes were little changed in the low-$2s. New York city gate gas also held relatively steady in the mid-$2.40s.</p>
<p>Planned work on Mobil's Mary Ann gas processing plant in Coden, Ala., has cut the plant's total processing capacity of 380-390 mmcfd. About 120 mmcfd should be back by early next week, with the balance due back in three weeks.</p>
