<title>RUSSIA: Russia-American crew on Mir relax after accident.</title>
<headline>Russia-American crew on Mir relax after accident.</headline>
<dateline>KOROLYOV, Russia 1997-06-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Two Russians and an American astronaut were relaxing on the space station Mir on Saturday, three days after a collision which damaged their power supply, mission control said.</p>
<p>&quot;The cosmonauts said the night was okay and that they slept well,&quot; a spokeswoman at Korolyov mission control, near Moscow, told reporters after the first radio conversation of the day with the crew.</p>
<p>Saturday was designated a rest day. Russian officials said on Friday the situation had stabilised after the collision during a docking manoeuvre on Wednesday in which a cargo craft holed a scientific module attached to Mir.</p>
<p>Repair work is expected to start when new equipment arrives in about 10 days.</p>
<p>Commander Vasily Tsibliyev, 43, flight engineer Alexander Lazutkin, 39, and American physicist Michael Foale, 40, sounded calm in conversations with mission control on Friday but were showing signs of fatigue.</p>
<p>Wednesday's collision left the orbital outpost with only half its usual supply of power and robbed it of its most efficient batteries, used when the station is in darkness.</p>
