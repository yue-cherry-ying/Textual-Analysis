<p>Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners LP and IMC Global said their IMC-Agrico Co fertilizer joint venture has resulted in 300,000 tonnes of additional exports of phosphate fertilizers in the second quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;A lull in international demand appears to have ended,&quot; said Thomas C. Pasztor, spokesman for IMC-Agrico. &quot;We ship monthly to China, so this is in addition to contract business that is ongoing.&quot;</p>
<p>The private sales were completed in late March by the Phosphate Chemical Export Association, which is a partnership between IMC-Agrico and Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>Approximately half of the sales will go to China, Pasztor said. Other destinations include India, Brazil, Chile and Mexico.</p>
<p>The additional fertilizer was sold for shipment during April, May and June for the market price at the time of loading, IMC said.</p>
<p>The amount of the additional export business is not seen as noteworthy for U.S. markets, but the extra sales will support current prices, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason it is significant is because it lends stability to the market price,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;If there is sufficient stability, it allows them to increase production and maintain prices.&quot;</p>
<p>China imports about 4.5 to 6.0 million tonnes of diammonium phosphate (DAP) each year, absorbing approximately one-third of the world's available supply for export, cash sources said.</p>
<p>U.S. fertilizer manufacturers produce approximately 1.2 to 1.4 million tonnes each month, cash market sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;So when you hear that China takes another 150,000 (tonnes) a quarter, it sounds like a lot, but it really isn't when you consider the big picture,&quot; one source said.</p>
<p>Under its current two-year contract agreement with China, PCEA ships approximately four Panamax cargos (200,000 tonnes) to China each month, industry sources said.</p>
