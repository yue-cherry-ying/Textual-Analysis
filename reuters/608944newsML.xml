<p>Argentine postal tycoon Alfredo Yabran, who is accused of being a mobster, gave evidence on Friday in the murder of news photographer Jose Luis Cabezas.</p>
<p>Hundreds of journalists mobbed Yabran's car as he drove up to a courthouse in Buenos Aires Province for questioning about the January murder of the photographer.</p>
<p>Cabezas, who worked for the weekly news magazine Noticias, was beaten, shot in the head and his body doused with fuel and burned to a charred skeleton, only identifiable by his watch.</p>
<p>The murder brought back memories of the death squads that killed thousands of people during the dictatorship of 1976-83. Huge crowds took to the streets to demand justice and there are posters everywhere saying: &quot;Don't Forget Cabezas.&quot;</p>
<p>Yabran, who is suing former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo for publicly accusing him of being a mafia boss, has been linked to the Cabezas case via his security chief Gregorio Rios, but denies any involvement.</p>
<p>Yabran denies any mob connections and denies he harboured resentment against the photographer for invading his privacy by taking rare snaps of him -- most recently, with his wife on the beach.</p>
<p>Investigating Judge Jose Luis Macchi also took evidence on Friday from Rios, who is reported to have received phone calls in the days before the murder from an ex-policeman who is suspected of organising Cabezas' murder and pulling the trigger.</p>
<p>The Cabezas case has some political significance in Argentina. Eduardo Duhalde, governor of the province where the murder took place, could be the presidential candidate for the ruling Peronist Party in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;The absolute truth means finding out not only who killed him, but also who are the masterminds, if they are not the same ones who did the actual killing,&quot; Duhalde said in Spain, where he is on an official visit.</p>
<p>Duhalde has warned Yabran to &quot;get a good lawyer&quot; to clear his name in the Cabezas case. Any proven link between Yabran and the killers could be seriously embarrassing for President Carlos Menem. He has denied reports that Yabran is a personal friend, but his former wife insists the friendship exists.</p>
<p>Menem's government has also been forced to deny newspaper reports of secret contacts between Yabran and senior ministers -- including Interior Minister Carlos Corach -- to try to get the postal tycoon's named cleared.</p>
