<p>The Pakistan rupee, adjusted downwards twice this month by the State (central) Bank of Pakistan (SBP), is likely to weaken further before the 1997/98 (July-June) budget due in June, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>The SBP on Friday adjusted the rupee down to 40.3900/40.5920 to the dollar from 40.3300/40.5317 fixed on May 6.</p>
<p>The central bank gave no reason for the lower adjustment in the rupee value, but bankers said the move was in line with the government's policy to boost exports.</p>
<p>The rupee, after Friday's adjustment, has depreciated 15.06 percent since the beginning of fiscal 1996/97 compared to a depreciation of 13.2 percent year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Pakistan's trade deficit has widened and to keep the exports competitive, devaluation is necessary,&quot; said a banker who asked not be identified.</p>
<p>He said the current devaluation had nothing to do with the international currency market, but had been done because of the country's weak fundamentals.</p>
<p>Pakistan's trade deficit soared to $274 million in April compared to $153 million in the corresponding period a year ago.</p>
<p>The weekly foreign exchange reserves fell to $1.569 billion compared to $1.765 billion a week earlier and $2.237 billion on May 16, 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The government would pursue the policy of gradual adjustment of the rupee before the budget is announced, but there are no chances of any major depreciation in Pakistani currency,&quot; said Mudassar Malik, chief dealer at BMA Capital Management.</p>
<p>&quot;The exports can slow further because of uncertainty about the rupee, but once the budget is announced, the rupee is likely to stabilise,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The 1997/98 budget will be announced on June 14.</p>
<p>An executive of a foreign bank said the process of creeping downward adjustment of the rupee started last month after a six-month gap following October's 7.86 percent devaluation.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar has appreciated against other currencies since then and the rupee has to be adjusted accordingly. Before the budget, we expect the Pakistani currency to shed another 0.15 to 0.20 rupees in its value,&quot; the executive said.</p>
<p>In the kerb market, the rupee fell 0.06 to 41.46 to the dollar in early trade.</p>
