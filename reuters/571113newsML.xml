<p>The Chinese yuan closed slightly up at 8.2934 against the U.S. dollar on Thursday from Wednesday's 8.2935, setting a new eleven-week high on pro-yuan sentiment, dealers said.</p>
<p>The weighted average price on Wednesday was 8.2938.</p>
<p>With no clear intervention seen from the central bank to depress the yuan, the yuan remained strong, although its rise slowed after continued gains over the past few days.</p>
<p>The yuan opened unchanged at 8.2935 and consolidated in a narrow range for most of the session, hitting an intraday low of 8.2937 and a high of 8.2930.  </p>
<p>&quot;The yuan has been moving at a high level for quite a while, but the expected central bank's intervention to depress the yuan has not appeared,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;That strengthened pro-yuan sentiment.&quot;</p>
<p>Some dealers said they expected the yuan to test the 8.2930 level on Friday.</p>
<p>But one dealer said that after its strong gains, there was an increasing possibility of a correction in the absense of major positive news.</p>
<p>The yuan closed down at an intraday low of 6.6325 from 6.5955 against 100 Japanese yen and down at 1.0713 from 1.0699 against the Hong Kong dollar.</p>
