<p>The state-run Pakistan Telecommunication Co Ltd (PTCL) said on Monday its net profit for the year ending June 30, 1996 fell to 14.269 billion rupees from 16.835 billion a year-ago.</p>
<p>In a statement after its board of directors met in Islamabad, PTCL said total revenues increased to 37.779 billion rupees in 1995/96 from 33.060 billion in 1994/95.</p>
<p>It said the foreign exchange revenues of the company, which is up for sale, rose to 15.694 billion rupees from 13.209 billion in 1994/95.</p>
<p>But the operating profit for 1995/96 fell to 16.554 billion rupees from 17.667 billion in the previous year.</p>
<p>The board of directors recommended a cash dividend of 0.60 rupees per 10-rupee share compared to a dividend of 4.486 rupees per share in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>The statement said the profits were down because of provisions made for doubtful debts, charges for rentals and a central excise duty.</p>
<p>It said after making provisions of 1.54 billion rupees the net profit would be 12.72 billion rupees for 1995/96.</p>
<p>It said higher total revenue was due to installation of 249,442 new telephone connections, growth in long-distance calls and growth in international paid minutes.</p>
<p>PTCL was created on January 1, 1996 from state-run Pakisatan Telecommunication Corporation (PTC). It sold a million 100-share vouchers, about two percent of total equity, in Pakistan in August 1994. PTCL Global Depositary Receipts, about 10 percent of total equity, have been traded abroad since September 1994.</p>
<p>PTCL has a 25-year licence to provide a full range of telephone services and will enjoy a seven-year monopoly over basic telephone services in Pakistan. It is also exempt from paying corporate tax till June 1999.</p>
<p>The government plans to sell a 26 percent strategic stake in the PTCL.</p>
