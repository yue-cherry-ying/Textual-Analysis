<p>A deranged Swiss gunman who shot and wounded a priest and a sexton in a church in a rare burst of terror in Geneva was not responsible for his crime because he was severely depressed, a court heard on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Swiss government has asked for the case of the 53-year-old former lawyer, dubbed &quot;the madman of Notre Dame&quot; by the media, to be dismissed because he was suffering from profound depression at the time, Swiss news agency ATS reported.</p>
<p>The man, whose name has not been released, drew a pistol inside the Notre Dame Roman Catholic Church in downtown Geneva just after evening mass on December 14 and shot a priest and a sexton in the legs.</p>
<p>He surrendered after a six-hour siege by heavily armed police.</p>
<p>ATS said the Geneva court prolonged his detention for two months, but that the prosecutor was unlikely to press charges.</p>
