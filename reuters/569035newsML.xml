<title>ROMANIA: Belgium wants Romania among first five for NATO-PM.</title>
<headline>Belgium wants Romania among first five for NATO-PM.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said on Thursday NATO's first eastward expansion should take in five, rather than three, former East bloc states, including Romania.</p>
<p>&quot;Referring to NATO's enlargement, Belgium believes that this process should be more comprehensive and aim not at three, but five countries, including Romania,&quot; a Romanian government statement quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Dehaene made the remarks during talks with Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea at the start of a four-day visit.</p>
<p>Romania and the ex-Yugoslav Republic of Slovenia have been tipped as longshots for first-wave admission, with Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic seen as near-likely entrants.</p>
<p>Belgium added to political support which Romania has won so far from France, Italy and other members of NATO's southern flank, as well as from Canada.</p>
<p>Bucharest is wooing the United States and Britain, which have so far remained lukewarm to the Balkan country's bid. Germany has offered understanding but little concrete support.</p>
<p>Dehaene praised a post-communist treaty which Romania and ex-Soviet Ukraine initialled last week, ending World War Two issues over borders and minorities between the two neighbours.</p>
<p>He said the treaty with Kiev, which Romanian President Emil Constantinescu is expected to sign with his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kuchma, &quot;is an important trump card for Romania&quot;.</p>
