<p>The Wendt-Bristol Health Services Corp said Tuesday it is estimating net loss of $200,000 in 1996.</p>
<p>The company said operating profits fell at its nursing facilities due to short-term declines in census and Medicaid rates attributable to level of care required,  as well as certain one-time financing and other significant costs incurred in 1996.</p>
<p>The company also said it estimated revenues for the year of $21.3 million, compared to $20.9 million in 1995.</p>
<p>The company, however, said it expected continued growth as well as profits based upon cost reductions, the profitable performance of its diagnostic and radiology operations, and the commencement this year of operations, through management contracts and ventures with third parties, of additional diagnostic sites and out-patient radiology - oncology centers.</p>
<p>The company said that final results will be available in its Form 10-K, which  will be completed within 15 days.</p>
