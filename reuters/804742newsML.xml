<p>More than 200,000 young Roman Catholics from around the world prepared on Sunday to converge on Paris for a week of prayers, hymns and happenings culminating in a vast open-air Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II.</p>
<p>Hundreds of buses will begin streaming into the French capital early on Monday morning to bring pilgrims from 135 countries to the Church's World Youth Days festival.</p>
<p>The Pope, now a frail 77, will arrive on Thursday for a four-day stay including the beatification -- the final step before sainthood -- of a pioneering 19th-century social worker and a controversial homage to an anti-abortion campaigner.</p>
<p>Youths from abroad, including many from poor countries whose air fares were paid by parishes here, have been spending the past few days as guests of Catholic families all around France before attending the bi-annual youth festival.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very pleased.  There is such intensity and such enthusiasm everywhere in France,&quot; said Paris Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger. &quot;It will be a great event.&quot;</p>
<p>Paris, now half-deserted for the summer holidays, will mobilise 7,000 police to supervise crowds at major events like a welcoming ceremony for the Pope at the Eiffel Tower and his Mass next Sunday at a racetrack in the Bois de Boulogne park.</p>
<p>The pilgrims will also have a wide selection of discussion groups, concerts and meetings to choose from.</p>
<p>But the message of the World Youth Days, which drew four million Catholics when last held in Manila in 1995, seem to have fallen on rocky ground in the country once known as the &quot;eldest daughter of the Church&quot;.</p>
<p>Only about 70,000 French youths are expected to turn out for the festival and estimates of the crowd for the Pope's final Mass -- the young pilgrims plus French Catholics of all ages -- have shrunk from 650,000 to 500,000.</p>
<p>Bishop Michel Dubost, who organised the festival with retired General Philippe Morillon, former head of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, said this reflected a crisis of confidence in the Roman church.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not deny there is a crisis between youths in certain Western countries, including France, and the Catholic Church,&quot; he told the newspaper Le Monde.</p>
<p>Sociologist Daniele Hervieu-Leger said many French who came of age in the 1960s rejected the faith they were brought up in. Eighty-five percent of France is nominally Catholic.</p>
<p>&quot;Their children are the first generation brought up 'outside religion,' without any contact to religious institutions,&quot; she told Le Monde.</p>
<p>The Pope's plan to pray at the grave of Jerome Lejeune, a prominent geneticist and fervent opponent of abortion, has provoked protests from critics who say this would encourage militant groups that stage sit-ins at abortion clinics.</p>
<p>The debate has overshadowed the gesture the Pontiff will make towards social activists by beatifying Frederic Ozanam, a left-wing French intellectual who founded the Saint Vincent de Paul Society in 1833 to help the poor and underprivileged.</p>
<p>A forerunner of the Catholic Worker movement, Ozanam railed against exploitation of workers in the 1830s -- before Karl Marx -- and campaigned for the then radical goals of a minimum wage, child benefit payments and a workers' spension system.</p>
<p>The timing of the Pope's Mass at Longchamp racetrack has also come in for criticism because it falls on the anniversary of the Saint Barthelemy massacre in 1572, when Catholic militias slaughtered tens of thousands of Protestants.</p>
<p>But Protestant clergymen have played down the coincidence of dates and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, himself a Protestant, plans to see the Pope off at Orly airport later that day.</p>
<p>President Jacques Chirac will meet the Pope at the beginning on his stay on Thursday.</p>
