<p>Swiss police are on a heightened state of suicide cult watch ahead of the summer solstice on June 21 and are keeping a close eye on known members of the notorious Solar Temple sect, a senior justice official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gerard Ramseyer, the top justice official in Geneva canton, said police was maintaining a &quot;discreet surveillance&quot; of 10 people in the international city &quot;who may be exposed to risks&quot; because of their links with the Solar Temple sect.</p>
<p>Since 1994, mass suicides have claimed the lives of a total of 74 followers, and family members, of the bewildering sect which believes &quot;death voyages&quot; by ritualised suicide lead to rebirth in a place called &quot;Sirius&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We're continuing our surveillance and we're checking if these people are still here and making sure that the children are still here,&quot; Ramseyer told reporters. &quot;But we cannot stop people taking their own lives.&quot;</p>
<p>Two of the 10 people under surveillance are children, Ramseyer said but gave no details.</p>
<p>Ramseyer said police believed there were some 100 people in Switzerland who were formerly close to or had been members of Solar Temple. The followers are mostly well-off professionals who are taught the world will end in fire and that to reach the afterworld they must die by burning.</p>
<p>He was speaking after a news conference where authorities from the cantons of Geneva, Vaud, Neuchatel, Tissin and Fribourg announced plans to boost cooperation in monitoring sects.</p>
<p>Geneva police fear the summer solstice is a &quot;delicate time of the year&quot; for the suicide cult's followers, said Ramseyer.</p>
<p>The last suicides of Solar Temple were in March when five believers, two of them Swiss, killed themselves in Quebec, Canada.</p>
<p>The cult won international notoriety after mass suicides aand murders killed 53 of its members in two Swiss villages in the Swiss cantons of Fribourg and Valais and a ski resort in Quebec in 1994.</p>
<p>A year later, in December 1995, 16 cult members including several children died in a remote French Alpine forest clearing in a macabre ritual in which most of them were drugged and had plastic bags pulled over their heads before being shot.</p>
<p>Those killings coincided with the winter solstice on December 21.</p>
