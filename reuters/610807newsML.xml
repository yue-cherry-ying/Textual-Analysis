<p>Officials from Shenzhen are trying to attract Hong Kong freight forwarders into crossing the border and use the southern Chinese airport's cargo facilities instead, said Anthony Lau, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents Ltd.</p>
<p>A delegation of officials from the airport near Hong Kong's border with China visited the territory earlier this month and HAFFA representatives plan a return visit in the near future, Lau said.</p>
<p>HAFFA, which represents 261 freight forwarders in the territory, told the Chinese fact finding mission that cost was their main consideration.</p>
<p>&quot;If they can get their act together, it is a very good idea. We would be able to offer a quicker service by saving half a day's trucking time to Hong Kong and presumably enjoy reduced terminal fees than in Hong Kong,&quot; Lau told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Until now, complicated customs procedures have deterred Hong Kong freight forwarders from using Shenzhen. Licensing difficulties and the extra cost of buying airway bills has added to the reluctance of forwarders to cross the border, Lau said.</p>
<p>Industry observers said Shenzhen's marketing effort is clearly a bid to win business from Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport which currently air freights large amounts of cargo made in southern China. It also increases competition with Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kok airport which is due to open next year when forwarders fear they will have to pay substantially higher fees than at Kai Tak.</p>
<p>Shenzhen has already been successful in attracting cargo airlines such as Korean Air Lines. Officials from South Korea's flag carrier have said they are studying a third weekly freighter service between Seoul and Shenzhen because of good demand.</p>
<p>&quot;They asked us to put forward our ideas on what it would take to use Shenzhen and we did. If they can compete on cost and speed up the formalities it will be a major consideration for our members. With increased fees expected at Chek Lap Kok it gives them a chance to get a slice of the cake,&quot; Lau added. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+5017</p>
