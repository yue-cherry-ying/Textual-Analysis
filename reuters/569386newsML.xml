<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Bear Stearns says HSBC unattractive.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bear Stearns said on Thursday it had initiated coverage of HSBC Holdings Plc with an unattractive rating.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe HSBC is likely to trade in a range due to the likely rising interest rate environment in the U.S., the slowdown in the Hong Kong property market, and the reduced growth in exports,&quot; it said in a research report.</p>
<p>It said while sizeable returns from subsidiary Hongkong Bank Group enhanced the overall attractiveness of HSBC, &quot;our less favourable opinion on the Midland Bank subsidiary leads us to believe that the shares of HSBC will not outperform the market or our covered universe over the next six to nine months.&quot;</p>
<p>Bear Stearns said it had established a price target range of HK$165 to HK$173 per share.</p>
<p>HSBC shares rose HK$4.00 to a record high of HK$211.00 in Hong Kong on Thursday before closing at HK$210.00.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns said lax loan-loss provisioning at HSBC's main subsidiaries -- Hongkong Bank, Midland Bank and HSBC Americas -- had resulted in &quot;overstated earnings in the neighbourhood of HK$9.1 billion&quot;.</p>
<p>At Midland Bank, it said higher overheads hampered a stronger earnings performance, while a renewed mortgage focus would reduce margins.</p>
<p>It said HSBC's take-over of Banco Bamerindus would be dilutive to earnings, resulting in a decline of HK$0.11 in HSBC's 1997 projected earnings per share and HK$0.10 for 1998.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns said investors had also played down the &quot;potential for problems presented by management's decision to purchase fledgling Latin American banks at what we consider high prices for the amount of risk incurred&quot;.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns said investors should switch into shares of either Dao Heng Bank Group or Citicorp.</p>
