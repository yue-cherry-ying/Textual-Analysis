<p>Bombs in Gaza and an exchange of barbs between Israel and its oldest Arab peace partner pushed the Middle East peace process nearer the edge on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Israel said two Palestinians blew themselves up in separate suicide attacks aimed at Jewish settlers in the PLO-ruled Gaza Strip. No Israelis were hurt.</p>
<p>Palestinian security officials said one man appeared to be a bomber but they blamed Israeli soldiers for killing the second man and wounding seven Palestinians in a taxi.</p>
<p>In the West Bank, Israeli soldiers shot dead two Palestinians in separate incidents in Hebron and Nablus triggering stone-throwing protests for the 13th consecutive day.</p>
<p>The violence mirrored a war of words between Israeli and Arab leaders that has erupted since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu broke ground for a Jewish settlement designed to tighten Israel's hold on Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Egypt, the first Arab state to make peace with Israel, said the settlement had brought roller-coaster Middle East peacemaking to a 20-year low point.</p>
<p>Netanyahu shot back, accusing Egypt of fomenting anti-Israel sentiment in the Arab world, which was considering freezing the normalisation of ties and re-instating an economic boycott of the Jewish state.</p>
<p>In Washington, Jordan's King Hussein was scheduled to meet President Bill Clinton in an attempt to prevent a collapse of the process launched in Madrid six years ago to bring Israel's four other Arab neigbours in to line with Cairo.</p>
<p>On the eve of the White House meeting Clinton received a &quot;sober&quot; report on the Middle East from U.S. diplomatic troubleshooter Dennis Ross.</p>
<p>Ross held two days of talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Netanyahu last week. Netanyahu is weighing a trip to Washington next week to seek U.S. help out of the impasse, Israeli officials said.</p>
<p>Western officials said Washington was trying to put together a package of measures to defuse Israeli-Palestinian tensions. These would include accelerating talks on a final settlement of the 100-year-old Jewish-Arab conflict and an Israeli pledge to curb settlement.</p>
<p>The U.S. had hoped passions would cool on both sides after initial protests over the Jerusalem building project but instead clashes have broken out in Palestinian towns and a Hamas suicide bomber killed three Israelis in a Tel Aviv cafe.</p>
<p>Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist group, denied it carried out the two attacks in Gaza on Tuesday. It accused Israel of orchestrating the blasts to damage relations between Islamic groups and Arafat's self-rule Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>Arafat said one man had blown himself up and accused Israeli soldiers of shooting the other.</p>
<p>&quot;This morning, one blew himself up on the road. In (sic) the same time an Israeli jeep opened fire on two taxis. One Palestinian was killed and five were injured,&quot; Arafat told a meeting of foreign donors in Gaza.</p>
<p>An Israeli army spokesman rejected Arafat's account.</p>
<p>&quot;As regards Chairman Arafat's remark, it is absolutely incorrect. There were two suicide attacks and two bombs,&quot; the spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan repeated Israel's demand that Arafat curb attacks. &quot;Unless the Palestinian Authority do something about this, unless they clamp down on terrorism, the peace process is indeed in grave danger,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Arafat said a further crackdown could backfire.</p>
<p>&quot;What will be the reaction from our side, to control more and more? For every pressure there is a reaction. This is natural law,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>Israeli military sources said one of the dead men wore a suicide bomb belt, and the other wore the uniform of the Palestinian police.</p>
<p>The blasts occurred around 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) as settlers and school children were leaving the isolated enclaves of Kfar Darom and Netzarim south of Gaza City. In the past both Jewish settlements have been the focus of Palestinian attacks.</p>
<p>Hamas official Sayed Abu Musameh blamed Israel for the blasts.</p>
<p>&quot;This bombing was done by the Israeli intelligence and its (Palestinian) collaborators in an attempt to create an internal problem between the Islamic movement and the Palestinian Authority,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>On the political front Netanyahu said he was considering forming a unity coalition government with the Labour opposition and other parties to achieve a &quot;wide national front&quot; for a final peace deal.</p>
<p>&quot;The big question is whether a unity government would create such a front of break it. Would it be a government of unity or two governments,&quot;' he told Army radio.</p>
