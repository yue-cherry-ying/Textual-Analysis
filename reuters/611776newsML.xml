<title>INDONESIA: Indonesian rupiah weakens on campaign jitters.</title>
<headline>Indonesian rupiah weakens on campaign jitters.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>The Indonesian rupiah weakened against the dollar in cautious early trading on Friday, with the market watching developments on the last day of the campaign for the May 29 poll, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is biddish on the dollar. People are rather worried about possible disturbances on the final campaign day,&quot; one Japanese bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the fears resulted from the minority United Development Party's (PPP) campaign schedule in Java, including Jakarta, which has potential for violence.  </p>
<p>Spot rupiah fell to 2,443.5/44.0 at 0210 GMT, compared with an opening of 2,440.0/42.0. Today rupiah was at 2,442.25/43.00.</p>
<p>There was no trade in value tomorrow because of a holiday in the United States on Monday.</p>
<p>Dealers said operators were slightly cautious at the opening fearing a tighter rupiah market because of a neutral central bank money policy on Friday.</p>
<p>But an easing of overnight money to 10.0/11.0 percent from 12.0/15.0 percent led to some dollar purchases.</p>
<p>Overnight swap edged down to 1.0/1.2 from 1.3/1.5. Spot/next was at 0.46/0.55 points.  </p>
<p>&quot;Operators are a bit nervous. I think any news of violence could spark off a slew of rupiah selling,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>He said longer-term swaps were on the uptrend on the back of uncertainty over the election campaign.</p>
<p>One-month swaps rose to 17.0/19.0 from 15.5/16.5 on Wednesday, two to 30.0/34.0 from 28.0/31.0, three to 47.0/52.0 from 40.0/44.0 and six to 87.0/92.0 from 83.0/85.0 points.</p>
<p>The central bank raised its intervention band by one point to 2,411/2,603 and its conversion band also by one point to 2,420/2,468 on Wednesday. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364</p>
