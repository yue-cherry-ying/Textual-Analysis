<p>June T-bond futures are set to maintain their bearish outlook and head down towards 106-22 on Tuesday, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Really it's a case of the market being in a steady bear trend looking for the next leg down and selling the corrective rallies when they come along,&quot; said David Sneddon, technical analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. &quot;The big target we are looking for here is 106-23, 106-22 with interim support at 107 the figure, which is a potential channel support.&quot;</p>
<p>At 0944 GMT, June T-bonds were at 107-07, unchanged from Monday's Chicago close in automated trade.  </p>
<p>&quot;Near-term you've got resistance at 107-19, 107-21,&quot; said Sneddon. &quot;If it gets above there we could see a bit of a correction back to around 108-00, but it should really hold below 108-04 to preserve the immediate bearish structure.&quot;</p>
<p>Daily charts show 108-04 was the low on March 26.</p>
<p>On initial tests, 106-23, 22 would likely hold and there could be a rebound or some sideways consolidation, Sneddon said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I expect the market to eventually break below that area and see a move to the 106-02, 105-28 band,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nicholas Rose, technical analyst at 4CAST in London, also saw downward pressure on T-bonds but sought an initial rally.  </p>
<p>&quot;At the moment they are in quite a flat range at the lows struck last Thursday and the important test is going to be to the upside early on. But any (upside) tests should sell back as T-bonds are still weak on a daily basis,&quot; Rose said. &quot;The basic pattern is to sell this rally but looking for a base to come in sometime this week.&quot;</p>
<p>He said initial support was at 107-05, Monday's low, but the contract had the potential to get down to 107-00.</p>
<p>Below there, the next main level at 106-00 was not an impossible target for this session, he said although he expected an initial move higher.</p>
<p>&quot;Things look pretty choppy at the moment with the moves in the stock market, and there is an air of worry,&quot; Rose said.</p>
<p>September Eurodollars were trading at 93.690, up 0.005 from Monday's Chicago settlement.</p>
