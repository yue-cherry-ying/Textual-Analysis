<title>GERMANY: SOCCER-HERTHA BERLIN RETURN TO GERMAN FIRST DIVISION.</title>
<headline>SOCCER-HERTHA BERLIN RETURN TO GERMAN FIRST DIVISION.</headline>
<dateline>BERLIN 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Germany's capital and largest city will have a soccer team in the first division for the first time in six years after Hertha Berlin won their 17th match of the season to guarantee promotion.</p>
<p>Hertha Berlin defeated Unterhaching 2-1 on Thursday night to clinch a spot in the Bundesliga's first division next season. They now have 58 points with 17 wins and seven draws in 31 matches.</p>
<p>After floundered for six seasons in the Bundesliga's second division following their 1992 relegation and nearly slipping into the regional league several times, Hertha benefitted from a major infusion of financial support from a publishing company this year.</p>
<p>Hertha are lying second behind Kaiserslautern, who have 61 points and clinched a return to the first division last week. Both teams have three matches left and can no longer be caught.</p>
<p>A match in Berlin's Olympic Stadium in April between Hertha and Kaiserslautern drew 75,000 fans -- the largest attendance for any soccer match in Germany in the 1996/97 season.</p>
<p>&quot;I am absolutely thrilled,&quot; said Berlin mayor Eberhard Diepgen in a telegram to the team. &quot;Finally the seven years of soccer drought in Berlin are over. Berlin is once again a first-class city for soccer.&quot;</p>
<p>Hertha won the Bundesliga championship in 1930 and 1931.</p>
<p>Thousands of Hertha fans poured on to the streets of Berlin to celebrate the return to the first division. Berlin will hold a formal promotion celebration on June 11 after the team's final home match against Uerdingen.</p>
