<title>UK: Quiet London gold hovers around key $350 level.</title>
<headline>Quiet London gold hovers around key $350 level.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The price of gold hung around the psychologically important $350.00 an ounce level in thin, trading on Tuesday, while the white metals showed more volatility.</p>
<p>Bullion was fixed at $350.00 an ounce in the afternoon, virtually unchanged from $349.85 in the morning after trading in a tight range of around $1.70.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold certainly does not seem to be doing much today and trading is quite thin,&quot; a dealer noted.</p>
<p>Dealers had said sharp losses on Wall Street on Thursday and Monday had helped to attract investors to gold, buoying prices.</p>
<p>The effect was not likely to last much longer, unless the stock market saw further significant losses this week, they said.</p>
<p>In contrast, silver, platinum and palladium have lost ground amid concerns about industrial demand in the aftermath of last week's hike in U.S. interest rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>Silver started the day weaker after a slide below the $5.08 support line in New York on Monday triggered sell stops and sent prices lower.</p>
<p>Further selling in early Europe, which dealers attributed to a New York investment fund, sent prices probing key support at $5.00 an ounce.</p>
<p>But it bounced off lows and was last at $5.03/$5.05, off nine cents from Thursday's close. Still, some dealers said silver had acquired a downside bias and was vulnerable to the downside.</p>
<p>&quot;The $5.00 level has held for now, and $4.98 has been good technical support in the past. But longs have been getting out and we may be moving into a new, lower range,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Platinum also came under pressure, and ticked lower after sustaining painful losses on Monday in New York. It was last at $368.50/$369.50, down $3.20 from Thursday's London close.</p>
<p>But palladium came off its lows and was last indicated virutally unchanged at $146.25/$147.25.</p>
<p>The market was still waiting for fresh news on Russian supplies of platinum group metals to Japan, which have been on hold since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Industry officials have said they were waiting for a government decree to authorise shipments. --Lida Poletz, London newsroom +44 171 542 2936</p>
