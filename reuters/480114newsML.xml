<title>GERMANY: SAA plans stable ex-Europe air cargo rates.</title>
<headline>SAA plans stable ex-Europe air cargo rates.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>South African Airways said it will hold air cargo rates from Europe to South Africa stable this spring.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Els, the airline's Frankfurt-based Europe cargo manager, told Reuters: &quot;SAA does not plan any rates increases from Europe to South Africa because the market does not support it.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;I hope that the rates level can be kept and that my competitors will start to think commercially.&quot;</p>
<p>Air cargo exports from Europe to South Africa were likely to remain steady this year with no significant growth rates, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect steady quantities from Europe this year, not big growth. There are no big projects,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>SAA flew 5,466 tonnes of airfreight from Germany to South Africa in 1996, according to the latest issue of company newsletter Springbok News.</p>
<p>Els said investment from North America and Japan in South Africa remained low while the automotive and computer industries were the main existing air cargo clients.</p>
<p>&quot;The South African market is dominated by several large clients. Other firms have not yet invested so much,&quot; he pointed out.</p>
<p>Competition to South Africa had increased dramatically over the last year with more than 60 airlines flying there now due to rising passenger demand and creating surplus cargo capacity, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market goes up and down in waves. What was not good for the market was the high capacity that came on to the market,&quot; he explained.</p>
<p>Els said Britain and Germany were the top European markets for SAA while the Netherlands was an important distribution point. --Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom. Tel +44 171 542 7706 Fax+5017</p>
