<p>Mexicans entered a new political era on Monday, with supporters of the victors jubilant at the unprecedented damage they wrought at the ballot box to the party that has ruled them for 68 years.</p>
<p>As results poured in throughout the day from Sunday's mid-term elections, post after post fell to opposition candidates capitalizing on pent-up anger at official corruption and a prolonged financial crisis that has hurt ordinary people the most.</p>
<p>Punishment of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) began in Mexico City when voters handed victory to veteran left-wing leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a twice-thwarted presidential hopeful, in the race for mayor of Mexico City.</p>
<p>Voting for that sensitive job -- until now the post has been a presidential appointee -- coincided with polling across Mexico for a fresh lower house of Congress, a third of the senate and governors in six of the 32 states.</p>
<p>With 86.6 percent of the votes counted, the PRI saw its majority in the lower house of Congress wither to 38.9 percent.</p>
<p>Its power was eaten away by gains of 27 percent by the conservative National Action Party (PAN) and 25.6 percent by the left-wing Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD).</p>
<p>&quot;It's as if we have woken up from a long nightmare,&quot; said Jose Ramon Ortiz, a 55-year-old shopowner in Mexico City's bohemian Condesa neighborhood.</p>
<p>Taxis in Mexico sported the yellow bumper stickers of Cardenas' PRD -- a force almost written off two years ago but, with Cardenas as its flagship candidate, made most gains in Sunday's vote.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm shocked. It's always been PRI, PRI, PRI and nothing but the PRI in Mexico,&quot; Raul Ramirez, a 35-year-old shoeshiner on the city's Reforma Avenue, said.</p>
<p>El Financiero daily declared: &quot;Seventy years of hegemony ended.&quot;</p>
<p>Mexican financial markets also surged on the news, with the stock market, which could have tumbled with the loss of the PRI majority -- reaching a new record high.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm was mostly due to the fact Mexico had at last embraced a multi-party system and held clean elections, which economists said was good for the country's long-term stability. For years, elections had been marred by charges of fraud.</p>
<p>&quot;We have finally succeeded in having real elections in Mexico, elections in which the votes are what decides who governs and who represents the people,&quot; a typically dour Cardenas said in an interview with Reuters.</p>
<p>Late on Monday, PRI President Humberto Roque Villanueva conceded the PRI would have great difficulty in maintaining the lower house majority in its biggest setback since it was founded after the 1910-1917 Mexican revolution.</p>
<p>Results were still being tallied and final numbers were not expected until Wednesday.</p>
<p>As well as likely losing the lower house, the PRI saw governorships in a number of key states slip away.</p>
<p>Most dramatically, the PAN took both the northern state of Nuevo Leon, Mexico's industrial heartland, and the central state of Queretaro from the PRI's grasp.</p>
<p>The PRI held onto tiny Colima state and Sonora in the north, but PRD supporters took to the streets in poverty-stricken Campeche state to protest alleged fraud they said was giving the PRI the advantage.</p>
<p>&quot;In Campeche everyone voted, even the dead,&quot; said Layda Sansores, the PRD's candidate for mayor of Campeche. &quot;Right now, we are going to start a political mobilization&quot; against the count.</p>
<p>But the optimism elsewhere was palpable.</p>
<p>&quot;The elections of July 6 represent, perhaps, a new epoch in Mexican history,&quot; said Nobel laureate and writer Octavio Paz in a newspaper commentary. &quot;The true victor of this day has been the entire people of Mexico.&quot;</p>
