<title>ITALY: Italian bonds/futures closing report.</title>

<p>Italian debt markets ended up after shadowing Bunds for the session but managing to outperform the German market overall.</p>
<p>Brokers said high yielders in general had outperformed and Italy itself had seen good domestic buying.</p>
<p>Expectations for a cut in the Italian discount rate seemed to have been pushed further out to next week or even early June, although analysts said judging the timing of a possible easing was extremely hard.</p>
<p>Linda Glover, senior broker at HSBC in London, said the expectation the Bank of Italy would cut eventually remained.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is the tantalising prospect of a rate cut,&quot; Glover said. But since the central bank had not moved straight after encouraging preliminary inflation data earlier this week the feeling was &quot;Why bother just before the French elections.&quot;</p>
<p>She said the Bank of Italy could even wait as long as early June, after both this weekend's first round of French polling and the second round on June 1.</p>
<p>The prospect of a possible victory by the opposition French Socialist party has potential to unnerve financial markets who would be concerned about subsequent progress towards a single European currency.  </p>
<p>As a result, analysts say the Bank of Italy may be waiting to see how voting turns out.</p>
<p>In addition, the central bank presents its annual report next week and the government is due to unveil its three-year economic plan, both of which are factors which analysts say could make the bank wait.</p>
<p>London and U.S. markets are closed on Monday and brokers said players seemed to have prefered to go home short.</p>
