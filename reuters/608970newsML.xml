<p>Banco Santiago will place $200 million in bonds on the United States market in July or October, though no exact date has been set yet, general manager Hector Valdes said Friday.</p>
<p>The bonds will probably be for 10 years, though that detail hasn't been settled either, Valdes said.</p>
<p>He said the bank has ruled out August or September for placing the bonds because he believes too many U.S. investors will be on vacation during those months.  </p>
<p>&quot;The first possibility is July, and the second is upon return from the American vacation period in October,&quot; Valdes told reporters at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting.  &quot;It all depends on our studies of international interest rates, and then we'll decide what the right moment is.&quot;</p>
<p>The shareholders' meeting earlier approved a $150 million capital increase and the long-expected bond placement.</p>
<p>The bank plans to place the bonds mostly or entirely on the U.S. market, though there is a possibility that they would be unleashed on the European market, said Valdes.  </p>
<p>The Central Bank of Chile owns 38.5 percent of Banco Santiago's stock, because the private institution paid its subordinated debts to the Central Bank last year in shares.</p>
<p>The Central Bank has protested against Banco Santiago's plans for the capital increase because the price on the new shares would be about four pesos less than the 12.8 pesos at which the Central Bank plans to sell its shares -- undercutting demand for the Central Bank's shares.  </p>
<p>Banco Santiago officials defended the decision to set the lower price, saying it would put the new shares within reach of all current shareholders, including the Central Bank, which the officials said was free to buy shares from the new placement.</p>
<p>&quot;The board has decided to favor the subscription of the new capital increase by all shareholders with this price on the shares,&quot; said Andronico Luksic Craig, president of Banco Santiago, at the meeting. Spain's Central Hispano is the other major shareholder in Banco Santiago, which was formed last year in the merger of Banco de Santiago and Banco O'Higgins.</p>
