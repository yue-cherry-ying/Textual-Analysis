<p>India's United Front coalition will announce the name of its new leader to head a centre-left government at 8:30 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Saturday, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Jaipal Reddy said alliance leaders would meet at 7:30 p.m. (1400 GMT) to decide on a new leader. &quot;We are sure to reach a settlement and announce the new leader at 8:30 p.m. so that you can relax for the night,&quot; he told reporters.  </p>
<p>United Front officials said strong support for caretaker Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral as a consensus candidate had built up during the day as alliance leaders held hectic talks to find a replacement for Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>But caretaker Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh remained a possible choice, they said. The chances of southern regional leader G.K. Moopanar being chosen appeared to have faded, they said.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda resigned on April 11 after losing a vote of confidence in the lower house of parliament. But the Congress party, which provoked his downfall by withdrawing support, said on Friday that it would back a new United Front leader at the head of a centre-left government.</p>
