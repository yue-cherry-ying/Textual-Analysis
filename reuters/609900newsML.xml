<headline>Brady debt mostly firmer ahead of holiday weekend.</headline>

<p>Emerging market debt prices were mostly higher on Friday but activity remained extremely light ahead of the market holiday in London and the Memorial Day holiday in New York on Monday, market experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been very, very quiet today with the three-day weekend coming up,&quot; said one emerging market debt trader at a European investment bank based in London.</p>
<p>The trader said the only activity in London early on Friday was in Russian debt following news that $10.6 million of MinFin bonds had been frozen.</p>
<p>The prices of Russian debt instruments had fallen briefly following the news but recovered fairly quickly to closing levels on Thursday, the trader said.</p>
<p>Russian Vnesheconombank dollar-denominated loans were 1/8 firmer at 85-5/8 bid and Russain Min Fin 3s were 1/4 higher at 87-1/4 bid.</p>
<p>In the Latin Brady market, emerging debt experts said news on Wednesday that Brazil planned to swap or buyback some of its Brady bonds continued to underpin prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The main news in emerging markets is what has been going on in Brazil with the swap which could be very large indeed,&quot; said Jerome Booth, head of emerging markets reseach at ANZ Investment Bank in London.</p>
<p>Another factor that helped to support Brazilian Bradies was Senate passage of a bill on Wednesday that would allow President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to run for re-election.</p>
<p>&quot;The re-election amendment is obviously good news. There is one more round of voting in the Senate...and the bribery scandal hasn't blown that off course so that is very positive,&quot; Peter West, director of emerging markets research at West Merchant bank in London said.</p>
<p>Brazilian &quot;C&quot; bonds were 3/8 higher at 79-3/8 bid and its par bonds were 1/8 firmer at 66-1/8 bid.</p>
<p>Market sources said another bright spot in the Latin debt market which presents a good buying opportunity is Venezuela.</p>
<p>&quot;The next play after Brazil where we are very interested at the moment is Venezuela,&quot; said Booth, who expects spreads on Venezuelan Brady bonds to narrow faster than most of the market.</p>
<p>&quot;Venezuela is making very substantial fundamental reforms and, in particular, its oil industry is increasing capacity at a very rapid rate and refining capacity at that,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Indeed, reforms in Venezuela are moving ahead.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Venezuela's Chamber of Deputies approved crucial reforms of the Labor Law as part of a wider package of social security reforms.</p>
<p>Venezuelan Flirbs were 1/8 stronger at 91-1/8 bid and the country's discount bonds were 1/2 better at 86-1/2 bid.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, emerging market experts said higher yielding credits such as Bulgaria and Ecuador were likely to attract investor interest.</p>
<p>&quot;As the market becomes a little more confident, I think we will see a little bit of a rally and once that is established there will be a lot more yield seeking so I will be looking at Bulgaria, Ecuador and Nigeria,&quot; said Booth.</p>
<p>Bulgarian IABs were 1/2 stronger at 67-7/8 bid, Ecuadorean pars were unchanged at 44-5/8 bid and Nigerian pars were 1/4 higher at 65-3/4 bid.</p>
