<p>U.S. spot gasoline prices jumped over 2.5 cents a gallon by late Thursday tracking sharply higher June futures and a one-cent firming of differentials amid tightened rules for shipments on the Explorer Pipeline for the remaining three cycles of May.</p>
<p>Group Three unleaded diffs firmed one cent, with prompt deals done at 4.0 cents over June futures and any-month parcels sold for 2.50 cents over, traders said.</p>
<p>June NYMEX gasoline settled 1.58 cents higher, meanwhile, to 62.50 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>Chicago unleaded diffs also firmed a penny by late day, to 2.25 cents over June NYMEX for spot material and 1.75 cents over for any-month material, traders said.</p>
<p>The pipeline company, running at full throttle, has fallen about five days behind its schedule for delivering refined products from Texas to Midwest markets.</p>
<p>Usually, it allows clients to nominate deliveries for specific cycles, with the option of later switching their reservation of line space to other cycles during the same month.  </p>
<p>But the company annnounced to clients late Wednesday that &quot;transfer of line space between cycles will not be allowed&quot; for the remaining 13th, 14th and 15th ten-day cycles of May because the pipeline is running at capacity.</p>
<p>Realizing they had to have physical barrels in hand or lose their space allowances on cycles they had already designated, refiners and traders switched into a buying mode on Thursday.</p>
<p>And continued delays on receiving shipments increased the desire to obtain material, particularly of gasoline, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Explorer has been running behind on gasoline for about a month because so much distillate is coming up the line, so they can't get enough gasoline in,&quot; one Group Three player said.</p>
