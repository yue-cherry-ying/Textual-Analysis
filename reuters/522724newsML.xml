<p>Late institutional buying of core blue chips pushed Seoul stocks to close higher during the half-day session on Saturday, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Institutional investors boosted core blue chips including Samsung Electronics and POSCO before the close,&quot; said Woo Sang-chul of Tongyang Securities.</p>
<p>Brokers said blue chip shares were being purchased ahead of a rise in the foreign stock ownership limit. The ceiling will be raised to 23 percent on May 2 from 20 percent at present.</p>
<p>The composite stock index closed at 700.65, up 4.98 points.  </p>
<p>Samsung Electronics rose 2,200 won to 62,400 and steelmaker POSCO added 2,800 won to 55,800.</p>
<p>Brokers said news that a senior North Korean defector Hwang Jang-yop would arrive in South Korea on Sunday had little impact on the market. But they said the market could react to any comments Hwang might make after his arrivial.</p>
<p>Financial troubles at the Jinro Group would continue to weigh on the market next week, the brokers said.</p>
