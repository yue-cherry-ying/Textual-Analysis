<p>Stocks tumbled Tuesday, as investors lost heart after an early attempt to rebound after losing almost 300 points in the last two sessions.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no need for anyone to become optimistic about the market's prospects in the near-term. The rubberband was stretched too tight and that brought in some bargain-hunting,&quot; said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock and Co.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem for the market lies in an environment in which it is assumed that interest rates will move higher in the weeks ahead,&quot; Barthel said.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 60.05 points at 6.523.43. In the broader market, declines led advancing issues by 14 to nine on active volume of about 295 million shares.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index fell 12.13 points to 1,209.57.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the key 30-year Treasury bond edged up 1/32 of a point. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, was unchanged at 7.10 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not be surprised to see the market bounce all over the place,&quot; said Charlie Crane, chief market strategist at Key Asset Management.</p>
<p>&quot;Afternoon is when the programme traders come in, and the bond market has been acting reasonably well,&quot; Crane said. He said that once the dust settled and the drop in stocks was over, the market will have gone through a 10 percent correction.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless the bond market deteriorates substantially from here, I don't think this will devolve into something worse. But it won't get better without an improvement in the bond market, either. The focus for the next three to four weeks will be earnings and economic data.&quot;</p>
<p>Stocks rallied early after the release of the March National Association of Purchasing Management index. While the overall index rose to 55.0 in March from 53.1 in February, its key price component actually dropped to 50.9 in March from a reading of 55.1 the previous month.</p>
<p>&quot;The industrial sector exhibits healthy expansion with a complete lack of pricing pressure,&quot; said Bruce Steinberg, manager of macroeconomics at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Other data released Tuesday were stronger than forecast.</p>
<p>The February index of leading indicators, a key economic forecasting gauge, rose by 0.5 percent after a 0.3 percent increase in January. Construction spending rose 2.3 percent compared with the previous month's revised increase of 0.3 percent.</p>
<p>Dick Stein, vice-president at US Clearing Corp., said that the market had risen 22 percent between Election Day on Nov. 5 through the first week of February due to a proliferation of investment in index funds.</p>
<p>&quot;The move was unheard of and unreal,&quot; he said. &quot;People kept putting their money in because the market moved up and up. Now that we have had a hike in interest rates and people assume we'll have another one in May. I don't think we'll have another hike that quickly, but you have to give earnings a chance to catch up with prices. Even if we bounce to 6,800 on the Dow, I think the market has seen its highs for the year.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that lows would be around the 6,200 to 6,350 level and would be realised by August.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll come back later this year and close around 6,800. I don't see a runaway market.&quot;</p>
<p>Among special situations, shares in Catalina Marketing, which late Monday warned of disappointing quarterly results, tumbled 11-3/8 to 29-1/4 after a delayed market opening.</p>
