<p>The German Defence Ministry said on Monday it hoped to file charges soon against soldiers who staged mock executions and rapes on video during breaks in training for peacekeeping in former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Ministry spokesman Alois Bach said preliminary investigations had revealed seven people were involved in making the video, which has provoked shock and stirred memories of Nazi atrocities since pictures were published in a weekend newspaper.</p>
<p>Bach said six of the soldiers -- most of whom were young conscripts -- had since left the army, so the ministry's scope for disciplining them was limited. But he added Bonn would employ the civil law to bring them to justice.</p>
<p>&quot;We will pursue these people using all possible means,&quot; he told a regular government news conference. &quot;We hope to hand the case over to prosecutors today or in the next few days.&quot;</p>
<p>Bach said the soldiers could face charges of glorifying violence and bringing symbols of the state into disrepute.</p>
<p>In scenes already published in newspapers, a youthful recruit in a German army uniform is shown holding a pistol in the mouth of another recruit.</p>
<p>Another photograph showed a German soldier wearing battle fatigues pretending to rape a recruit acting as a woman civilian, later shown being marched to execution by soldiers.</p>
<p>Other photos from the video, which was shot at Hammelburg training ground in southern Germany in April 1996, show enactments of &quot;civilians&quot; being tortured and hanging from trees.</p>
<p>Bach said the ministry had no evidence that the soldiers' actions had been politically motivated.</p>
<p>He said the ministry had only seen extracts of the video, due to be broadcast on national television later on Monday.</p>
<p>The private broadcaster which obtained the tape had promised to pass it on to the ministry later in the week, he said.</p>
