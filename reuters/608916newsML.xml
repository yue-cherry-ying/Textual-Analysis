<title>TAJIKISTAN: Russian border guards kill two on Afghan border.</title>
<headline>Russian border guards kill two on Afghan border.</headline>

<p>Two armed men trying to cross into Tajikistan from neighbouring Afghanistan have been shot dead by Russian border guards, a Russian military spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>The spokesman told Reuters in the Tajik capital Dushanbe that the two were killed as they tried to cross the Pyandzh river on the border in the inflated inner tube of a car tyre.</p>
<p>The incident, which occurred late on Thursday, was the third of its kind in just three days. Russian troops shot dead two people trying to cross the border on Tuesday and a further two on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Around 20,000 Russian troops are deployed in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, guarding its remote, mountainous border.</p>
<p>Russia and Tajikistan see the troops as a shield against militant Islamist extremism spreading northwards from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Russian border guards and the Tajik government have voiced concern that the advance of the purist Islamist Taleban militia in Afghanistan's north could destabilise the situation in Tajikistan and spread to other Central Asian states.</p>
<p>Tajikistan's secular government and the united Islamist opposition agreed last year on a ceasefire to end a four-year civil war that left tens of thousands dead and many more displaced.</p>
<p>But the fragile peace is often shaken by maverick armed bands and drug traders operating out of their bases in Afghanistan.</p>
