<p>Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore said Friday that a settlement of tobacco litigation was not imminent, although he said he hoped to know within two weeks whether a deal could be reached.</p>
<p>Moore said in a telephone interview that news reports that the settlement was near were incorrect.</p>
<p>&quot;We've completed some of our work, but have a long way to go,&quot; he said. &quot;We'll know if we're going to resolve this thing in the next two weeks is what I believe. If we don't, I've got to come home and get ready for trial.&quot;</p>
<p>Moore is the lead negotiator for Mississippi and the 28 other states that have sued the tobacco industry to recoup Medicaid costs of smokers. Mississippi's trial is scheduled to begin July 7, followed by Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>He criticised Friday's Wall Street Journal report that said a core group of attorneys general and tobacco company lawyers negotiating a settlement were close to a plan that would sharply restrict the ability of current smokers to bring lawsuits.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the proposal would also make it virtually impossible for future smokers to be compensated for the most common tobacco-related illnesses, such as lung cancer.</p>
<p>&quot;The story is wrong,&quot; Moore said. &quot;The talks are about the future. The focus has been on children and public health and how to reduce smoking ... Very little time has been spent on civil liability.</p>
<p>&quot;The story is faulty ... not only faulty in focus but faulty in substance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said civil liability was a low priority compared with efforts to reduce smoking among children.</p>
<p>&quot;Our top priority is to reduce teenage consumption by 50 percent in seven years. If we do that, then that will reduce adult consumption within 15 to 20 years by the same amount.&quot;</p>
<p>Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who heads a committee of attorneys general on the liability issue, said the group would never agree to a settlement that would make it virtually impossible for future smokers to sue the industry.</p>
<p>He added that the group had not discussed a monetary settlement in any detail.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher, who has participated in telephone conference calls to update the suing states, said he also felt a final settlement was far from being reached.</p>
<p>&quot;Any settlement would have to make sure that they (tobacco companies) stop targeting our children and that Pennsylvania taxpayers are adequately compensated,&quot; Fisher said in an interview.</p>
<p>He said he had not heard any dollar figure yet.</p>
<p>Moore also denied reports that plaintiffs lawyers were making decisions on settlement proposals.</p>
<p>&quot;The primary role of the lawyers is to assist us,&quot; he said. &quot;Private lawyers are not making decisions for attorneys general.&quot;</p>
