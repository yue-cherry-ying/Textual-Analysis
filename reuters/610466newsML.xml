<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Thursday.</p>
<p>LONDON - UK shares closed moderately higher but a weaker Wall Street took the shine off a promising advance. The FTSE 100, which raced to an intraday trading high of 4,661.7, a mere 32 points below its record closing peak, finished 9.8 points firmer at 4,651.8.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German shares ended bourse trade down after reversing course from earlier gains. Traders tied weakness to sales of German debt futures, with afternoon dealing focused on U.S. market movements along with Bund futures. The 30-share DAX index ended down 16.67 points at 3,579.42. In post-bourse trade the IBIS DAX index closed at 3,575.44.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares closed 1.6 percent lower on profit-taking on the eve of the end of the trading account after recent highs for the blue-chip index. Rumours about unpublished opinion polls concerning the May 25 and June 1 two-round parliamentary election also weighed on the market. The CAC-40 index closed 44.70 points lower at 2,741.65.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares closed marginally easier, but held nearly all of Wednesday's strong gains despite some pressure from an easier U.S. dollar and a slump in German Bunds. The broad Swiss Performance Index fell 1.55 points, or 0.05 percent, to 3,266.80.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks ended slightly higher after drifting both sides of Wednesday's closing level. Recent sharp fluctuations of the yen kept investors hugging the sidelines. The Nikkei 225 average index finished 35.41 points, or 0.18 percent, higher at 19,877.39.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Profit-taking in Hong Kong's leading stocks brought the Hang Seng Index to a lower close, but lagging counters received a boost as investors sought out bargains. The blue chip index ended 23.52 points, or 0.17 percent, lower at 14,212.00.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Australian stocks ended slightly firmer, with the market range-bound for most of the session but traders finding enough motivation late in the day to lift shares to a record close. The benchmark All Ordinaries index closed up 4.7 points at 2,547.9.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African shares dipped as poor sentiment gripped the market, but sparkling results from Investec Bank Ltd triggered a surge of trade in the banking sector. The local market has been suffering the blues recently after a rash of poor corporate earnings in May crystalised concerns in the industrials sector. The All-share index dropped 31.1 points to 7,096.1, the Industrials index slipped 44.7 points to 8,351.5 and the Golds index lost 8.6 points to 1,205.5.</p>
