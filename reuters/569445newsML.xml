<p>Human activity, overgrazing, and erosion are rendering vast swathes of China's farmland barren and costing the nation billions of dollars each year in direct economic losses, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A recent survey by the Ministry of Forestry found China had nearly 1.69 million square km (652,000 square miles) of sandy and rocky deserts, making up 17.6 percent of its total area, Wang Zhibao, vice-minister of forestry, told reporters.</p>
<p>However, under a broader definition of wasteland used by the United Nations, some 2.62 million square km (1.0 million square miles) -- more than one-quarter of China's total land -- was desolate, Wang told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Desertification is seriously harming China's agricultural and livestock output as well as the lives of the people,&quot; Wang said.</p>
<p>Soil erosion caused by wind, water and ice combined with human activity were helping to create deserts and wastelands at a rate of 2,460 square km (950 square miles) a year and causing as much as 54 billion yuan ($6.5 billion) a year in direct economic losses, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Desertification of Chinese land still has not effectively been brought under control,&quot; he said. &quot;Protecting against desertification has become one of the most pressing tasks facing us.&quot;</p>
<p>Drought across much of northern China had contributed to erosion as the dry weather killed or stunted plants that keep soil in place, said the China Desertification Report, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;But human activity is stimulating and accelerating the process of desertification and has become the main factor in desertification,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Rampant grazing by livestock, improper irrigation methods and the felling of trees for firewood and building materials had all taken their toll on the land by magnifying the effects of erosion, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The population growth in areas where desertification is happening must be controlled to reduce the pressure created by demand for natural resources,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Many farmers who had moved into uninhabited northern steppe areas years ago had disrupted the fragile grassland ecology by planting crops that quickly led to erosion, eventually making the land useless, Wang said.</p>
<p>&quot;We must strictly look into and handle the chaotic felling of trees and all types of illegal encroachment on and damage to forests and grasslands,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>China was spending 600 million yuan a year on finding ways to check erosion and reduce the effects of human activity on the ecology, Wang said, but added the battle would not be won soon.</p>
<p>&quot;China is a country seriously affected by desertification. These investments will never be enough,&quot; he said.</p>
