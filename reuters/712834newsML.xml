<p>The OSCE, which monitored Albania's elections, said on Tuesday the polls had been acceptable and told Albanian politicians to honour the outcome and seek reconciliation or risk losing international aid.</p>
<p>&quot;Without such reconciliation, there will be no basis for defining the terms of international aid, and the continued support of the international community,&quot; the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said in a final report on the June 29-July 6 polls.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe...we can say the elections can be deemed as acceptable, given the prevailing circumstances,&quot; the statement said, pointing to a high 73 percent turnout.</p>
<p>It said most voters had been able to cast ballots without fear and most electoral commissions had behaved impartially.</p>
<p>After two rounds of voting, Albania's ex-communist Socialists and their leftist allies looked set for a two-thirds majority over President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The 54-nation OSCE, spanning Europe and North America, monitors human rights and democratic institutions in Europe.</p>
<p>Javier Ruperez, Spanish president of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly meeting in Warsaw, told a news conference that the OSCE Albania mission's chief Franz Vranitzky would later submit conclusions to OSCE leaders who would decide on recommendations for future international aid.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been waiting for a new government before negotiating terms of an economic reform programme. The IMF has disbursed some 60 million in credits to Albania since 1992 but the programme was suspended in 1995.</p>
<p>It reported that there had been irregularities in both the first and second rounds, some serious, which it was up to Albania's judicial system to deal with.</p>
<p>But referring to the June 29 first round it added: &quot;The large turnout of voters (73 percent) demonstrated that Albania, in close cooperation with the OSCE, was able to organise the voting day in a reasonably orderly fashion.&quot;</p>
<p>It recalled that one polling station official had been killed in an apparently election-related murder, and said that the counting had been very slow and problematic.</p>
<p>The statement condemned the killing of two election officials in the second round, but added: &quot;Overall, observers indicated that there were no serious technical violations of the voting process.&quot;</p>
<p>Albania's Socialist leader Fatos Nano, who plans to be prime minister of the coalition government, said on Monday he hoped to convene parliament by July 20 and form a cabinet by July 25 although some districts are to hold a vote on Sunday.</p>
<p>The early election was called in March after the collapse of popular savings funds triggered a violent rebellion and over 1,500 deaths in clashes, forcing the Democratic government to resign after five years of ruling the Balkan nation.</p>
<p>The Socialists won over 80 of 155 seats in the first vote.</p>
