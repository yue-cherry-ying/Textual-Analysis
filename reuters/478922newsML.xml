<title>THAILAND: Thai central bank staff exonerated in BBC case.</title>
<headline>Thai central bank staff exonerated in BBC case.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Bank of Thailand said on Tuesday it found deputy central bank governor Jaroong Nookhwun and two other senior bank officials not guilty of negligence in a bungled civil court case against executives of Bangkok Bank of Commerce Plc (BBC).</p>
<p>A central bank statement said an inquiry by an independent panel last month showed that Jaroong and the other officials did not deliberately delay the case against former BBC president Krirkkiat Jalichandra and other executives.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said in February they were forced to drop a government case against BBC executives who faced charges related to Banking Act violations because a one-year statute of limitations had expired.</p>
<p>Jaroong said earlier that central bank officials under his supervision had acted promptly in providing white collar crime police with documentary evidence related to the case.</p>
<p>The Tuesday statement said no central bank officials were found to have committed disciplinary violations.</p>
<p>Krirkkiat and his aides also faced other separate criminal charges of embezzling BBC's funds.</p>
<p>The government took over BBC last May after a public run on its deposits that was triggered by disclosure in parliament that the bank was saddled with over 78 billion baht ($3 billion) of non-performing loans.</p>
