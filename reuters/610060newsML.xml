<p>House Republican leaders tried on Thursday to leave town for a week-long break without approving disaster aid for the flooded Midwest, sparking a bipartisan rebellion that threw Congress into chaos.</p>
<p>Furious at the prospect of going home to voters empty-handed, lawmakers blocked formal efforts to adjourn by a vote of 67-278. Shellshocked Republican leaders quickly suspended House business and will hold only perfunctory sessions until the recess ends on June 3.</p>
<p>Both parties support disaster aid, but the original $8.4 billion emergency spending bill became bogged down because of unrelated spending and environmental amendments that were added by Republicans, drawing veto threats from President Clinton.</p>
<p>Bob Livingston, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, tried to offer a stripped-down $1 billion disaster aid bill but was blocked on the floor by his own Republican leadership.</p>
<p>Livingston said he had still not given up efforts to move the smaller measure. But other lawmakers said they had been told to go ahead and leave town, with the understanding that the issue was dead until Congress returned.</p>
<p>House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who had been prepared to support the smaller aid bill,  had already departed.</p>
<p>&quot;It is my intention to offer it (the small bill) tomorrow if I get recognised,&quot; Livingston, a Louisiana Republican, said. He noted that the only way a bill could move would be if all members in the House and Senate agreed, which is unlikely.</p>
<p>Democrats and many Republicans were furious.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no business leaving town,&quot; North Dakota Democratic Representative Earl Pomeroy said. &quot;We've got to finish this up. The people we represent deserve no less.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite days of talks, Congress and the White House could not bridge their differences on the original bill, which would have provided $5.5 billion to more than 30 states hit by floods, mudslides and other natural disasters, as well as about $2 billion for U.S. overseas military operations.</p>
<p>Republicans earlier on Thursday had turned to their Plan B, the measure offering $1 billion in disaster relief, nutrition aid for poor women and children, and U.S. military operations. But top Republicans opposed moving the bill out of concern about losing leverage in future negotiations with the White House if some of the must-pass aid were stripped out of the bigger bill.</p>
<p>&quot;It is with deep regret and sense of apology that I inform members we are unable to do further work this evening,&quot; House Republican Leader Dick Armey said on the House floor.</p>
<p>Livingston, who had implored his leadershiop to move the stripped-down bill, said he had been told there was enough federal money in the pipeline to help affected states.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats threatened to block any move to adjourn on their side of the Capitol as well.</p>
<p>&quot;The same irresponsible crowd that shut down the government has now decided to shut down the effort to provide disaster relief,&quot; North Dakota Democratic Sen. Byron Dorgan said.</p>
<p>Dorgan was referring to two unpopular government shutdowns during fiscal 1996 negotiations on a balanced budget.</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle holding up the disaster bill was a provision added by Republicans that would automatically keep the government open next year if Congress and the White House failed to agree on needed spending bills.</p>
<p>Clinton has threatened a veto over that plan, arguing that it would provide billions less for domestic spending than allowed under the new balanced budget deal.</p>
<p>The White House also opposes a proposal by Ted Stevens, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, to make it easier to build roads on federal lands in Alaska.</p>
