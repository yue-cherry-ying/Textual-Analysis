<p>International Paper Co. on Tuesday unveiled plans to sell $1 billion worth of assets over the next year and slash 9,000 jobs -- about 10 percent of its work force -- in an effort to improve its sagging financial performance.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be divesting or closing operations that no longer meet the company's financial or strategic objectives,&quot; International Paper Chairman John Dillon said in a statement announcing the moves.</p>
<p>The paper and forestry products company will shut down three production lines at its Erie, Pa., mill and will close its mill in Woronoco, Mass., it said. It also will close its de-inking pulp operation in Lock Haven, Pa.</p>
<p>The asset sale includes International Paper's imaging and multi-wall kraft, or strong brown paper, packaging businesses and 175,000 acres of timberland in western regions of Pennsylvania and New York, the company said.</p>
<p>It said it also is completing the conversion of three production lines in Maine and Alabama to kraft, specialty and coated freesheet grades from uncoated paper. The moves will result in the company cutting its pulp and uncoated paper capacity by at least 400,000 tons, it said.</p>
<p>The restructuring plan will begin to contribute toward earnings this year and will have a greater impact in 1998, when most of the actions are completed, the company said.</p>
<p>It said the moves will not affect its $1.2 billion capital spending plans for 1998.</p>
<p>The restructuring will cost International Paper $535 million in pre-tax charges in the second quarter, the company said. It is also recording a separate charge of $150 million to add to its legal reserve.</p>
<p>In preliminary earnings released Tuesday, the company said the charges will force it to post a loss for the second quarter of about $419 million, or $1.39 per share, vs. a profit of $99 million, or 33 cents per share, a year ago.</p>
<p>Despite the loss, the company said demand remains strong, and it had a second-quarter operating profit of 20 cents per share before the restructuring charges.</p>
<p>It recorded sales for the quarter of $5.034 billion, down slightly from $5.093 billion a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The good demand we are experiencing should lead to increased profitability over the next six months,&quot; Dillon said.</p>
<p>The company's stock jumped on the news, closing $4.69 higher at $56 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
