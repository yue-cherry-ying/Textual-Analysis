<p>Laurent Kabila's new transitional government in the Democratic Republic of Congo cannot afford to rush into elections, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki cautioned on Friday.</p>
<p>Mbeki, who played a key role in President Nelson Mandela's attempt to ensure a peaceful transition in the former Zaire during seven months of civil war, told reporters there were serious obstacles to achieving a fair poll so soon after taking power.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be unfair to say to somebody who walked into Kinshasa the day before yesterday: 'Set a date for elections'. They can't and if they did it would be entirely a thumbsuck,&quot; said Mbeki, speaking to reporters in the Zimbabwe capital Harare.</p>
<p>Mbeki said however he had no doubt that Kabila's alliance was dedicated to calling elections following its successful rebellion which toppled the 32-year regime of former president Mobutu Sese Seko, who fled Kinshasa on May 16.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to take a bit of time,&quot; Mbeki said. &quot;There are enormous problems...just in terms of drawing up a voters' roll. But there is definitely a commitment to the holding of elections.&quot;</p>
<p>Mbeki reported earlier this week that a European Union team had explored the possibilities for an early election in Zaire last year and had reported problems caused by infrastructure, roads, administration and the unresolved of issue of the nationality of some residents.</p>
