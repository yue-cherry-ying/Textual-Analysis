<p>A trio of German economic reports on Friday showed inflation creeping higher but analysts dismissed the gains as largely due to one-off factors and stressed the Bundesbank has nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Economists said that underlying price pressures in Germany remain tame and that inflation should be subdued for the rest of the year, threatening little impact on monetary policy.</p>
<p>Two of the four states whose data is used to compute preliminary west German consumer prices said May inflation climbed from the same level a year earlier while another report showed that Germany's producer price index climbed in April to a 16-month high.</p>
<p>&quot;This doesn't mean very much for the Bundesbank,&quot; said Stefan Schneider, chief economsit at Paribas in Frankfurt. &quot;To some extent we are seeing month-on-month volatility.&quot;</p>
<p>In the state of Bavaria, consumer prices climbed 1.5 percent in May from a year ago after edging up 1.1 percent in April. In Baden-Wuerttemberg, consumer prices climbed 1.3 percent from May 1996 after gaining 1.1 percent in April.</p>
<p>The two other states which make up the preliminary west German CPI report are expected to publish their data on Monday.</p>
<p>PPI data, meanwhile, climbed 0.9 percent from a year ago, the fourth successive rise after an 11-month run of falls that ended last December, and the biggest gain since December 1995.</p>
<p>Analysts said consumer price gains were largely due to highly volatile seasonal factors that do not present a long term threat to German price stability.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not much concern because many of the items that caused the rise were short-term factors, such as food products, heating oil and the notorious holiday expenditures,&quot; said Matthias Haffner, economist at BZW in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Economsits said they see little threat to sustained price rises in large part because weak German consumer demand makes it hard for companies to lift prices and because raw material prices are relatively stable.</p>
<p>Producer prices, meanwhile, were driven higher by mined products as well as iron and steel. Petroleum product prices declined.</p>
<p>Economists said markets have even less to fear from the higher inflation figures because price pressures had been weak so far this year and are well below the Bundesbank's pain threshhold.</p>
<p>&quot;It is something we can live with after the last two reports that were very positive,&quot; Haffner said. &quot;We would need much higher price increases to see any increase in German interest rates.</p>
<p>Indeed, the German debt market, highly sensitive to even the slightest whiff of inflation, quickly recovered from declines soon after the first inflation reports were released and traded solidly higher in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The June Bund future contract, for example, was 12 basis points higher at midday at 100.85.</p>
