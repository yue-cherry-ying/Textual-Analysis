<p>NATO opened an historic summit on Tuesday with alliance leaders moving close to an agreement to limit the first wave of eastward expansion to three post- communist nations -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>A senior NATO official said key aides, in tense late-night negotiations, had made &quot;considerable progress&quot; in narrowing transatlantic differences and reaching a deal to take in the three candidates favoured by the United States.</p>
<p>The concession to disappointed NATO applicants like Romania and Slovenia would be a firm pledge to keep the door open for a second round of enlargement, the official said.</p>
<p>NATO, formed nearly five decades ago as a bulwark against Soviet communism, was ready to open a new era in alliance history by accepting former foes from the now-defunct Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's meeting is the defining moment for NATO,&quot; alliance Secretary-General Javier Solana declared as he inaugurated the two-day summit at Madrid's Municipal Congress Centre. &quot;We will open the doors of this alliance to the first new members from central and eastern Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our alliance will emerge strong from Madrid and ready to assume all of the new tasks we have set ourselves,&quot; Solana said.</p>
<p>NATO leaders then moved behind closed doors to begin what was expected to be the most contentious alliance gathering in years.</p>
<p>After weeks of open bickering, U.S. President Bill Clinton was expected to come under fire from European allies incensed at his attempt to unilaterally impose his view that the first wave of new members should be limited to three nations.</p>
<p>NATO diplomats said the debate would give French President Jacques Chirac and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi a chance to vent irritation over what they see as American heavy-handedness. But it was nonetheless all but certain to yield a consensus in support of Clinton's position, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an emerging consensus on three in return for a statement on the 'open door' and strong support for firm language on that 'open door',&quot; the NATO official said.</p>
<p>&quot;The two are part of the same package and I am confident we will be getting there later today.&quot;</p>
<p>With Clinton likely to prevail in NATO's first eastward thrust, European allies were pressing hard for a commitment from the alliance on a timetable for taking in a second wave of post-communist countries.</p>
<p>The French government, which had led a European charge to have Romania and Slovenia included in the first round, wants a strong statement to give encouragement to future NATO aspirants.</p>
<p>But the Clinton administration, mindful of the opposition it will face when the Republican-led Congress begins debating NATO expansion, wants to avoid specific promises beyond pledging that the alliance will take in new members at some future date.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that the NATO doors should remain open,&quot; Clinton told reporters on Monday before attending a dinner with alliance leaders. &quot;We do not believe we should close the door to the aspirations of any democracy.&quot;</p>
<p>Senior NATO diplomats met late into the night to narrow differences over the wording of the expansion communique, but the final decision was to be made by the heads of government -- a rare event for the normally choreographed alliance summits.</p>
<p>&quot;There's only going to be three new members because the U.S. wants three and they'll get it,&quot; a Spanish NATO diplomat said.</p>
<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who had bitterly opposed NATO's expansion but admitted he was powerless to stop it, chose not to attend. His signing of a landmark Russia-NATO cooperation treaty in May paved the way for enlargement while giving Moscow a voice -- but not a veto -- in alliance affairs.</p>
<p>Invitations to even three ex-communist states would be the biggest expansion in NATO history. Only once, in 1952, was more than than one new country admitted at once, when Greece and Turkey joined.</p>
<p>It would be the first push into the former East Bloc by a Western defence organization that was created out of the ashes of World War Two to contain the spread of Soviet communism.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters after a meeting with a bipartisan congressional delegation in Madrid for the summit, Clinton said he faced a challenge at home to win support for NATO expansion.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a ways to go to convince the American people of the momentous importance of the decisions we are making here and the need for them to support it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Clinton has dug in his heels about limiting NATO's growth, saying Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were the only applicants ready politically, militarily and economically to join the 16-member alliance.</p>
<p>But on Monday he sought to soften the expected blow to shunned applicants Romania and Slovenia, saying he was &quot;very enthusiastic about the developments that have taken place&quot; in the two countries.</p>
