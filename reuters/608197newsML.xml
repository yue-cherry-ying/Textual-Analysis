<headline>First Data to sell two units for $200 mln.</headline>

<p>First Data Corp said Friday that it has agreed to sell two of its health units to Illinois-based HealthCare COMPARE Corp in a deal valued at about $200 million in cash.</p>
<p>The units to be sold under a definitive agreement are First Health Strategies, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, and First Health Services, based in Richmond, Va., First Data said.</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to close by July 1, subject to regulatory approval, it said.  </p>
<p>Healthcare COMPARE is a healthcare services provider currently engaged in acquisitions designed to extend its services nationwide.</p>
<p>The units being sold were acquired by First Data in its 1995 merger with Atlanta-based First Financial Management Corp.</p>
<p>The two companies provide independent health care administration services such as claims administration and related health care management services to the self-insured corporate and government markets.  </p>
<p>First Data said it will continue to operate two smaller health care operating units -- VIPS, based in Towson, Md., and EBPLife, based in Minneapolis, Minn.</p>
<p>Ric Duques,, First Data's chairman and chief executive officer, said that while the loss of First Health's earnings will be modestly dilutive, the sale, &quot;will positively impact First Data's ability to concentrate its efforts on its higher growth card processing and payment instruments businesses.&quot;</p>
<p>The loss on the transaction and the related impairment to the ongoing value of other First Data health care operations are expected to produce an after tax loss of approximately $200 million, he said.</p>
<p>In addition, the absence of earnings from First Health Strategies and First Health Services operations for the balance of 1997 will reduce First Data's 1997 operating earnings by about $0.02 per share, he said.</p>
<p>As a result, First Data now expects 1997 earnings per share --without considering the after tax loss on the transaction and the related impairment charge--to be approximately $1.58, he said.</p>
