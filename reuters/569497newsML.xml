<p>By Alan Elsner, U.S. Political Correspondent</p>
<p>The Republican National Committee said on Thursday it returned more than $100,000 in political contributions because it learned the money came from the Hong Kong parent company of a Florida-based subsidiary.</p>
<p>It was the first time the Republicans have been forced to return a foreign contribution. The Democratic Party has acknowledged receiving more than $3 million in questionable foreign funds last year and is in the process of returning it.</p>
<p>The Justice Department and two congressional committees are investigating campaign fund-raising practices in last year's campaigns.</p>
<p>A statement by RNC chairman Jim Nicholson said the money was returned on Wednesday as soon as it became clear the money had originated in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The contributions came from Young Brothers Development USA. Nicholson said the party had no reason to believe the money came from overseas when it accepted the donation.</p>
<p>&quot;We were not able to secure the facts from the company until (Wednesday) afternoon when a company officer reported by telephone that the source of the funds was not an American company...but a 'parent' company in Hong Kong,&quot; Nicholson said.</p>
<p>&quot;Upon learning those facts, we immediately returned the contributions before day's end,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The donations were made between 1991 and 1993 and totalled $102,400. In 1994, the same company also guaranteed a $2.2 million loan to a Republican Party think-tank, the National Policy Forum, established by Nicholson's predecessor as chairman, Haley Barbour.</p>
<p>The think-tank was set up as a non-profit issues advocacy organisation but was disbanded last year with its non-profit status still not approved by the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>Congressional sources said Young Brothers appeared to be a shell company whose sole U.S. asset was an apartment in Georgetown, an exclusive Washington neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party said in a statement the RNC needed to return another $2.1 million raised abroad.</p>
<p>Ohio Sen. John Glenn, the senior Democrat on the committee investigating campaign fund raising, said the development proved Democrats were not alone in receiving foreign money and bolstered his argument that the Republicans should also be investigated.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to look at all aspects of campaign finance ... wherever the trail may lead. It's a problem for both parties and we have to look at it on that basis,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tennessee Republican Fred Thompson, who chairs the Senate committee investigating fund raising, agreed to a Democratic request to issue six new subpoenas to groups suspected of illegally funnelling money to Republicans. They included Young Brothers Development and Ambrose Tung Young, father of the brothers who run the company.</p>
<p>Representative Henry Waxman of California, the senior Democrat on the House of Representatives committee investigating campaign finance abuses, said he and other Democrats welcomed the RNC action. But he added, &quot;What we are concerned about is that there may be more than that sum of money that they ought to be returning.&quot;</p>
<p>Waxman and 19 other Democrats asked Attorney General Janet Reno to expand the Justice Department's investigation into campaign fund raising to include the RNC.</p>
<p>But Nicholson said there was a big difference between the two parties. He said Democrats had sent fund-raisers overseas to collect foreign money in an orchestrated effort to &quot;solicit illegal contributions from foreign individuals and foreign sources.&quot;</p>
<p>The donation being returned by the Republicans was an isolated incident, he said.</p>
