<p>NSW SEEKING SUPPORT FROM OTHER STATES AT MEETING TODAY</p>
<p>The New South Wales Health Minister says he'll appeal to the other states at today's meeting of health ministers in Sydney to get money back he claims has been wrongly taken from the state.</p>
<p>The state health ministers are meeting with Federal Minister, Michael Wooldridge, to re-negotiate the Medicare agreement and discuss the crisis in private health insurance.</p>
<p>New South Wales claims the Federal Government has breached the Medicare agreement, by illegally penalising the state US$68 million for alleged cost-shifting by public hospitals.</p>
<p>Minister, Andrew Refshauge, wants support from the other states for a High Court challenge against the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>But Doctor Wooldridge says New South Wales does not have a legal leg to stand on in relation to the proposed court challenge, and has described the threat as futile and ridiculous.</p>

<p>GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES REFORMS TO SUPERANNUATION</p>
<p>The Federal Government's announced new reforms to give consumers greater control over their superannuation.</p>
<p>Assistant Treasurer Rod Kemp says by the year 2000 employees will be able to switch from one fund to another much more easily.</p>
<p>At the moment, employees are restricted in which funds they contribute to, even if the fund they're in is a low performer.</p>
<p>Mr Kemp says the reforms honour an election promise, and will ensure employees get the best return on their super benefits.</p>

<p>JANA CONSIDERING HER FUTURE AFTER SETTLEMENT WITH CHANNEL 7</p>
<p>Television current affairs presenter, Jana Wendt, says she has no idea where her career will lead after a very public falling out with Channel Seven.</p>
<p>Ms Wendt yesterday reached a A$1.2 million out-of-court settlement with Channel Seven, enabling her to terminate her contract with the Witness program.</p>
<p>Ms Wendt says she knew she was jeopardising her livelihood by going to the Commission, but she was not prepared to continue working for the program.</p>
<p>She says she made the monumental step of moving to Seven after 13 years with Channel Nine on the understanding that the program would be up-market and news-breaking.</p>
<p>But she says it's direction and style was allow to evaporate.</p>
<p>Ms Wendt says she'll take time out to consider what she'll do next.</p>

<p>FEE INCREASES FOR CRA-RTZ DIRECTORS CRITICISED BY UNION</p>
<p>The Miners Union says increases in fees for CRA-RTZ board directors make a mockery of the company's expectation that its workers bare the brunt of cost cutting.</p>
<p>Mick Watson, from the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union, says he raised the question at company's annual general board meeting in Melbourne, because the Reserve Bank has urged restraint on corporate salary increases.</p>
<p>He says at a time when CRA RTZ is looking to cut jobs at it's Mount Thorley and Hunter Valley mines, Chairman John Uhrig's fee to attend around four board meetings a year has been doubled to more than A$500,000.</p>
<p>Mr Watson also claims there was a A$1 million rise in the amount paid to Executive Chairman Robert Wilson, while Chief Executive Leon Davies gets an A$800,000 increase.</p>
