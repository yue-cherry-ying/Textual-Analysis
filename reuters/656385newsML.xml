<p>China's epic movie of the 19th century Opium War when Britain seized Hong Kong was branded an &quot;opium bore&quot; on Thursday by a leading film critic here.</p>
<p>&quot;The result seems more like a loud cannon blast that disappears into a cloud of smoke,&quot; Dennis Eng wrote in the Hong Kong Standard, a Chinese-owned English-language daily.</p>
<p>Eng also said &quot;The Opium War&quot;, a US$12 million blockbuster with a cast of 50,000 including 3,000 non-Chinese, was a &quot;one-sided drama&quot; and &quot;bogged down by too many subplots&quot;.</p>
<p>This was the first review to appear in Hong Kong media and a spokeswoman for distributors Panasia Films said :&quot;This is only one critic and the movie has not opened to the public yet so this is not a general verdict.&quot;</p>
<p>The film, which depicts Britain seizing Hong Kong from the Qing Dynasty's empire after winning a war over opium trade, will be released on Friday ahead of Hong Kong's return to China at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>Panasia launched the local premiere with twin screenings at the Hong Kong Convention Centre on Wednesday. It was first shown in Beijing.</p>
<p>Governor Chris Patten was not invited to the VIP events where his successor, future leader Tung Chee-hwa, the president of the incoming legislature Rita Fan and the deputy director of China's Hong Kong mission, Zhang Junsheng, mingled with some 1,000 guests.</p>
