<p>Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa has sparked a debate in Hong Kong on the fate of Taiwan's rival &quot;China&quot; flag, which has flown here with impunity for decades but now faces an uncertain future.</p>
<p>Newspapers on Saturday carried a spectrum of views on the flag, which has become highly sensitive since the territory joined China on July 1 after 156 years as a British colony .</p>
<p>China-backed Tung said on Thursday he was mulling whether to allow Taiwan's Nationalist &quot;Republic of China&quot; flag to be flown in the territory this year on October 10, Taiwan's national day.</p>
<p>In the past, the day known as the Double Tenth has been marked with flags hoisted prominently in the territory along the Nathan Road shopping street, in the Wanchai waterfront area and in villages across the territory.</p>
<p>The flag is blue with a white sun on a red patch, in stark contrast to Beijing's red flag with five golden stars and Hong Kong's new red flag with a white bauhinia tree blossom.</p>
<p>Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province that split when the Nationalists lost power to the communists on the mainland at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.</p>
<p>The Beijing government hotly opposes any notion of two Chinas and sees its &quot;one country two systems&quot; recovery of Hong Kong as a model for Taiwan's eventual return to the fold.</p>
<p>Taiwan's diplomatic partners have been forced to shut their consulates in Hong Kong since it became part of China.</p>
<p>Pro-Taiwan groups appeared divided about whether they should fly the flag. October 10 marks the Xinhai Revolution, the day in 1911 when the imperial Qing Dynasty was toppled and the Republic of China, ruled by Sun Yat Sen's Kuomintang Party, was founded.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people may just think the 1911 Revolution was a memorable event and have a tradition to celebrate it,&quot; said Dick Tse of the pro-Taiwan 123 Alliance, a Hong Kong political party.</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue to do what we have been doing. If we abandon our traditions before they are banned, it would be like fleeing before your enemies have fired,&quot; Tse said. He said his group might write to Tung urging him not to ban the flag.</p>
<p>Hoisting the Taiwan flag might be a breach of the new constitution, the Basic Law, said Hong Kong's second most senior government lawyer, Deputy Solicitor General Stephen Wong.</p>
<p>&quot;Since a flag is a symbol of sovereignty, raising it could be interpreted that you are advocating a sovereign state,&quot; Wong said. &quot;In that case it could be a violation of the Basic Law.&quot;</p>
<p>Byron Weng, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said it should be permissible to display the flag privately in offices or at home, but not in public places.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm waiting to see how the officials handle this during the Double 10th celebration. It will be a test this year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jimmy Lee, leader of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Union Council, a pro-Taiwan group organising October 10 celebrations, said the alternative could be to fly flags decorated with the plum blossom, a Chinese national floral emblem.</p>
<p>Taiwan's China Airlines adopted this emblem  recently.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a view that we should respect the first Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government and consider the sensitivity of flying the flag,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>He said raising the Taiwan flag could be interpreted as subversion under the Basic Law, which bans activities promoting the break-up of China, or the independence of China's constituent parts such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tibet.</p>
<p>&quot;There's one China, and splitting China is absolutely forbidden&quot; Tung said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The South China Morning Post called for an understanding between the government and Taiwan supporters on the flag to show that even explosive issues could be resolved quietly.</p>
<p>In the 1950s pro-China and pro-Taiwan trade union groups clashed violently in Hong Kong riots.</p>
<p>The Sing Tao Daily said it was unlikely the flag would survive here because both sides supported Hong Kong's return to China and believed only one flag should fly over Hong Kong.</p>
