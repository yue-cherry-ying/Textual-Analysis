<title>HONG KONG: HK mum on U.S. trade sanctions on mystery company.</title>
<headline>HK mum on U.S. trade sanctions on mystery company.</headline>

<p>Hong Kong authorities said on Friday they would punish companies violating laws on controlled items but refused to discuss U.S. sanctions slapped on a company alleged to have sold chemical weapons components to Iran.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Washington said Hong Kong company Cheong Yee Ltd, together with two Chinese companies and five Chinese individuals, had transferred chemicals and other technology to Iran contrary to a U.S. law on chemical weapons.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong company named in the sanctions remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Cheong Yee Ltd is not listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange and is not found in public telephone directories.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Customs and Excise Department, the agency that investigates the illegal import or export of controlled items, refused to say whether it had been in contact with the U.S. government or whether it was taking any action.</p>
<p>But a top customs official made clear Hong Kong's stance on the movement of controlled items.</p>
<p>&quot;Strategic commodities, including chemical weaponry, is under control. Import and export must be accompanied by valid approvals in the form of import and export licences,&quot; assistant commissioner David Tong told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;If they are exported from Hong Kong not accompanied by export licences, the exporter or people involved will be responsible for illegal exportation and in such a case...we will pursue the case, investigate and prosecute,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chinese companies Jiangsu Yongli Chemical Engineering and Technology Import/Export Corp and Nanjing Chemical Industries Group were also on the U.S. sanctions list.</p>
<p>Five Chinese citizens -- Liao Minglong, Tian Yi, Chen Qingchang, Pan Yongming and Shao Xingsheng -- were also named.</p>
<p>Washington says the parties transferred glass-lined chemical processing equipment and three dual-use chemicals -- thionyl chloride, diamethylamine and ethylene chlorohydrine -- to Iran.</p>
<p>The sanctions bar any trade between the United States and the listed parties for at least a year.</p>
<p>The sanctions marked the first time Chinese entities have been penalised under the U.S. Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, although sanctions have been imposed on people and companies in other countries.</p>
