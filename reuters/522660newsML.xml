<p>Former rebel Serbs in Eastern Slavonia, voting for the first time in six years in Croatian elections last weekend, won 11 out of 28 municipalities in the region, United Nations and Croatian officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Unofficial results indicated Croats, who voted in absentia, won control of the region's main town of Vukovar.</p>
<p>The once picturesque port on the Danube river became a symbol of Croatia's war for independence from former Yugoslavia when the Yugoslav army reduced it to rubble during a three-month siege before capturing it in November 1991.</p>
<p>The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) which rules nationally and an independent Croatian candidate, Tomislav Mercep, won 53 percent of the votes in the Vukovar municipality. The rest went to the Serb SDSS bloc.</p>
<p>Mercep, a hardline commander of the Vukovar defence in the war, was a member of HDZ until recently, and an all-Croat local coalition was likely.</p>
<p>In the town itself, the HDZ candidates won in four out of six districts, and the SDSS two.</p>
<p>Out of 14 municipalities in each of the two counties covering Eastern Slavonia, Serb candidates won in six municipalities in the Osijek-Baranja county and five in the Vukovar-Srijem county.</p>
<p>The remaining 17 municipalities went to the HDZ. Other Croatian parties won on average under one percent of votes.</p>
<p>The April 13-14 elections in Eastern Slavonia were plagued by technical irregularities on the first day but ran more smoothly on the second.</p>
<p>Publication of the result was delayed for three days because of a complex tabulating procedure, which caused mistakes in the process of adding up the votes, a U.N. source told Reuters on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The results as released are now in line with the ones of the government,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>The U.N. sources would not be drawn into how the votes will be translated into seats on the local councils, but according to an unofficial interpretation, Croats would have a 14-12 majority in the Vukovar city council.</p>
<p>But Borislav Stanimirovic, the leader of Eastern Slavonia Serbs, said on Saturday Croats would not be able to take over the power in the town before Croat refugees come back and resettle.</p>
<p>&quot;If Croats win in Vukovar, that will be a symbol of their national victory, but they will have a hard time taking over power until they move back there,&quot; Stanimirovic told the independent Belgrade Radio B-92 hours before the release.</p>
<p>Stanimirovic said Serbs would ask the head of the U.N. administration of Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES), U.S. diplomat Jacques Klein, to set up an interim rule in Vukovar and to extend the U.N. mandate after the July 15 deadline.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe U.N. will not pull out as planned. There are even serious indications that the UNTAES mandate is extended until January 1998 because of the non-democratic elections in Croatia and a series of problems in other parts of Croatia,&quot; Stanimirovic said.</p>
<p>Local Serbs have been guaranteed minority rights and were expected to form majority governments in some municipalities.</p>
<p>But ethnic hostility lingering from the war remains intense and some of the 120,000-odd Serbs in the region are expected to flee to Serbia instead of submit to renewed Croatian rule.</p>
<p>Croatian radio presented the results of vote in Eastern Slavonia on Saturday as a &quot;victory of the Croatian option&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We are satisfied with the election results,&quot; Ivica Vrkic, the government's representative for the region said.</p>
<p>&quot;It should not be forgotten that we are establishing the Croatian authority in the two counties, and there could be no more talk of a Serb district, or Serb municipalities, and even less so of Serb towns,&quot; Vrkic told Croatian state radio.</p>
<p>The elections coincided with voting for municipal and county assemblies and the Upper House of the parliament throughout the rest of Croatia.</p>
<p>President Franjo Tudjman's HDZ party regained control of the Upper House and almost all 21 county assemblies and most town councils but lost to or deadlocked with opposition coalitions in the more liberal big cities, including the capital Zagreb.</p>
