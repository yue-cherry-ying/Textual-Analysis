<p>India's United Front coalition on Saturday ran into difficulties in selecting a leader to head a new centre-left government as contenders stepped up their lobbying, officials said.</p>
<p>A senior official said the 15-party alliance might be unable to meet its own timetable for forming a government this weekend because of differences between its disparate parties.</p>
<p>The official, who asked not to be identified, said the United Front was struggling to agree on a leader to replace caretaker Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>Asked if a government would be formed by Sunday, he told Reuters: &quot;It will be rather difficult.&quot;</p>
<p>On Friday, United Front officials had said they were confident the alliance would select a new leader on Saturday and that a new government would be formed by Sunday.</p>
<p>But differences have emerged between supporters of southern regional leader G.K. Moopanar, caretaker Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh and other contenders from the populous northern Hindi belt, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is far from over,&quot; the senior United Front leader said. &quot;It is quite a sensitive phase.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if the coalition was still confident a new leader would be selected on Saturday, he said: &quot;I underestimated the difficulties.&quot;</p>
<p>The convenor of the United Front's decision-making Steering Committee, Chandrababu Naidu, held hectic discussions with Moopanar, Yadav and Jyoti Basu, leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying for a consensus,&quot; Naidu told reporters. &quot;When a consensus is reached, then everything will follow.&quot;</p>
<p>Naidu said he expected a core group of Steering Committee members to meet in the afternoon to discuss the leadership issue.</p>
<p>On Friday, the way appeared to have been cleared for the selection of a leader after the Congress party lifted a roadblock that had threatened to scuttle efforts to form a government without snap elections.</p>
<p>Congress, which had undercut Deve Gowda by withdrawing its make-or-break support for his coalition on March 30, sent a letter to President Shankar Dayal Sharma on Friday saying it would back a new United Front leader if it were not Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>Head of the Tamil Maanila Congress party in Tamil Nadu state, Moopanar has been a front-runner in the race to succeed Deve Gowda, whose 10-month-old government fell on April 11 in a parliamentary vote of confidence.</p>
<p>Moopanar quit Congress last year in protest against the party's alliance with a Tamil Nadu rival. He has the backing of southern parties that make up a large segment of the United Front's 178 votes in the 542-member lower house.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us hope the Steering Committee takes a right decision,&quot; Moopanar said on Saturday after meeting Naidu.</p>
<p>But he has been opposed by left-wing parties in the alliance because of his close ties to Congress, which the leftist bloc distrusts, and to Sonia Gandhi, the influential widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.</p>
<p>Emerging as a strong rival to Moopanar was Mulayam Singh Yadav, the strong-willed former chief minister of the populous northern state of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>Yadav's backers said he would be able to lead the fight against the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the increasingly likely event the next government fails to survive until the end of parliament's term in 2001.</p>
