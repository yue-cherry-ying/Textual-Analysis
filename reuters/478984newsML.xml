<p>The China re-insurance market is booming for foreign insurance firms despite deep central bank concerns over the loss of foreign exchange as risk is onsold abroad, industry experts said.</p>
<p>They said the market for re-insurance of infrastructure and large commercial projects was growing fast in spite of tough restrictions on the activities of foreign insurance firms.</p>
<p>One insurer put the growth rate at 30-40 percent per year, while another estimated it was rising by 20 percent annually.</p>
<p>The Chinese insurance firms, which are required by law to take the lead in insuring all foreign-funded projects, are on-selling much of the risk to foreign insurers, thereby exporting the premiums.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is developing very fast, and sometimes insurers can't cover all the risk so they must re-insure part (of it) on the international market,&quot; said a manager with an insurance broker in Shanghai.</p>
<p>He estimated that perhaps 20-30 percent of total foreign exchange insurance premiums were leaving China, a number which is continuing to grow.</p>
<p>&quot;More and more re-insurance is being sold outside China, which is alarming the People's Bank of China (PBOC),&quot; said a European insurance firm analyst. &quot;They see hard-earned foreign exchange leaving the country, and they want it to stay here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The PBOC is not happy to see this, but many of the clients, especially U.S.-based clients, want U.S. insurance companies to cover their risk,&quot; said another insurance manager.</p>
<p>This boom is occurring even though only four insurance companies currently have licences to write insurance policies directly in China.</p>
<p>They are American International Assurance Co Ltd, which is part of American International Group; Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co Ltd; Winterthur Swiss Insurance Co and a Hong Kong unit of Manufacturers Life Insurance Co of Canada, which has a joint venture life insurance operation.</p>
<p>The European analyst said the Chinese insurers were selling risk on to foreign insurers for a variety of reasons, including a desire to keep local competitors at arm's length from their best customers.</p>
<p>There is also significant pressure from the foreign companies investing in major projects in China to have their insurance onsold to foreign companies, the manager of another foreign insurance operation in Shanghai said.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally most companies want to have the risk linked back to their global cover,&quot; the manager said.</p>
<p>&quot;They want the security of international insurers backing them,&quot; said the first insurer. &quot;They feel if there's a major problem, they can go to international insurers and can get a claim paid.&quot;</p>
<p>He said there had been one or two cases where claims had not been settled by Chinese insurance companies in a manner which satisfied the investors. He declined to give details, saying it was a matter of great sensitivity.</p>
<p>The bulk of investment dollars coming into China need to be insured, and actual foreign investment last year has been estimated at $48 billion, up seven percent over 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth is terrific,&quot; said the insurance broker.</p>
<p>&quot;For instance, General Motors has just announced a $1.5 billion (automobile production) project and has another 14 or 16 joint ventures in China. All this investment must be insured,&quot; he said.</p>
