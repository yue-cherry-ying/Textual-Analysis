<p>Three young people were found shot to death early Monday in a grisly scene at a fashionable Starbucks coffee shop in Washington's luxury Georgetown area, police said.</p>
<p>Two men aged 18 and 25 and a 24-year-old woman, all with multiple gunshot wounds to the head, were discovered shortly after 5:15 a.m. EDT by an employee arriving for work.</p>
<p>Police shut down busy Wisconsin Avenue, a major traffic artery into downtown Washington and home to exclusive art galleries and upmarket stores, while they investigated the triple homicide.</p>
<p>Sgt. Joe Gentile of the D.C. Metropolitan police, said the three victims were employees of Starbucks, a nationwide coffee shop chain. The store had closed at 8 p.m. Sunday but it was not immediately known when the three died.</p>
<p>Gentile said there were no suspects or possible motives at this time, although local television reported that police had developed the name of a possible suspect.</p>
<p>Starbucks spokesman Dean Torrenga told reporters late Monday the chain had never seen such violence in 26 years of operation.</p>
<p>&quot;In our 26-year history at Starbucks we have never experienced any kind of crime like this,&quot; Torrenga said. &quot;We have over 1,200 locations throughout the world...this is the first time it has ever happened and it has touched our lives deeply.&quot;</p>
<p>The victims were identified by police as Emory Allen Evans, 25, Aaron David Goodrich, 18, a high school student, and Mary Mahoney, 24, the store's assistant manager.</p>
<p>Local television reported that no money appeared to be missing from the store and said all the doors were locked when the employee who discovered the bodies arrived before dawn.</p>
<p>Each of the victims was shot in the head at least once, according to WRC-TV.</p>
<p>The murders came a day after Washington's Mayor Marion Barry declared the streets of the nation's capital were the safest in the United States.</p>
