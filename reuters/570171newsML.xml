<title>USA: NY precious metals seen opening slightly higher.</title>

<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures were seen opening slightly higher Thursday, in line with a firmer bullion market overnight, but the Ascension Day holiday in continental Europe may slow trade, analysts said.</p>
<p>A sharp fall in the U.S. dollar against most major currencies overnight on talk of Japanese intervention against the dollar, was helping support gold prices, traders said.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the fall in gold prices in the past year to four year lows has been the steady rise in the U.S. dollar, making gold more expensive in many currencies, analysts said.  </p>
<p>But the overnight gold price in Japanese yen fell to around 42,322 yen an ounce, its lowest level since February.</p>
<p>COMEX June gold was seen opening up 50 cents to $1.00 an ounce from Wednesday's close at $342.40, after trading a $342.40-344.00 range in overnight ACCESS trade.</p>
<p>COMEX gold stocks were unchanged at 910,877 ounces Wednesday.</p>
<p>Spot gold was quoted $342.00/50 early, compared to the London Thursday morning fix at $341.10 and the New York close Wednesday around $341.00/50.</p>
<p>COMEX July silver was seen opening unchanged to up 0.5 cent from the previous close at $4.758, after trading a $4.760-4.780 range in ACCESS.</p>
<p>COMEX silver stocks rose 411,675 ounces to 192,586,423 ounces Wednesday.</p>
<p>NYMEX July platinum was seen opening up 50 cents to $1.00 an ounce from the previous close at $372.90 an ounce, while NYMEX June palladium was called to open unchanged to up 50 cents from $155.00 at Wednesday's close.</p>
