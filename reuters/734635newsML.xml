<p>Police and FBI agents hunted on Tuesday for an alleged serial killer and male prostitute they suspect murdered world-renowned fashion designer Gianni Versace on the steps of his Miami Beach mansion.</p>
<p>Miami Beach Police Chief Richard Barreto told a news conference that Andrew Cunanan, 27, was their only suspect in the slaying, which stunned the fashion world.</p>
<p>&quot;Cunanan is known to be a male prostitute who services a broad clientele,&quot; Barreto said, adding he did not know if he had any relationship with Versace, who was homosexual.</p>
<p>Versace, 50, died on Tuesday morning after being shot twice in the back of the head at the gates of his mansion in the tourist mecca of Miami Beach. The Italian fashion king was strolling home after buying magazines at a cafe he frequented.</p>
<p>The killer ran away, leaving Versace's body slumped in a pool of blood on the steps of the Mediterranean-style mansion on Ocean Drive.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a number of articles of evidence that tie Mr. Cunanan to that crime,&quot; Barreto said. &quot;He is the only suspect at this time.&quot;</p>
<p>Cunanan is suspected of four murders, including that of his former male lover during a two-week, cross-country killing spree that began in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Barreto said a red truck found by police in Miami after Versace's killing belonged to his last alleged victim, a New Jersey cemetery caretaker shot to death on May 10.</p>
<p>Cunanan, who is on the FBI's list of 10 most wanted criminals, was at large and &quot;armed and dangerous,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>FBI special agent Paul Philip said at the same briefing that many agents were involved in a nationwide manhunt for him. Cunanan had been sighted a few weeks ago in West Palm Beach, north of Miami, so they were aware he was in the area.</p>
<p>Philip said it was not certain that Cunanan knew his victims before he allegedly killed them.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears that on occasion he frequents places where gay folks hang out,&quot; he said, adding he had no idea if Cunanan knew Versace. &quot;Nobody's safe in this. Everybody's at risk. Everybody's got to help us put this guy in jail.&quot;</p>
<p>South Beach has one of the United State's most active gay scenes and Versace was also openly gay.</p>
<p>&quot;That was common knowledge, though I don't think he went around saying it,&quot; a writer at Miami's Fashion Spectrum magazine told Reuters. Versace had a longtime male companion, she said.</p>
<p>Police and witnesses said Versace, 50, was shot twice at point-blank range in the back of the head execution-style. There was apparently no robbery attempt involved.</p>
<p>Philip Villaneuva, the neurosurgeon who treated him at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital, said there were two entry wounds to the back of the skull and one bullet stayed within the skull.</p>
<p>&quot;Either one would have been fatal. There was one exit wound next to his nose on the right side.&quot;</p>
<p>The white-haired Versace was returning to his home from the nearby News Cafe on the glamorous Ocean Drive strip, a beachfront street of brightly painted art deco hotels and trendy restaurants frequented by models.</p>
<p>Miami Beach, a narrow finger of land off the Florida mainland, is the centre of Miami's swinging fashion and music industry. It has its own police force and city administration.</p>
<p>Eddie Bianchi, 50, a shopowner, told Reuters he was nearby when the shooting occurred.</p>
<p>&quot;We heard two shots. I saw people running. Gianni was on the stairs. He was shot twice in the head. We were trying to help Gianni on the floor, but we realised it was too late.&quot;</p>
<p>A senior manager at the News Cafe said Versace was his usual gracious self when he walked to the shop to buy magazines on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;There was nothing to detect any difference,&quot; Ryan Yorke told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;He would hang out, relax, chill out, watch the parade on Ocean Drive. He didn't come here for business. He was always very gentle, unassuming, gracious, very private. We are all in a state of shock. The mood here is very sombre.&quot;</p>
<p>Globe-trotting Versace, who dressed some of the world's most beautiful women, was not a permanent resident of Miami Beach but frequently stayed at the white stone mansion, the only private residence on Ocean Drive.</p>
<p>The slaying recalled for many the murder of another Italian fashion czar, Maurizio Gucci, in Milan in 1995. His former wife and two alleged hit men were among five people charged in that killing in February this year.</p>
<p>The FBI had distributed about 2,000 wanted posters portraying Cunanan in Florida in recent weeks but had sightings of him from around the country.</p>
