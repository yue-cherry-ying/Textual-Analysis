<p>Doctors said Monday that one of two hospitalized members of the Detroit Red Wings hockey team injured in a June 13 limousine crash has emerged from a coma.</p>
<p>Team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov remains in serious condition, breathing with the help of a ventilator, in the intensive care unit at William Beaumont Hospital in suburban Detroit, hospital officials said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;His level of wakefulness and responsiveness has improved to the point that we consider him to be conscious,&quot; said neurosurgeon Dr. Karol Zakalik, who has been treating Mnatsakanov and defenceman Vladimir Konstantinov.</p>
<p>Zakalik said Mnatsakanov is consistently making purposeful movements, such as squeezing, shaking and holding the hands of family members. He is also beginning to communicate by attempting to write numbers and his name in Russian.</p>
<p>Konstantinov continues to breath on his own and show gradual signs of progress toward regaining consciousness. He also remains in intensive care.</p>
<p>&quot;Although these signs of improvement are encouraging, it's important to remember that this will be a very long recovery process for both patients,&quot; said Dr. James Robbins, the hospital's trauma surgeon.</p>
<p>Both men suffered severe head injuries when the limousine they were riding in crashed into a tree in the Detroit suburb of Birmingham. Konstantinov, Mnatsakanov and defenceman Slava Fetisov were returning from a team golf outing.</p>
<p>Police suspect the driver of the limousine, who was hospitalized for a few days and then released, fell asleep while driving. The crash came six days after the Red Wings won their first Stanley Cup in 42 years.</p>
