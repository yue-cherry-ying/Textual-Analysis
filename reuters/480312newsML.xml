<headline>Australian dollar makes a late resistance break.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Australian dollar was making a late move through resistance levels that had been capping it over the past week, after earlier having spent most of the day trading in a US$0.7850/60 range.</p>
<p>Resistance at US$0.7860 had capped the unit for the past week, but the dollar made two forays above there today, with the afternoon peak of US$0.7875 its highest level in a week.</p>
<p>At 4.30 p.m. (0630 GMT), the Australian dollar stood at US$0.7872/77 from an opening US$0.7856/61 and a close last Thursday of US$0.7858/63. Australian markets had been closed on Friday and Monday for the Easter holidays.  </p>
<p>Traders had expected the unit would test higher after downside tests last week had started to find higher supports, but the market lacked impetus for most of the day.</p>
<p>With US$0.7860 now the support marker, the unit still has some resistance to get through before challenging the US$0.7910 level, traders said.</p>
<p>Strong Japanese buying related to the start of the new financial year and possible demand for samurai issues never really materialised, although there was some buying from overseas that helped the dollar post its late afternoon gains.  </p>
<p>In trade weighted terms, the dollar improved to 60.5 from an opening 60.4, finishing level with its close of last week.</p>
<p>Against the yen, it finished at 97.26/36 yen from an opening 97.23/33 and a previous close of 97.30/40.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar weakened in Tokyo on comments from U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich that the U.S. dollar/yen rate was worrying in view of Japan's trade surplus.</p>
<p>His comments dented the dollar, and came ahead of a meeting this Friday between U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka.  </p>
<p>There was also talk in Tokyo markets that Rubin may reverse the &quot;strong dollar is in the U.S. interest&quot; stance if the U.S. did not receive trade concessions ahead of the meeting, which had also weighed on the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>There is little on the local calendar until Thursday's February trade data, so attention will focus offshore. First up is the U.S. NAPM index later today, and the Bank of Japan tankan survey of business sentiment will be released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A strong NAPM index, especially if followed up by a strong U.S. payrolls number on Friday, would raise market expectations of further U.S. rate hikes to follow last week's move.  </p>
<p>Signs of improving Japanese sentiment may also raise some expectations of higher rates there, analysts said.</p>
<p>Higher rates offshore is seen as a negative for the Australian dollar because it narrows the interest differential advantage Australian dollar assets enjoy. However, in the longer term higher rates are a sign of stronger growth, and therefore commodity prices, which should be a positive for the local unit.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board held its monthly meeting today, but no change in policy is expected to follow.</p>
<p>Ahead of the meeting, analysts saw rates as steady, before eventually rising later this year or in the first half of 1998.  </p>
<p>No news was received on the union movement's 'living wage' claim, about which a decision has been expected for some time.</p>
<p>The claim asks for three A$20 a week pay increases over the next three years for workers who have failed to negotiate an enterprise bargaining agreement (EBA), and an 8.75 percent increase in minimum award pay rates this year.</p>
<p>The RBA has warned such an outcome would threaten low inflation, but economists expect an outcome where workers who have no EBA would receive a A$12 a week rise, which they said was consistent with the RBA's inflation target.</p>
