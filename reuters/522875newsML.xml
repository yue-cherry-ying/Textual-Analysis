<p>India's United Front coalition struggled on Saturday to select a leader to head a new centre-left government as contenders eyeing possible mid-term elections jockeyed for advantage.</p>
<p>The 15-party alliance, which lost power in a parliamentary vote of confidence on April 11, said it was confident a new leader would emerge on Saturday to succeed caretaker Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and form a government by Monday.</p>
<p>The alliance's decision-making Steering Committee was expected to meet later on Saturday to try to select a chief and end a three-week political crisis.</p>
<p>But the meeting, already put off by a day, would depend on the outcome of a hectic round of discussions between the panel's convenor, Chandrababu Naidu, and leaders of the United Front's disparate parties, politicians said.</p>
<p>Asked when the new leader would be announced, Naidu said on Saturday: &quot;It will be announced later at an appropriate time.&quot;</p>
<p>The way was cleared for the selection of a leader after the Congress party on Friday lifted a roadblock that had threatened to scuttle efforts to form a government without snap elections.</p>
<p>Congress, which had undercut Deve Gowda by withdrawing its make-or-break support for his coalition on March 30, sent a letter to President Shankar Dayal Sharma on Friday saying it would back a new United Front leader if it were not Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>Naidu met caretaker Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and G.K. Moopanar, head of a regional party from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, separately on Saturday.</p>
<p>Moopanar quit Congress last year in protest against the party's controversial alliance with a Tamil Nadu rival.</p>
<p>Head of the Tamil Maanila Congress party, Moopanar has been among the front-runners to succeed Deve Gowda as he has the backing of southern parties that make up a large segment of the United Front's 178 votes in the 542-member lower house.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us hope the Steering Committee takes a right decision,&quot; Moopanar said on Saturday after meeting Naidu.</p>
<p>But he has been opposed by left-wing parties in the alliance because of his close ties to Congress, which the leftist bloc distrusts, and to Sonia Gandhi, widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.</p>
<p>Emerging as a strong rival to Moopanar was Mulayam Singh Yadav, the strong-willed former chief minister of the populous northern state of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>Yadav's backers said he would be able to lead the fight against the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the increasinlgy likely event the next government failed to survive until the end of parliament's term in 2001.</p>
<p>The BJP has its base in the northern Hindi belt, including Uttar Pradesh, which sends 85 deputies to the lower house of the parliament and is considered India's choicest political prize.</p>
<p>The BJP is the biggest single party in the lower house, the Lok Sabha, with 162 deputies. With its allies it controls 193 votes, compared to Congress's 140.</p>
<p>The BJP is weaker in Moopanar's south, where Congress is the chief rival for parties in the United Front.</p>
<p>But Yadav, who heads the regional Samajwadi Party, was opposed by some members of the United Front who were backing other northern candidates, including Bihar state chief minister Laloo Prasad Yadav and Railway Minister Ram Vilas Paswan.</p>
<p>Lurking in the background was caretaker Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, who supporters said could emerge as a consensus choice as he had no strong political enemies and was respected.</p>
