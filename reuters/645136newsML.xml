<p>Chicago White Sox slugger Albert Belle was fined $5,000 on Friday for making an obscene gesture to the fans in Cleveland following Tuesday's 9-5 victory over the Indians.</p>
<p>Belle, fined and suspended numerous times in the past while playing with the Indians, was making his first appearance in Cleveland after signing a five-year, $55 million free agent deal with the White Sox.</p>
<p>Belle was booed throughout the game, which had to be halted twice to clean debris thrown at him in left field. After the Indians were retired in the ninth, Belle turned back to the fans in left and made his obscene gesture.</p>
<p>&quot;An obscene gesture to our fans -- no matter what the provocation -- is simply not acceptable behaviour from a major league player,&quot; said American League president Dr. Gene Budig, who ordered Belle to purchase $5,000 worth of White Sox tickets and distribute them to disadvantaged youth in Chicago.</p>
<p>Belle played his first eight seasons with Cleveland and led the majors with an aggregate 98 homers and 274 RBI over the last two years. He is hitting .279 this season with 13 homers and 59 RBI in 56 games with the White Sox.</p>
