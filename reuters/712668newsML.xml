<p>France launched a campaign to boost its meagre exports to South Africa on Tuesday with a display of new technology and a pitch by Foreign Trade Minister Jacques Dondoux for French know-how in roads, ports and tourism.</p>
<p>Opening the France Technologies '97 exhibition at Midrand north of Johannesburg, Dondoux said he chose South Africa as his first foreign destination since his Socialist party came to power because France was under-represented in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;With 145 exhibitors...it is the largest technological fair ever organised by one country on South African soil. This is not pure chance. (It) reflects French aspirations in South Africa and the whole of southern Africa. Our companies have now understood the importance of South Africa,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dondoux was due to hold talks on Wednesday with South African Trade Minister Alec Erwin, Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo, Water and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal and Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus. He was also due to meet the Southern African Development Community (SADC) executive secretary Kaire Mbuende and French business leaders here.</p>
<p>Since 1994, France has become the fourth most important western investor in South Africa, but still lags behind its western competitors in sales, Dondoux said in a speech made available before delivery.</p>
<p>&quot;France, fourth economic world power, is still under-represented in this region of the world...the efforts we still have to make are enormous,&quot; Dondoux said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our companies supply under four percent of South African imports, an inadequate percentage compared to the results achieved by our main European partners.&quot;</p>
<p>French visitors were displaying technologies in the services sector, aeronautics, information, health, energy, transport, food and tourism.</p>
<p>Dondoux said South Africa's private-public partnership strategy offered special opportunities for cooperation in &quot;one of France's areas of excellence -- the management of urban services, harbour, airport and road infrastructures, the service industry and the tourism sector&quot;.</p>
<p>The vast majority of companies exhibiting were small to medium size concerns with no established foothold in South Africa -- additional proof of the attractiveness of the South African market, Dondoux said.</p>
