<p>Any capital gains tax cut enacted this year would affect profits on sales of stocks and other assets as of May 7, the chairmen of the congressional tax-writing committees said Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We intend to propose that the effective date for any capital gains tax cut included in the budget reconciliation bill will be with respect to sales and exchanges occurring on or after today,&quot; according to a joint statement from House Ways and Means Committee chairman Bill Archer of Texas and Senate Finance Committee chairman William Roth of Delaware.</p>
<p>A capital gains tax cut is expected to be part of a tax package this year and was included in a broad outline of a budget agreement reached Friday between congressional leaders and the White House.</p>
<p>Specific details of any tax package have yet to be worked out and the process could take months. Last week's agreement called for $135 billion in gross tax cuts over five years, offset by $50 billion in revenue raiser, for a net tax cut of $85 billion.</p>
<p>Currently, the maximum capital gains tax rate is 28 percent, and analysts have predicted it could be reduced to 19.8 percent to 21 percent.</p>
<p>Republicans have said a tax cut on profits made on investments is one of their priorities. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican, said tax legislation must include &quot;something dramatic&quot; in capital gains tax relief such as a reduction in the top rate to 20 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Interested parties should be advised that no specific provisions have been agreed upon and will only be finalized at the end of the legislative process,&quot; the joint statement from the tax-writing committee chairmen said.</p>
<p>One tax expert said it would be wise for investors to keep in mind that a capital gains tax cut, while likely, was not a done deal.</p>
<p>&quot;My own advice to clients would be to wait and see how the legislation progresses through the House, the Senate, and I think over time we will get a much clearer idea,&quot; Peter Merrill, national director for tax policy economics at Price Waterhouse LLP, said.</p>
<p>&quot;It would not be wise merely to sell today solely because you want to get the benefit of the lower rate, you ought to certainly wait until later in the year until it becomes clearer whether that rate reduction will occur,&quot; Merrill said.</p>
<p>Another tax expert said while there were no absolute guarantees for a capital gains tax cut, based on the budget agreement such a reduction was likely for individual investors.</p>
<p>&quot;They should go ahead and make their sale, and if there is a cut they will get the benefit of it,&quot; Randall Weiss, director of tax economics at Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, said.</p>
<p>While a capital gains tax cut may prompt some investors who had previously held back from selling to do so, it would also increase the value of stocks, Weiss said.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that taxes will be lower on future sales has got to increase the value of stock, and make stock generally more attractive especially stock where the return comes more in the form of capital gains than dividends,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Weiss also said much of the stock market is held by investors who do not care about variations of tax rates such as pension funds and some mutual funds, and they may see market declines as a buying opportunity.</p>
<p>&quot;Those sorts of professional investors might well take advantage of any dip that might be caused by individual holders who would rush out and sell,&quot; he said.</p>
