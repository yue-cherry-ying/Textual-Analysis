<p>COMEX copper ended firmer in choppy trading, largely pushed higher for the second consecutive session by strong gains in the other base metals, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;In London on LME funds were buying zinc, aluminum and nickel, and that ultimately spilled over into copper,&quot; Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential Securities said.</p>
<p>The recent trend of stock hikes on LME continued, but the increases were smaller and therefore more constructive for the market, Raptopoulos added.</p>
<p>LME stocks rose 950 tonnes Thursday to 152,925 tonnes.</p>
<p>COMEX July copper settled 1.00 cent firmer at 111.45 cents per pound, traded 112.50 to 110.00 cents. Spot May COMEX went out 1.05 cents higher at 112.15 cents. Volume was estimated at 10,000 lots.</p>
<p>The LME backwardation ended at $58/$62, barely changed from Wednesday.</p>
<p>COMEX stocks on Thursday fell 1,210 short tons to 43,772 short tons.</p>
<p>Union leaders at strike-hit Quebrada Blanca copper mine in Chile said they hoped that talks would begin Thursday with management to resolve the week-long strike over pay at the pit.</p>
<p>But management at the mine said no further negotiations were planned, and that a final pay offer had been made.</p>
