<p>J&amp;L Structural Inc, a division of CPT Holdings Inc, said Tuesday it had offered to acquire Steel of West Virginia Inc for $9 a share.</p>
<p>J&amp;L, a producer of lighweight structural steel products, said its formal written proposal was originally made February 11 but Steel of West Virginia had refused to meet with it to discuss the offer.</p>
<p>J&amp;L said that it has received &quot;no constructive response&quot; from the company since that time but instead took actions aimed at entrenching its board and management.  </p>
<p>It said it learned from Steel of West Virginia's latest proxy materials filed with federal regulators that the company plans to issue common and preferred shares, among other things, without disclosing to shareholders that there is a specific offer to acquire the company.</p>
<p>J&amp;L said if Steel of West Virginia proceeds with its plans it will consider all options, including initiating a tender offer for all of the company's shares.</p>
