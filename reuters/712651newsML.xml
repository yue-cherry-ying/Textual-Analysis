<p>Amnesty International said on Tuesday it was appalled at violence by Kenyan police as they broke up pro-reform rallies across the East African country on Monday.</p>
<p>In a statement, the London-based human rights group called for constitutional reforms before parliamentary and presidential elections this year and added that holding elections before reforms would be meaningless.</p>
<p>&quot;Excessive violence was clearly used in an attempt to intimidate pro-democracy activists from holding further rallies,&quot; Amnesty International said.</p>
<p>&quot;The authorities should set up a prompt and initial investigation into the events, ensure those responsible for using excessive force are brought to justice, and that the security forces follow international guidelines when dealing with such rallies,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Kenyan police on Tuesday apologised for storming Nairobi's main Anglican All Saints Cathedral where they teargassed and beat up worshippers. They said the incident would be investigated.</p>
<p>Nine people were killed on Monday during the most violent clashes between police and protesters in Kenya. Opposition activists said they had reports that as many as 12 people were killed on Monday.</p>
<p>The ferocity with which police, wielding clubs, on Monday beat anyone they could get their hands on shocked even longtime foreign residents of Kenya and Britain, which voiced concern.</p>
<p>Amnesty said both sides of Kenya's political divide agreed on the need for constitutional reforms but timing was crucial.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless both sides agree to meet and find a way to resolve the situation, the violence and lack of respect for human rights will increase and more lives will be lost,&quot; Amnesty added.</p>
<p>The Kenya Human Rights Commission reported that two of its officials and another man were detained by police in the coastal resort of Mombasa on Monday and their whereabouts were still unknown. The three had not been charged, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Efforts to trace them in all police stations in Mombasa have been fruitless,&quot; the Commission said in a statement.</p>
