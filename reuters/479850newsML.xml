<headline>INSIGHT - Gilts bearish while under 108-26.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>June gilts are in danger of slipping to test their contract low of 107-19, as long as they are stuck below 108-26 resistance, technical analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But any break above this level would see a fairly strong rebound towards 110-01.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as we're below 108-26, the bottom of a recent consolidation area, we're looking for a return to the contract low of 107-19 reached on January 7,&quot; said Howard Friend, senior technical analyst at MCM YieldWatch here.</p>
<p>By 0723 GMT, the June gilt was down 17/32 at 108-14.  </p>
<p>Friend said that on the upside, the first real resistance kicked in around 109-21, an area of recent congestion.</p>
<p>&quot;But if we get above 108-26 we would likely see a stronger rebound to a small congestion area above 110-00 -- around 110-01 to 110-16,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>David Wood, independent technical analyst near London, agreed 108-26 was a key level.</p>
<p>&quot;The data on gilts is rather sketchy, but when it broke 108-26 in automated trade on Thursday, that set up a target of 108-11,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Then there is a hole to 107-29/27,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>On the upside, Wood said the 108-26 to 109-00 area would be the main initial barrier.</p>
<p>&quot;If we get through 109-06 we'll focus on the upside as that will be a decent base, but that looks unrealistic at the moment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>By 0741 GMT, June short sterling was down three basis points at 93.30.</p>
<p>Analysts at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said in a note that a retreat through the 93.29 range lows was favoured this week to 93.24/23 -- trendline support from November 14 and 50 percent retracement of the mid-November to early March rally.  </p>
