<title>GERMANY: German shares rattled by Wall Street plunge.</title>
<headline>German shares rattled by Wall Street plunge.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Wall Street's renewed tumble over Easter sparked losses of more than four percent on the blue chip DAX index in early dealings, raising the spectre of a 1987 style sell-off in the minds of Frankfurt traders.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a crash in the 1987 sense of the word, although nominally it's about as bad,&quot; said a Frankfurt trader.</p>
<p>&quot;People are certainly going to be offloading, and fast. We will have to see over the next few days whether this is a real change in trend,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The DAX index was down 138.76 points, or 4.1 percent, at 3,290.29 points at 1008 GMT, holding above what dealers said was a key psychological support level at 3,280 points.</p>
<p>While German share trading closed down on Monday for the Easter break, the Dow Jones tumbled 157 points, bringing its losses over two days to 4.3 percent amid mounting worries about more interest rate increases to come.</p>
<p>Key economic data from the U.S., including the National Purchasing Managers Survey at 1500 GMT today and labour market data on Friday, will give a clearer picture on whether market angst over future interest rate rises is justified or not, dealers noted.</p>
<p>German shares tumbled across the board.</p>
<p>The only exception was Victoria Holding, which was up 11 percent at 625 marks in bourse trade, after a bourse newslatter named the insurance company as a possible takeover candidate.</p>
<p>However turnover in the stock was limited, with just 2,250 shares changing hands in early trade.</p>
