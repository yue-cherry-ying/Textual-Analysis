<headline>IPE gas oil closes lower, Brent off in jumpy trade.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE gas oil closed lower on Friday in an uneventful session as brokers squared positions ahead of the long holiday weekend in Britain.</p>
<p>June gas oil settled $1.25 lower at $177.75 a tonne, while July Brent was 14 cents off at $20.04 a barrel at 1701 GMT.</p>
<p>Brokers said gas oil had been pressured lower by profit-taking and squaring ahead of the long weekend as well as losses on the NYMEX heating oil contract.</p>
<p>They said Brent futures had been pushed further into negative territory by losses on NYMEX crude futures.</p>
<p>Both markets were seen jumpy with the expiry of product options on NYMEX making trading volatile.</p>
<p>Many traders said, however, the fact the July Brent contract was clinging to the $20 level was an encouraging sign.</p>
<p>&quot;This market is well supported. It dipped below $20 but quickly bounced back,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just tracking the WTI (NYMEX crude),&quot; said another broker.</p>
<p>Both the IPE and NYMEX are closed on Monday due to the Memorial Day holiday in the United States and the Spring Bank holiday in Britain.</p>
