<p>A witness in the Oklahoma City bombing trial, who previously told of seeing one man leave a truck outside the federal building minutes before the blast, changed her story on Friday and said she saw two men.</p>
<p>Lawyers for defendant Timothy McVeigh hoped that Daina Bradley would bolster their theory that unidentifed people carried out the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building that killed 168 people.</p>
<p>Bradley, 21, who lost two children and her mother in the explosion as well as one of her legs, has a history of mental illness.</p>
<p>For two years, Bradley, who was visiting the Social Security offices on the first floor of the building, had said she saw one man leaving the Ryder rental truck that allegedly carried the bomb minutes before the blast.</p>
<p>She said he was olive-skinned and resembled &quot;John Doe No. 2&quot;, a suspect authorities searched for after the blast but never found. He was definitely not McVeigh.</p>
<p>But she changed her story on Friday, saying she had also seen a second man get out of the truck parked outside the Murrah building that day.</p>
<p>&quot;I seen two men get out the truck,&quot; she told the court, adding that both men walked quickly away.</p>
<p>A nervous, clearly upset Bradley admitted that the first time she had told anybody about a second man was at a meeting last week with defence attorney Cheryl Ramsey.</p>
<p>She said she told Ramsey last week that the second man, who she described only as a white man, was not McVeigh.</p>
<p>But within seconds the woman admitted on the witness stand that she had later told prosecutors she was not certain if the second man was McVeigh or not. She said she had not got a good look at him.</p>
<p>Under cross-examination by prosecutors, Bradley said she had been in mental health institutions from the age of seven until she was 16 and had been given &quot;lots&quot; of medication that caused her &quot;to lose memory of who I was and (of) people around me.&quot;</p>
<p>Both prosecution and defence lawyers seemed taken aback by Bradley's shifting position and it was unclear which side her testimony helped.</p>
<p>Prosecutors maintain that the 29-year-old McVeigh, a decorated Gulf War veteran, bombed the Murrah building. The defence alleges unidentified people were involved and that the real bomber could have died in the blast. If convicted McVeigh, who has pleaded not guilty, could face the death penalty.</p>
<p>Bradley was subpoenaed to testify as a defence witness.</p>
<p>On Friday, the defence tried to poke holes in the reliability of eyewitnesses linking McVeigh to the rental of the Ryder truck.</p>
<p>The prosecution says Robert Kling, who rented the truck from Elliott's Body Shop in Junction City, Kansas two days before the bombing, was really McVeigh.</p>
<p>The defence called to the stand Todd Bunting, whose friend Michael Hertig rented a Ryder truck from Elliott's a day after the bomb truck was rented.</p>
<p>The defence is trying to show that the Elliott witnesses could have confused the two rental transactions.</p>
<p>Bunting bears a strong resemblance to the sketch of &quot;John Doe No. 2&quot; circulated by the authorities after the blast.</p>
<p>Bunting joked that when he heard that a $2 million reward was being offered for the bombing suspects, he said: &quot;Well shoot if that was me, I'd turn myself in.&quot;</p>
<p>FBI agent John Hersley testified that Eldon Elliott, owner of the rental agency, was not shown photographs of possible suspects by the FBI until more than a month after the bombing when he singled out McVeigh. Hersley said Elliott told him he had already seen McVeigh's picture on television by then.</p>
<p>Elliott, called earlier in the trial as a prosecution witness, identified McVeigh in court as the man who rented the Ryder truck.</p>
<p>The defence called Gary Wells, a professor of psychology at Iowa State University, to testify on the reliability of eyewitness identification.</p>
<p>Wells, an expert in the field, said that if a suspect's picture was shown on television it was possible for a witness's memory to come from television rather than what he or she had originally seen.</p>
