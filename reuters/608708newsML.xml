<p>Hungarian shares eased 0.1 percent this week but still led major East European exchanges as the Polish bourse was weighed down by the coming public offering of Bank Handlowy and Czech stocks were stung by a currency crisis.</p>
<p>The Slovenian and Slovak bourses gained, Croatia was mixed and Romania fell.</p>
<p>The Central European Share Index (CESI), which measures price movements in 72 Hungarian, Polish, Czech, Slovak and Slovenian stocks, fell more than two percent.</p>
<p>WARSAW</p>
<p>Polish shares fell 1.2 percent over the week and analysts said the market would probably maintain a slight downtrend during the public offering of Bank Handlowy.</p>
<p>The bank, whose public offering starts next week and is seen worth a total of about $1 billion, is due to announce the price bracket for the offering late on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot will depend on the pricing of Bank Handlowy. The pricing of that issue should...allow an appraisal of currently listed banks,&quot; said Ryszard Wojnowski, an analyst at Polish Investment Bank (PBI) brokerage.</p>
<p>Analysts said Poland's good macroeconomic environment, reflected by the finance minister's Wednesday statement that year-on-year inflation could fall below 13 percent in December from 15.3 percent in April, would prevent steep falls.</p>
<p>BUDAPEST</p>
<p>A successful IPO with a pricing close to the market price in pharmaceuticals company Richter Gedeon Rt revived the Budapest Stock Exchange on Friday, giving a strong push to the BUX index before the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;Richter's pricing and its developments (its four and half times oversubscription) drove the market out of its falling trend,&quot; said Robert Forgo of MKB Securities.</p>
<p>On Friday the BUX index regained virtually all of the week's losses to close at 5,873.59 points.</p>
<p>The second phase of Richter's selloff followed another transaction earlier this month in which a total of 19 percent in oil company MOL Rt was sold amid heavy demand both domestically and abroad.</p>
<p>PRAGUE</p>
<p>Czech shares fell sharply throughout the week, with dealers saying trading was overshadowed by the crisis in the foreign exchange markets where the crown faced repeated attacks from speculative investors pushing for a devaluation.</p>
<p>Although major issues staged a slight recovery on Thursday and Friday, dealers said buying was driven almost entirely domestically with foreigners focusing attention on the crown.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreign clients are waiting to see if there will be a devaluation of the crown,&quot; said Ivan Kusacek of Zivnostenska Banka.</p>
<p>The Czech central bank successfully fought off crown speculation on Thursday and Friday by taking a series of measures ranging from direct intervention to banning access to the last resort lending rate, the Lombard.</p>
<p>BRATISLAVA</p>
<p>Turmoil on the Slovak money and forex market overshadowed activities on the Bratislava bourse this week and further weakened the already low liquidity on the Slovak stock market.</p>
<p>Although the official 16-share SAX index firmed 0.18 points this week to close at 195.52 on Friday, traders said the bourse continued trading at very low volumes which hardly reflected the real market situation.</p>
<p>Traders said they did not expect equity trading to increase in coming days, saying players would be waiting for the result of money market crises in both Slovakia and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>LJUBLJANA</p>
<p>Slovenian shares rose 1.55 percent this week with the SBI index firming 20.18 points to 1,318.47.</p>
<p>Traders said future movements on the market would largely depend on the ratification of the EU association accord, which was signed in June last year.</p>
<p>Last week the Slovenian parliament postponed a vote on whether to ratify the agreement to allow political parties one more week to reach a broader agreement on the issue.</p>
<p>Traders said the ratification could push the blue-chip index up 30 percent over the next two to three months as foreign investors would resume buying.</p>
<p>&quot;If the treaty is not ratified the index could slide to its December level of about 1,150 points,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>ZAGREB</p>
<p>Istrian hotelier Riviera on Friday outperformed a directionless Croatian stock market which ended the week mixed, and analysts said shares would continue to drift sideways next week.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that the stock exchange will remain in the doldrums though there are one or two buying opportunities where prices have bottomed out,&quot; said Auctor's  Michael Glazer.</p>
<p>Blue chip Zagrebacka Banka rose 50 kuna from last week to end at 2,050 kuna while fully-listed Pliva mostly held its ground, closing the week only 0.5 percent lower.</p>
<p>BUCHAREST</p>
<p>Bucharest stocks traded mixed early in the week, only to take a tumble on Thursday and extend losses on Friday as investors stuck to their wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>Two independent indices, the VAB and the BIG, slipped by 6.5 and 3.51 percent from the previous session to 865.3 and 852.53 points respectively.</p>
