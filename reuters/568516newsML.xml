<p>Harnischfeger Industries Inc said Thursday it will continue its $19 a share tender offer for Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc after Giddings said its board of directors rejected the offer.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are disappointed that the board of directors of (Giddings), which has failed to build shareholder value for several years, again cannot recognize the value that Harnischfeger's all-cash offer provides to shareholders,&quot; Harnischfeger chief executive Jeffery Grade said in a statement. &quot;This underscores our decision to take our full-priced, premium, all-cash offer directly to (Giddings) shareholders and at the same time, to seek removal of the (Giddings) board.&quot;  </p>
<p>Earlier Thursday, Giddings said its board of directors unanimously rejected the offer as inadequate and said it has had preliminary discussions with others about a possible transaction.</p>
<p>Harnischfeger has demanded a special meeting of all Giddings shareholders and removal of impediments to its offer and will begin soliciting shareholder consents for the meeting as soon as clearance is received from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Approval is expected from the SEC in the next few days, Harnischfeger said.</p>
<p>The purpose of the special meeting is to permit shareholders to vote on measures that will allow the Harnischfeger offer and any other legitimate offers to be considered by all Giddings shareholders, Harnischfeger said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our bid offers real value and we will pursue it with dispatch,&quot; Grade said.</p>
<p>Harnischfeger shares were down 5/8 at 41-1/4 Thursday and Giddings was up 1/4 at 20-3/4.</p>
