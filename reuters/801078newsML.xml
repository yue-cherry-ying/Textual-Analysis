<title>JAPAN: ASIAN TRADERS SEE LME ALUMINIUM TESTING SUPPORT.</title>
<headline>ASIAN TRADERS SEE LME ALUMINIUM TESTING SUPPORT.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-08-14</dateline>

<p>Aluminium prices are likely to probe downside support at $1,680 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange (LME) in the near-term, but that level is likely to hold, Japanese traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;During Asian hours, moderate technically driven buying was detected. Aluminium prices may test $1680, but I have a feeling that the downside would be solid partly on physical buying interest,&quot; a trader at a major trading house said.</p>
<p>Traders said that the market is still in a technical correction phase after prices became overextended on the upside.</p>
<p>Traders were also watching whether the increase in LME aluminium stocks in recent days suggests a change in inventory trends.</p>
<p>One trader said some metal might have been attracted to warehouses by the backwardation, which, although softer on Wednesday on the LME, could blow out next week when August dates are traded.</p>
<p>At 0632 GMT, benchmark three-month aluminium was quoted at $1,697/$1,701 a tonne, marginally up from $1,696 at London's afternoon kerb close on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Copper prices were expected to drift within recent ranges for the near-term amid the summer lull.</p>
<p>At 0610 GMT, copper prices were quoted at $2,285/2,289 a tonne, unchanged from levels at 1800 GMT in London on Wednesday.</p>
