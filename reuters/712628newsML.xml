<p>Groupe Sommer Allibert said on Tuesday that it planned to sue Armstrong World Industries Inc in a U.S. court in the &quot;next few days&quot; for allegedly violating confidentiality agreements between the two rival companies.</p>
<p>Sommer Chief Executive Marc Assa told reporters the lawsuit would be filed in Pennsylvania. Assa said Sommer filed a similar action in a Quebec court on Monday in which it accused Armstrong of abuse of process and defamation.</p>
<p>The lawsuits are the latest in a volley of court actions between Armstrong and the French plastics processor.  </p>
<p>On Monday, Armstrong said it filed a motion in federal court in Philadelphia seeking an injunction to block the proposed merger between Sommer and Tarkett AG of Germany.</p>
<p>In the suit, Armstrong said it was seeking to stop the deal based on alleged breach of a confidentiality agreement and other understandings between it and Sommer.</p>
<p>The lawsuits are related to Armstrong's C$23 a share bid for Domco Inc, a floor covering maker based in Farnham, Quebec and 69.2 percent-owned by Sommer. Assa repeated at the news conference that Sommer had no plans to counter Armstrong's bid with an offer to take Domco private.  </p>
<p>Assa also said he respected the power of Domco's board to make a recommendation, if any, to Domco's shareholders on whether to accept or reject Armstrong's offer. Domco has until August 8 to make a recommendation.</p>
<p>Assa said he was confident of the decision Domco would take. Sommer has two seats on Domco's nine-member board.</p>
<p>Assa said he was also confident that the securities commissions in Ontario and Quebec would determine that Sommer's proposed merger with Tarkett would not constitute an indirect takeover of Domco because majority ownership of the Canadian company would not change.</p>
<p>Under the merger, Tarkett would pay $414 million cash for Sommer's floor covering business, which includes Domco, while Sommer would obtain 60 percent of Tarkett.</p>
<p>Michel Cognet, Sommer director-general, said the merger with Tarkett was expected to be concluded between September and November. Tarkett is 65 percent-owend by investment funds affiliated with Doughty Hanson and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners.</p>
<p>Sommer President Jean Milliotte said that after the merger, Sommer would study the combination of Tarkett and Domco to reduce costs and improve product cross-selling. But plant closings in the combined company's North American floor covering business were not expected, he said.</p>
