<p>Romania's over-the-counter (OTC) market tracked sideways on Thursday as some of the heawyweights lost further steam, operators said.</p>
<p>Independent indices VAB-RASDAQ rose by 0.1 percent to 3,995.65 points, while BIG-OTC drifted down by 0.35 percent respectively from the previous session to 3,147.67 points.</p>
<p>Traders said they seen the price of high-cap listings falling next week, followed by a period of stabilisation.</p>
<p>&quot;Cement makers and oil refineries again closed weaker, but the falls were not so big as on Wednesday and we expect a stabilisation in coming sessions,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>He added that some of the small caps posted gains but investors remained focused on heavyweights. The rise in the VAB index was linked to its inclusion of all listings.</p>
<p>Cement maker Moldocim, one of the main losers on Wednesday, closed 3,000 lei down at 37,000. Casial, another cement maker, slipped 300 lei to close at 2,100.</p>
<p>A third cement industry listing, Romcim, one of the few gainers at the previous session, inched down 1,000 lei to close at 62,000. Oil refinery Arpechim, which lost the most ground at Wednesday's session, droped a further 4,000 lei to 30,000.</p>
