<p>Southern Baptist leaders urged their followers Tuesday to approve a boycott of Walt Disney Co. theme parks and stores because of what they termed &quot;gay-friendly&quot; policies.</p>
<p>The nation's largest Protestant denomination warned last June it was giving Disney a year to change its policies and programming, but the group's leaders told thousands of members on the first day of an annual meeting in Dallas that their objections were being ignored.</p>
<p>&quot;When major entities ... question whether we are a people of our word, whether we really mean what we say and whether we are willing to sacrifice the enjoyment of their products, there is still ground to be gained, there are still battles to be fought,&quot; Southern Baptist Convention president Tom Elliff said in pushing for a selective boycott against Disney.</p>
<p>The issue was to be debated and put to a vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Southern Baptist Convention, which has 15.7 million members, has been angered by &quot;Gay Days&quot; at Disney theme parks, the extention of health benefits to partners of gay employees and the recent episode of &quot;Ellen&quot; on Disney-owned ABC television in which the sitcom character played by Ellen DeGeneres revealed that she was a lesbian.</p>
<p>Disney officials declined to comment on the impact of any boycott but said it remains a leader in family entertainment.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very proud that Disney creates more family entertainment of every kind than anyone else in the world, and we plan to increase that production,&quot; spokesman Ken Green said.</p>
<p>But conservative Southern Baptist leaders said Disney had done nothing to convince them of that.</p>
<p>&quot;The only response we have seen is the further promotion of the homosexual lifestyle,&quot; Rev. Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptists' Christian Life Commission, said.</p>
<p>About 15,000 Southern Baptist &quot;messengers&quot; were expected to attend the three-day meeting in Dallas. Other issues slated for debate included late-term abortions, cloning and a proposal that local churches be allowed to ordain women.</p>
<p>The convention is dominated by conservatives.</p>
<p>&quot;Southern Baptists were espousing traditional family-values long before the term was popular,&quot; Elliff said. &quot;We affirm God's plan for the family is one man for one woman as long as they shall live. We believe homosexuality is a perverted twisting of God's plan.&quot;</p>
