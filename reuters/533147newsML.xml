<p>An exhibition of priceless treasures from Russia's imperial past that were stranded in a truck outside a museum for six days because of a legal wrangle were moved to the Russian Embassy on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But no decision had been reached on the ultimate fate of the collection, including the Romanov czars' crown jewels which remained in the museum's vault.</p>
<p>The collection, including art works, costumes and some of the world's biggest gems, was due to be shown in several U.S. cities thoughout this year, starting with a successful show at Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art that has just ended.</p>
<p>But Russia now says it wants the treasures back for Moscow's 850th birthday celebration in May, according to the Corcoran.</p>
<p>The American organisers of the exhibition had refused to deliver them to the Russian Embassy, citing a contract with the Russian government.</p>
<p>&quot;Our agreement to release the truck is a good faith effort on the part of the Russian Embassy and the American-Russian Cultural Cooperation Foundation,&quot; the group's chairman James Symington said in a statement.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the foundation, which raised $550,000 to mount the exhibition, said no decision had been reached on the final disposition of the jewels.</p>
<p>Corcoran Gallery president and director David Levy has locked away the Romanov gems in a vault and is sitting tight until he gets a court order or a written agreement about where they go next.</p>
<p>The moving van hired to take the exhibition to Houston for the next stop on a planned tour, had been parked on a side street near the gallery since last Wednesday, blocked in round-the-clock with cars manned by drivers from the Russian Embassy.</p>
<p>The exhibition, &quot;Jewels of the Romanovs: Treasures of the Imperial Court&quot; drew over 80,000 visitors during its stay at the Corcoran.</p>
<p>Symington attributed the standoff to a dispute over revenue, not to Moscow's need for the jewels back home.</p>
<p>He said the deal with Russia's Culture ministry was to split revenues after expenses were paid, but said Russian officials were now telling him that that arrangement was not acceptable. &quot;It doesn't satisfy them,&quot; Symington said Monday.</p>
<p>But John Millian, a lawyer retained by the Russian Embassy, denied that profits were the motive.</p>
<p>The State Department said a Russian official was on his way to Washington in an attempt to end the standoff.</p>
