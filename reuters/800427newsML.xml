<headline>Turk parliament debates secularist education bill.</headline>

<p>Turkey's parliament on Thursday took up debate of an education reform bill at the heart of a bitter dispute between the secular establishment and the former ruling Islamists.</p>
<p>The deputy speaker convened at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT) a special assembly session expected to extend throughout the day as MPs from across the political spectrum discuss a draft law which has already had a bumpy ride through the commission stages.</p>
<p>The planning and budget commission approved the bill on Tuesday after nine days of stormy negotiations which repeatedly broke down in angry exchanges between MPs from the Islamist Welfare Party and government deputies.</p>
<p>Islamists have taken to the streets to protest against the bill which they see as a direct threat to religious education.</p>
<p>Compulsory state schooling would be extended to eight years from five under the draft law, effectively bringing an end to the primary section of Islamic schools, known as Imam Hatips.</p>
<p>The education plan was a key element of military demands for a crackdown on rising religious activism under the Islamist-led government of former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan.</p>
<p>The secularist pressure helped edge Erbakan out of office in June and led to the appointment of a right-left government under Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.</p>
<p>The parliament session, expected to be addressed by over 100 MPs, was set to continue until midnight (2100 GMT) and resume on Friday if necessary before going to a vote. The assembly's summer recess, already delayed to deal with the bill, was to begin after the process was completed.</p>
<p>The commission has given its approval to plans for consumers to contribute to the school reforms, forecast to cost 1,000 trillion lira ($613 million) over the next three years.</p>
<p>($1 = 163,100 Turkish lira)</p>
