<p>Romania's Gabriela Szabo clinched the world women's 5,000 metres title on Saturday with a shrewd tactical race.</p>
<p>Szabo, who won a 1,500 metres silver at last year's Atlanta Olympics, tucked herself into the slipstream of the leaders for most of the race before choosing her moment to hit the front with 200 metres remaining.</p>
<p>Portugal's world record holder Fernanda Ribeiro could not respond as the Romanian produced another burst down the home straight to win in 14 minutes 57.68 seconds and add an outdoor gold medal to the world indoor titles she has won over 3,000 metres.</p>
<p>Italian Roberta Brunet also sprinted past Ribeiro down the home straight to snatch second in 14:58.29 with the Portuguese runner taking the bronze medal in 14:58.85. Britain's Paula Radcliffe, who had led just before the bell, finished fourth.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not plan it. Every race has different tactics,&quot; she said. &quot;Today is a very important day for me and for Romania.&quot;</p>
<p>Kenyan Lydia Cheromei set the pace in the early stages before Radcliffe took over with three laps remaining. Ribeiro then made her move to the front just after the bell but Szabo looked fresh down the back straight behind her.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old Romanian then sped away from the rest of the field at the start of the final bend.</p>
<p>Brunet's silver medal was a major achievement after a succession on injuries over the past year.</p>
<p>&quot;A month ago I didn't think I could make it here,&quot; the Italian said. &quot;But once I got here I thought I could get a medal. I am dedicating this to all people who suffer.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to dedicate it to the handicapped too. We had races (for the disabled) here yesterday. They are the real champions.&quot;</p>
