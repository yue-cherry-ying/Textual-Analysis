<p>Young Bulgarians in the run-down village of Jivkovo hope Saturday's parliamentary elections will propel reforms to help them start private businesses and end poverty and joblessness.</p>
<p>&quot;I dream of setting up a family farm, but I have no cash. The only possible sponsors now are the local mafiosos who will not let me run the farm properly,&quot; 30-year-old Kiril Penov told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There is lots of money in farming if managed properly. I know how,&quot; said Penov, who has a university degree in animal breeding but now works as a bus dispatcher.</p>
<p>A tiny village on the plains 50 km (30 miles) south of Sofia, Jivkovo has a population of 600. As in most of the country's rural communities, most of the residents are old and the local economy stagnant.</p>
<p>&quot;If we could be certain that we would not be racketeered and there was a functioning bank lending at affordable rates, we would start the business immediately,&quot; said Penov's wife Maria.</p>
<p>Curbing organised crime and corruption are the priorities of the Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), the favourites to win the election race.</p>
<p>The UDF hopes to capitalise on the support it won from month-long protests which toppled the former Socialist government in February, and the main question is how big their parliamentary majority will be.</p>
<p>An interim cabinet led by Sofia's UDF mayor Stefan Sofianski has run the country since February, sealing a deal with the International Monetary Fund and kicking off the reform process the new government must continue.</p>
<p>The interior minister has launched a high-profile campaign against organised crime, which has soared unchecked since the end of communist rule, helped by an inadequate legal system.</p>
<p>The only consolation for those in the impoverished countryside is that for some in the cities, things are even worse.</p>
<p>&quot;If it was not for my dozen sheep and the vegetables I grow, our son and daughter in the city would starve,&quot; said Tsvetana Milcheva, who formerly worked at nearby factory.</p>
<p>Many urban families rely on relatives in the countryside for cheap food supplies.</p>
<p>Wages have been drastically eroded by a shattering economic crisis. The lev equivalent of $100 at end-1995 now is worth a mere $30 -- about the average state monthly salary, yet hardly enough to pay electricity and heating bills.</p>
<p>Delayed reforms and corruption have led to the closures of a chain of banks and a drastic slump in the lev currency.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything is enormously expensive, bus and train tickets. Half of my pension goes for a visit to the doctor and the rest on medicines,&quot; said Stoyanka Ilkova, a retired worker from a nearby factory.</p>
<p>But gloom is beginning to disperse for Sasho Neikov, who works in the nearby Ihtiman smelting plant, which was recently bought out by its 800 workers.</p>
<p>&quot;We have clients in Italy and Germany, we have had some difficulties. We have kept the average wage at around $80 and hope to do better,&quot; said Neikov.</p>
<p>Communist ideas have not been abandoned by everyone. Jivkovo's 96-year-old blacksmith Ivan Nachev said he would back the tiny Bulgarian Communist Party.</p>
<p>&quot;My father was a communist. I was a communist since early childhood and I will remain one,&quot; said the sprightly Nachev.</p>
<p>After the collapse of one-party rule in 1989, most former communists resurfaced in the Bulgarian Socialist Party, which won a clear majority in the 1994 general election.</p>
<p>The communists, who still use the hammer and sickle symbol, are expected to poll well below the four percent threshold needed to enter parliament.</p>
