<p>Shares on the Amman stock exchange fell at the start of weekly trade on Saturday despite continued demand for a handful of blue-chip stocks, brokers said.</p>
<p>A sharp decline in shares of Jordan Kuwait Bank helped nudge the official 60-share Amman Financial Market (AFM) index down 0.07 percent to 160.82 points in busy turnover of 1.3 million dinars ($1.8 milion).</p>
<p>Jordan Kuwait Bank stock fell by the five percent daily maximum to 3.97 dinars, wiping out all of Wednesday's gain.</p>
<p>Active trade in the bank shares, linked to a possible merger or takeover by Bank of Jordan, have pushed the share price up and down in recent weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's fall may be a tactical move by some shareholders to discourage others from selling their stock,&quot; said broker Ibrahim Odeh.</p>
<p>Blue-chip gainers included Arab Bank, which rose one dinar to 258 dinars in Saturday's busiest trade worth 531,000, though brokers said most of that was in a single bloc transaction of shares.</p>
<p>Other stocks in demand included Jordan Cement Factories and Jordan Phosphate Mines, which gained slightly on a mixture of foreign and local buying, Odeh said.</p>
<p>But the general trend was downwards, with 22 shares falling and only 10 rising and another 12 trading but closing unchanged.</p>
<p>The private Pearl Index of the 45 best-performing shares in terms of turnover and financial performance shed 0.40 percent to 81.45 points, 2.30 percent down from the start of the year.</p>
<p>$1 = 0.709 dinars</p>
