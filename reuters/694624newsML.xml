<p>State Bank of India, the country's largest commercial bank, said on Saturday it has decided to cut its prime lending rate and added further cuts could be in the offing if loan advances did not pick up.</p>
<p>&quot;If credit offtake does not pick up I would say that chances (of another cut) cannot be ruled out,&quot; said P.K. Bhattacharjee, deputy managing director and chief financial officer of State Bank of India (SBI) told a news conference.</p>
<p>SBI announced a cut in its prime lending rate to 13.5 percent from 14 percent effective July 1.</p>
<p>The reduction followed a cut on Wednesday in the key bank rate to 10 percent from 11 percent by the Reserve Bank of India, and SBI is the first major state-run bank to react to the central bank's move.</p>
<p>Bhattacharjee said SBI's credit growth in the first three months of fiscal 1997/98 (April-March) was insignificant.</p>
<p>&quot;We're just flat,&quot; he said. &quot;Slight decline is also there (in some sectors).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Unless the economy performs well ...the growth potentials, the growth possibilities are becoming inconspicuous,&quot; Bhattacharjee said.</p>
<p>India's industrial growth fell to 6.7 percent in 1996/97 (April-March) from 11.6 percent a year ago, government figures released on Friday.</p>
<p>Severe electricity shortages was one reason for slack industrial activity and poor demand for funds, he said.</p>
<p>He said the bank had infrastructure proposals worth 300 billion rupees to 400 billion, but these needed to be appraised and SBI will not be funding the ventures on its own.</p>
