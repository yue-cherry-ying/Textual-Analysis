<p>The number of Americans lining up to collect first-time unemployment benefits held steady last week but still hovered at its second highest level of the year, the Labor Department said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The department said 347,000 Americans filed for new jobless benefits in the week ended May 3. That figure was unchanged from the previous week.</p>
<p>The only time claims were higher this year was in the week ended Jan. 4, when they stood at 365,000.</p>
<p>Wall Street economists had forecast initial claims of 334,000 for the latest week.</p>
<p>The four-week moving average, viewed as more reliable gauge of jobless trends because it smooths out weekly fluctuations in the data, rose to 336,250 from 330,500 the week before.</p>
<p>The four-week moving average in the week ended May 3 was at its highest level since the week ended Jan. 25, when it reached 339,750.</p>
<p>The total number of Americans continuing to collect jobless benefits rose by 66,000 to 2.3 million in the week ended April 26, the latest period for which that data were available.</p>
<p>The department said eight states reported increases in claims exceeding 1,000 on an unadjusted basis in the week ended April 26, the latest period for which that data were available.</p>
<p>Among the largest were North Dakota with an increase of 6,729 initial jobless claims, Massachusetts with 3,707, New Jersey with 2,303, Louisiana with 2,216 and Texas with 2,071.</p>
<p>In North Dakota, almost all claims were reported to be flood related. Massachusetts reported layoffs in the service industry, while New Jersey said it had layoffs in the trade and service industries.</p>
<p>Louisiana reported layoffs in the transportation equipment industry, while Texas had layoffs in the oil and gas, non-electrical machinery, trade and service industries.</p>
<p>The department said three states and one territory reported decreases in claims exceeding 1,000, unadjusted, in the April 26 week.</p>
<p>They were California with 2,202 fewer jobless claims, Missouri with 1,836, Puerto Rico with 1,737 and North Carolina with 1,159.</p>
<p>Missouri reported fewer layoffs in the transportation industry. The other states and Puerto Rico provided no explanation.</p>
