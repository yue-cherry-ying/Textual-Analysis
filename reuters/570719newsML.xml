<p>Blue-chip shares at India's National Stock Exchange (NSE) firmed on Thursday helped by tax breaks and hopes of economic revival, brokers said.</p>
<p>The National Stock Exchange 50-stock index ended 10.30 points, or one percent, higher at a provisional close of 1054.70.</p>
<p>News that Sonia Gandhi has decided to join the Congress party, which came as trading ended for the day, would perk up the market, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;This will give a boost when the markets open tomorrow,&quot; Rasesh Maniar, dealer at brokerage Mukesh Babu Securities said.</p>
<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange was closed for a local holiday.</p>
<p>Banking stocks led the surge.</p>
<p>Bank of Baroda rose 7.0 rupees to 84.50, Bank of India 6.7 to 73.50, Federal Bank 6.2 to 95.15 and SBI to 4.55 to 310.</p>
<p>&quot;Financial firms will be the first ones to gain from an economic turnaround,&quot; said Ketan Jhaveri, chief dealer at Kotak Securities.</p>
<p>The easier norms brought interest rates down and analysts foresaw better profit margins as the business picks up.</p>
<p>&quot;They are the most representative of the economy,&quot; said Ashith Kampani, head of dealing at JM Share &amp; Stock Brokers.</p>
<p>&quot;The focus is clearly shifting to the larger market -- refinery stocks and shares of multinational stocks.&quot;</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Wednesday proposed to exclude software exports profits from a mininum tax, giving that sector a boost.</p>
<p>NIIT rose 3.95 rupees to 374.25, Infosys 36.6 to 1,463.10, Satyam Computers 3.65 to 74.15 and Tata Unisys 16.05 to 601.05.</p>
<p>Software stocks have been market outperformers in recent months with many brokerage firms giving &quot;buy&quot; recommendations on the companies forecasting strong performance.</p>
<p>Car maker Hindustan Motors said its net profit fell to 393.2 million rupees in the year ended March 31, 1997 from 510.4 million a year ago, due a contract drivers strike which hit production.</p>
<p>Auto components maker Sundram Fasteners said its net profit rose to 320.5 million rupees in the year ended March 31, 1997 from 303.75 million a year earlier.</p>
