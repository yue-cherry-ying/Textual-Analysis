<p>Pakistan on Wednesday unveiled plans to narrow its trade gap to $2.33 billion in fiscal 1997/98 (July-June) from $3.37 billion in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar, announcing the policy for 1997/98 after approval by the cabinet, said exports were to grow 15 percent to $9.575 billion from the year-earlier's $8.26 billion and imports to $11.9 billion from $11.63 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Export-led growth is the cornerstone of this government's economic strategy,&quot; he said in a televised speech.</p>
<p>&quot;Larger and high value-added exports will not only help improve the balance of payments but will also provide employment opportunities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;To lay the foundations of a robust outward-oriented economy, it is now imperative to reverse the anti-export bias in the economic structure evolved over the last 50 years.&quot;</p>
<p>He said there would be adequate export finance for small- and medium-sized exporters through commercial banks at lower rates.</p>
<p>Dar said 50 percent of the duty drawback to exporters would now be paid within three days of the presentation of documents and the balance after verification of customs authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;Machinery (not manufactured locally) imported by engineering units for export-related production (will) be subject to a zero rate of tariff up to 200 percent of the export value during the preceding financial year...</p>
<p>&quot;This facility would be available on an annual basis up to 30th June, 2000,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Local assemblers and manufacturers of vehicles had been allowed duty-free imports of assembly kits, corresponding to the number of their exported units, Dar said.</p>
<p>&quot;There would be no sales tax on imported raw materials, components required for manufacturing goods to be supplied against international tenders,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Dar said exporters would also be allowed to import, duty free, textile designs, artwork and transparencies up to 0.5 percent of the value of exports.</p>
<p>He also announced duty-free import of raw sugar for further exports after refining. &quot;This would save foreign exchange, utilise idle capacity of sugar mills and result in value addition,&quot; Dar added.</p>
<p>Pakistan would open up the import of gold and silver, which was now allowed for only three companies, he said. &quot;However, foreign exchange for such imports will be privately arranged by the importer as per existing practice.&quot;</p>
<p>He said most measures would be effective in a month, hoping the export of non-traditional items would register an increase of $500 million in 1997/98 and the traditional exports based on cotton and textiles to bring an additional $815 million.</p>
