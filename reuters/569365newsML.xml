<p>The Taiwan central bank's announcement on Thursday that it would keep monetary policy unchanged was in line with market expectations and was the only way the bank could appease polar market forces, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Raising interest rates would have jeopardised Taiwan's slow economic recovery while lowering them would have risked overheating the stock market, analysts said.</p>
<p>Central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong said after a board meeting that the bank would not change its longstanding position on interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank will keep its stable-to-loose, but not too loose, monetary policy,&quot; Sheu told a news conference.</p>
<p>Sheu also said the central bank had no plans to interfere in the foreign exchange market to prop up the ailing Taiwan dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank will respect market forces and let the market's supply and demand determine the rate of the Taiwan dollar,&quot; Sheu said.</p>
<p>Analysts had said that Taiwan's trade deficit in April meant the central bank would allow the Taiwan dollar to continue its downtrend in an effort to fuel the island's export-driven economy.</p>
<p>The trade deficit of US$203.5 million in April marked the first time that Taiwan had seen a single-month deficit since June of 1995.</p>
<p>Allen Huang, analyst for National Securities, said the central bank's move was not a surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;The market knew that the central bank was not going to announce any changes, because any change would upset current market balance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank wants to let the economy keep on recovering, but it also does not want to see the stock market overise,&quot; Huang said.</p>
<p>Taiwan's volatile stock market has roared ahead through most of 1997 in what securities brokers termed a &quot;liquidity-driven rally&quot;. But the index tumbled in late April on widespread fears that many share prices had become overvalued.</p>
<p>The government has forecast that Taiwan's gross domestic product would grow a higher-than-expected 6.6 percent in the first quarter, which would lift the economy out of its 1996 slump in which the GDP rose only 5.71 percent.</p>
<p>But analysts have said economic growth alone would still not justify the stock market's rally.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank wants to see the stock market grow in line with the economy, not faster or slower,&quot; said Lin Long-hsien, analyst for United Securities.</p>
<p>Sheu, championing the bank's balancing act, said the current money policy would be able to &quot;guide financial stability and economic growth&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank will fully provide funds for normal economic activities and it will continue to mildly mop up liquidity if banking system's liquidity becomes too loose,&quot; he said.</p>
