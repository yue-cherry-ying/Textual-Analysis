<title>SPAIN: Spain opens bid for stake in Telefonica's TISA.</title>
<headline>Spain opens bid for stake in Telefonica's TISA.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-06-06</dateline>

<p>Spanish state holding company SEPPA said on Friday that it had opened a bid for the state's remaining 23.8 percent stake in telephone service provider TISA, the international unit of Telefonica.</p>
<p>Spanish telecoms operator Telefonica de Espana, the majority shareholder in TISA, will not take part in the bid, but will have the right to acquire the stake by equalling the best offer, SEPPA said in a statement.  </p>
<p>&quot;Given its condition as majority shareholder in TISA, Telefonica de Espana will not participate in the bid and will work closely with SEPPA in supplying relevant information that should be presented to investors,&quot; SEPPA said.</p>
<p>Because of Telefonica's duties as majority shareholder, the telephone company reached a deal with SEPPA and TISA that it could match the best bid if it agreed to purchase the stake if there were no bidders.</p>
<p>The price in this case would be the minimum price set by lead managers Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, as long as it was not more than 20 percent higher than the price estimate made by Saloman Brothers last December at SEPPA's request.</p>
<p>The investment house estimated the price of the state's remaining TISA stake would be in the range of 95 billion to 117 billion pesetas.</p>
<p>The state finished privatising the parent Telefonica de Espana in February, selling off its remaining 21 percent stake in a hugely successful public share offer.</p>
<p>Telefonica shares rose 25 pesetas to 4,340 on Friday, well over the retail share price of 3,239 and the institutional price of 3,360 in the sale two months ago.</p>
