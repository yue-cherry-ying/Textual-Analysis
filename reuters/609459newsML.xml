<p>U S West Media Group is close to an agreement to sell its cable systems in Minneapolis-St. Paul to closely held Charter Communications for about $600 million, the Wall Street Journal said on Friday.</p>
<p>In its electronic edition, the Journal said the systems for sale were acquired by U S West last year as part of its $10 billion purchase of Continental Cablevision Inc. of Boston.</p>
<p>The sale would allow U S West to pay down debt as well as satisfy federal laws that prevent telephone companies from owning cable systems in the same market.</p>
<p>U S West Media Group, the publicly-traded cable and wireless unit of U S West, was being forced to sell off the systems because Minnesota is part of the parent company's 14-state telephone market, the paper said.</p>
<p>Specific terms were not immediately available. However, sources told the Journal the price was about 10.5 times cash flow.  </p>
<p>U S West Media Group is the cable and wireless operating arm of U S West Inc, a holding company which also controls U S West Communications Group, the separately traded telecommunications business.</p>
<p>(Corrects headline, first paragraph, and inserts last paragraph, to correct name of company selling cable system, and clarifies relationship between U S West companies)</p>
