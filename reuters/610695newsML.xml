<p>Shanghai copper futures ended mostly up in active trading on Friday on continued gains on the London Metal Exchange (LME) but local contracts still met strong resistance at the 24,000-yuan level, traders said.</p>
<p>The most actively traded September 1997 contract ended at 23,920 yuan ($2,884) per tonne, rising 40 yuan.</p>
<p>It opened at 23,950 yuan per tonne, hitting an intraday high of 24,140 yuan and a low of 23,870 yuan per tonne.</p>
<p>June fell 20 to 23,350. July rose 20 to 23,620, August 30 to 23,760, October 40 to 23,900 and November 90 to 23,900 yuan.</p>
<p>Combined volume rose to 76,340 tonnes from 65,600 tonne.  </p>
<p>LME three months copper was indicated at $2,507/10 per tonne at 1800 GMT on Thursday, and London traders said it set to consolidate around $2,500 a tonne on Friday.</p>
<p>Shanghai copper opened high and rose further for most of the session before profit-taking pushed prices down in late trade.</p>
<p>Traders said investors held different views on the short-term market trend, and that was behind Friday fluctuations.</p>
<p>&quot;Copper breached the key 24,000-yuan level in the morning but it closed below the level, indicating there was strong selling pressure,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Active trading suggested investors disagreed with each other on the short-term market trend,&quot; he added. &quot;This might lead to further price volatility in the next few days.&quot;</p>
<p>Physical price indications in the Shanghai area strengthened through the day to around 23,350 yuan from 23,100 yuan.</p>
<p>Traders said domestic fundamentals had changed little but technical charts indicated copper was likely to rise further in the next few days.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent trading has indicated long and short position holders will fight fiercely around the 24,000-yuan level in the next few days,&quot; a second trader said.  </p>
<p>Aluminium ended down. June did not trade, July fell 100 to 15,500 and August 20 to 15,770 yuan per tonne.</p>
<p>Combined volume fell to 420 tonnes from 1,110 tonnes.</p>
<p>($1=8.2924 yuan)</p>
