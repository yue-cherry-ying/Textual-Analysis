<headline>Mexico stocks fall on Dow, U.S. rates fears.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican stocks fell sharply Monday along with U.S. markets on fears of further hikes in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The bourse has broken support now. An important factor for us which is hitting the markets is a change in outlook for U.S. interest rates,&quot; said Jaime Fernandez, an analyst at the Interacciones brokerage in Mexico City.</p>
<p>The leading IPC share index ended down 94.96 points, or 2.47 percent, at 3,747.98.</p>
<p>&quot;Dealers are moving ahead of expected additional hikes (in U.S. interest rates). We expect another increase in May...,&quot; Fernandez added.</p>
<p>Trading volume was a lifeless 48.9 million shares. Traders said this was due to caution while awaiting further developments on Wall Street.</p>
<p>In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 157 points on Monday following a drop of 140 points on Thursday, when Mexican financial markets were closed. U.S. financial markets were closed on Friday.</p>
<p>On the broad market, 112 stocks changed hands, of which decliners trounced gainers by 80 to 13.</p>
<p>Telecoms firm Telmex L class shares, which ended off 44 centavos (6 cents) at 15.22 pesos ($1.92), accounted for 17 percent of all shares traded and weighed most heavily on the market. Telmex ADRs meanwhile ended down 1/2 at 38-1/2 on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Retail chain Sears gained 60 centavos (8 cents) to 13.50 pesos ($1.71).</p>
<p>&quot;Some bought Sears, but it was speculative, a few dealers are saying it will be bought by Carso,&quot; another floor trader said. Officials contacted by Reuters at both Carso and Sears declined to comment.</p>
<p>Holding company Grupo Carso closed down 1.50 pesos (19 cents) at 46.00 pesos ($5.81).</p>
