<p>Nippon Oil Co Ltd said on Friday it plans capital investment of 24 billion yen for the current fiscal year, compared with 26.4 billion yen in fiscal 1996/97.  </p>
<p>Nippon Oil reported current profits of 10.6 billion yen in the 1996/97 year, down 300 million yen from the previous year.</p>
<p>It attributed the decline to the company's inability to immediately pass on the increase in production costs to wholesale prices.</p>
<p>Japan's oil industry lost its virtually exclusive right to import oil products in April 1996 as part of measures to deregulate the industry.</p>
<p>The step exposed the industry to fresh competition.</p>
<p>Some companies have taken to strengthening ties within the industry in an attempt to survive the competition.</p>
<p>Nippon Oil now has cooperative ties with Idemitsu Kosan Co in areas such as distribution, and some analysts believe the relationship between the two former rivals could become even closer. As a step in that direction, Nippon Oil and Idemitsu have said they expect to expand their cooperation in domestic oil distribution to gasoline next year.</p>
