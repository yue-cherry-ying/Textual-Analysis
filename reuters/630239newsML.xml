<p>Pope John Paul on Monday painted a bleak picture of life for the economic orphans of Poland's post-communist prosperity, saying many suffered poverty, homelessness and unemployment.</p>
<p>He urged political and business leaders not to ignore the old and the disadvantaged who have struggled since the fall of Polish communism in 1989 spurred one of the fastest economic revivals in eastern Europe.</p>
<p>In a sermon to 300,000 pilgrims at a dilapidated former Soviet air base near the southwestern town of Legnica on the third day of his return to his homeland, John Paul said:</p>
<p>&quot;The Pope will speak out -- and he cannot fail to speak out -- on social problems because here man is involved, concrete individuals.&quot;</p>
<p>The vast crowd gave the 77-year-old Pope a welcome reminiscent of the emotional masses he held during earlier pilgrimages to Poland, starting in 1979 when the country was still firmly under communist sway.</p>
<p>John Paul's age and frail health and the realisation that this strenuous 11-day visit to 12 towns may be his last to the country have charged the pilgrimage with nostalgia.</p>
<p>Many worshippers fell to their knees as the Popemobile drove him from his helicopter to an altar topped by a 25 metre (yard) high cross which was visible for kilometres around.</p>
<p>The venue was emblematic of the political changes that have swept Poland and the rest of East Europe since the end of 1989.</p>
<p>The Warsaw Pact which bound East European satellite nations to the former Soviet Union for four decades was dissolved in 1991. The last Soviet soldiers garrisoned in Poland left in 1993.</p>
<p>The Pope, who spoke to the crowd under brilliantly sunny skies after two days of rain since his arrival in Wroclaw, said the breathless pace of capitalism was leaving many victims in its wake.</p>
<p>As it has in many other post-communist countries, Poland's dynamic economic growth has widened the gap between the new rich, who have seized economic opportunities, and the poor.</p>
<p>&quot;Every day we become aware of how many families are suffering from poverty,&quot; he said in a sermon read from a throne painted wih gold leaf.</p>
<p>The Pope said single mothers were struggling to raise their children, elderly people were being abandoned and many Poles had been made unemployed by industrial and economic restructuring.</p>
<p>&quot;On the streets and in the squares, the number of homeless people is increasing. I cannot pass over in silence the present long list of all these brothers and sisters ...&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He called on the nation's politicians &quot;to establish appropriate laws and guide the national economy in such a way that these painful phenomena of social life find a proper solution.&quot;</p>
<p>The Pope appealed to Poland's new entrepreneurs not to treat workers as mere tools of production.</p>
<p>&quot;Here, I speak to all those brothers in Christ who give work to others. Do not let yourselves be deceived by visions of immediate profit at the expense of others,&quot; he said.</p>
