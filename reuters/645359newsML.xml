<p>A Cambodian opposition leader on Saturday accused Second Prime Minister Hun Sen of ordering a bloody grenade attack on an opposition rally in Phnom Penh and challenged him to refute the charge in a justice system outside Cambodia.</p>
<p>&quot;In publicly accusing Hun Sen, from France, of having ordered the criminal attack of March 30, 1997, I challenge him to file suit against me for slander in a French court,&quot; Sam Rainsy, leader of the Khmer Nation Party (KNP), told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish to confront him in an independent and impartial justice system, which does not exist in Cambodia,&quot; Rainsy said.</p>
<p>Hun Sen has previously declined comment on suggestions by Rainsy that he was linked to the attack.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has been assisting Cambodian authorities in their investigation of the grenade attack on a demonstration led by Rainsy which left up to 19 dead and more than 100 wounded.</p>
<p>Rainsy, who narrowly escaped injury in the attack, is a political ally of First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and the main political rival of Hun Sen.</p>
<p>Ranariddh and Hun Sen have been waging a bitter war of words in recent months over various disagreements including power-sharing in their coalition government.</p>
<p>Rainsy told Reuters in a telephone interview that he had documentary evidence proving that Hun Sen had ordered the attack.</p>
<p>But he said he would only make the evidence public in front of an independent judge, such as one in France.</p>
<p>He said a slander complaint against him would oblige the French authorities to investigate the incident.</p>
