<title>THAILAND: Bangkok financial district hit by phone breakdown.</title>
<headline>Bangkok financial district hit by phone breakdown.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Thousands of telephones went dead on Tuesday in the central Bangkok financial district after a failed attempt by the Telephone Organisation of Thailand (TOT) to switch phone systems, TOT sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some 33,000 telephone lines in the central district have been out for several hours now because we failed in our attempt to switch the phone system in the area from pulse to tone,&quot; a TOT official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The phones would be up again in stages later in the day when the old &quot;pulse&quot; system would be reinstated, he said.</p>
<p>Most affected by the breakdown were some business houses and banks in the area, but the Thai stock exchange was unaffected and the market opened for business as usual.</p>
<p>However, some affected brokers complained that they could not phone their counterparts in the bourse to execute orders.</p>
<p>Other fuming susbcribers said they had received no warning or notice from the TOT that it was going to undertake such a major phone system switch and said their business routines had been severely affected by the TOT's bungle.</p>
