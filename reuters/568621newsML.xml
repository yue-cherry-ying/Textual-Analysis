<p>House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt accused Republicans Thursday of trying to rewrite last week's budget deal with President Clinton.</p>
<p>Gephardt accused House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer of making statements that the deal did not include the $35 billion for education Clinton thought he had, and changing the deal on low income housing credits and the way inflation will be measured.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the problem we've got is that the other side is trying to rewrite and change what our negotiators thought was agreed to and they're putting the rush on the product,&quot; Gephardt said.  </p>
<p>Gephardt called Archer's statements &quot;alarming&quot; and asserted that an even worse problem was that Republicans plan to write the budget deal into law next Tuesday before disputes can be resolved on what the deal is.</p>
<p>&quot;I would hope that the (Republican) majority would slow this thing down&quot; and give negotiators time to clarify what the budget deal is.</p>
<p>Gephardt said Democrats thought the budget deal would cut only about $14 billion off cost-of-living increases in federal benefits but said he believed Republicans were changing the deal to go back to a $26 billion cut proposed earlier.  </p>
<p>Archer said in an interview on CNN that &quot;in all of the written material that we've been given by our leadership it does not specify a $35 billion amount (for education).&quot;</p>
<p>But Archer did not say low income housing credits would be reduced to offset revenue increases in the budget deal. When asked if that would happen, he said &quot;we're not going to talk specifics right now&quot; except that $32.5 billion of that would come from airline ticket taxes.</p>
<p>Archer made no comment about changing the consumer price index (CPI) way of measuring inflation but Gephardt said a letter from Congress's Congressional Budget Office made him think Republicans were changing that deal.</p>
