<p>India's rightwing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would like possible mid-term polls to be held under a caretaker government headed by Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and not the Congress party, a senior BJP official said on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;Let them (Congress) expose themselves thoroughly, then elections will become inevitable,&quot; a senior BJP leader who asked not to be named told Reuters.</p>
<p>On Sunday Congress president Sitaram Kesri announced his party was withdrawing its pivotal support for Deve Gowda's 15-party ruling coalition, and he staked a claim to form a new government.</p>
<p>President Shankar Dayal Sharma on Monday asked Deve Gowda to prove his majority in the lower house of parliament by April 11. If he lost the vote and no new government emerged from the hung parliament, snap elections under a caretaker prime minister would be needed.</p>
<p>&quot;We would rather have Deve Gowda as interim prime minister than Kesri,&quot; the BJP leader said.</p>
