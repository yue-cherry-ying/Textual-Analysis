<p>Burundi's main Hutu rebel group turned down on Friday an invitation to a peace conference in Geneva next month but opened a way for regional sanctions to be lifted against Bujumbura on the grounds they were not working.</p>
<p>Leonce Ndarubagiye of the National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD) told a news conference CNDD would not go as it was already in talks with Burundi's Tutsi military rulers.</p>
<p>Burundian Foreign Minister Luc Rukingama announced on Thursday that all groups in Burundi would meet in Geneva next month for a peace conference under the auspices of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).</p>
<p>But Ndarubagiye opposed the talks being widened to include political parties after Burundi military ruler Pierre Buyoya announced that his government and CNDD reached a pre-ceasefire agreement in March following secret negotiations in Rome.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been approached by UNESCO but we believe UNESCO is not the right organisation to talk peace,&quot; Ndarubagiye said. &quot;We did not expect them to start negotiations between Burundian factions.</p>
<p>&quot;So CNDD will not go to Geneva. There is a framework for negotiations between the two belligerents in Rome and Arusha (Tanzania) but we are not prepared to go to UNESCO,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said CNDD was concerned about what criteria were being used to invite parties and held that as it was at war with the Tutsi army it should only negotiate with its representatives.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not at war with the political parties in Burundi... I don't think we can go to negotiate with parties because there is nothing to negotiate,&quot; said Ndarubagiye, adding that CNDD believed political parties could be included in the two sides meeting in Rome.</p>
<p>Ndarubagiye, head of CNDD leader Leonard Nyangoma's office, signed the agreement in Rome in March for direct negotiations on a seven-point agenda following secret talks since December.</p>
<p>Asked how long the talks could go on, Ndarubagiye cited other negotiations, noting some had lasted for 10 years, and said some of the problems they were dealing with were 400 years old.</p>
<p>More than 150,000 people have been killed in Burundi in civil war and massacres since the assassination of its first elected president from the Hutu majority by Tutsi soldiers in 1993.</p>
<p>Ndarubagiye said CNDD was surprised when Buyoya announced talks had been going on and when it learned that he had showed the agreement to regional African leaders in Arusha, Tanzania, last month, prompting them to ease sanctions against Burundi.</p>
<p>He said this showed a &quot;lack of seriousness&quot; by Buyoya.</p>
<p>But asked whether the sanctions should be continued, Ndarubagiye said they had never worked as some countries had violated them &quot;so lifting them or not lifting them is not a problem&quot;.</p>
<p>CNDD had supported sanctions imposed by regional leaders on the small landlocked Central African country shortly after Buyoya seized power from its Hutu civilian president in a coup last July.</p>
<p>He said CNDD did not feel that it was a blow to the rebel cause that the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) had invited Buyoya to its annual heads of state summit in Harare in June.</p>
<p>He said the OAU had invited many dictators to its talks in the past including Idi Amin of Uganda but they were toppled.</p>
<p>Buyoya was scheduled to travel on Thursday to Uganda to meet President Yoweri Museveni. Ndarubagiye said he presumed the military leader was looking for help because he was desperate.</p>
<p>&quot;Buyoya will be removed, believe me. The people of Burundi are fed up with dictatorship,&quot; said Ndarugabiye, adding CNDD would continue to wage its war against &quot;the fascist regime&quot;.</p>
