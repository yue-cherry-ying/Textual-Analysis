<p>Laurent Kabila's new government, under fire for excluding the country's veteran opposition leader, said on Friday that because they had won the rebel war they had the right to decide the future.</p>
<p>After seven months of bush war to oust ailing ex-president Mobutu Sese Seko, foreign minister Bizima Karaha called on him to return home with the money he stowed abroad during his 32 year rule.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not ready to take nonsense from anyone for whatever reason, just to make sure people are happy. Liberty yes, but revolution first,&quot; Karaha told a news conference after Etienne Tshisekedi and his supporters demonstrated against the Alliance on Friday. Kabila's troops fired in the air to halt a march on parliament by several hundred Tshisekedi supporters.</p>
<p>Mobutu, weakened by cancer, left Kinshasa a week ago, a day before fighters of Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire entered Kinshasa.</p>
<p>He arrived in Morocco on Saturday aboard the official plane of Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema. Sources close to Eyadema said Mobutu would go on to France, where he has a Riviera villa and a Paris apartment, after elections there which end on June 1.</p>
<p>French Prime Minister Alain Juppe said Paris would consider a request for asylum but had not received one.</p>
<p>Mobutu left Togo, the first stop of his journey to exile, with his wife and children, including his son Captain Mobutu Kongolo, and an entourage of about 50 people on Eyadema's presidential Boeing. A DC-8 was expected later to collect his extensive luggage.</p>
<p>For over three decades Mobutu dominated Africa's third largest country, which has an abundance of mineral resources.</p>
<p>&quot;The Alliance makes this appeal to Mobutu Sese Seko and guarantees all measures of personal security,&quot; Karaha said.</p>
<p>He said South African President Nelson Mandela, who tried to mediate a peaceful solution to seven months of civil war, had been asked to convey assurances of security to Mobutu and end his exile which Karaha described as &quot;humiliating&quot;.</p>
<p>Mobutu, who in the mid 1980s was reputed to have amassed a fortune amounting to at least $4 billion, built a vast palace at his northern ancestral village of Gbadolite, known as &quot;Versailles in the jungle&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Congo is big, if he doesn't want to stay in Kinshasa he has his village, he can start to import some of the money he has exported and take part in the second phase which is the reconstruction of this country,&quot; Karaha said.</p>
<p>When asked about Tshisekedi's appeal for foreign armies to withdraw their troops from the new Democratic Republic of Congo, Karaha said:</p>
<p>&quot;On one side there was the Congolese population and on the other side was a group of mercenaries. The Serbs (mercenaries) have gone home, UNITA have gone home and the ex-FAR are going home.&quot;</p>
<p>He made no mention of Rwandan, Ugandan and Angolan troops who have played a role in the Alliance victory.</p>
<p>State television called on employees of the National Information Agency security police to report for work at Ndjili international airport on Saturday, but Alliance officials said there was no plan to reopen the borders so soon.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no interest in keeping these borders closed longer than necessary,&quot; one Alliance official said.</p>
<p>One boat was able to leave Kinshasa for Brazzaville carrying a number of journalists who had been trying to leave the city for five days, but it was forbidden to bring people back.</p>
