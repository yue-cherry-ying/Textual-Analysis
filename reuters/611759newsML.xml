<p>Japanese automaker Mazda Motor Corp on Friday announced a strong surge in its annual parent profits, but remained mired in the red at the operating level.</p>
<p>Mazda said its parent current profit totalled 13.90 billion yen ($120 million), up sharply from the previous year's 1.23 billion yen ($10.6 million). The profit figure was larger than earlier estimates by industry analysts.  </p>
<p>The unexpectedly strong rise in profits, which analysts attributed to the yen's weakness and hefty sales of securities holdings, pushed up Mazda's shares, which stood 17 yen higher at 358 yen in afternoon trading.</p>
<p>But the earnings picture was not wholly positive. At the parent operating level, Mazda remained in the red in 1996/97 for a fourth successive year due to poor sales. Mazda also said it expects to post a group net loss for 1996/97 when it reveals its consolidated business results next week, although it did not give a specific estimate.</p>
<p>For the current year which started in April, Mazda forecast its current profit would grow to 20 billion yen ($173 million) and predicted an operating profit of 25 billion yen ($217 million). Current profit is pre-tax and includes gains and losses made on investments.</p>
<p>The figures were Mazda's first full-year results under the presidency of Henry Wallace, who took the wheel at Mazda in June after Ford Motor Co raised its holding in the carmaker to a one-third stake, giving it management control. Wallace has been in the spotlight as the first foreigner to run a major Japanese company. ($1=115)</p>
