<p>Army Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, will visit China next week in a joint programme to improve U.S.-China military ties, the Pentagon said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The four-day visit, which begins on Monday, will be the first by America's top military officer to China since Army Gen. John Vessey went there as JCS chairman in 1983, the Defence Department said.</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters Shalikashvili would meet his counterpart, Gen. Fu Quanyou, chief of the general staff department of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), and also visit military facilities and units.</p>
<p>Shalikashvili will make a speech at the PLA'S National Defence University, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;This is...part of our programme of strengthening military-to-military relationships between China and the United States,&quot; Bacon said.</p>
<p>&quot;The goal is to increase understanding and transparency so that we have a clearer idea of how each military establishment operates so we can do more to cooperate with each other when necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite differences over Taiwan, international trade, human rights and arms proliferation, President Bill Clinton has stressed that growing economic giant China is far too important to be isolated and ignored by Washington.</p>
<p>Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright have visited China separately this year as part of the administration's strategy of &quot;constructive engagement&quot; with Beijing.</p>
<p>Chinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian visited the United States last December and U.S. Defence Secretary William Cohen has said that he will visit Beijing before this year is out.</p>
<p>Despite calls by some conservative members of Congress to deal more sternly with Beijing because of alleged transfer of dangerous arms to Iran and alleged human rights violations by China's Communist government, Clinton and President Jiang Zemin have vowed to pursue closer ties in areas where the two countries have common interests.</p>
<p>Those include a push by Washington for North Korea to join four-way talks with the United States, South Korea and China to finally end the 1950-53 Korean War with a peace treaty.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Chinese militaries are improving relations, including visits by high-level officers and warship exchange visits. China has also agreed to continue to allow U.S. warship visits to Hong Kong after the British colony is returned to China this summer.</p>
<p>Former U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry visited China in October 1994, but Defence Minister Chi's return visit was postponed twice until last December, in part because of tensions over China-Taiwan relations earlier last year.</p>
