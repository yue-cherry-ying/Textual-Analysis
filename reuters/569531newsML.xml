<p>The number of Americans entering unemployment lines for the first time held steady last week but still hovered at the second-highest level this year, the Labour Department said Thursday.</p>
<p>The department said 347,000 Americans filed for new jobless benefits in the week ended May 3. That figure was unchanged from the previous week.</p>
<p>The only time claims were higher this year was in the week ended Jan. 4, when they stood at 365,000.</p>
<p>The report painted a weaker-than-expected picture of the economy, but economists noted that special factors like flooding and automotive industry strikes have also played a role in the recent pickup in claims activity.</p>
<p>&quot;Special factors added to the rise,&quot; said Gary Thayer, senior economist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. &quot;The economy is slowing down a bit (but) we don't believe the upward move in jobless claims is the beginning of a substantial slowdown.&quot;</p>
<p>Wall Street economists on average had expected claims to dip to 334,000 last week.</p>
<p>The four-week moving average, viewed as a more reliable gauge of jobless trends because it smooths out weekly fluctuations in the data, rose to 336,250 from 330,500 the week before.</p>
<p>The moving average in the week ended May 3 was at its highest level since the week ended Jan. 25, when it reached 339,750.</p>
<p>The total number of Americans continuing to collect jobless benefits rose by 66,000 to 2.3 million in the week ended April 26, the latest period for which those data were available.</p>
<p>The department said eight states reported increases in claims exceeding 1,000 on an unadjusted basis in the week ended April 26, the latest period for which data were available.</p>
<p>Among the largest were North Dakota, with an increase of 6,729 initial jobless claims, Massachusetts, with 3,707, New Jersey, with 2,303, Louisiana, with 2,216 and Texas, with 2,071.</p>
<p>In North Dakota, almost all claims were reported to be flood related. Massachusetts reported layoffs in the service industries, while New Jersey said it had layoffs in the trade and service industries.</p>
<p>Indiana reported an increase of 1,737 initial claims and linked the rise mainly to the indirect effects of a strike in the automobile industry. In Michigan, new claims rose by 1,014 due to the indirect impact of a strike in the auto industry.</p>
<p>The department said three states and one territory reported decreases in claims exceeding 1,000, unadjusted, in the April 26 week.</p>
<p>They were California, with 2,202 fewer jobless claims, Missouri, with 1,836, Puerto Rico, with 1,737, and North Carolina, with 1,159.</p>
