<p>For Zildghian Jarquin, a 17-year-old honours student, tough new U.S. immigration rules that took effect on Tuesday mean the end of her dream to become a doctor and deportation to a land her family fled 10 years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think I deserve this. I think this is a very cruel law,&quot; Jarquin said at a news conference, tears flowing freely. &quot;I am here trying to make something of myself.&quot;</p>
<p>The new regulations, which have panicked immigrant communities across the United States, went into effect on Tuesday after an appeals court rejected a last-minute stay.</p>
<p>The law, approved by Congress last fall, was meant to tighten U.S. borders against illegal aliens. But immigrant advocates say it will mean deportation for thousands who have lived, worked and paid taxes in the United States for years.</p>
<p>Roman Catholic Archbishop John Favalora of Miami joined a host of immigrant advocacy groups at a news conference to denounce the new law, calling the measures &quot;heartless, inhumane and unworthy of our American spirit.</p>
<p>&quot;These anti-immigrant measures are part of a growing trend in our society to define living human beings as problems,&quot; Favalora said. &quot;People are not to be defined as problems, whether they are immigrants, elderly, poor or unborn.&quot;</p>
<p>The immigration reforms have plunged Jarquin and thousands of immigrants into a legal morass that could end with deportation. Community leaders say an estimated 40,000 Nicaraguans in Miami live in fear of the new law, many hiding with friends or family to avoid raids or deportation notices.</p>
<p>Immigration lawyers have filed a class-action lawsuit against the Immigration and Naturalisation Service to halt deportations and win residency for Nicaraguans.</p>
<p>Jarquin, a Nicaraguan citizen brought here by her parents when she was seven, faces expulsion because U.S. lawmakers enacted the law retroactively, preventing her from winning a legal reprieve called suspension of deportation that could have resulted in permanent residency.</p>
<p>&quot;All my dreams are in the trash,&quot; Jarquin said. &quot;All they (lawmakers) think is immigrants, immigrants, let's get rid of all of them. But they don't realise what they're doing to us.&quot;</p>
<p>Her lawyer, Gons Nachman, described Jarquin as an honour roll student who has never been in trouble with the law, drugs, alcohol or gangs.</p>
<p>He said she and her mother were left in legal limbo along with thousands of Nicaraguans who came to the United States in the wake of the U.S.-backed Contra war against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government during the 1980s.</p>
<p>After her claim for political asylum was denied in 1990, Jarquin was placed in deportation proceedings, Nachman said. Ordinarily she might have been eligible for suspension of deportation, but because of the new law, she was denied suspension on Feb. 24 and given a year to leave the country or face deportation.</p>
<p>Immigrant advocates said the law threatens to create a new underclass of paperless immigrants who, due to sheer numbers, are not deported by INS and take to living underground where they become victims of ruthless employers and landlords.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States is providing a sorry example of refugee protection,&quot; said Miraan Sa, a director of Amnesty International's U.S. branch. &quot;The effect will be to deny protection to the most brutalized victims.&quot;</p>
