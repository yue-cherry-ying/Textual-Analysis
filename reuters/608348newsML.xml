<p>World champion Tommi Makinen of Finland extended his lead over Briton Colin McRae to 26 seconds at the midway point of the second leg of the Rally of Argentina on Friday.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi driver Makinen, who led by eight seconds overnight, found himself unable to shake off a determined McRae in a Subaru in the morning's opening stages as the drivers headed out into the mountains to the west of Cordoba.</p>
<p>The pair set the joint fastest time on the ninth stage, with Makinen quickest on the 10th, but McRae's top times on the 11th and 12th stages saw the two drivers separated by just five seconds.</p>
<p>But on the 13th stage, the Chamico to Ambul run where Makinen was particularly quick last year on his way to victory, the current series leader set an unbeatable stage time of 18 minutes 52 seconds.</p>
<p>That was 17 seconds faster than McRae's effort and, by the end of the following stage, which took the teams to the service point at San Lorenzo, Makinen had pulled a further four seconds clear for an overall 26-second advantage heading into the 15th stage.</p>
<p>Behind the leading duo, Ford driver Carlos Sainz was unable to match the speed of Makinen or McRae.</p>
<p>Although maintaining his third place position, he was one minute 13 seconds adrift of Makinen at the end of the 14th stage and just seven seconds ahead of a charging Richard Burns in a Mitsubishi.</p>
