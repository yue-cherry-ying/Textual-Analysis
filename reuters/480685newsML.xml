<headline>SILF/Swedbank purchasing managers index unchanged.</headline>
<dateline>STOCKHOLM 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Silf and Swedbank said on Tuesday that their purchasing managers' index was unchanged at 55.5 in March, the same level as February.  </p>
<p>&quot;The upturn in the industrial cycle is continuing accordingly but without further acceleration,&quot; Silf and Swedbank said in a statement.</p>
<p>The index in January was 53.3 and in March 1996 46.4.</p>
<p>The statement said the order intake was continuing to show a divided picture but was still better in the first quarter of 1997 than in the same period a year ago with positive developments.</p>
<p>The index for order intake was 57.0 in March against 59.4 in February but compared to 47.0 in March last year.</p>
<p>&quot;It is still orders from exports that are dragging while the home market is not far from becoming stagnant,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>Silf and Swedbank said the most negative aspect in March was still falling employment.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite increased production, unemployment in the industrial sector continues to fall,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The production index rose to 59.7 in March against 59.4 in Feburary and 50.0 a year earlier.</p>
