<p>Diana, Princess of Wales, tiptoed through a U.S. political minefield on Tuesday as she pressed a Red Cross campaign for a global ban on anti-personnel land mines, &quot;these evil weapons.&quot;</p>
<p>With Diana appearing on behalf of the British Red Cross, a bipartisan group of senators seeking a prompt ban on new deployments hitched their wagon to her star.</p>
<p>&quot;I commend (American Red Cross President) Elizabeth Dole and Lady Diana who have worked so hard to help the victims,&quot; Sen. Patrick Leahy said on the Senate floor.</p>
<p>Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, introduced a bill last week that would bar the Pentagon from planting anti-personnel mines anywhere in the world except Korea after Jan. 1, 2000.</p>
<p>So far, 57 of the 100 senators have co-sponsored the measure, which dovetails with a Canadian drive to put a mine treaty in place by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The Clinton administration, however, favours a much slower route to a ban on mines, through the U.N. Conference on Disarmament. The Pentagon is reluctant to surrender a weapon until others, notably China and Russia, have agreed to do so.</p>
<p>&quot;We just believe that there needs to be an all-inclusive approach to this thing, which can only be accomplished through the Conference on Disarmament,&quot; a Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Michael Doubleday, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the Senate, Leahy and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, the chief Republican co-sponsor of the bill barring future deployments, used the occasion of Diana's appearance to turn up the heat on Clinton.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the time is now,&quot; Hagel, a combat veteran twice wounded by land mines in Vietnam, told the Senate. He said the administration's go-slow approach &quot;could extend the life of these cruel weapons by a decade or more.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton was pursuing an approach &quot;that could allow killing and maiming of thousands more civilians before America finally decides to lead,&quot; Hagel added.</p>
<p>Diana did not directly address the Clinton slow-track approach at a sun-splashed news conference outside the headquarters of the American Red Cross.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously, I am more than happy to be here to lend support to the American Red Cross campaign to ban anti-personnel land mines and to raise funds for the victims of these evil weapons,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>After her speech, the princess did not respond to a question from a reporter about Clinton's refusal to embrace the Canadian initiative, which she praised.</p>
<p>But, in a departure from her prepared text, she said: &quot;This visit to Washington for me is timely&quot; because of a Belgian government-hosted conference next week to follow up on the Canadian drive to draft a global treaty for signing this year.</p>
<p>Anti-personnel land mines -- planted during war and often forgotten when the fighting ends -- kill or maim 2,000 people every month, often civilians, a Red Cross fact sheet said.</p>
