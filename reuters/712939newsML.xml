<p>Former Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo appeared in court on Tuesday for the first public trial of some 20 legal suits pending against him, in which he is accused of slandering a former customs official in his campaign against corruption.</p>
<p>But Cavallo, removed by President Carlos Menem a year ago after his vehement accusations of graft inside the Peronist government went too far, scored one legal victory when a suit against him by his arch-enemy, controversial businessman Alfredo Yabran, was thrown out by another court.</p>
<p>Cavallo is campaigning for a seat in Congress on an anti-corruption platform, and has irked the government by accusing former cabinet colleagues of manipulating the courts to protect corrupt businessmen.</p>
<p>Lawyer Jorge Kolon is suing Cavallo in a federal court for corruption allegations dating back to 1992, which he says got him fired from his job in the customs office and prevented his being named judge.</p>
<p>Kolon told reporters as the trial began on Tuesday: &quot;His accusations brought me economic, social and family ruin. I lost clients, jobs and had problems at home.&quot;</p>
<p>But the defence moved for an annulment, with Cavallo alleging the man trying the case, Rodolfo Canicoba, is one of the judges in the pockets of his enemies in government -- in this case of former Justice Minister Elias Jassan, who quit recently after he was caught lying over his links with Yabran.</p>
<p>&quot;This trial will be a farce. I will be tried by a judge who once worked for Jassan, with all the connections that we known Jassan has through Yabran with the mafia,&quot; Cavallo told reporters, calling Kolon another link in the Yabran organisation.</p>
<p>Alfredo Yabran is at the centre of Cavallos campaign against graft. The businessman has declared interests in the private postal sector, but is also widely believed to own companies with strategic interests in Argentinas airports and that print and distribute official documents including passports. He has been named by Cavallo as the head of an organisation feared even by Menem.</p>
<p>Yabran, who is also being investigated in connection with the murder of a news photographer in January, has filed three suits against Cavallo -- one for slander, another accusing Cavallo of causing his businesses $180-200 million of damage, and the third, which a federal court has now rejected on the basis of insufficient evidence, accusing Cavallo of acting unfairly against Yabran's postal company in a 1994 tender for services for a state-owned bank.</p>
