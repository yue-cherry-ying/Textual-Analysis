<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing debt market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing debt market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch bonds closed a little higher, after lingering in positive territory all day.</p>
<p>Dealers said business could get more volatile in the near term as investors remained nervous and disinclined to buy.</p>
<p>&quot;If the (June) bund future contracts drop below 110.25 this would turn the whole market bearish,&quot; said one dealer, noting that the future contracts had started to drop in the middle of the afternoon and recovered later.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was already some buying interest for the Dutch government's 5.75 percent bond due February 2007, which will be reopened for sale from Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Grey market prices were quoted around 99.25/60 in late afternoon versus 99.40/60 in the morning.</p>
<p>The original 5.75 percent February 2007 bond closed at 99.72/80, yielding 5.78 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said that business would be calm at the start of next week as many market players might be away for an ISMA meeting in Singapore.</p>
