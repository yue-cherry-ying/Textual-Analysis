<headline>Canada gets Bre-X fraud complaints, stock delisted.</headline>

<p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Wednesday they received two fraud complaints involving Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and its Busang gold bust as investors tallied up their losses from history's biggest gold swindle.</p>
<p>While investigators met Wednesday to decide their next move in a widening probe over the gold fiasco, the Toronto Stock Exchange delisted the former stock market darling.</p>
<p>In a letter to the RCMP, Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh alleged a fraud had been perpetrated against his company, but he did not identify a suspect.</p>
<p>A second fraud complaint was filed by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), Canada's top securities regulator. The Ontario Securities Commission is conducting its own investigation of Bre-X for possible violations of insider trading and disclosure laws.</p>
<p>Bre-X officials were unavailable to comment on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Under Canadian law, a fraud conviction can carry a maximum 10-year prison sentence, said Don Holmes, a forensic accountant with Ernst &amp; Young consultants.</p>
<p>&quot;In spite of Bre-X laying a complaint with the RCMP, the company itself could be held criminally liable. That would involve showing that its officers and directors perpetrated a fraud,&quot; Holmes said.</p>
<p>Bre-X announced on Wednesday the resignation of two directors from the boards of Bre-X and its sister firms.</p>
<p>The Busang discovery in Indonesia -- touted by Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X as the richest gold find of the century -- was falsified on a scale &quot;without precedent in the history of mining,&quot; according to a report by consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd. released late Sunday.</p>
<p>Since then Bre-X's stock -- once valued at over C$6 billion ($4.4 billion) -- has collapsed to pennies a share and class action suits loom over the embattled miner.</p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) on Wednesday delisted Bre-X shares after it concluded that &quot;the company no longer meets the required listing standards.&quot;</p>
<p>Bre-X closed up one-half cent at 9 cents Canadian (6 cents) cents Wednesday on 20 million shares on the TSE.</p>
<p>Deleen Schoff, a spokeswoman for the RCMP in Alberta, denied a report from Indonesian police on Wednesday that an RCMP team would arrive in Jakarta either on Thursday or Friday to question people involved in the Busang affair.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point anything is possible, but we haven't designated anyone to go over (to Indonesia),&quot; Schoff said. &quot;We haven't decided if we're going over.&quot;</p>
<p>The Alberta government has named a special prosecutor to work with the RCMP. &quot;He'll work very closely with the police, assisting them and providing them with legal advice,&quot; Leslie Gronow, a spokeswoman for Alberta's Justice Ministry, said.</p>
<p>While police met over the Busang imbroglio, there was increasing speculation over how much and when Bre-X officials knew about the tampering of core samples from Busang.</p>
<p>Strathcona said there were several red flags in reports that Bre-X received last year from Canada's Kilborn SNC-Lavalin Inc. and Australia's Normet Pty Ltd.</p>
<p>Strathcona said Bre-X's storage warehouse near the Borneo town of Samarinda, where core samples were kept for a lengthy period of time, was the most likely spot for any tampering.</p>
<p>Published reports from Indonesia have quoted local Bre-X employees as saying that they blended reddish, white and gold-coloured powders with pulverized rock samples from Busang.</p>
<p>Analysts said Bre-X officials either did not recognise or ignored the clues contained in the Kilborn and Normet reports.</p>
<p>Before Sunday's announcement, Walsh had dismissed doubts about Busang that had dogged his company since March. Walsh has said he was shocked by Strathcona's report and investigators hired by Bre-X would find the culprits.</p>
<p>Bre-X's chief of exploration, John Felderhof, also has expressed dismay over the tampering at Busang and denied any knowledge of the fraud.</p>
<p>Felderhof has gone into virtual seclusion at his $2.9 million estate in the Cayman Islands. Cayman immigration officials said Felderhof had applied for permanent residency.</p>
<p>As Canada's financial sector totalled up their losses from the Busang blowout, Canadian newspapers on Wednesday were filled with the hard-luck stories of Bre-X shareholders.</p>
<p>An estimated C$500 million ($362 million) was lent to people to buy Bre-X shares and they now must pay it back.</p>
<p>Toronto-based investment dealer First Marathon Inc., the most active Canadian brokerage in Bre-X, said on Wednesday it lost C$4.5 million ($3.2 million) on the meltdown.</p>
<p>The mayor of Edmonton, Alberta, has threatened to fire the city official reponsible for losing almost C$750,000 ($540,000) from the city pension fund due to Bre-X.</p>
