<p>Avista Advantage expects to be profitable this year on revenues of $6 million, President Gerry D. Crooks said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Revenues are expected to be in the $20 to $30 million range in three to four years, he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Crooks was in New York with other Washington Water Power Co officials for presentations to security analysts. Avista, which changed its name Monday, has been doing business for 15 months.  </p>
<p>He attributed the company's ability to show profits at this stage of development to its &quot;significantly different&quot; approach to the energy services business.</p>
<p>With its proprietary billing program, which allows Avista to provide customers with a single monthly energy bill, the company is able to provide customers with &quot;immediate benefits,&quot; Crooks said.</p>
<p>He said the company's latest contract is with the U.S. Postal Service for a pilot resource accounting program at its 23 Portland, Ore., facilities.  </p>
<p>Initially, &quot;we'll be giving them a handle on their Portland facilities,&quot; he said, noting the effort will be monitored by national Postal Service officials for possible expansion.</p>
<p>Avista looks at itself as a commodity manager rather than a commodity provider, Washington Water corporate and investor relations administrator Patrick M. Lynch said.</p>
<p>He pointed out the company can provide the commodities too, if the customer wants, through Avista Energy, the trading and marketing arm of Avista Advantage's parent, Avista Corp.  </p>
<p>He noted fuel commodities are part of the full service that Avista is providing California's SharePlus Hospital Association.</p>
<p>Crooks said the services provided White Lodging include a determination of per room energy costs.</p>
<p>He said other customers include Tidyman's, a regional grocery chain, and 35 western U.S. and British Columbia plants operated by Louisiana-Pacific Corp.  Noting the timber company has contracts with four energy service providers covering its operations in various areas, Crooks said he believes &quot;they ultimately will go to one of the four.&quot;</p>
<p>The company has made 200 proposals to U.S. and Canadian companies, he noted.</p>
