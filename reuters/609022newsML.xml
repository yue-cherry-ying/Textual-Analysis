<headline>Camdessus upbeat about Colombia's economic future.</headline>

<p>International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus on Thursday urged Colombia to tighten monetary and fiscal policies but was upbeat about the country's economic prospects.</p>
<p>Camdessus arrived in Bogota on Thursday and met President Ernesto Samper for a working lunch.  </p>
<p>At a press conference, Camdessus said greater economic openness would enable Colombia to take advantage of wider opportunities in the global marketplace.</p>
<p>He said Colombia could be able to achieve a six percent growth in its gross domestic product (GDP) but he did not say when the country could be able to achieve it.</p>
<p>Last year Colombia experienced one of its lowest GDP growth in the last decade at 2.01 percent. This year Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo has forecast a four percent growth.</p>
<p>Following the leak of a report to the local media earlier in the week, in which the IMF criticised Samper's &quot;inadequate&quot; combination of short and medium-term policies, the tone of Camdessus' comments to the press was buoyant.</p>
<p>&quot;Having seen the economic data this country is vigorous and has great opportunities in the globalised economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I don't think the model of economic openness should change. I recommend there should be no backward step. Openness is not the miracle medicine but this must go hand in hand with a prudent management of fiscal and monetary policy,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Earlier this week, Ocampo announced a 500 billion peso budget freeze and a public sector efficiency drive in a bid to rein back the yawning fiscal deficit. Figures released Tuesday showed the central government's fiscal deficit for the first four months of this year stood at 1.78 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>That compared with a fiscal deficit of about four percent of GDP for 1996.</p>
<p>The IMF head said if Colombia failed to rein back its public sector spending before the turn of the century it could &quot;sacrifice economic stability&quot;.</p>
<p>The government should pump all the necessary resources into fighting drug trafficking, Camdessus said.</p>
<p>&quot;When a country must combat a powerful internal enemy whose horror is a permanent threat, there is no other solution (but to spend). The government has to equip the police forces in Colombia to erradicate this cancer.</p>
<p>&quot;Colombia has the obligation to put more funds toward fighting this cancer but it would be worse to allow the narco- traffickers to get away with the illusion that they're winning this battle,&quot; he said.</p>
