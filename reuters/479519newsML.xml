<p>India and Pakistan have made quiet but encouraging progress in peace talks ending three years of diplomatic sniping, but a political crisis in New Delhi has clouded a pledge to meet again soon, analysts said.</p>
<p>The foreign ministry secretaries of both countries ended four days of talks on Monday with a vow to hold another round of negotiations in Islamabad. No dates were set.</p>
<p>They were the first high-level discussions since January 1994, when deep-seated differences over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir forced the neighbours to break off talks.</p>
<p>Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad called the latest talks a new start. &quot;We intend to follow up the new beginning with continued interest,&quot; Ahmad told the Press Trust of India on Monday evening before leaving for Pakistan.</p>
<p>Indian Foreign Secretary Salman Haidar told a news conference: &quot;I would say, 'Please keep watching.' We do intend to continue and to address the issues.&quot;</p>
<p>Foreign policy analysts and diplomats said that while there were no breakthroughs on specific issues, they were heartened that the two sides discussed all critical concerns, including Kashmir, and agreed to meet again.</p>
<p>&quot;It is encouraging and favourable,&quot; said Uday Bhaskar, deputy director of the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses. &quot;They haven't said they would scuttle the thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was the best possible scenario that you could have expected,&quot; said Bhabani Sengupta, executive director of the Centre for Research on International Change.</p>
<p>A Western diplomat said: &quot;It's encouraging that all issues were addressed as well as the modalities and structures for future talks. It's encouraging they have maintained discipline in terms of controlling the atmosphere.&quot;</p>
<p>After returning to Pakistan on Monday, Ahmad said he had stressed the &quot;centrality&quot; of the dispute over Kashmir in his 12 hour of talks with Haidar.</p>
<p>India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence in 1947, two of them over Kashmir which remains divided between the South Asian neighbours.</p>
<p>Islamabad wants Kashmiris to vote in an internationally supervised referendum to determine whether the region will join Pakistan or India.</p>
<p>But Delhi says the dispute is strictly between the two countries and insists it will not relinquish rule over the two thirds of Kashmir which it controls.</p>
<p>Haidar acknowledged the two sides had discussed Kashmir.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the almost completely asymmetrical positions over Kashmir, this was the best meeting that one could have expected,&quot; Sengupta said.</p>
<p>But a crisis in New Delhi, where Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's 10-month-old government faces a vote of confidence by April 11, clouds the future of talks.</p>
<p>The two foreign secretaries were unable to set dates for a subsequent round largely because of uncertainty over the future of Deve Gowda's government, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The political turmoil creates a lot of problems,&quot; the Western diplomat said. &quot;It makes it awkward for the Indians to proceed.&quot;</p>
<p>Indian Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral was expected to meet his Pakistani counterpart, Gohar Ayub Khan, during or after a meeting on April 7-8 of foreign ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement in New Delhi. But there was no knowing whether political upheaval in Delhi would sidetrack the talks.</p>
<p>Still, analysts said the joint statement at the end of talks reflected a renewed resolve to narrow differences.</p>
<p>&quot;The statement is itself an indication of a remarkable sense of maturity,&quot; said Surjit Mansingh, head of the Centre for International Politics, Organisation and Disarmament at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi.</p>
<p>&quot;Pakistan had an excuse to drop the talks when they saw they were not sure who would be in power in India. It shows a genuine seriousness of purpose,&quot; she said.</p>
