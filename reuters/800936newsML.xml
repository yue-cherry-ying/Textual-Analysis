<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Thursday joined churches in opposing the country's first legal heroin programme, which is planned to start in 1998 and will cost A$10 million (US$7.4 million).</p>
<p>&quot;I am myself ... profoundly ambivalent, indeed more than that, sceptical to the point of hostility,&quot; Howard told a Sydney radio station.</p>
<p>&quot;I remain to be convinced that there's any benefit at all in this heroin trial,&quot; said Howard, a conservative politician.</p>
<p>Six churches on Wednesday also condemned the plan for territory and state governments to provide addicts with heroin at a nominal price, calling it &quot;totally outrageous&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;One really has to ask about the logic and the rationale behind the thinking which produces a decision to endorse heroin taking,&quot; said Reverend John Edmondstone, president of the New South Wales Council of Churches.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact is that heroin kills people,&quot; Edmondstone said.</p>
<p>Health ministers from the national government, two territories and six states agreed last month to support the trial which will start in the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>The first phase involves about 40 addicts purchasing the heroin for a nominal price of about $A15 a week.</p>
<p>The second and third phases, which involve more than 1,000 addicts from three cities, would be carried out over two to three years. The second and third stages need final approval.</p>
<p>Supporters of the Australian trial said the aim was to supply safe heroin, prevent overdoses, fight the spread of disease from shared needles, improve addicts' quality of life and reduce drug-related crime.</p>
<p>Anglican Archbishop of Sydney Reverend Harry Goodhew said similar heroin schemes overseas had proved ineffective and the programme sent the wrong message to Australia's youth.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a programme will be costly, but how much more costly will it be to our society as a whole,&quot; said Reverend Noel Edwardes, president of the Baptist Churches in New South Wales, Australia's most populous state.</p>
<p>The Australian government would have to import 184 kg (405 pounds) of synthetic heroin to implement the scheme after Tasmania, the only state in Australia permitted to harvest opium poppy crops, refused to supply the drug.</p>
<p>However, Tasmania agreed to support the heroin trial in principle after ensuring its A$80 million legal poppy industry was not at risk from the International Narcotics Control Board -- the body which controls the world's legal heroin industry.</p>
