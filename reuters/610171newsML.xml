<p>Dresdner Bank AG, Germany's second largest commercial bank, said on Friday that strong operating business in the first quarter left it mildly optimistic for its profit outlook for 1997.</p>
<p>The bank, reporting detailed first quarter earnings for the first time, posted a 10 percent advance in operating profit for the first three months amid strong advances in interest and commission income as fund and equity sales improved.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the environment remains difficult for the German banks in 1997, after a good first quarter we remain cautiously optimistic for the full year,&quot; chairman Juergen Sarrazin told the bank's annual general meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;We are also confident of being able to present a full year 1997 result which will enable us to pay an attractive dividend as well as significantly increase our reserves,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dresdner raised its 1996 dividend to 1.45 marks per share from 1.35 marks and also paid a bonus dividend of 10 pfennigs to mark its 125th anniversary, as its net profit surged 31 percent to 1.58 billion marks, outstripping its main rivals.</p>
<p>Sarrazin said earnings in the first quarter of 1997 had as usual been influenced by special factors and could not be directly extrapolated for the full year.</p>
<p>Operating profit before risk provisions advanced to 991 million marks ($587 million) in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The bank posted a particularly strong rise in commission income for the three-month period, with a 20.6 percent rise to 1.2 billion marks on the back of high equity and mutual fund sales.</p>
<p>Net interest income rose rose 8.8 percent to 1.7 billion marks, but was partly boosted by elements of &quot;quasi-trading income&quot;, Sarrazin said, which were not necessarily sustainable over the full year.</p>
<p>Own account trading income was 330 million marks, which Sarrazin said was very satisfactory, without providing a comparative figure. The first quarter result was, however, equal to half the full trading income for 1996.</p>
<p>Sarrazin took the opportunity presented by the shareholder meeting to firmly deny media reports that Dresdner was interested in taking over Postbank, the German postal bank due for privatisation this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We are neither interested in taking over Postbank or in taking a stake in it,&quot; Sarrazin said, although he conceded that the bank had in 1995 considered these options.</p>
<p>The media reports were based on working papers from London investment bank Schroders which were said to indicate Dresdner was interested in taking a stake in Postbank.</p>
<p>Turning to another topical issue, Sarrazin assured shareholders that Dresdner would keep up its links with the chemicals and metals firm Degussa AG, even after agreeing this week to sell its stake in the firm to utility Veba AG.</p>
<p>Dresdner would earn some 800 million marks for its part in the sale of a 36.4 percent stake in Degussa, and use this return to further strengthen its own funds, Sarrazin said.</p>
<p>The bank's administrative costs rose 10.4 percent to 2.3 billion marks in the first quarter, partly due to the first-time consolidation of funds unit RCM Capital Management, without which the rise would have been 7.3 percent.</p>
<p>Sarrazin said Dresdner was placing strong emphasis on institutional fund management, which he considered one of the most promising segments in international banking.</p>
<p>Dresdner did not give any precise figures for loan loss provisions for the first quarter, but Sarrazin said these were likely to remain at about the year-ago level for the full year.</p>
<p>The bank's balance sheet total passed the 600 billion mark for the first time by March 31, rising 11.5 percent to 625 billion marks, but lending added only 3.5 percent to the total, the rest being due to money market business.</p>
<p>Sarrazin said the bank was focusing more on margin and asset quality in its lending business.</p>
