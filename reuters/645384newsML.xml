<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel on Saturday released some of the pressure within Chancellor Helmut Kohl's beleaguered ruling coalition and ruled out raising taxes in 1997.</p>
<p>Asked by journalists at a meeting of the junior wing of his Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) if he was planning to increase taxes, Waigel replied: &quot;Not in 1997&quot;.  </p>
<p>Junior coalition partner the Free Democrats (FDP) has repeatedly stressed its opposition to tax increases, which Waigel had previously declined to rule out.</p>
<p>Earlier, a FDP spokesman denied reports it had threatened to leave the coalition if it insisted on raising taxes to help get Germany's finances in shape for Europe's single currency,</p>
<p>&quot;The current budget problems will be overcome without tax increases. So there is no reason or cause for a discussion about the coalition,&quot; Rolf Goebel said in a statement.</p>
<p>Waigel repeated that he was sure Germany could fulfill the Maastricht criteria for European economic and monetary union (EMU). &quot;Our data show we will make it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Waigel has often vowed that Germany will reduce its budget deficit to three percent of gross domestic produce as is mandated by the Maastricht Treaty for countries wanting to join EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;You will see, Germany will make the deficit criteria,&quot; Waigel said.</p>
<p>But the finance minister did not say what measures he would take to meet that target.</p>
<p>Waigel on Tuesday was forced to retreat from his plan to help state finances and qualify for the euro with profits from revalued central bank assets, after sharp Bundesbank criticism and disquiet in the ruling coalition.</p>
<p>Waigel denied reports that his CSU party, Bavarian sister to Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), were discussing a delay to the planned 1999 EMU start date.</p>
<p>The Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily on Friday quoted a member of the CSU state government in Bavaria as saying: &quot;Since the French election we have agreed currency union must be postponed.&quot;</p>
