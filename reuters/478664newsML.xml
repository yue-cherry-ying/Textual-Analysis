<p>A U.N. mission said on Tuesday that 400,000 people were threatened by hunger in strife-torn Albania and it would push ahead to distribute aid even before the arrival of a planned multinational security force.</p>
<p>The U.N. team, ending a week-long visit to the Balkan nation battered by insurrection last month, reckoned that people most at risk were destitute families, patients in hospitals, children in orphanages and the elderly in homes.</p>
<p>&quot;The country does not presently face an immediate large-scale humanitarian crisis...but immediate humanitarian needs do exist,&quot; said Paul Hebert, an American from the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs heading the mission.</p>
<p>He told a news conference that 140,000 of the poorest families, or about 400,000 people in the former communist state of 3.4 million people, had been deprived of minimal welfare handouts by the collapse of central government control.</p>
<p>About 8,000 people in hospitals or other state-run institutions like orphanages were also threatened by shortages of food or medicines, Hebert said.</p>
<p>The U.N. team had seen no starvation but reckoned that aid and a return to order in chaotic Albania, Europe's poorest state even before the insurrection, was vital now to head off a crisis in a few weeks or months.</p>
<p>Among urgent needs were 5,000 tonnes of flour, a modest amount compared to relief shipments to nations such as Zaire, Somalia or Bosnia. &quot;We need to fill the gaps,&quot; Hebert said.</p>
<p>Italy is putting together a U.N.-approved multinational force expected to number 2,500 troops or police to protect deliveries of food and medical supplies. Hebert said the United Nations would push ahead irrespective of the force.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not have to wait to begin delivery of humanitarian assistance, that has already been done,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He noted that the Red Cross last week distributed food by truck in rebel-held areas of southern Albania, at the centre of unrest sparked by the collapse of high-interest pyramid schemes this year that wiped out many people's savings.</p>
<p>Aid consignments from France, Italy and Greece had also been distributed, mostly in Tirana and other government-controlled areas, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have to see and test the waters to see if there are any problems in the next few weeks,&quot; Hebert said. &quot;We don't have enough experience to know if we'll have major problems.&quot;</p>
<p>U.N. officials conceded it would be tough for boats to dock with consignments of flour if ports were not secured. The international force aims to secure the Adriatic ports of Durres and rebel-held Vlore along with Tirana airport.</p>
<p>But Albanians in Vlore are in uproar with Rome over the sinking of a crowded refugee vessel in the Adriatic on Friday after a collision with an Italian navy boat enforcing a policy of turning back refugees.</p>
<p>Albania says more than 80 people drowned.</p>
<p>Hebert said that humanitarian needs were far smaller than in Bosnia during the war in former Yugoslavia. Aid shipments required in Albania were far less, there was no major problem with displaced people and no massive destruction.</p>
<p>Complicating factors in Albania were the lack of clear lines between opposing groups, lawlessness and banditry.</p>
