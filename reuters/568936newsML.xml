<p>Diplomatic pressure nudged Zaire's ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila closer towards a negotiated end to civil war.</p>
<p>Mobutu and leaders of some of his French-speaking Central African allies said on Thursday they saw a key role for Zaire's parliament and urged a quick replacement of its speaker -- Mobutu's constitutional successor in the event of his death or incapacity.</p>
<p>The other leaders said they noted Mobutu's decision not to stand for reelection for health reasons. At 66, he has prostate cancer and looked tired at the meeting.</p>
<p>Washington renewed its call for Kabila and Mobutu to work out a transitional government to put Zaire on a path to democracy and avoid a bloodbath as rebels advanced on the capital Kinshasa.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Kabila understands what's at stake for him and his reputation in the way he handles the transfer of power,&quot; said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.</p>
<p>Kabila's rebels have won control of around three quarters of the mineral-rich state at the heart of Africa since taking up arms in October to defend the nationality of ethnic Tutsis.</p>
<p>South African mediators said a new talks between Kabila and Mobutu, who dominated Zaire for more than three decades, had been set for Wednesday. The venue was not announced.</p>
<p>A meeting hosted by South Africa's Nelson Mandela on a ship off the coast of Congo ended inconclusively at the weekend with Mandela promising new talks within 10 days.</p>
<p>No fresh military activity was reported after residents said Kabila's rebels defended the town of Kenge, 200 km (125 miles) from Kinshasa, from a determined counter-attack at the weekend by loyal units of Mobutu's ragged army.</p>
<p>Burns refused to say how the United States might react if Kabila and his forces stormed Kinshasa with attendant loss of life. But he said U.S. officials had told Kabila in private what Washington might do.</p>
<p>&quot;We...understand from our conversations with Mr. Kabila that he would very much like to avoid that (bloodshed). He, however, says also that he is determined to take the capital. Our view is that he and others need to be mindful of their own actions, which are a test of their credibility,&quot; Burns said.</p>
<p>Residents of Kinshasa fear the response of scared Zaire troops facing defeat as much as a rebel entry into the teeming city of five million. Hundreds of people were killed when soldiers went on the rampage in 1991 and 1993.</p>
<p>Officials in Gabon, where Mobutu met the presidents of Chad, Congo, Central African Republic and Equatorial Guinea, said he intended to return to Kinshasa on Friday.</p>
<p>Mobutu, a Cold War ally of the United States, came under pressure in the early 1990s to democratise Zaire and, in public at least, stated his commitment to multi-party elections.</p>
<p>The transitional parliament was born out of political chaos in 1994 as a compromise to bring together supporters of Mobutu and the political opposition. Mobutu's allies have a majority in the 738-seat assembly.</p>
<p>A vacancy for speaker was created in 1995 when an unusual political alliance of opposition radicals and Mobutu's supporters ousted Roman Catholic Archbishop Laurent Monsengwo.</p>
