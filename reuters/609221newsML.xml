<p>The Dow Jones industrial average leaped to a record close Friday as blue-chip stocks resumed their spirited rise after this week's decision by the Federal Reserve to hold the line on interest rates.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average was up 87.78 points, or 1.21 percent, at 7,345.91, setting its 20th record so far this year as it beat its May 15 milestone of 7,333.55. For the week it closed up 151.24 points.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index set a new high, closing up 17.12 points at 1,389.72, its first record since late January, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 11.37 to a new high of 847.03.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was also at a record at 8,000.321 up 102.035 or 1.29 percent.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines 1,873 to 615 on moderate volume of 416 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>A wave of buying sent stocks leaping as Wall Street prepared for the three-day Memorial Day holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq's inability to keep up with the Dow's ascent into record ground had been seen by market analysts as a potential Achilles' heel for Wall Street.</p>
<p>But high technology and smaller-name stocks began closing the gap on blue chips over the past three weeks. And with many traders exiting early Friday ahead of the holiday, the bulls easily carried the day.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been a real change in sentiment in the smaller cap stocks and in high technology stocks towards a more positive view,&quot; said James Volk, director of equity trading at Jensen Securities.</p>
<p>Some traders, however, noted that stocks have historically rallied into three-day weekends, often only to unwind the gains the following session.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think this rally means much,&quot; said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray &amp; Co. &quot;The stock market is easily pushed up when a lot of people are on the sidelines.&quot;</p>
<p>Bonds were quiet, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury holding at Thursday's close of 6.99 percent.</p>
<p>Next week could lead to choppy trading as investors fret over the long-bond yield cracking the key 7 percent level, said Gregory Nie, technical analyst at EVEREN Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Bonds north of 7 percent can become a bit of a headache again for equities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The stock market got relief this week from a Fed decision not to raise interest rates but after this week's sharp gains, any renewed worries that the central bank will raise rates at its next meeting in early July will put fresh selling pressure on stocks, said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer of Value Line's Asset Management division.</p>
<p>&quot;Any risk to the (stock) market at this point forward is to the downside rather than to the upside,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Among the market features, Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s CBS unit said Peter Lund, president of its CBS television and cable group, had resigned. Analysts said the executive-suite shakeup would be a boost to the slumping television network. Westhinghouse's shares rose 1-3/4 to 18-3/4.</p>
<p>Medtronic Inc. rose five to 71-7/8 after the medical device company late Thursday reported upbeat quarterly results. J.P. Morgan Securities raised its fiscal 1998 and 1999 earnings estimates on Medtronic, citing the strong earnings.</p>
<p>Stocks of computer disk drive companies extended their decline after two brokerages cut their earnings estimates on Seagate Technology Inc. and on investor fears that disk drive prices will decline further, traders said.</p>
<p>Seagate fell 2-1/8 to 40-1/4, Read-Rite Corp. dropped 2-1/8 to 19-7/8, Western Digital Corp. lost 4-1/4 to 52-7/8 and Quantum Corp. gave back 3/8 to 38.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange index gained 4.21 points to 597.94. The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 5.62 to 440.28. The average NYSE share was up 55 cents.</p>
