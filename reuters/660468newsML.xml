<headline>Simpson's house being sold; lawyer grilled on assets.</headline>

<p>O.J. Simpson, ordered to pay $33.5 million to the families of his murdered ex-wife and her friend, is putting his mansion up for sale, lawyers trying to collect the damages said Thursday.</p>
<p>On the third anniversary of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, the lawyers spent five hours behind closed doors grilling the ex-football star's business attorney about his client's assets.</p>
<p>Several times they came out into Judge David Perez' court to complain that Leroy &quot;Skip&quot; Taft, Simpson's long-time business attorney, was not forthcoming.</p>
<p>Taft later declined to give any details to reporters outside the Santa Monica courthouse where last Febraury Simpson was found responsible for the murders.</p>
<p>Simpson was sued for wrongful death by the victims' families in civil court following his 1995 acquittal on criminal murder charges.</p>
<p>The former star running-back and later TV and movie actor and advertising pitchman was not in court Thursday.</p>
<p>Lawyers Peter Gelblum and Peter Csato, who represent the Goldman family, told reporters a trustees' sale was scheduled for mid-July for Simpson's Los Angeles home, which is valued at more than $3 million and is facing foreclosure.</p>
<p>However, there was little chance proceeds from the sale would go to the Goldmans since the money was earmarked for the mortgage company and also to pay off Simpson's legal fees.</p>
<p>They said Simpson was currently drawing $25,000 a month pension from his production company, Orenthal Productions.</p>
<p>After taxes he receives around $16,000 a month, though this was probably exempt from paying off the damages award, the lawyers said.</p>
<p>They said they had also complained that $50,000 Simpson was paid for a German TV appearance went to pay other lawyers' fees.</p>
<p>Among Simpson's assets is the Heisman Trophy he won as the top college football player. When asked about it by reporters, Taft replied: &quot;I'm only the business manager, I don't deal in sports trophies.&quot;</p>
<p>He became testy when one reporter asked of Simpson: &quot;Is he looking for the real killer today?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't spoken to him today,&quot; Taft snapped back.</p>
