<title>MEXICO: Mexico stocks pare losses, but end sharply down.</title>
<headline>Mexico stocks pare losses, but end sharply down.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican stocks recovered from earlier lows at the close of trade on Tuesday on the coattails of a rebound on Wall Street, but were still sharply down on fears of further rises in U.S. interest rates, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The session was very apathetic in volume terms. It was a bear market again and we thought it could get quite ugly, but the recovery by the Dow kept the market in check,&quot; a Mexico City floor trader said.</p>
<p>The leading IPC share index ended down 33.72 points, or 0.90 percent, at 3,714.26.  </p>
<p>Trading volume was lackluster at 61.5 million shares.</p>
<p>The IPC had reached a low of 3,684.17 points in mid-afternoon trade.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones, meanwhile, closed up 0.42 percent at 6,611.05 points, up from a session low of 6,522.67.</p>
<p>&quot;The volatile Dow Jones is still hauling Mexico along. We thought (the IPC) would hit bottom at 3,650 points, but it stopped short,&quot; said Diego Cndamo, head of research at the Ixe brokerage.  </p>
<p>&quot;Forecast of additional hikes in U.S. interest rates is weighing the market down and diverting attention from positive domestic factors,&quot; Candamo added.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market took no notice of positive manufacturing employment and retail sales figures released in early trade.</p>
<p>U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds were up 6/32 to yield 7.08 percent as the foreign exchange markets were closing in Mexico, after being down 5/32 in early trade to yield 7.12 percent.  </p>
<p>U.S. long bond yields were still much higher than this time last week, however, and traders said they expected domestic primary rates to increase later in the day.</p>
<p>Money market traders surveyed by Reuters forecast Banco de Mexico would assign bellwether 27-day Cetes at an average rate of 21.22 percent. This would be a gain of 63 basis points since last week's auction.</p>
<p>On the broad market, 91 stocks changed hands, of which 65 declined and just 13 ended ahead.</p>
<p>Retail chain Sears de Mexico was a prominent gainer, up 1.40 pesos to close at 14.90 pesos.  </p>
<p>Traders noted the stock bucked a generally bearish market to notch up sharp gains for the second day in a row. Several traders said they heard rumours of a &quot;sale of assets&quot; by the company.</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck and Co. owns 75 percent of Sears de Mexico.</p>
<p>Market heavyweight Telmex L shares ended up 14 centavos at 15.36 pesos. The L class accounted for 19 percent of all shares traded during the session.</p>
<p>Telmex ADRs meanwhile closed unchanged at 38-1/2.  </p>
<p>Traders noted Telmex L shares had been up for most of the session, while its ADRs had often been down, which they said was due to arbitrage trading triggered by a zigzagging peso-dollar exchange rate.</p>
<p>Benchmark 48-hour peso contracts ended unchanged at 7.9120/7.9140 per dollar, after opening 1.1 centavos weaker.</p>
