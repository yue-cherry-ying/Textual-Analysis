<p>Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said on Sunday he had sent an emergency response team to study the Hudson Foods Inc. plant that handled 1.2 million pounds of frozen hamburger recalled this week.</p>
<p>The Agriculture Department on Friday announced the largest recall of U.S. ground beef products in history, citing possible contamination with a deadly strain of the E. coli bacterium after reports of 16 cases of bacterial illness in Colorado in July.</p>
<p>Glickman told CNN's &quot;Late Edition&quot; program that officials from the department's food safety division and its inspector general's office were on their way to the Hudson Foods plant in Columbus, Nebraska.</p>
<p>&quot;I've sent the SWAT team out to this particular plant because I want to send a signal throughout the industry that we will not tolerate practices which are ... incompatible with public health,&quot; Glickman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We got to find out why it happened and put a stop to it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The agriculture officials will investigate the nature and quantity of the food supply that was affected, Glickman said. He added that he would keep a close eye on the probe.</p>
<p>The amount of meat being recalled is far beyond any previous ground beef recall and 60 times the 20,000 pounds that the Agriculture Department initially said Hudson Foods was recalling. The size of the recall could continue to mount as the department investigates.</p>
<p>Hudson Foods was responsible in 1995 for the biggest meat recall before this one, and the company was fined more than $300,000 last month by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for repeated violations of federal worker safety rules, the Washington Post reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm concerned that the thing grew so rapidly and that also happened a few years ago,&quot; Glickman said, but he added that the company had &quot;by and large&quot; been operating safely and it was still unclear whether the meat became tainted during processing at the plant or was already contaminated when if arrived from one of the company's beef suppliers.</p>
<p>Hudson Foods has called a telephone news conference for 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to examine this particular plant to determine if they're doing what they should have been doing,&quot; Glickman said.</p>
<p>Asked why the company was still operating after two such large recalls, Glickman said: &quot;I'm not in a postion to judge the company right now. ... We have to conduct an investigation to determine if there is a pattern or not.&quot;</p>
<p>He said U.S. consumers had the safest food in the world and noted that new meat safety rules were in the process of being implemented at processing plants around the country.</p>
<p>The plant in question was new and medium-sized, which meant it did not yet have to implement all new federal rules, which are being phased in over two to three years.</p>
<p>Glickman said his department needed more inspectors and better tools -- such as the ability to impose civil penalties -- to bolster its enforcement of the new meat safety rules.</p>
<p>But he said consumers also had a role to play by learning to handle meat safely and cook it at high enough temperatures.</p>
