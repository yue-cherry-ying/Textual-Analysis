<p>U.S. special envoy Desaix Anderson arrived in Cambodia on Saturday but was not expected to meet either of the country's two prime ministers, United States and Cambodian officials said.</p>
<p>Anderson had hoped to meet powerful co-premier Hun Sen, a U.S. embassy official said, but Hun Sen was unable to meet the U.S. envoy because the premier's mother was seriously ill, an aide to Hun Sen said.</p>
<p>The U.S. embassy official said Anderson had not planned a meeting with Ung Huot, Cambodia's foreign minister and newly appointed first prime minister.</p>
<p>Hun Sen ousted his former coalition partner and co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a bloody July 6 takeover and then supported Ung Huot's nomination to replace the prince.</p>
<p>But a U.S. government official said Wednesday's vote in the Cambodian parliament approving Ung Huot's nomination as first prime minister was undemocratic due to the atmosphere of intimidation in the country.</p>
<p>Anderson told reporters upon his arrival that the United States would continue to deal with the Phnom Penh government.</p>
<p>&quot;We won't be presenting anything in terms of a plan,&quot; Anderson told reporters when asked of his mission to Cambodia.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is very clear we will continue to deal with the Cambodian government despite our reaction to the election (in parliament) a few days ago,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The United States said on Friday it was extending indefinitely its suspension of aid to the Cambodian government but said direct help for the Cambodian people would continue.</p>
<p>The United States suspended its aid programme to Cambodia for 30 days after Hun Sen's takeover.</p>
<p>&quot;The Secretary (of State) has decided today to extend indefinitely the suspension of assistance to Cambodia until progress towards free and fair elections has been made,&quot; U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin told a regular news conference. Elections are planned for May next year.</p>
<p>&quot;During this suspension period our estimate is roughly two thirds of the assistance that had been...planned will be suspended because that assistance would go one way or another to the government of Cambodia,&quot; Rubin said.</p>
<p>But he said about $20 million would still be available for humanitarian needs.</p>
<p>Washington allocated $35 million in aid to Cambodia for fiscal 1997, which ends in September.</p>
<p>Anderson, a career diplomat, is a member of a task force on Cambodia set up by the U.S. State Department and his visit is a follow-up to one made by former U.S. Congressman Stephen Solarz in late July, a U.S. embassy official said.</p>
<p>Hun Sen angrily rejected outside interference in Cambodia's affairs soon after he ousted Ranariddh but he met Solarz for talks and has begun a dialogue with an Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) mediation mission.</p>
<p>The U.S. said it backs ASEAN's Cambodia mediation effort.</p>
<p>Anderson was due to meet representatives of non governmental organisations in Cambodia before his departure on Sunday, a U.S. embassy official said.</p>
