<p>Russia's Norilsk Nickel metals group said in a statement on Friday that it had a consolidated loss of 3.29 trillion roubles ($571.9 million) for 1996 and was showing signs of bankruptcy requiring radical action within six months.</p>
<p>The figure appeared to be calculated according to Russian accounting standards, but Norilsk spokesmen and an auditor from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the firm which had a contract to review Norilsk figures, could not say how the numbers had been arrived at and declined to comment. The Norilsk statement said Coopers did not have a licence to work with Russian companies whose production is a state secret and that it would be replaced with a Russian firm.</p>
<p>Norilsk said that it wanted to create a joint venture with Finnish metals company Outokumpu to work on the Sever and Central ore-mines in the Kola Peninsula, but it gave no details.</p>
<p>Norilsk is one of the world's most significant producers of nickel, platinum group metals and cobalt, as well as of copper and other metals. The statement said nothing about production or exports.</p>
<p>Norilsk Nickel had a 1995 consolidated pre-tax profit of nearly 5.5 trillion roubles, but it was not clear whether this figure was comparable with the loss announced today.</p>
