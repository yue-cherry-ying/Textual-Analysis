<p>Beijing has promised that Hong Kong ethnic minorities will be eligible for passports after the territory's reversion to Chinese sovereignty later this year, the Indian Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Lu Ping, China's top official on the transition, assured the group during a meeting in Beijing that ethnic minorities wishing to get Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) passports will have no problem, subject to residency and other rules, the chamber said in a statement.</p>
<p>Ethnic minorities in Hong Kong, mostly of Indian and Pakistani origin, had feared possible statelessness following the British colony's reversion to China at midnight June 30.</p>
<p>That fear was removed when London in February promised to grant full British passports to up to 8,000 minorities.</p>
<p>But chamber chairman Raj Sital told Lu on Tuesday that there were likely to be those who preferred the SAR passport as they regarded Hong Kong as home, the chamber said.</p>
<p>Lu also said there was likely to be no change in the visa-free entry arrangments for Indian visitors to Hong Kong, adding that Beijing was seeking visa-free entry into India for SAR passport holders.</p>
<p>Lu noted it was important for Hong Kong to maintain a fairly relaxed arrangement for business visitors in view of its status as an international trade and finance centre, the chamber said.</p>
