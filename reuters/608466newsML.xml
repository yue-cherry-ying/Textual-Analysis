<p>Latvian Economy Minister Guntar Krasts denied conflict of interest allegations on Friday and said he sees no reason for resigning.</p>
<p>Saimnieks, the biggest party in the country's unweildy eight-party coalition, submitted materials to Prime Minister Andris Shkele on May 22 which alleged that Krasts violated anti-corruption laws by keeping his post in an alcohol trading company after he became minister.</p>
<p>Krasts said that his ties with the company ceased in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not think I have to resign,&quot; Krasts told a news conference.</p>
<p>Krasts, representing the coalition's third biggest party, Fatherland and Freedom (FP), said Saimnieks was trying to force FP out of the government.</p>
<p>&quot;If similar attempts continues I see a possibility that FP might leave the coalition,&quot; Krasts said.</p>
<p>Shkele has demanded additional information on the issue from the relevant state bodies and will have a &quot;clearer view of the situation&quot; on Monday, a government spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Latvian government is going through a rough patch this month with the defence minister sacked amid a fuel purchace scandal and the welfare minister resigning over a pension law disagreement with DSP.</p>
