<p>England's impressive run of victories continued on Saturday when skipper Alan Shearer scored five minutes from time for a 1-0 win over France in a fiercely-contested Tournoi de France match.</p>
<p>Following a highly efficient 2-0 World Cup win in Poland last Saturday, and an inspired 2-0 victory over Italy in Nantes on Wednesday, England withstood a tremendous physical assault from the French to steal the winner after keeper Fabien Barthez' only mistake of the match.</p>
<p>Shearer pounced after Barthez failed to hold on to a low, hard cross from Teddy Sheringham, who had replaced Ian Wright only five minutes earlier.</p>
<p>The ball squirmed free to Shearer, who cracked it into the empty net for his 11th goal in his last 11 internationals and the 16th of his England career.</p>
<p>It gave England their first win in France for 48 years, sent France to only their second defeat in 36 matches under coach Aime Jacquet and extended England's winning run to six matches.</p>
<p>French manager Aime Jacquet said afterwards: &quot;The fans must be patient. This was a very tough game, but we are still evolving. But it is very frustrating to lose to a goal like that.&quot;</p>
<p>England coach Glenn Hoddle said: &quot;If we come back for the World Cup next year then we're going to have to play in games like that. We had good chances in the first half, in the second they came at us, and we played deeper but with Alan Shearer in the team you always have a chance.&quot;</p>
<p>This match, between the two losing Euro'96 semifinalists, started out as a scrappy battle but finished on a high note after some vastly-improved second half play from both sides, especially the French who carried the game to their opponents.</p>
<p>France, playing with an experimental attacking formation of Christophe Dugarry and Nicolas Ouedec, had three great chances to score after the interval.</p>
<p>Dugarry volleyed and then headed just over the bar twice in two minutes before Pierre Laigle unleashed a fierce left-foot volley from 18 metres. England goalkeeper David Seaman did well to punch clear.</p>
<p>England also had four good scoring chances, but were denied each time by some inspired play from Barthez, who until his late mistake had an outstanding match.</p>
<p>He denied Ian Wright what appeared to be a certain goal when he pushed his close range shot over the bar after 41 minutes and then made two excellent saves from two Shearer headers after 34 and 66 minutes. Then a minute after Sheringham came on in the 80th minute, Barthez denied him with another good diving save.</p>
<p>The match improved after a poor start when Moroccan referee Said Belgola seemed about to lose control of the game.</p>
<p>The referee was at the centre of a bizarre incident in the 13th minute when he booked England midfielder David Beckham for refusing to be stretchered off when he preferred to hobble off the field for treatment after a fierce tackle from Patrick Vieiri.</p>
<p>Despite the absurdity of the yellow card, it was enough to keep Beckham out of England's next match against world champions Brazil in Paris on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Jacquet made eight changes from the French side that drew 1-1 with Brazil on Tuesday while Hoddle made six changes from the side that beat Italy, restoring Paul Gascoigne to the starting line-up for his 50th cap.</p>
<p>Gascoigne played well in patches, but was a long way short of his peak and had nothing like the impact of his opposite number Youri Djorkaeff.</p>
<p>The Inter Milan midfielder was at the heart of every French movement and they were unlucky some of his inspired play failed to produce a goal.</p>
<p>The victory keeps England in first place in the four-team tournament after their win over Italy, who play world champions Brazil in Lyon on Sunday.</p>
