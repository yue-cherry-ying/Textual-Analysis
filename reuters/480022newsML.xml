<p>U.S. West Coast spot product prices fell Monday after Tosco averted a potential refinery strike and an early morning fire was contained quickly at a small California refinery, traders said.</p>
<p>A Tosco official on Saturday said union workers and the company reach a labor contract agreement that ends the chance of strike at four California refineries.</p>
<p>Traders shrugged off an early morning fire at Paramount Petroleum's Los Angeles refinery, saying the facility's production was too small to threaten supply.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if it burned the place down, it would have no effect,&quot; one broker said.  </p>
<p>Adequate supply had traders forecasting a soft market, with more production coming from Exxon and Mobil's refineries following their return from spring maintenance.</p>
<p>There was little buying interest for CARB unleaded gasoline in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Sellers talked CARB in L.A. at 84 cents gallon, down two cents from late Thursday spot trade.</p>
<p>CARB diesel, which was active last week, rose 0.50 early Monday amid trader talk of a blending problem ARCO's Carson, plant. &quot;We saw them buying last week,&quot; one broker said, adding they had since dropped out.</p>
