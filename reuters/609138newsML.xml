<p>Japan's Ministry of Finance said on Friday it would deal seriously with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd if the bank were proven to have violated laws.  </p>
<p>A MOF official told reporters that the bank may have falsified reports to the ministry in past regular inspections with the aim of avoiding an accurate assessment of its problem loans.</p>
<p>&quot;This act could be in violation of Japan's banking laws,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>The bank earlier on Friday announced that its president and chairman would resign to take managerial responsibility for its involvement in a scandal surrounding a corporate &quot;sokaiya&quot; racketeer.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Dai-Ichi Kangyo was raided by prosecutors investigating the bank's links with the &quot;sokaiya&quot;, who has been accused of taking illegal payoffs from Japan's top brokerage, Nomura Securities Co Ltd.  </p>
<p>&quot;It is quite regrettable that a financial institution with high public standing such as DKB has undermined the trust of depositors,&quot; said the official.</p>
<p>He said the ministry has instructed the bank to check if it has made similar questionable loans to others.</p>
<p>Japan's banking law bans financial institutions from making false reports to the ministry when the ministry conducts inspections, the official said. Any banks which violate the law must pay a fine of up to 500,000 yen, but no banks have ever been fined.</p>
<p>&quot;Considering the fact that no banks have ever been punished under the law, it would be a very hard social punishment if any banks were to be punished,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;At any rate, we will take some action against DKB at the stage when facts become clear,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The ministry will check if DKB has had a sufficiently sound management system and if the bank has adequately fulfilled its public role, he added.</p>
