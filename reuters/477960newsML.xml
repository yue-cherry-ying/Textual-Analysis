<p>The Clinton administration is on course to complete its proposal for opening power markets to competition in time for House hearings, Energy Secretary Federico Pena said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The electricity restructuring proposal has been in the works for several months and is now being vetted by the White House before being sent to several other agencies for comments.</p>
<p>&quot;We're in good shape in terms of where we are and where the Congressional schedule is,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Industry officials had viewed the Clinton administration as lagging behind the rest of the government in weighing the issue of electricity restructuring.</p>
<p>But Pena noted that the House, which has been leading the federal moves toward customer choice in electricity markets, has postponed its hearings until after lawmakers hold meetings around the country later this month.</p>
<p>&quot;I think what's interesting is that the Congress has slowed down the process,&quot; he told a group of reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;People are beginning to appreciate just how complicated this issue is,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Pena declined to say whether he favored imposing a deadline on states to open their power markets to competition.</p>
<p>&quot;A final decision hasn't been made on just how much we want to push the question of a mandate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said protecting the environment from power plant pollution would be an element of the administration's policy.</p>
<p>&quot;I would expect that the environmental issue will be addressed in one way or another, either in the legislation or elsewhere,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He confirmed that the Energy Department's position was to leave many decisions about electric restructuring, including recovery of utilities' stranded investments, up to states.</p>
