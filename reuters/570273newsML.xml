<p>The British Treasury moved quickly on Thursday to dampen speculation Britain planned to rejoin the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), but failed to quell the suspicion it wants a lower pound.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no truth in it at all,&quot; a Treasury spokeswoman said, in reponse to an overnight newswire report which quoted a senior Labour Party source as saying ERM re-entry might be attractive for sterling if the central rate was 2.50 marks, sharply below current levels.</p>
<p>The report,carried by Bridge news agency, gave no date for rejoining the currency grid, but market rumours rapidly supplied one -- 2001. The pound slumped by almost four pfennigs overnight as the story gained credence.</p>
<p>Despite the official denial, the pound recouped only around half of its lost ground on Thursday morning, clawing its way back up to near 2.79 marks compared with an overnight low of around 2.7750.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very grudging rally,&quot; said CIBC chief economist David Coleman.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the Treasury has denied rumours about the ERM, there may still be a suspicion that the Labour Party would be fairly happy to see the pound lower,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The question is whether this is a deliberate leak or whether it's down to inexperience,&quot; Coleman said.</p>
<p>The pound has gained around 19 percent since last August, causing further problems for Britain's beleagured manufacturing sector by making exports dearer.</p>
<p>British finance minister Gordon Brown said on Tuesday that he wanted to see a &quot;stable and competitive&quot; pound and there is speculation this could mean a desire for a weaker currency.</p>
<p>Labour ended 18 years of rule by the Conservative Party by sweeping to power at last Thursday's election, and has courted financial market confidence with the surprise move of giving the Bank of England operational independence to set interest rates.</p>
<p>Britain's base rate was raised to 6.25 percent from 6.0 percent on Tuesday, and is expected to go up again in the near future as the central bank tries to ensure inflation falls below 2.5 percent and stays there. This should give the pound some help, analysts say.</p>
<p>&quot;We suspect that the overnight move was overdone and the prospect of further tightening in monetary policy will be supportive,&quot; said Bank of America economist Jeremy Hawkins.</p>
<p>&quot;However, any appreciation is likely to be less swift than it was in the past,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs economist Gavyn Davies, widely tipped to be appointed second Bank of England deputy governor, attributed the overnight fall in sterling to the decline in the dollar rather than the report.</p>
<p>&quot;What's happened overnight is that the dollar has come down and the pound is trading down against the yen and the deutschemark in line with the dollar. I suspect that's the main thing that's going on,&quot; he told BBC radio 4's Today programme.</p>
<p>He added that such rumours were inevitable given that Labour was more pro-European than the previous government..</p>
<p>&quot;I think we are going to get that sort of rumour persistently now because the government obviously is doing things which bring it closer to the European Union and I think this kind of rumour is going to occur,&quot; Davies said.</p>
<p>Sterling left the ERM in September 1992, after 10 billion pounds of foreign exchange intervention failed to keep the currency near its central rate within the system, which is designed to be a pre-cursor to a single European currency. No return date was set.</p>
<p>Labour, which scored a landslide victory over the ruling Conservative Party at Thursday's election, has said that Britain is unlikely to join the single European currency at its launch in January 1999. Any future decision to join would be subject to test of the national interest and a referendum.</p>
<p>But analysts say the overnight story has reinforced the market view that Britain is more likely to join a single European currency under Labour than it was under the Conservatives.</p>
<p>&quot;It will add to the feeling that the new government is more likely to eventually take the pound into a single currency,&quot; Bank of America's Hawkins said.</p>
