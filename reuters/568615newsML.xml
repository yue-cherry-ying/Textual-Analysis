<p>Berkshire Hathaway Inc chairman and chief executive Warren Buffett on Thursday said US Airways Group Inc's planned efficiency improvement measures show the company's sense of urgency about its future.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been associated with US Airways for a number of years and I believe these actions represent a level of foresight and a sense of urgency essential to its future,&quot; said Buffett.</p>
<p>Bershire Hathaway owns about $358 million worth of US Airways preferred stock, with about 10 percent of total US Airways voting rights.  </p>
<p>&quot;The company's new management is ready to act in the best interests of all shareholders, employees and communities served -- and now is the time to act,&quot; Buffett said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the labor groups have the will, I know management has the ability to make this airline the global competitor everyone wants it to be,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, US Airways said it will stop flying some of its most unprofitable routes, close excess facilities and ground 22 aircraft as part of an efficiency program.</p>
<p>Service to nine cities will be eliminated.  Some employee furloughs are expected, but the company said it will work with union leaders and employee groups to minimize the impact on personnel.</p>
<p>The company made no estimate of the cost savings from the plan, nor any one-time costs connected with its implementation.</p>
<p>It also said it is committed and hopeful that labor talks will enable it to put in place a competitive cost structure.</p>
