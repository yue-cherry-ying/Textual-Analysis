<p>Zaire's embattled leader Mobutu Sese Seko and a handful of fellow French-speaking African presidents held a mini-summit in Gabon on Thursday as part of the hunt for a peaceful end to the war threatening his capital.</p>
<p>South Africa, which brought Mobutu and his civil war rival Laurent Kabila together on a South African ship on Sunday, said peace moves appeared on track and Kabila's rebels seemed to be respecting a pledge to halt their march on Kinshasa.</p>
<p>In Tanzania, South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said a second meeting between Mobutu and Kabila was set for next Wednesday, adding that the place was uncertain because of Mobutu's health. He has been suffering from prostate cancer.</p>
<p>In Paris, U.S. special envoy Bill Richardson said a fresh summit was crucial to ensure a peaceful transfer of power.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the probability is high for a second meeting and I'm also encouraged that this second meeting will produce a result that does not involve a violent end, and that includes also an inclusive transitional government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In Cape Town, President Nelson Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, told reporters earlier: &quot;There is no reason to believe Mr Kabila is not keeping to his undertaking that he will stop movement of his troops on all fronts.&quot;</p>
<p>Witnesses said Mobutu, sporting his trademark leopard skin cap, embraced Gabonese president Omar Bongo, another veteran leader who came to power in 1967, two years after Mobutu.</p>
<p>The two met at the presidential palace with the presidents of Chad, Congo, the Central African Republic and former Spanish colony Equatorial Guinea. Cameroon, current chairman of the Organisation of African Unity, sent its foreign minister.</p>
<p>One Zairean opposition newspaper, the Potentiel, dubbed the meeting Mobutu's &quot;Goodbye summit&quot; but Zaire's information minister, Kin-Kiey Mulumba, rejected suggestions that his departure for Gabon was a veiled flight into exile.</p>
<p>He said the only thing that would prevent Mobutu from returning immediately would be another meeting. &quot;He is coming back after the summit, unless there is another meeting. There is no reason why the president should flee the country, no reason.&quot;</p>
<p>His ministry later withdrew the accreditation of four Reuters journalists and a producer for the U.S.-based television company Cable News Network and told them to leave the country, accusing them of breaching accreditation guidelines.</p>
<p>Mandela promised after Sunday's inconclusive meeting in Congo's port of Pointe Noire that he would bring Kabila and Mobutu back together within 10 days.</p>
<p>Mankahlana said South Africa expected the two men's aides would first thrash out a formula &quot;which we hope will define very clearly the roles of both in the transition process&quot;.</p>
<p>On the war front, several hundred civilians and fighters from both sides were reported dead after a battle for Kenge, a town 200 km (125 miles) east of Kinshasa. Humanitarian and church sources tried to check whether massacres took place.</p>
<p>Mobutu, 66, has dominated Africa's third largest country for more than three decades. Kabila and his rebels, who took up arms in October demanding Zairean nationality for ethnic Tutsis, now control three quarters of the mineral-rich nation.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Bongo, Vincent Mavungu, said Thursday's mini-summit aimed to help the search for a negotiated settlement.</p>
<p>Residents of Kenge, in radio contact with Kinshasa, said the rebels controlled the town on Wednesday after Mobutu's forces recaptured it briefly on Sunday night. They said at least 200 civilians, 106 government soldiers and 15 rebels were killed.</p>
<p>Kinshasa was reported calm on Thursday but residents of the city of five million people remain apprehensive -- a mood reflected in the capital's newspapers.</p>
<p>The independent Reference Plus quoted Mobutu's security adviser Honore Ngbanda as saying the city was a powderkeg and any fire lit there could be very difficult to put out.</p>
<p>In northeastern Zaire on Thursday, the head of Rwanda's repatriation commission arrived in Kisangani to visit a refugee camp where dozens of Rwandan Hutus are dying daily.</p>
<p>Aid officials said Ephraim Kabaija, chairman of a group set up to oversee reintegration of over two million Hutu refugees into Rwandan life, went to Biaro camp south of the city.</p>
<p>He was expected to talk with officials of the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR on conditions there and an airlift that took a further 1,150 refugees back to Kigali on Thursday.</p>
