<p>Colombia's minister of mining and energy said on Friday that the United States' blacklisting of Colombia was no roadblock to investment in the energy-rich country.</p>
<p>Rodrigo Villamizar, in a meeting with members of the Japanese banking community to court Japanese investment in the development of Colombia's huge hydrocarbon reserves, acknowleged his country's rampant drug trade.</p>
<p>&quot;We have accepted that we have a (drug) problem, and we are trying to eradicate it,&quot; Villamizar said. &quot;Most drug kingpins are now either in jail or are dead.</p>
<p>&quot;But ultimately, the United States will need to come to terms with its own (foreign policy) position,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In February, President Bill Clinton &quot;decertified&quot; Colombia for the second straight year, in a U.S. gesture indicating that the home of notorious drug cartels was no ally in the international fight against narcotics.</p>
<p>Certification is the process under which the U.S. president approves the performance of foreign countries in fighting drug smuggling.</p>
<p>The measure, which has been criticised in Washington as a blunt instrument, groups Colombia with a list of virtual pariah states -- Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Nigeria and Syria.</p>
<p>&quot;Colombia still has 10,000 to 20,000 people involved in the drug trade,&quot; Villamizar said. &quot;But we also have 40 million hard-working citizens with something of a Protestant work ethic.&quot;</p>
<p>Villamizar said Colombia had experienced little difficulty in securing foreign investment as a result of the U.S. measures. &quot;When Colombia was decertified for the first time, two years ago, we briefly lost a loan for the construction of the Cusiana pipeline, but it only took three hours for (U.S.) Chase Manhattan Bank to offer the same amount of money,&quot; Villamizar said. &quot;And at a better interest rate,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Villamizar was refering to loans for the construction of the Oleoducto central S.A. (Ocensa) pipeline, which will connect Colombia's giant Cusiana and Cupiagua oil fields to the Caribbean coast terminal at Covenas (tilda).</p>
<p>Cusiana and Cupiagua, which lie in the eastern foothills of the eastern Andes, contain at least two billion barrels of oil reserves.</p>
<p>Last October, the Ocensa project was granted a further $121 million credit by the Export-Import Bank of Japan.</p>
<p>A month earlier the Ex-Im Bank provided $300 million as an untied loan to Colombia's state oil company Ecopetrol for the expansion of the Cusiana and Cupiagua oil fields.</p>
<p>Asked whether the U.S. stance would influence future energy development loans to Bogota, a spokesman for the Export-Import Bank of Japan said it was unlikely. &quot;We don't make loans based on drug issues,&quot; he said. The total cost of the 500 mile (800 km) pipeline is expected to be about $2 billion and it is scheduled for completion by the end of 1997.</p>
