<p>Continental Airlines Inc. and its pilots were far apart Friday on key sections of a new labour pact as the two sides prepared to resume negotiations next week with a federal mediator, a union officer said.</p>
<p>With talks stalled over wage and benefit proposals, negotiators for the Houston-based carrier and its pilots union were set to hold their first meeting Wednesday in Washington with National Mediation Board mediator Harry Bickford, union President Len Nikolai said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're so far apart, the only way we are going to get a deal is in mediation,&quot; said Nikolai, a 32-year Continental veteran and president of the Independent Association of Continental Pilots.</p>
<p>At a union board meeting this week the pilots named a coordinator to begin working full-time on strike preparations in the event talks break down in the months ahead, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It takes six months to a year to get ready&quot; for a strike, Nikolai said. &quot;The company is not serious about an industry standard wage for our pilot group. Sooner or later, this pilot group will run out of patience.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Continental, the nation's fifth-largest airline, said the carrier remained confident of reaching agreement with its 5,000 pilots before a June 30 deadline. She declined to comment further on progress of the talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't negotiate in the press. We'll leave all that at the bargaining table,&quot; Continental's Sarah Anthony said.</p>
<p>In addition to a &quot;low-ball&quot; wage package that fell well short of the 35 percent to 60 percent wage hikes sought by the pilots, the company made no substantive improvements to its retirement plan, Nikolai said in a letter to the pilots.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the company's proposal, the pilot group would have to wait until the year 2002 before reaching levels of pay that will still fall short of today's industry standard,&quot; Nikolai said in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters.</p>
<p>Continental offered double-digit pay increases under a six-year agreement, with pay differentials based on the type of aircraft flown instead of longevity, he said.</p>
<p>Negotiators have reached agreement on most non-economic sections of the contract covering the 4,000 Continental pilots, but the two sides remain far apart on terms for 1,000 Continental Express pilots, he said.</p>
<p>Nikolai said he was puzzled by the slow pace of talks, which opened with both sides pledging to ink a new pact well before the June 30 amendable date of the current agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know if there is a Delta deal out there or if the company is trying to compress (the negotiations) to get a good deal,&quot; he said, referring to persistent rumours of a possible merger of Continental and Delta Air Lines Inc.</p>
<p>If Continental does merge with another airline, Nikolai said, its pilots likely would continue to work under the pact now being negotiated.</p>
<p>&quot;If we sign an inferior contract and then merge with somebody, we've just hosed ourselves,&quot; he said.</p>
