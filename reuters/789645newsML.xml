<p>Lyudmila Galkina, given up for dead after a serious car crash last October, celebrated her recovery by taking the world women's long jump title on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm just happy to be alive and here. I was involved in a serious car crash last October and for a short period the doctors thought I was going to die,&quot; the Russian said.</p>
<p>&quot;I certainly never thought I was going to jump again but fortunately I made a much better than expected recovery and started training again in January.&quot;</p>
<p>Niki Xanthou took the lead with a third round effort of 6.93 to send the home crowd into ecstasy but Greek hopes of their first gold medal of the championships were dashed just six jumps later.</p>
<p>Galkina produced her winning leap with a personal best and also a year's best of 7.05 metres with her fourth attempt and although Xanthou improved to 6.94 in the same round she fouled her two remaining attempts.</p>
<p>&quot;At least I have finally got a medal.&quot; Xanthou said.</p>
<p>Galkina burst into tears after the competition was over and they were still streaming when she spoke to the media later.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been like a dream. And I never expected to be in front of so many photographers and journalists.&quot;</p>
<p>Galkina likes Athens so much that she has decided to stay in the Greek capital for another week to celebrate her success.</p>
<p>By contrast, Italy's former champion Fiona May, will be looking for a quick departure after finishing third.</p>
<p>May was booed when she attempted her sixth and final jump when she might have overtaken Xanthou.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it was very unsporting. I was very unhappy at the way I was treated,&quot; she said.</p>
