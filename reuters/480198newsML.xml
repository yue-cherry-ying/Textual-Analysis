<p>The index of leading indicators, a key economic forecasting gauge, posted its largest increase in a year in February, a business research group said Tuesday, suggesting continued strong economic growth.</p>
<p>The Conference Board said the index rose by 0.5 percent in February after a 0.3 percent gain in January. The February rise in the index, which is designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months ahead, was the largest since a 0.9 percent rise last February, the business group said.</p>
<p>The February increase was slightly higher than the 0.4 percent rise forecasted by Wall Street analysts. The stronger-than-expected gain was the latest in a string of recent indicators suggesting the economy is picking up speed.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve last week boosted short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point, its first increase in more than two years, and cited the risk that strong demand might fire up inflationary wage and price rises.</p>
<p>Over the six months from August to February, the index increased by 1.1 percent, the private business group said.</p>
<p>It said that nine of 10 components of the leading index rose in February. The largest contributors to the rise were a drop in unemployment claims, a slowdown in deliveries, which suggested that suppliers were having a harder time meeting demand, and stock prices, which fell sharply in March.</p>
