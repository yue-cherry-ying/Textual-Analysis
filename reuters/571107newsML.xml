<p>A top Communist Party official has called for China's bloated bureaucracy to be streamlined, the China Daily said on Thursday.</p>
<p>People were still being hired by government departments and organisations despite a campaign aimed at controlling their size, the official newspaper quoted Hu Jintao, who sits on the party's powerful seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, as saying.</p>
<p>Specialised economic administration units should be separated from government departments and made independent units to trim the bureaucracy and boost efficiency, Hu said.</p>
<p>The government structure should be simplified, especially in poverty-stricken areas, and measures should be taken to ensure that it did not become bloated once again, he said.</p>
<p>While the number of urban workers in China had eased recently for the first time in many years, the number of employees in government organisations and institutions had soared, the China Daily said.</p>
<p>China has in recent years struggled to reform its huge civil service by introducing competitive entrance examinations and by sacking staff found to be incompetent. However, the size of the bureaucracy has slowed progress.</p>
