<p>Camilla Parker Bowles, mistress of Britain's Prince Charles, was recovering on Thursday after suffering slight injuries in a head-on car collision.</p>
<p>Parker Bowles, whose love for Britain's future king led to the collapse of his marriage, was driving her green Ford Mondeo estate car on her way to dinner with Charles at his west of England home Highgrove when the crash happened near her own house.</p>
<p>Police said the accident occurred towards dusk on Wednesday between the villages of Norton and Easton Grey in the county of Wiltshire.</p>
<p>The driver of the other vehicle was also treated for minor injuries, police said.</p>
<p>Parker Bowles, 49, who lives in the nearby village of Lacock, called police and an ambulance on her mobile phone.</p>
<p>Both Parker Bowles, who was alone in her car, and the other driver were given a routine test for alcohol, but both passed.</p>
<p>The Sun tabloid newspaper said Parker Bowles had telephoned the police post at Highgrove.</p>
<p>Prince Charles sent his own police bodyguard and two other members of his staff to the scene.</p>
<p>After giving a statement to police, Parker Bowles was taken to Highgrove, where she was said to be recovering.</p>
<p>A royal source was quoted as telling the paper: &quot;Camilla is very badly shaken up. She gave her head a very severe whack during the impact and twisted her wrist, possibly as she wrestled with the (steering) wheel.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very difficult part of the road and it was just getting dark. It could have been a lot worse.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sun said Parker Bowles was expected to remain at Highgrove until she recovers.</p>
<p>Parker Bowles is divorced from her cavalry officer husband, Andrew Parker Bowles. Charles, 48, was divorced from Princess Diana, 36, in February 1996 and has ruled out remarrying.</p>
