<headline>Euro oil swaps - Monthly CFDs jump 8 cts on spread.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>European oil swaps firmed on Thursday but trading remained quiet due to a widespread public holiday in Europe.</p>
<p>Brent futures jumped nearly 40 cents a barrel, helped by strong demand in the United States and signs that OPEC is preparing to freeze its production ceiling at its meeting next month.</p>
<p>Inter-month spreads also firmed helping to lift monthly CFD prices. The balance of May jumped 8 cents to 26 cents under the IPE while June moved up to 18 cents under and July 15 cents under.</p>
<p>&quot;When the spreads firm like today the nearby (monthly) CFDs always firm,&quot; said a broker.</p>
<p>Despite the gains on monthly CFDs, weekly levels fell back after early gains.</p>
<p>Next week's dates fell to 28 cents under July while the following week eased back to 27 cents under.</p>
<p>Fuel swaps climbed $1 a tonne, extending similar gains made on Wednesday. May barge swaps talked up to $85, dragged higher by firm Singapore swaps around $102.</p>
<p>But there was no activity on the physical market which kept swaps trading quiet.</p>
<p>Further forward the shape of the barge market was little changed despite reports on Wednesday of big Russian exports this summer.</p>
<p>Gasoline firmed $1 a tonne on June swaps which traded at $193.25 and $193.50. But May was stable around $194.50 for most of the day.</p>
<p>Middle distillates were flat although the underlying tone remained weak. Gas oil crack spreads held at $4.30 a barrel (3Q97), $4.85 (4Q97) and $4.70 (1Q98).</p>
