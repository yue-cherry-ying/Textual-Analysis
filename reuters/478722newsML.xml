<text>
<p>Brazilian government whips and economy officials were locked in talks over the text of a civil service reform bill due to be put to its first vote in the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea is that the vote goes ahead as scheduled tomorrow,&quot; said a spokeswoman for Deputy Benito Gama, the government's leader in the lower house.</p>
<p>Differences remain over a proposed ceiling on pay and pensions, which would cut the income of many lawmakers and threatens to split the government's multiparty alliance in Congress, she said.  </p>
<p>Planning Ministry officials were calculating the financial cost of exempting lawmakers and other categories of public sector workers from the proposed 10,800-reais ($10,188) monthly ceiling on pay and pensions, a ministry spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>However, Gama's spokeswoman said the text had not been altered so far.</p>
<p>Civil service reform is considered the most effective way to cut public spending. It would enable states and municipalities that spend more than 60 percent of their receipts on payrolls to dismiss workers whose jobs are currently guaranteed.</p>
<p>The bill was sent to Congress in August 1995. Since then, it has proceeded at a snail's pace in the face of opposition ranging from trade unions to government-allied parties.</p>
<p>As a constitutional amendment, the bill requires the approval of two three-fifths majority votes in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate.</p>
