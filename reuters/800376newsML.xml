<p>Turkish gold bourse members welcome the gold futures market to be launched on Friday, but expect a quiet start for a market little known to investors.</p>
<p>&quot;It is too early to say something about the market trade volume, because customers will determine the market. It will take some time to acquaint investors with the market,&quot; Ismail Yangk, head of the Association of Istanbul Gold Bourse Brokerages, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said that alongside producers, entering the market for hedging purposes, speculators were likely to play a major role.</p>
<p>Bourse members said the futures market, the first of its kind in Turkey, would indirectly determine lira and dollar prices for gold in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a thin trading volume at the beginning but later this will increase when the market is recognised,&quot; said trader Celal Camas of Kumova Kiymetli Madenler brokerage.</p>
<p>The Gold Bourse said in a statement on Wednesday that the market would operate under international laws and lower risks and producers' costs.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that in the six-month to one-year time period the futures trading will lead spot trading and speculators will be the main traders in the futures market,&quot; said Mert Yazicioglu, treasury group head at private Koc Bank.</p>
<p>Turkey is said to have the world's third biggest gold trading volume after Italy and India, at an annual 250 tonnes, including scrap gold.</p>
<p>Trading in lira- or dollar-based gold futures will take place between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. local time (0800-1300 GMT).</p>
<p>The size of futures contracts will be three kg (6.6 lb) and the maximum expiry periods will be six months for deals conducted in lira terms and one year for dollar-based deals.</p>
<p>There will be five types of futures orders -- market, limit, fill or kill, good till cancelled and stop loss.</p>
<p>Initially, the futures market will have 30 members, made up of 17 banks, seven foreign exchange and gold offices, three precious metal brokerages and three stock market brokerages.</p>
<p>A member will be able to hold a maximum of 1,000 futures contracts for itself and its customers for a certain delivery date and 5,000 in total at any one time.</p>
<p>A customer can buy a maximum of 100 futures contracts for a certain delivery date and a maximum of 250 in total at any time.</p>
<p>Initially 12 members, including 10 banks, will be authorised to carry out futures contract settlements on behalf of their customers and other members as well as for their own contracts.</p>
<p>The remaining 18 members can only settle contracts of their own.</p>
