<p>A senior Chinese official responsible for Hong Kong affairs said on Thursday that the territory would retain its capitalist way of life beyond the 50-year period that Beijing had already pledged.</p>
<p>Chen Ziying, deputy director of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, also reiterated the promises China has made to Hong Kong of minimal change and business as usual when Britain gives up sovereignty at midnight on June 30, 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;The One Country, Two Systems policy will not change for 50 years after 1997 and it will remain unchanged even beyond that period,&quot; Chen told a French Business Association luncheon in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The &quot;One country, Two systems&quot; policy of late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping pledged that the territory would be able to retain its capitalist freedoms and way of life intact for half a century beyond its reversion to China, now 54 days away.</p>
<p>The guarantee was enshrined in the Joint Declaration signed between China and Britain in 1984 governing the transition of power.</p>
<p>&quot;This is because we take into consideration the close relations between the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and the strategy of the development of China,&quot; Chen said.</p>
<p>&quot;As Deng Xiaoping in his lifetime put it so well: '50 years is only a vivid way of putting it. Even after 50 years our policy will not change either',&quot; Chen said.</p>
<p>Chen painted a glowing picture of Hong Kong's future.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Deng) went on to say these principles and policies should be acceptable not only to the people of Hong Kong but also to foreign investors, and first of all to Britain, because they will benefit them too,&quot; Chen said.</p>
<p>Chen said China had drawn up policies on Hong Kong with the intention of maintaining its status as an international trade and financial hub.</p>
<p>No official would be assigned from Beijing to administer Hong Kong, Chen said.</p>
<p>&quot;The monetary and financial relations between the Hong Kong SAR and the mainland (China) will be regulated entirely according to international practice. Mainland enterprises in Hong Kong will enjoy no privileges,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Democracy in Hong Kong will develop gradually, he said. The ultimate goal was for the leader and the legislature to be chosen by universal suffrage, he said.</p>
<p>Trade between China and Hong Kong rose 96 times in 18 years from 1978 to 1996, he said. He forecast China's gross national product would continue to expand by eight to nine percent a year over the next 15 years.</p>
