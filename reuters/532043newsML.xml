<p>China on Wednesday told U.S. leaders not to jeopardise ties by meeting the Dalai Lama, after U.S. President Bill Clinton signalled he would brave Beijing's wrath with a &quot;drop-by visit&quot; to the exiled Tibetan leader.</p>
<p>Clinton would drop in on a White House meeting on Wednesday between the Dalai Lama and Vice President Al Gore despite strong objections from Beijing, U.S. administration officials said.</p>
<p>Washington should not even have allowed the Tibetan spiritual leader, Beijing's greatest rival for the loyalties of the restless Himalayan region, to visit the United States, said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman.</p>
<p>&quot;Particularly (the United States) should not arrange any form of meeting between U.S. leaders and the Dalai Lama, in order to prevent new damage to Sino-U.S. relations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The warning came amid virulent condemnations of the Dalai Lama by China's state-controlled media, with newspapers slamming Tibet's supreme monk as a tool of hostile Westerners and an impediment to his region's development.</p>
<p>Beijing officials have said that if U.S. leaders meet the Dalai Lama they will see it as meaning that Washington backs what they call his attempts to split the Chinese motherland.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama's visit is the latest issue to test a cross-Pacific rapprochement that began in late 1996 after two years of Sino-U.S. diplomatic disputes over differences ranging from Taiwan to trade to human rights.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry spokesman gave no details of how Beijing would respond if the meeting between the Dalai Lama and Clinton went ahead, or whether it could affect a planned trip to Washington this month by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said the Dalai Lama is a welcome visitor to the White House, which uses presidential drop-by meetings as a diplomatic gambit to show support for controversial visitors while saving some face for objecting foreign governments.</p>
<p>Clinton used the method last week when Hong Kong democracy leader Martin Lee paid a call, and also dropped in on a meeting between Gore and the Dalai Lama when the Tibetan last visited Washington in September 1995.</p>
<p>Beijing routinely accuses the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule, of seeking independence for the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his peaceful campaign for Tibetan autonomy, says he seeks only genuine self-rule for his mountain homeland.</p>
<p>The globe-trotting monk's tours of Western nations have prompted angry responses from Beijing and have made him the target of ferocious editorials in the Chinese state press.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama was an obstacle to religious order who used Tibetan Buddhist beliefs as a political tool, said an editorial in the official People's Daily on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dalai Lama's activities to split the motherland are backed by Western anti-China forces, with whom he has colluded and for whom he has been a most willing tool, in order to fulfil his political scheme,&quot; said a separate editorial in the China Daily.</p>
<p>In an interview on a CNN talk show, the Dalai Lama said he had no wish to cause trouble for the United States and was not offended by the drop-by format of his White House reception.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not want to create embarrassment to anybody, that is not the point,&quot; he told host Larry King. &quot;To meet, person-to-person, to talk, that is important.&quot;</p>
