<p>Stock markets in Thailand and the Philippines fell sharply on Wednesday on negative local sentiment, while other Asia markets were mixed after a lacklustre session on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit another closing record on Tuesday, ending up 11 points at 7,225. But trading was hesitant, and dealers said it appeared the market may have run its course, at least for now. Tokyo stocks were down slightly on profit-taking after a steady rise in the past five sessions. The Nikkei 225-share average was off 156.62 points, or 0.78 percent, at 20,024.30. &quot;Despite the decline, the market mood is not bad,&quot; said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities. Hong Kong stocks ended the morning session 50.83 points, or 0.37 percent, higher at 13,630.17. Selective buying in property stocks outweighed profit-taking in some blue chips. &quot;The market is generally taking a breather after the gains of the last few days,&quot; said James Osborn, sales director of ING Barings. Thai stocks were battered on renewed concern over problem loans in the property sector, the completion of upcoming mergers and the impact a weak economy will have on corporate profits. The SET Index dropped 3.02 percent, or 19.43 points, to 623.85. Officials at Thai Danu Bank Plc and Finance One, Thailand's biggest finance company, told reporters their merger was still on and was set to close on May 15. Rumours had circulated recently the deal would not go through, dealers said. Manila's two-day rally came to a halt due to heavy selling in blue-chip companies. The key share index lost 82.13 points, or 2.96 percent, to close at 2,694.40. &quot;Although the market was up on Tuesday, there were already signs of profit-taking and we just saw a continuation,&quot; said Henry Ong, dealer at Sapphire Securities. Taiwan shares rallied after the government said it would reshuffle its cabinet, a move aimed at signifying determination to crack down on crime problems. Violent crime issues became a hot topic after the daughter of a local actress was found murdered. Singapore stocks tacked on a modest 0.8 point, or 0.04 percent, leaving the Straits Times Index at 2,056.48. Malaysian shares gained 14.90 points, or 1.37 percent, to 1,104.90. &quot;Buying is confined mainly to banking stocks, and support is coming mainly from local institutions,&quot; said Ramlan Ahmad, senior manager of fund managers Commerce MGI in Kuala Lumpur. Korean shares were down, hit by financial troubles at Yu Sung Co and a negative newspaper report on the Hansol Group. In Australia, the All Ordinaries Index was up 2.3 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,515.7, while in New Zealand stocks were advanced, encouraged by a lower interest rate and exchange rate environment. The NZSE-40 Cap Index was up 23.13 points, or 1.0 percent, at 2328.37 at the close.</p>
