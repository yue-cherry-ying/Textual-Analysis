<p>A church outing to a shooting range ended in disaster when a young woman accidentally shot and killed a friend, police said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Michael Chumney, 24, of Redmond, Wash., was pronounced dead late Monday (corrects date) shortly after he was shot by the 30-year-old woman, who apparently could not control the recoil on a .44-calibre revolver, Bellevue Police Lt. Bill Ferguson said.</p>
<p>Ferguson said Chumney and the woman, whose name was not immediately released, were part of a Mormon church group out for an evening of target practice at Wade's Eastside Gun Shop in suburban Seattle.</p>
<p>According to the witnesses, Chumney left his cubicle to let the woman try the Smith &amp; Wesson revolver he was using. He then stood closely behind her to watch.</p>
<p>As she fired, the gun climbed from the recoil, and her third shot was fired back over her shoulder, striking Chumney in the neck, Ferguson said.</p>
<p>He said police were investigating, but &quot;based on the information we've received from witnesses, we believe this is an accidental shooting.&quot;</p>
