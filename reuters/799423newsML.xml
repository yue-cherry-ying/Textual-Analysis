<p>A model who claims she was engaged to Dodi Al Fayed until pictures of him kissing Britain's Princess Diana appeared in newspapers sued the millionaire playboy on Thursday for breach of contract.</p>
<p>Kelly Fisher, 31, who with her willowy figure, blonde hair and shy smile in many ways resembles Diana, broke down in tears at a news conference as her attorney Gloria Allred related how her client was emotionally &quot;left at the altar,&quot; by the now famous &quot;kiss photo.&quot;</p>
<p>Allred said Al Fayed, a millionaire playboy, gave Fisher &quot;every indication that they were going to get married.&quot; Instead, the attorney added, &quot;He betrayed her and has humiliated her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To compound matters,&quot; Allred added, &quot;Ms. Fisher learned about Mr. Fayed's betrayal not from Mr. Fayed but instead from the 'kiss photo' that was published and circulated around the world to Ms. Fisher's utter dismay, shock and shame.&quot;</p>
<p>A series of more than 60 blurry pictures snapped by an Italian photographer showed Diana and Al Fayed kissing and embracing on his yacht in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Allred said that even while the photos were being taken, Fisher was on a nearby yacht also owned by the Al Fayed family. She said from the timing of the photos it appeared Al Fayed, 42, was romantically involved with the princess at the same time as he was promising marriage to Fisher.</p>
<p>&quot;If the time period reported by media of 'the kiss' in St. Tropez is accurate then it would appear that Mr. Fayed was spending at least part of his days and nights with Ms. Fisher in an intimate relationship (at the same time),&quot; Allred said.</p>
<p>Dodi Al Fayed's father, Mohamed Al Fayed, one of the richest men in the world, owns Harrods department store in London where the British royal family frequently shops.</p>
<p>&quot;Ms. Fisher loved, trusted and believed in Mr. Fayed. In return he took her love and gave her every indication they were going to get married, and he would fulfill all his promises to her,&quot; Allred said.</p>
<p>Al Fayed told Fisher he had bought a home in Paradise Cove, an exclusive Malibu neighborhood near Los Angeles, for them to live in, and he told her to start shopping for furnishings, Allred said.</p>
<p>As she spoke, Allred held one of two sapphire and diamond rings Fisher claims Al Fayed bought for her.</p>
<p>Allred said Fisher would not talk to the press, but when asked by a reporter why she was still wearing the other engagement ring, she sobbed &quot;because I loved him.&quot;</p>
<p>Fisher, wearing black slacks and a black short-sleeved knit sweater, was also asked if there was any chance of a reconciliation, and she replied emphatically, &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>Allred stressed the lawsuit was not a &quot;palimony suit&quot; even though Al Fayed &quot;led her emotionally all the way up to the altar and abandoned her when they were almost there.&quot;</p>
<p>Instead, the lawyer said it was based on certain financial promises that Al Fayed had made to Fisher to convince her to put her modeling career on hold to spend time with him.</p>
<p>Al Fayed, Allred alleged, also had given Fisher a check for &quot;a substantial amount of money&quot; but when she tried to cash it, it was returned marked &quot;account closed.&quot;</p>
<p>Fisher, who had modeled in the United States and Europe since the age of 17, met Al Fayed in Paris in July 1996, according to Allred, and he asked Fisher's parents for permission to marry her in November that year. He gave her the first engagement ring in December 1996 and a second one some months later.</p>
<p>Allred said she and Fisher wanted Diana to know about Fisher's experience with Al Fayed &quot;so that she can make an informed decision regarding her future and that of her children.&quot; Fisher was willing to meet the princess anywhere in the world on a confidential basis, Allred said.</p>
