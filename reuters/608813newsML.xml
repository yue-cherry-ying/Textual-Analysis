<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin kissed a fluffy toy rabbit he received as a gift after presenting a simplified version of his policies to Moscow school children on Friday .</p>
<p>&quot;If the economy and the financial sphere start growing, education will also get a big boost. I personally monitor the questions of education and I look into its future with optimism,&quot; Yeltsin told the children.</p>
<p>Russia is fighting a severe budget crisis but the government has said the economy is starting to grow slowly.</p>
<p>Education is one of the worst hit sectors, with hundreds of thousands of teachers living on low salaries that are often not paid for months on end.</p>
<p>Yeltsin also mentioned his new anti-corruption drive during his improvised speech at the secondary school where his granddaughter Masha is studying.</p>
<p>He said no government officials would escape having to declare their assets. &quot;Those who try to do so will be severely punished,&quot; he added. &quot;The tax service will watch them closely.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin said he had already filled in his own declaration, stating that his salary was lower than that of Russian bankers and businessmen.</p>
<p>&quot;But I am not complaining. I live in an official flat, I have an official residence. But I have taken a small loan to build a small country home and I have bought a BMW car,&quot; he said.</p>
