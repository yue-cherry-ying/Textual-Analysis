<p>Privatisation of Slovenia's biggest bank Nova Ljubljanska Banka (NLB) and the country's third-ranked bank Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor (NKBM) could start in 1998, NLB chief Marko Voljc said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;Presumably the law on the sale of state assets will be adopted this year and that would set the stage for bank privatisation,&quot; Voljc told reporters following a closed meeting of central European bank executives at the Slovenian Adriatic resort of Portoroz.</p>
<p>&quot;It is possible (bank) privatisation could start next year,&quot; Voljc added.</p>
<p>The green light for privatisation of the two unlisted banks was given on Thursday when the Bank of Slovenia established that the two banks fulfilled conditions to end a state restructuring programme which started in 1993.</p>
<p>The restructuring, deemed necessary because bank balance sheets were tainted by problem loans to old public sector enterprises, was managed by Slovenia's Bank Rehabilitation Agency.</p>
<p>During the restructuring, the government took over most of the two banks' non-performing assets from Slovenia's pre-independence days.</p>
<p>The government plans to privatise both banks, but has not yet set out a timetable for the selloff or how it will be carried out.</p>
<p>Charles Dallara, managing director of the Washington-based Institute of International Finance, pointed out the importance of privatisation which leads to ownership that &quot;enables managers to manage the bank (solely) in the interest of commercial performance and of shareholders' benefit.</p>
<p>&quot;The banks in the (central European) region are very well positioned to compete effectively in the years ahead also on an international scale,&quot; Dallara said.</p>
<p>NLB's market share in Slovenia is 28 percent, while NKBM has an 11.5 percent share.</p>
<p>There are currently 28 banks in Slovenia, many of which are privately owned.</p>
