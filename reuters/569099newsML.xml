<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin's long-delayed visit to Ukraine, aimed at smoothing strained relations between the two Slav neighbours, may take place on May 30, Itar-Tass news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Tass quoted Yeltsin's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, as saying Yeltsin had discussed the date of the visit with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma at a meeting in Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;The two leaders considered May 30 as a possible date for the visit,&quot; Yastrzhembsky said.</p>
<p>A Kremlin spokesman told Reuters he could not confirm Yastrzhembsky's remarks but had no reason to doubt the report.</p>
<p>Kuchma's spokesman, Dmitry Markov, was quoted by Interfax news agency in Moscow as saying that May 30 should be considered as a &quot;only a working hypothesis&quot;. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would first hold talks in Kiev.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin and Kuchma were due to meet in the Russian city of Novgorod later on Thursday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin and Kuchma took part as guarantors in signing a peace protocol between Moldova and its rebel Dnestr region on Thursday and spoke on the sidelines of the event.</p>
<p>Moscow and Kiev are at loggerheads over division of the former Soviet Black Sea fleet and differ on where the Russian share of warships should be based.</p>
<p>Kiev has been alarmed by demands by some leading Russian politicians that Sevastopol, the fleet's home port on the Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, be designated for sole Russian use.</p>
<p>Russia and Ukraine are also split on some economic issues.</p>
<p>Moscow and Kiev have so far failed to agree on the terms of a friendship treaty which would sort out major problems existing between them. Yeltsin has postponed a visit to Ukraine at least six times in the past two years.</p>
<p>Some Russian political analysts have suggested that the protracted row between Moscow and Kiev and mutual suspicion between them could prompt Ukraine, which has so far stuck to a neutral line, to seek closer links with NATO.</p>
<p>Moscow, which bitterly opposes the western alliance's plans to grant membership to some former Soviet-bloc states in central and eastern Europe, has voiced concern at recent visits to Kiev by top NATO officials. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana was in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin promised Kuchma during their last meeting on March 29 that he would visit Kiev in early June at the latest, irrespective of whether the friendship treaty is ready or not to</p>
