<p>Greek coupon bonds were licking their wounds holding mid-session price levels, depos and forex forwards were little changed and ecu/drachma was consolidating in late dealings, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices of fixed coupon bonds are holding in late dealings after being battered in early trade,&quot; said a dealer at a private bank.</p>
<p>Prices of fixed coupon bonds and two-year zeros dipped 10 to 50 basis points in early trade depending on the instrument.</p>
<p>Fixed coupon bonds might have to endure a new selling bout in the near future if the finance ministry decided to auction large amounts of three-, five-, seven- and 10-year coupon bonds on June 19, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Floaters stayed on the sidelines throughout this selling episode and prices have been little affected,&quot; said a bond dealer.</p>
<p>Deputy Finance Minister Nikos Christodoulakis said on Thursday that the treasury will issue 12-month T-bills at 9.60 percent on June 2, down 10 basis points, and reopen bids for three-, five- and seven-year coupon bonds on June 19.</p>
<p>Greece auctioned three-year, 9.80 percent bonds, five-year, 9.20 percent bonds and seven-year, 8.9 percent bonds on March 19.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 159.62/67 from Friday's 159.450 fix, the dollar at 269.87/97 drachmas from 269.560 and the ecu at 311.32/42 from 311.080 drachmas.</p>
<p>&quot;Ecu/drachma is trading around 311.30/35 in late dealings after easing to 311.5/10 after the central bank's intervention at the fixing,&quot; said a forex dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>Bank of Greece sold 130 million marks and 35 million ecus for drachmas at the fixing today signalling to the market that ecu/drachma was too high, dealers said.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece, the domestic money market's biggest player, quoted the following late rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at  9.70-10.20</p>
<p>** T/N at  9.70-10.20</p>
<p>** S/N at  9.70-10.20</p>
<p>** One week at 9.70-10.20</p>
<p>** Two weeks at 9.70-10.20</p>
<p>** Three weeks at 9.70-10.20</p>
<p>** One month at  9.70-10.20</p>
<p>** Two months at  9.70-10.20</p>
<p>** Three months at 9.70-10.20</p>
<p>** Six months at  9.70-10.20</p>
<p>** Nine months at 9.70-10.20</p>
<p>** Twelve months at 9.70-10.20</p>
