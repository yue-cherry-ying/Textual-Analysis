<p>Australian Communications Minister Richard Alston said on Tuesday the government would review laws that prevent pay television obtaining exclusive rights to broadcast key sporting events.</p>
<p>Alston said the government was concerned by cases where free-to-air broadcasters had not shown events to which they had been guaranteed access under the so-called anti-syphoning laws.</p>
<p>Alston told Melbourne radio station 3AW that legislation was being drafted to reform the laws.  </p>
<p>&quot;... what we will be looking at is either saying that when you get the rights you can't hoard them, which means that you've got to make use of them or else we'll split the pay-TV rights and the free-to-air rights because at the moment either can buy both and then effectively make sure they are not available to anyone else,&quot; Alston said.</p>
<p>He did not say when the legislation would be introduced into parliament.</p>
<p>Anti-syphoning laws prevent pay TV buying exclusive access to sporting events, making them unavailable to people who only receive free-to-air broadcasts.  </p>
<p>But problems have emerged with events being broadcast on free-to-air stations only in part, days late or not at all.</p>
