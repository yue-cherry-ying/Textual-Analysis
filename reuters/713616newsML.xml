<p>French Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin told his Communist coalition partners on Tuesday that the law did not allow authorities to suspend layoff programmes.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to be clear the law does not permit ... suspension of layoff programmes,&quot; he said as he arrived at a weekly Socialist Party meeting. &quot;We can't do something the law doesn't allow.&quot;</p>
<p>His statement followed calls by Communist leader Robert Hue for authorities to suspend job reduction programmes announced by companies this summer in the face of near record 12.5 percent unemployment.</p>
<p>But Jospin told reporters, &quot;We certainly have to change the law,&quot; saying it would not be good to see job cut programmes multiply.</p>
<p>Jospin said the government would discuss the issue with unions and business heads to seek &quot;something, perhaps, that respects the need for economic efficiency and at the same time defends salaried employees' rights&quot;.</p>
<p>At a meeting later in the day with Jospin, Communist party leaders said they had won a commitment from the prime minister that he would consider suspending public assistance for companies that went ahead with massive layoffs this summer.</p>
<p>The Communists were included in the leftist coalition government after the Socialists failed to win an absolute majority in last month's parliamentary election.</p>
<p>Hue urged Jospin on Monday to take immediate action to tackle unemployment rather than put off decisions on key jobs programmes until the autumn.</p>
<p>The Communists have been impatient with Jospin for failing to stop carmaker Renault from closing a Belgian plant, despite an election campaign promise to review the matter.</p>
<p>But Hue has said that the Communists have no intention of deserting the governing coalition.</p>
