<p>NWE gas oil eased on Friday as sellers were forced to respond to scant buying interest by lowering offers.</p>
<p>Heating oil barges were traded weaker at June IPE +$1.50 and $1.25 a tonne cif Rotterdam, although one buyer with a very prompt requirement paid +$2.00 a tonne for a barge loading over the weekend.</p>
<p>First-half June barges were offered at June IPE +$1.75 a tonne.</p>
<p>&quot;The turnover has been very light this week, and now buyers will want to wait to see if prices go even lower,&quot; said one barge dealer.</p>
<p>Underlying IPE futures were also softer, with the June contract trading down $1.75 a tonne at $177.25 at 1116 GMT.</p>
<p>Discussion on diesel barges was weaker, with offers at June IPE +$9.75 a tonne in Rotterdam and +$8.75 in Antwerp.</p>
<p>The Russian cargo market was seen pressured after three cargoes were traded into ARA on Thursday at around June IPE +$2.00.</p>
