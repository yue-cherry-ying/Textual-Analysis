<headline>Israel, PLO deny date set for meeting.</headline>
<dateline>JERUSALEM 1997-06-07</dateline>

<p>Israel and the PLO said on Saturday they had discussed holding a meeting between their representatives to revive stalled peace talks but denied a date had been set.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday Egypt said it had arranged a meeting for Sunday between Israeli and Palestinian &quot;experts&quot; but political sources said the announcement was premature, prompting both sides to issue clarifications.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of a meeting tomorrow between Israeli and Palestinian respresentatives was raised but no meeting has been set,&quot; said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman, Shai Bazak.</p>
<p>He said Israel would announce details of the meeting once they are set.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu Rdainah said the PLO had accepted an Egyptian proposal to hold a meeting with Israeli officials in Cairo but the date must still be set.</p>
<p>&quot;Palestinians have accepted a proposal to hold a meeting with Israelis at the level of experts in Cairo although we have not yet agreed on the date,&quot; Abu Rdainah told Reuters, confirming the Egyptian proposal that the meeting be held on Sunday.</p>
<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa announced the meeting to reporters after Arafat briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo on his latest contacts with the Israelis. He said Arafat had met on Friday with an adviser to Netanyahu who proposed new Israeli ideas to break the deadlock.</p>
<p>PLO officials identified the Israeli adviser as Yitzhak Molkho. They said Arafat also met the head of Israel's Shin Bet security service, Ami Ayalon.</p>
<p>Moussa said two sides would discuss the impasse in peacemaking prompted by Israel's settlement building. A PLO official said Arafat turned down an Israeli proposal for a summit with Netanyahu.</p>
<p>The Sunday meeting would centre on &quot;important points connected with the peace process, including settlements&quot;, Moussa said.</p>
<p>Israel-PLO peace talks plunged into crisis in March when Netanyahu started to build a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Egypt has stepped up mediation efforts since a summit between Mubarak and Netanyahu last month.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources said on Friday Egypt and the Palestinians were working on a five-point plan which included a freeze on any change in the status of Jerusalem and a ban on Jewish settlement of the West Bank for &quot;a sufficient period&quot;.</p>
<p>In return the Palestinians would give a firm commitment to address Israel's security demands, they added.</p>
<p>PLO officials said they would agree to return to the negotiating table if Israel accepted a freeze on settlement activities until both sides concluded talks on the final status of the West Bank, including Arab East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Palestinians said they were briefed in Cairo on the Egyptian plan and that the Israeli position had not changed.</p>
<p>&quot;Until now there is nothing new from the Israelis, they still refuse to freeze settlement activities,&quot; said Abu Rdainah. &quot;However, Egyptian efforts would continue to try to bridge the gaps.&quot;</p>
