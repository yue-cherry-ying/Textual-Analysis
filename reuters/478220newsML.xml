<headline>SBC CEO sees long-distance service in '97.</headline>
<dateline>SAN ANTONIO 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>SBC Communications Inc chief executive officer Edward E. Whitacre Jr. said the company plans to introduce long-distance service in its local markets before the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel pretty good about doing it sometime this year,&quot; Whitacre told reporters on a conference call shortly after the San Antonio-based company announced completion of its $16.5 billion merger with Pacific Telesis Group.  </p>
<p>&quot;We will be soon, we hope, in the long-distance business, offering our customers the ability to carry their needs not just domestically but end-to-end internationally.  We've got a zero market share in that business and we plan on being big, as we are already today in the long-distance business in the wireless market place,&quot; said Phil Quigley, who was Pacific Telesis' chairman and is now vice-chairman of SBC.</p>
<p>Quigley said he was excited about international service to Latin America and the Pacific Rim, pointing out that more than 50 percent of calls to Mexico originate in California and Texas, both of which are served by the post-merger SBC.  </p>
<p>Quigley said 20 percent of all calls to Asia originate in SBC's markets. He said SBC was well placed to enter the long-distance market and plans to file for approval soon.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we are well prepared in the West Coast -- and I know in Texas -- to meet the marketplace. We just have to get through the regulatory hurdles here, and I think we are very close to doing that. We'll be filing relatively soon and hope to be in the business this year,&quot; Quigley said.</p>
<p>Whitacre said there would be changes in senior management but did not detail them, saying they would be worked out from tomorrow onward.</p>
<p>But he did say Quigley would remain in charge of the Pacific Telesis operation.</p>
<p>Both Whitacre and Quigley said the merger would bring consumer benefits, notably in long-distance markets.</p>
<p>Quigley declined to make a formal pledge on lower prices but said, &quot;I can assure you there is going to be more competition. More competition means better prices and better products.&quot;</p>
<p>Whitacre said the merger would bring 1,000 new jobs in California and extra jobs in San Antonio.</p>
