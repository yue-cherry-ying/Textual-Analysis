<p>Hungarian politicians have tried to hinder Budapest authorities to continue a wave of closing restaurants which had overcharged guests, the Hungarian Radio said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Fifth district administrative chief Judit Xantus said that politicians of both the national and the local municapality level as well as an embassy tried to persuade her by telephone that their favourite restaurants should not be closed.</p>
<p>Xantus did not name the politicians or the embassy.</p>
<p>At least nine downtown restaurants have been closed temporarily since May when Dreher Halaszcsarda, located in the heart of Budapest, forced Danish tourists to pay more than $6,000 for dinner, sparking an international scandal.</p>
<p>The government decided to crack down on irregularities following the Halaszcsarda case which was widely quoted in international press as revenues from tourism are vital for Hungary to balance its current account.</p>
<p>Hungary had a $1.3 billion surplus from tourism in 1996, up from $0.65 billion in 1995, and expects to keep the amount at last year's level in 1997 and the following years.</p>
