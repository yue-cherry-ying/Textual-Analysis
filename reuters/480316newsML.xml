<title>NEW ZEALAND: New Zealand dlr ends flat in directionless trade.</title>
<headline>New Zealand dlr ends flat in directionless trade.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The New Zealand dollar closed an uneventful session almost unchanged on Tuesday and dealers said the currency lacked direction.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going nowhere quickly at the moment,&quot; said a chief dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess that's partly a reflection of the fact that the Aussie is going nowhere quickly as well. Both of them really are looking for fresh direction.&quot;</p>
<p>The Kiwi ended at US$0.6949/56 and at 68.29 on its Trade-Weighted Index, a touch lower than its 0.6951/58 and 68.36 local open.  </p>
<p>Selling out of New York early in the session was countered by local buying, and the weaker greenback was also helping to buoy the Kiwi in the face of a softer Australian unit.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously the U.S. dollar is under a little bit of pressure, and that's certainly helping to support the Kiwi even though the Aussie still looks a bit soft,&quot; the chief dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;I tend to think overall the Kiwi will remain well capped. The technicals suggest that the cycle high for the Kiwi should be seen in the next 24 hours...we'll wait and see on that one.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Kiwi is seen supported at 0.6930/40 and capped at 0.6965/75, with dealers picking it to trade a 0.6935-60 range overnight. -- Matthew Brockett (64 4) 473-3736</p>
