<p>U.S. spot residual fuel prices mostly held steady Friday in lackluster, pre-holiday trade, underpinned by firmer NYMEX natgas futures and relatively stable crude despite the lack of utility demand, sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Low sulphur feels pretty good. There may be a little demand into Florida, but there's no aggressive buying interest,&quot; said one cash trader, noting high sulphurs may be poised to fall if rumored European barrels arrive.</p>
<p>New York Harbor physical one percent was unchanged at $16.50-75 a barrel, with June one percent paper quoted off a quarter at about $17 on slightly softer crude, traders said.  </p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour notionally inched into the low-$17 area but traders saw little upside with no real underlying utility demand.</p>
<p>High sulphurs in New York notionally were steady, but talk of cargoes from Europe kept buyers wary. NYH 2.2 percent was still talked near $15, traders said.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Gulf, one percent also was little changed at $15.75-16.00, while three percent slipped 25-50 cents to about the $14.50 area.</p>
<p>New York city gate weekend gas prices eased slightly to the low-$2.40s/mmBtu, or $15.25 a barrel equivalent. Gas at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point, also lost some ground to about $2.19/mmBtu, or $13.80 a barrel.</p>
