<p>China said on Thursday it had complained to the United States for allowing the Dalai Lama to meet U.S. leaders in Washington this week, but stopped short of saying the meetings would harm warming ties.</p>
<p>&quot;We are strongly dissatisfied with the United States for allowing the Dalai Lama to carry out splittist activities in the United States, and with U.S. leaders for meeting him,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have already expressed our serious and principled stance to the U.S. side,&quot; Cui told a regular news briefing.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton ignored Chinese warnings not to meet the Dalai Lama -- Beijing's arch-rival for Tibetan loyalties -- at the White House on Wednesday and told Tibet's top monk he would urge China to open a direct dialogue with him.</p>
<p>&quot;We express our adamant opposition to any actions that tolerate or support the Dalai Lama's activities to split the motherland,&quot; Cui said.</p>
<p>But Cui stopped short of saying the meeting, which Beijing had strongly opposed, would affect a Sino-U.S. relationship that both sides have been at pains to mend after a series of disputes over issues such as human rights, trade and Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always made clear to the U.S. side our position on this issue, but we don't necessarily need to clarify what channels were used,&quot; Cui said, when asked how Beijing had expressed its dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Beijing on Tuesday warned senior U.S. officials not to meet the Dalai Lama during his visit to Washington and slammed the spiritual leader as a puppet of Western forces aiming to split China.</p>
<p>Clinton, wary of derailing the new Sino-U.S. rapprochement, avoided a full meeting with the Dalai Lama, instead &quot;dropping in&quot; on talks between the visiting Tibetan monk and Vice-President Al Gore.</p>
<p>Beijing's response was much more muted than its reaction to a similar low-key meeting Clinton held with the Dalai Lama in September 1995, when it summoned the U.S. charge d'affaires to deliver a strong protest.</p>
<p>Cui did not say if the Dalai Lama's meeting with Clinton would affect a planned trip by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen later this month to Washington, where he is to have talks with the U.S. president.</p>
<p>Tibet's exiled spiritual leader has been the target of a string of virulent state media condemnations in recent days. His visits to other Western nations have often prompted angry responses from Beijing.</p>
<p>Beijing regularly accuses the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed revolt against Chinese rule, of seeking to split the Himalayan region from China.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dalai (Lama) must acknowledge that Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory and must totally drop his support of Tibetan independence,&quot; Cui said.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent campaign for more Tibetan autonomy, says he is only seeking genuine self-rule for his people under Chinese sovereignty.</p>
