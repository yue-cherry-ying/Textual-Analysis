<p>British gilts will continue to stew over inflation and interest rate worries but the market can make significant inroads against German Bunds longer term, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>The 10-year gilt/Bund yield spread was likely to swell to around 155 basis points where it would find investor interest to push it slowly towards the 100 mark by the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Once again gilts have emerged as the poor man of Europe,&quot; Huw Roberts, European bond strategist at NatWest Markets in London, said. &quot;In the last week or so all the peripheral spreads to Bunds have come in 10 to 15 basis points and we've actually widened out.&quot;</p>
<p>Gilts were bashed this week mainly by a poor auction on Thursday of stock due 2021. The auction attracted cover of just 1.29 times with a lengthy yield tail.</p>
<p>The gilt/Bund gap widened to 151 basis points on Thursday from 140 on Monday but has since narrowed back in to 145 basis points.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been some quite aggressive selling in the futures by the hedge funds,&quot; Roberts said.</p>
<p>Fundamental concerns will likely trip the market up over the next few months after its recent outperformance.</p>
<p>Gilts have been thriving after Britain's Labour government shifted operational responsibility for interest rates to the Bank of England (BOE) from the Treasury. Markets expect stricter vigilance on inflation from a more independent central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;We still see yields higher than this in the medium term,&quot; Kevin Adams, gilts analyst at BZW in London, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although we have a new monetary policy framework and we have the sense the new government will tighten fiscal policy in the mini-budget, the fact remains we are in the stage of the economy where it is growing fairly robustly.&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Adams said retail sales data released on Thursday emphasised this. Sales showed at annual growth rate of 4.7 percent in April, compared with 4.4 percent in March.</p>
<p>While that rate should slow in the summer, it was likely to pick up again in the autumn, and markets were expected to become worried about inflation into 1998.</p>
<p>Economists foecast at least one more interest rate rise in an effort to keep inflation in check as well as fiscal tightening from a budget in the next month or so. Those two events should both unsettle gilts.</p>
<p>Adams saw the yield on 10-year gilt drifting up towards 7.5 percent from around 7.2 percent now.</p>
<p>The pain against Bunds however, should not be too severe and spreads should narrow into the second half of the year, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a long-term gradual narrowing...I think the spread is limited to the outside,&quot; Steve Scott, gilts analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, said.</p>
<p>Roberts forecast the spread to hit 155 basis points in the short term before squeezing to 120 basis points by the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly expect Chancellor Brown to tighten fiscal policy and we expect one more 25 basis point hike and that together should be sufficient to bring the economy off the boil and ensure we have trend growth and delay inflation,&quot; he said. -- International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 6176</p>
