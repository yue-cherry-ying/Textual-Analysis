<p>U.S. trading in Canadian stocks was dampened by the halt of the Toronto Stock Exchange's computer trading system Tuesday, frustrated U.S. traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a little frustrating, but I guess as the technology up there picks up it should go away,&quot; said Brad Marks, vice president of international trading at Jefferies and Co.</p>
<p>He added that trade in Canadian shares listed on both U.S. and Canadian exchanges had slackened following the halt of the system at 1054 EST/1554 GMT. Investors were reluctant to take positions with the Toronto exchange halted.  </p>
<p>The exchange's computer stoppage coincided with a big volume of deals in troubled Bre-X Minerals Ltd. Almost 7.8 million Bre-X shares changed hands in the 22 minutes between its 1032 EST/1532 GMT opening and its halt on the Toronto exchange.</p>
<p>The exchange resumed trading as of 1145 EST/1645 GMT. However, Bre-X was not expected to resume Toronto trade before 1300 EST/1800 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;Bre-X -- if I don't see that one again it'll be too soon,&quot; said Frank Calta, director of trading at Anvil Institutional Services. He added that he had not held any Bre-X shares.</p>
<p>Calta said if he needed to circumvent the computer halt he would keep an open telephone line to a trader on the Toronto exchange's floor and buy and sell that way.</p>
<p>Marks said he had not traded much Bre-X Tuesday, only about 50,000 shares. He added about the halt, &quot;It's just an overloading of the system from Bre-X.&quot;</p>
