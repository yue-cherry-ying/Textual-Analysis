<title>NIGERIA: Nigeria sends navy ship to troubled oil area.</title>
<headline>Nigeria sends navy ship to troubled oil area.</headline>

<p>The Nigerian navy said on Saturday that it had sent a ship to the troubled midwestern oil producing area of Warri where 50 people have been killed in communal clashes since last week.</p>
<p>A navy spokesman said on state television that NNS Ekpe, a fast attack boat, was to safeguard the production of crude oil, Nigeria's economic lifewire.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to say that all oil companies and support services should go about their business normally,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Five people died and a village was burnt down in running clashes on Friday between militant youths of feuding tribes.</p>
<p>This brought to 50 the number of people reportedly killed in renewed hostilities in the area since April 12.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation here is still tense,&quot; said a journalist by telephone from Warri, about 300 km (190 miles) from Lagos.</p>
<p>Warri has seen trouble since March 22 when clashes broke out over the relocation of the local council headquarters from an Ijaw town to a town belonging to the rival Itsekiri tribe.</p>
<p>A dusk-to-dawn curfew imposed in Warri in the wake of the March clashes was lifted early this week.</p>
<p>At the height of the crisis, armed Ijaw tribesmen occupied oil facilities of the Nigerian unit of Royal Dutch Shell Group, holding 127 of their Nigerian staff hostage and disrupting oil production.</p>
<p>The hostages were released in batches following delicate negotiations and oil output has since resumed.</p>
<p>Shell officials were not available to comment on the renewed clashes.</p>
<p>Similar clashes have erupted in several other parts of multi-ethnic Nigeria over a recent creation and restructuring of some of the more than 770 local government councils.</p>
<p>Government officials say the action is being reviewed by the federal authorities in the capital Abuja to correct what one called &quot;glaring anomalies in the exercise.&quot;</p>
<p>Colonel John Dungs, the military administrator of Delta state of which Warri is a part, met community leaders there on Wednesday and told them to call their people to order or the government would be forced to take tough measures.</p>
