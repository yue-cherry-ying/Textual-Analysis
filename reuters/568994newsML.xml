<p>South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki discussed Zaire's crisis with Tanzania's president on Thursday on the second leg of a six-nation African tour.</p>
<p>Officials said Mbeki, who arrived in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday night, met President Benjamin Mkapa on Thursday and might also hold talks with Tanzania's vice president and Julius Nyerere, its former president and Africa's elder statesman.</p>
<p>Mbeki saw Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos on Wednesday in Luanda and said he still believed that a second meeting would take place next week between Zaire's ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila.</p>
<p>&quot;We still believe the meeting will take place next week, but before that meeting can take place we thought it necessary to consult with all those who are playing a constructive role in resolving the crisis in Zaire,&quot; Mbeki told reporters in Luanda.</p>
<p>Mobutu and Kabila held inconclusive talks at the weekend in their first face-to-face encounter on a South African naval ship off the coast of Congo. South Africa said they agreed to meet again within 10 days.</p>
<p>Mobutu on Wednesday left Zaire's capital on a two-day trip to Gabon, sparking speculation he had gone for good.</p>
<p>Mbeki said he believed Mobutu would return to Kinshasa after attending an African mini-summit in Gabon's capital, Libreville.</p>
<p>He said he spoke to Kabila on Tuesday night and reminded him of his promise to halt his forces from advancing on Kinshasa.</p>
<p>&quot;I spoke to him last night. He told me that he had ordered his men to stop advancing on all fronts and gave me his assurance that they were not moving forward,&quot; Mbeki said.</p>
<p>Mediators including the United Nations, the United States and South Africa are trying to prevent further bloodshed in Zaire's civil war and arrange a peaceful transition of power.</p>
<p>Mbeki is also due to visit Rwanda. After a stopover in Pretoria he was due to meet Kabila in Lubumbashi, Zaire, and planned to travel on to Kinshasa for talks with Mobutu on Friday before going to Brazzaville, Congo, and Gabon.</p>
