<title>UNITED NATIONS: China and Bahamas establish diplomatic ties.</title>
<headline>China and Bahamas establish diplomatic ties.</headline>
<dateline>UNITED NATIONS 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>China and the Bahamas, which until recently recognized Taiwan, formally established diplomatic relations on Friday, a Chinese spokesman said.</p>
<p>A communique signed by the two governments said they recognized that &quot;there is but one China in the world and that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China,&quot; he said. It also stated that Taiwan &quot;was a province of the People's Republic of China.&quot;</p>
<p>The papers were signed by Wang Xuexian, China's deputy U.N. representative, and Harcourt Turnquest, Bahamas' U.N. ambassador at China's mission to the United Nations.</p>
<p>Taiwan earlier this month severed ties with the Bahamas after it learned the islands were preparing to establish relations with Beijing.</p>
<p>The action by the Bahamas cut back the number of countries that recognize Taiwan to 30. That number will fall to 29 later this year when Taipei's biggest diplomatic ally, South Africa, switches allegiance to Beijing.</p>
<p>The Bahamas, a grouping of 700 Atlantic islands off the east coast of Florida, established diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1989.</p>
<p>Taiwan has fostered close ties in the Caribbean and Central American region where it has given financial aid to several countries, which in the past have supported its unsuccessful candidacy for U.N. membership. There was no word of economic commitments from China on Friday.</p>
