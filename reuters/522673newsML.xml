<p>Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov on Saturday blasted Russia's newly reshuffled government, saying it would deepen the country's economic and social crisis, and called for constitutional reform.</p>
<p>&quot;The actions of the reshuffled government deprive the country of perspectives for reviving the national economy and improving the life of the workers,&quot; Zyuganov told delegates to the fourth party congress in central Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;This government will undoubtedly carry out policies murderous for Russia,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Last month President Boris Yeltsin ordered a radical shake-up of the government and drafted economic liberals Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov into key positions.</p>
<p>Zyuganov, defeated by Yeltsin in last year's presidential race, said his party should devote more resources to extra-parliamentary protests within the framework of the law.</p>
<p>It would also start gathering signatures calling for Yeltsin's resignation and changes in Russia's constitution, which gives the president most of the power at parliament's expense, Zyuganov said.</p>
<p>The Communists are the largest faction in the State Duma lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;Now there are all grounds for speaking of a new tactical stage in the activity of the Communists,&quot; Zyuganov said.</p>
<p>After his opening address to the congress, Zyuganov led some 150 delegates to the mausoleum of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin on Red Square to pay their respects and lay wreaths.</p>
