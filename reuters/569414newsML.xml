<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Hong Kong banks still compare favourably with banks in other countries despite a rise in bad debts, a leading accounting firm's study has found.</p>
<p>&quot;Twenty-six of Hong Kong's largest locally incorporated banks recorded charges for loan losses totalling HK$3.9 billion in 1996,&quot; Andy Cheung, a partner at Arthur Anderson, said in the study.</p>
<p>That figure is more than double the total of HK$1.9 billion recorded in 1995 and nearly 3.5 times higher than the HK$1.1 billion recorded in 1994, Cheung said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;That may sound alarming, but Hong Kong-based banks compare very favourably to banks in other countries,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>For example, while Hong Kong banks incurred losses which amounted to 7.2 percent of profit before tax in 1996, British banks incurred 20.5 percent and the largest banks in the United States recorded 20.1 percent, Arthur Anderson said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong banks' capital adequacy ratios are high by international standards, standing at 17.8 percent in 1996 versus 10-12 percent for international banks generally.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question that these banks are very well protected against the risk of bad debts increasing,&quot; Paul Rusten, senior manager of the firm's financial markets group, told reporters at a press conefernce on the study.</p>
<p>Up to now, Hong Kong's strong economy, high savings rates, lucrative interest margins and a strong property market have underpinned the banks' strength.</p>
<p>Cheung said economic data released so far in 1997 suggest that banks will experience a drop in loan losses this year compared with 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>In addition to being highly correlated with economic growth, loan losses reflect the level of competition among banks. Higher competition tends to mean a relaxation of credit standards.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, &quot;the composition of lending hasn't changed dramatically, but it has been changing gradually&quot;, Cheung told reporters.</p>
<p>For example, Hong Kong banks are lending more to companies from the People's Republic of China (PRC).</p>
<p>&quot;The PRC is not more risky than Hong Kong, but by lending to PRC companies, banks are exposing themselves to new areas and they need to understand these businesses,&quot; said Cheung.</p>
<p>Despite the favourable environment, Arthur Anderson said Hong Kong could banks would be prudent to improve their credit management before a turn in the economy or increased competition threatens standards.</p>
<p>For example, the accounting firm recommends that local banks create internal standards that exceed the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's requirements.</p>
<p>Banks should also learn from overseas experiences and international best practice in credit risk management, it said.</p>
