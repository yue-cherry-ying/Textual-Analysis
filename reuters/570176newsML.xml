<p>Northland Cranberries Inc said Thursday it entered into an agreement in principle to acquire the stock of Atoka Cranberries Inc, the owner of North America's largest single-site cranberry marsh, for a total of $28.5 million.</p>
<p>The transaction is payable in $13 million in cash, with the remainder in Northland convertible notes.</p>
<p>Northland is the world's largest cranberry grower and makes 100-percent blended cranberry juice products. Atoka is one of the largest independent producers of cranberries.  </p>
<p>Northland said Atoka, based in Quebec, has a total of 424 planted acres in various stages of maturity on 2,700 acres of land, with additional land and water resources available for future expansion of productive acreage.</p>
<p>Atoka would operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Northland after the acquisition was completed, which is expected to occur wthin six weeeks after certain conditions are satisfied.</p>
<p>In addition to its cranberry operation, Atoka also handles and processes fruit at its own receiving station and juice processing facility.</p>
<p>Atoka markets fresh cranberries, cranberry juice, concentrate and cranberry sauce.  A majority of its products are sold for use in private label products.</p>
<p>&quot;This transaction should clearly reemphasize to our shareholders and competitors Northland's steadfast determination to continue accelerating our growth and ultimately become a significant force in the consumer food products industry,&quot; John Swendrowski, president, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Northland's total planted acres with this deal will increase to 2,972.</p>
