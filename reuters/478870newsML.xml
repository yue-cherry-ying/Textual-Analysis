<p>Optus Communications Pty Ltd chief executive Ziggy Switkowski said the planned buyout of the Optus Vision partners will drag the telecommunications group into a 1996/97 loss.</p>
<p>Optus Vision, a pay television operation, reported a loss of A$168.2 million for the six months to December 31, 1996, while Optus Communications rang up a A$58.9 million profit.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the second half of the year is going to see (Optus Vision) losses continue at that level,&quot; Switkowski told Reuters in a telephone interview.  </p>
<p>&quot;At this stage those (Optus Vision) losses are going to overwhelm Optus Coms (Communications) profits,&quot; Switkowski said.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be recorded losses for Optus Vision for some time to come until the subscriber numbers for pay-TV and the local telephony subscribers grow to considerably greater number than they currently are,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Optus Vision has 180,000 subscribers, while its local telephony service has been plagued by technical difficulties since its launch last year.</p>
<p>Switkowski said the Optus Communications board would meet at the end of April to consider the proposed share market float.  </p>
<p>The Optus Vision rejig, announced early on Easter Friday morning, would result in Optus acquiring 100 percent of Optus Vision. Previously it held 46.5 percent.</p>
<p>The other shareholders in Optus Vision, US West Inc, with 46.5 percent, Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd (PBL) at five percent and Seven Network with two percent, would swap their holdings for stakes in Optus.</p>
<p>The long-awaited deal arose from court action begun by Seven against Optus Vision shareholders for agreeing to grant PBL an option to obtain a higher stake in the pay-tv group.  </p>
<p>The recent deal paved the way for the proposed float of Optus Communications, which was shelved last year after Seven launched the court case.</p>
<p>Analysts said Optus could seek to raise up to A$1.5 billion with the bulk of the offer representing the sale by transport and healthcare group Mayne Nickless Ltd of its 26.1 percent stake in Optus.</p>
<p>But Switkowski said he could not comment on the amount the company planned to raise. &quot;The reality is that we would probably raise more equity than we had planned some months ago,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Switkowski said Optus was in talks with Telstra, the state-owned telecoms group which is also set for a 1997 float and which ranks as the major and larger rival, about sharing infrastructure for its pay-TV and telephony services.</p>
<p>&quot;There is room for some sort of infrastructure accord with Telstra. Those discussions have been underway for some weeks, but we are not close to an accord,&quot; Switkowski said.</p>
<p>Telstra also jointly owns rival pay-tv group Foxtel with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd.  </p>
<p>However, any deal between Telstra and Optus over pay-tv or sharing telecommunications infrastructure would need the consent of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) anti-monopolies group.</p>
