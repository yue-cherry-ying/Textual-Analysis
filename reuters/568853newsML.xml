<p>European naphtha markets were holding steady at the lower levels in late trade.</p>
<p>Traders said stronger crude and gasoline futures had provided some support but expected scant buying interest and weaker Asian markets to continue to weighing on prices.</p>
<p>Public holidays across much of Europe also dulled trade.</p>
<p>Traders said the arbitrage to the Far East was under some pressure as lengthy supplies saw Asian naphtha prices easing.</p>
<p>&quot;There is just too much naphtha,&quot; said a Far East trader.</p>
<p>Traders estimated that about 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes of naphtha have been shipped to Asia since the arbitrage window from Europe opened in March.</p>
<p>Mediterranean markets continued to focus on Far East arbitrage options but traders said this was closing down rapidly and they expected supplies in Europe to start to build up again putting further pressure on prices.</p>
<p>In NWE demand remained restricted to small top-up parcels although a 25kt cargo of pipeline spec for May 5-15 delivery was reported traded on Wednesday at a slightly softer $175 a tonne cif.</p>
