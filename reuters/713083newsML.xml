<p>The contentious surplus in Japan's current account -- the broadest measure of trade in goods and services -- jumped 154.9 percent to 906.8 billion yen in May, rising for the second month in a row, the Finance Ministry announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The surplus in merchandise trade, often the source of bitter rows with the United States, surged 118.6 percent to 927.9 billion yen in May from a year earlier.  </p>
<p>At Wednesday's rate of around 113 yen to the dollar, the overall current account surplus totalled $8.02 billion, while the trade surplus stood at $8.21 billion.</p>
<p>Although showing a large jump, the current account surplus came in just under the range of forecasts by economists, who had been expecting a rise of around 156 to 254 percent in the contentious figure.</p>
<p>A surge in the surplus had been widely anticipated as Japan's customs-cleared trade surplus for May, which was announced in June, showed a dramatic year-on-year increase of more than 200 percent. The trade surplus within the current account category, calculated on a different basis, differs slightly from the customs-cleared trade surplus.</p>
<p>Economists attributed the sharp increase in the May current account surplus mainly to strong growth in exports, such as car shipments to the United States, fuelled by the relatively weaker yen. A drop in domestic demand following a rise in Japan's sales tax from April 1 has encouraged Japanese firms to export more to make up for falling domestic consumption, they said.</p>
