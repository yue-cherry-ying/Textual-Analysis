<p>James Bond, Britain's famous screen secret agent, this week picked up the keys to his new company car -- a $100,000 top-of-the-line BMW 750i saloon that he will drive in a new film slated for release in December.</p>
<p>The car is a regular production model but will have &quot;extras&quot; not traditionally available to the public. They will be added by 007's creative assistant &quot;Q,&quot; who develops devices to help get the movie hero out of trouble.</p>
<p>&quot;It will look like the standard production vehicle,&quot; ,&quot; Gordon Arnell, spokesman for Eon Productions, said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>&quot;But when it is delivered to Bond by Q, it will have all sorts of optional extras.&quot;</p>
<p>Eon Productions of Britain told Reuters on Wednesday it had agreed with Bayerische Motoren Werke AG of Munich for Bond again to drive a BMW in the latest 007 adventure.</p>
<p>The BMW saloon, which is &quot;aspen silver&quot; in colour, was first used in filming on Tuesday at Stansted airport near London for the film, which has been titled &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, the 18th Bond film.</p>
<p>The movie is billed as a &quot;high-octane tale of media power as a lethal weapon&quot; and pits Pierce Brosnan as the lady-killer Bond against Jonathan Pryce, a mad media mogul who considers triggering World War Three to garner higher television ratings.</p>
<p>BMW has scored another marketing coup in winning the deal for Bond to drive one of its vehicles. He drove a BMW Z3 in his last film, GoldenEye, in a deal that required BMW to include the Bond character in advertising campaigns about the car.</p>
<p>The carmaker received a massive wave of publicity for the Z3 roadster and its link to the high-flying character, sparking heavy sales orders for the vehicle and also a new wave of carmakers turning to Hollywood to expose their products.</p>
<p>A BMW spokesman declined comment on the deal other than to confirm that the German carmaker had delivered saloons to Eon in mid-February for use in the film. He also confirmed the price tag of a 750i -- 173,000 marks including taxes.</p>
<p>Arnell declined to comment on terms of the deal with BMW, which has had a long relationship with Bond films since the early 1980s production of &quot;Octopussy&quot;.</p>
<p>The decision to continue using a car made by BMW, which also owns British-based Rover, will certainly prompt some fans of Bond to criticise the commercialisation of the character as well as to question why he was not driving a British vehicle.</p>
<p>A member of Britain's parliament, Geoffrey Robinson, who is also a former chief executive of British carmaker Jaguar, had called on Eon to back the British car industry. He once drove an Aston Martin DB5.</p>
<p>Many famous names in the British car industry, such as Aston Martin, Jaguar and Bentley, lobbied hard for the opportunity to get their latest models into the film.</p>
<p>&quot;You can be sure that most of the major car manufacturers have been on to us in one form or another,&quot; he said.</p>
