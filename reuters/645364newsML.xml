<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel said on Saturday he will get Germany into Europe's single currency without raising taxes, as senior figures in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party warned against delaying the euro project.</p>
<p>&quot;You will see, Germany will make the deficit criteria,&quot; Waigel told journalists at the meeting in southern town of Erlangen, where he was addressing a meeting of the junior wing of his Christian Social Union (CSU), Bavarian sister party to Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU).</p>
<p>Waigel denied there was any discussion in his party of delaying the project beyond its scheduled 1999 launch and promised Germany would fulfil the Maastricht goal of budget deficit at three percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>But many economists predict slow economic growth and soaring unemployment will mean Germany cannot hit that target precisely, prompting some Bonn politicians to call for a looser interpretation of the deficit target rather than a delay.</p>
<p>Several thousand demonstrators took to the streets of Munich on Saturday for a union-led protest against Bonn's welfare policies, shouting &quot;Kohl must go!&quot; and criticising spending cuts being made to help Germany qualify for EMU.</p>
<p>Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, who holds the rotating European Union presidency, on Saturday said he saw no reason to think there would be a change in the schedule for Europe's economic and monetary union (EMU), despite Germany's woes.</p>
<p>Several senior politicians warned of the serious results of a delay, which some members of Waigel's CSU have said would be preferable to slackening the Maastricht entry criteria.</p>
<p>&quot;A softening of the criteria is not an option for the CSU. Then we would rather delay the euro,&quot; CSU board member Markus Soeder was quoted as telling Bild am Sonntag in a release ahead of publication on Sunday.</p>
<p>But CDU parliamentary leader Wolfgang Schaeuble said such talk was irresponsible and destroyed trust in the euro project.</p>
<p>Former European Commission president Jaques Delors told Focus news magazine a delay to EMU would be disastrous. &quot;Even only a one year delay to the start of the currency union would be the end of the project,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The debate about the possibility of a delay -- until recently a taboo subject in Bonn -- flared up this week when Waigel was forced into a humiliating retreat over his plan to force the central bank to revalue its gold and currency stocks to help plug a shortfall of at least 19 billion marks ($11 billion) in his 1997 budget.</p>
<p>One way to make up that gap and help hit the three percent deficit criterion would be to raise taxes.</p>
<p>But Waigel, who faces stiff political opposition from junior coalition partners the Free Democrats (FDP) on tax rises, on Saturday said he would not resort to such a move -- at least not this year.</p>
<p>With few options for making up the deficit at a stroke, Waigel has increasingly looked for small savings.</p>
<p>According to Der Spiegel magazine, for example, Waigel wants to reduce funding to the labour office by over two billion marks during the second half of this year, slashing money for training and job creation schemes.</p>
<p>The savings would still leave Germany far short of the 10 to 15 billion marks that economists reckon it needs to qualify for EMU. Media reports have suggested Bonn will try to find that from further spending cuts and privatisations.</p>
<p>As if EMU were not enough to deal with, Waigel is also in the midst of preparing the budget for next year, a task he described as more difficult than qualifying for EMU.</p>
<p>Waigel ruled out increasing government new debt in 1998, saying total borrowing in the year must remain under 58 to 59 billion marks, in line with the constitutional requirement that new borrowing does not exceed total public investment.</p>
<p>&quot;We are facing a very decisive four weeks,&quot; Waigel said of his preparation of the 1998 budget.</p>
