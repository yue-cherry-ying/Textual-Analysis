<p>Nippon Credit Bank Ltd's (NCB) 5.4 percent five-year bank debenture due June 1997 traded at 6.0 percent on Tuesday, unchanged from Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>Two hundred million yen worth of the instruments changed hands, a brokerage house trader said.</p>
<p>Volume of trade in NCB debentures has been rising recently, fuelled by news about the long-term credit bank's restructuring efforts, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Market players seem more willing than before to buy NCB debentures with relatively short maturities,&quot; a trader for a trust bank's securities unit said.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, before news about NCB's restructuring plans reached the market, NCB debentures with less than a year until maturity, including a five-year debenture due September 1997 with a coupon rate of 4.8 percent, traded at 8.0 percent.</p>
<p>Market players still seem reluctant, however, to buy NCB debentures with relatively long maturities, the trader for a trust bank's securities unit said.</p>
<p>He added that NCB's five-year bank debenture due July 1999 with a coupon rate of 3.5 percent was traded at 7.0 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There are fewer sell orders for NCB debentures than before... But (domestic) financial institutions are still reluctant to buy the bonds. I think buyers have been limited to foreign financial institutions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>NCB on Tuesday announced a major restructuring plan that will mean the loss of 600 jobs, the sale of prime real estate and a withdrawal from major overseas markets.</p>
<p>The bank said it believes the scheme will help it to regain the market's trust.</p>
