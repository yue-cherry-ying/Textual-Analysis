<p>Argentine stocks edged higher in muted trading Thursday, with investors already bracing themselves for next week's U.S. inflation indicators, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a wait-and-see attitude ahead of the inflation report,&quot; said Jorge Bonanno at brokers Interfin. &quot;The U.S. long bond yield ticked higher today, showing the trend abroad is still volatile and the big question is -- will Wall Street keep climbing next week or be jolted by the price data?&quot;</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal index  added 0.3 percent to 726.62, trimming losses so far in the week to 0.8 percent.  </p>
<p>Floor turnover slowed to 13.2 million pesos from an already paltry amount of 14.6 million Wednesday, but over-the-counter deals swelled to 123.9 million pesos from 98 million Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The MerVal is locked between 715-730, and it's going to take a lot more volume to break out of that range,&quot; another broker said. &quot;But for now everyone's keeping a low profile.&quot;</p>
<p>The broad market  rose 0.7 percent, with winners outpacing losers 26 to 17 and 22 issues closing flat. Top MerVal risers were construction stock Polledo, up 1.9 percent, and carmaker Sevel and steelmaker Siderar, both up 1.8 percent.  </p>
<p>Bellwether YPF rose 1.6 percent while Telefonica and Telecom both closed up 1.2 percent.</p>
<p>MerVal losers were led by pulp and paper maker Celulosa, holding company Central Costanera and textile firm and shoemaker Alpargatas, which dropped 4.8 percent, 2.9 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively.</p>
