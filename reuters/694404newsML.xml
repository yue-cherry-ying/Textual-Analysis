<p>Masked intruders burst into the homes of three men in Salvador in northeast Brazil and executed them in apparent retribution for petty crimes, police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still investigating the motive for the deaths,&quot; a local policeman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Three men were killed by gunshots on Friday night, the policeman said. They were Marcelo Oliveira, 16; Wellington Silva, 18, and Edson Araujo, whose age was not given.</p>
<p>Oliveira and Araujo were both killed in the street while Silva was murdered inside his home, the policeman said. He could give no further details on the killings.</p>
<p>Local news agency Agencia do Estado reported that both Oliveira and Araujo were dragged out of their homes by three hooded men and gunned down in the street.</p>
<p>The assassinations took place in a suburb of Salvador reputed for drug trafficking and violence, the news agency said.</p>
<p>The victims allegedly stole from local bars and small businesses and police were working with the theory that their killers were hired to get rid of them, it added.</p>
