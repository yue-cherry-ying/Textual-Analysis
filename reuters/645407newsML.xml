<p>At least 37 worshippers were killed and more than 50 injured on Saturday when fire engulfed a famous Hindu temple in the southern Indian town of Thanjavur, police said.</p>
<p>&quot;The death toll has risen to 37 and we expect more casualties,&quot; state director general of police K.K. Rajasekaran Nair told Reuters in the capital of Tamil Nadu state, Madras.</p>
<p>Police said the blaze was ignited either by fire crackers lit outside Brihadeeswara temple, or holy fire used for prayer that set alight a thatched structure inside.</p>
<p>Police suspect many people burned to death while others died in a stampede to escape the flames and smoke.</p>
<p>Thanjavur town is about 320 km (200 miles) southwest of Madras.</p>
<p>Brihadeeswara, or &quot;Big Temple&quot;, was built in the 11th century by the hindu king Rajaraja Chola. It houses the biggest lingam, or symbol of the Hindu god Shiva, in India, and the temple tower is 216 feet (66 metres) high.</p>
<p>The Press Trust of India said rituals were underway in the temple ahead of the culmination of a Hindu festival on Sunday.</p>
<p>The news agency quoted officials as saying 25 bodies had so far been removed from the temple.</p>
<p>In February at least 120 people were killed when a fire tore through makeshift shelters at a religious gathering in eastern India.</p>
<p>Nearly 425 people died in 1995 when a blaze ripped through a school prize-giving ceremony in the northern town of Dabwali in Haryana state near New Delhi.</p>
