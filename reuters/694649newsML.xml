<p>A rift within Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition over Europe's planned single currency widened on Saturday when one of his partners openly raised the prospect of pulling out of the ruling alliance.</p>
<p>The row pits members of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) against its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and above all Bavarian premier Edmund Stoiber.</p>
<p>While other senior coalition figures went on the offensive over Stoiber's repeated calls for a strict interpretation of the membership criteria for the new currency, one of his allies raised the stakes.</p>
<p>&quot;If the stability criteria are not adhered to and the euro becomes a soft currency, the CSU will have to draw the necessary conclusions,&quot; Markus Soeder, a CSU leadership member, told the Bild am Sonntag weekly in an article to be published on Sunday.</p>
<p>Stoiber, in a flurry of recent interviews, has pledged fierce resistance if the budget deficit limit of three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for single currency membership is interpreted as anything other than 3.0.</p>
<p>While Stoiber has not spelled out how far he is prepared to go to block what he sees as a softer euro, Soeder made clear he believed the CSU would not shy away from quitting government.</p>
<p>Soeder recalled that the CSU in 1976 had voted at its Wildbad Kreuth retreat to end its alliance with Kohl's CDU and the discussion over the euro was again heightening tensions.</p>
<p>&quot;It could come to a second Wildbad Kreuth resolution and that could mean 'get out of the coalition in Bonn and dissolve our joint parliamentray group with the CDU'&quot;, said Soeder, the head of the CSU's youth wing.</p>
<p>With France saying it will not meet the 3.0 goal and economists predicting Germany will also struggle, senior CDU officials have indicated a looser interpretation would be better than postponing the project, due to start on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, however, warned Paris that Kohl would not let France into his pet project of economic and monetary union if it did not make sufficient efforts to cut its deficit.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that there are no illusions in Paris over the reaction of Germany and other EU members,&quot; Juncker, whose country takes over the EU presidency next week, told the German weekly news magazine Der Spiegel.</p>
<p>&quot;Helmut Kohl will not agree to monetary union at any price. If necessary he will be rock solid in protecting German interests and be very careful to respect German concerns,&quot; Juncker said in the interview, to be published on Monday.</p>
<p>Leaders from the CDU and the coalition's other partners, the centrist Free Democrats (FDP), made clear their discontent with the doubt unleashed by Stoiber's repeated sniping.</p>
<p>&quot;The result of this debate is that peoples' concerns that the euro will not be stable are heightened. That's not good,&quot; said Kohl's chief lieutenant Wolfgang Schaeuble, who heads the CDU/CSU parliamentary group in Bonn.</p>
<p>&quot;He's stirring up resentment against the euro,&quot; FDP parliamentary leader Hermann Otto Solms told Der Spiegel. &quot;By doing this, he's damaging German interests.&quot;</p>
<p>The battle is not just between the CDU and CSU but also a power struggle within the Bavarian party between Stoiber and Kohl's Finance Minister Theo Waigel, the CSU leader.</p>
<p>Waigel appeared to be firing a shot across the bows of his critics onSaturday when he warned against both talk about postponing the euro and the temptation to withdraw from government.</p>
<p>&quot;If we gave up power, we would have taken leave of our senses,&quot; he told a party meeting in the town of Gunzenhausen.</p>
<p>But Waigel, treading a fine line between Bonn's desire to stick to the timetable and CSU worries about softening the entry rules, also called for strict adherence to the criteria.</p>
<p>&quot;The Maastricht Treaty names a figure for the deficit criterion and that figure is three,&quot; he told Bild am Sonntag.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who now believes 3.2 or 3.3 is sufficient will end up with 3.9 percent.&quot;</p>
