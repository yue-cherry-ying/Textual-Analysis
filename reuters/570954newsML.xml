<title>CAMBODIA: Cambodian royalist leader slams rival PM.</title>
<headline>Cambodian royalist leader slams rival PM.</headline>
<dateline>SIEM REAM, Cambodia 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Cambodian co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh renewed a verbal tirade against rival Hun Sen on Thursday, one day after the two had agreed to end their war of words on radio and television.</p>
<p>Ranariddh, meeting members of his royalist FUNCINPEC party in this northwest provincial capital, repeated accusations that Second Prime Minister Hun Sen was behind a challenge to the prince's leadership from dissidents within his own party.</p>
<p>&quot;The person who interfered in FUNCINPEC affairs is only Hun Sen, who instigated to create a break,&quot; said Ranariddh.</p>
<p>Ranariddh said he was appointing Defence Undersecretary of State Krouch Yeoun to replace the leader of the FUNCINPEC dissidents, Toan Chhay, as governor of Siem Reap province.</p>
<p>The dissidents announced their challenge to Ranariddh's leadership in mid-April and Hun Sen swiftly pledged the support of his Cambodian People's Party (CPP), plunging ties with Ranariddh to their lowest level since the two parties formed an uneasy coalition after U.N.-run elections in 1993.</p>
<p>The prince also appointed a new second deputy governor in Siem Reap.</p>
<p>&quot;If Hun Sen doesn't agree (to the Siem Reap appointments), it means that he interferes in FUNCINPEC's affairs because (the governor of) Siem Reap is FUNCINPEC's quota,&quot; the prince said.</p>
<p>Government appointments must be approved by the co-premiers, who on Wednesday met for the first time in two months to chair a cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>They pledged to end their polemics on television and radio to improve the political atmosphere in Cambodia. Officials said it would be impossible to include the partisan print media in the decision.</p>
<p>It was unclear if FUNCINPEC planned to broadcast Ranariddh's comments on its own radio and television stations.</p>
<p>Verbal sparring between Ranariddh and Hun Sen, which stems partly from their efforts to get support ahead of national polls next year, has virtually paralysed government and parliament, political analysts have said.</p>
<p>Ties between the two leaders and their parties began to deteriorate after Ranariddh threated to leave the government in March 1996 in a row over power-sharing.</p>
