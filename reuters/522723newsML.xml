<headline>Sultan of Brunei sees plot to smear country image.</headline>
<dateline>BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei 1997-04-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah said defamatory accusations were smearing Brunei's image and he urged the nation to be vigilant against such attacks.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been implicated by slander and defamation that could very well undermine the respect and trust the people have placed on us,&quot; the ruler of the oil-rich country on Borneo island said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hence we must remain vigilant against the destructive forces, that try to confuse the general perception of the people,&quot; said the sultan, believed to be the world's richest man, in a radio address to mark Friday's Moslem festival of Eid al-Adha, the Feast of Sacrifice.</p>
<p>The sultan has been the target of allegations by a former Miss USA beauty queen, who accused him of trying to turn her into his &quot;sexual toy&quot;.</p>
<p>A suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles in January by Shannon Marketic, 26.</p>
<p>In March, the sultan categorically denied the allegations. A statement from the Brunei prime minister's office said the sultan &quot;has never been acquainted with, nor met, Ms Marketic&quot;.</p>
<p>Marketic's lawsuit said she was among seven young women sent to Brunei by a Los Angeles talent agency.</p>
<p>Transported to the sultan's palace, she alleges that she and the other women were &quot;forcibly detained&quot; in Brunei and forced to dance at late night parties while being groped and verbally abused by the sultan and his guests.</p>
<p>The sultan, who is also the nation's prime minister, did not specifically mention Marketic or the lawsuit in the radio address, but he said allegations made against his country were &quot;worse than murder&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Apparently Brunei's good image, its strong hold on Islam, the virtuous values and traditions it upholds has made some people uneasy,&quot; the sultan said in the Thursday night speech.</p>
<p>He also said the palace, in accordance with Islamic tenets, has also been a royal residence intended for decent and righteous activities.</p>
<p>He said the palace had hosted many Koran readings and had welcomed the haj pilgrims who have come to seek blessings of the royal family.</p>
