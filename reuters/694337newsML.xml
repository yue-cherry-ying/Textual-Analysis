<p>Bulgaria's parliament on Saturday passed an astere 1997 budget clearing the last hurdle before introducing a currency board system on July 1.</p>
<p>&quot;Bulgaria now has an approved 1997 budget, the country's financial constitution,&quot; Finance Minister Muravei Radev told the assembly.</p>
<p>&quot;The budget is tailored to the operation of the currency board. We have to learn the spend not more than we earn,&quot; head parliament's budget and finance committee Yordan Tsonev told reporters.</p>
<p>Bulgaria is due to launch the self-regulating restrictive monetary mechanism next week as part of reform pledges to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>Radev said that sustaining the restriction of the Budget is of paramount importance for the government. Overshooting budget targets would fail the agreement with the IMF, said earlier Prime Minister Ivan Kostov.</p>
<p>The budget envisages a 6.2 percent deficit of gross domestic product (GDP) which is assumed at 16.15 trillion levs.</p>
<p>GDP is expected to fall by a real 7.4 percent from 1996. GDP fell a real 10.9 percent last year to 1,660.2 billion levs.</p>
<p>Spending is assumed at 33.5 percent of GDP and revenue at 27.3 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Annual inflation is seen 566 percent. The high annual inflation is attributed mainly to the galloping 243 percent monthly inflation in Fabruary, triggered by political unrest earlier this year.</p>
<p>Inflation since then has come down to 5.6 percent in May and minus 0.7 percent in April. Monthly inflation is seen at two percent at the end of the year.</p>
<p>The budget envisages a fixed exchange rate of 1,000 levs to the mark and 1,700 to the dollar as part of the currency board system, which requires that levs in circulation be matched by foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>On Friday central bank governor Svetoslav Gavriiski said that interest rates will remain stable at current levels of around one percent in the next few months after the launch of the currency board system.</p>
<p>The central bank cut its main rate to effective annual 10.60 percent or 0.84 percent monthly on Thursday from 16.30 percent. The rate is calculated on the average yield to maturity on three-month discount T-bills, said Gavriiski.</p>
<p>Foreign debt interest payments due this year account for 2.9 percent of GDP and domestic debt interest due is assumed at 6.9 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Social security payments were assumed at 1.577 trillion levs, defence was allocated 390 billion levs, the interior ministry 222 billion levs and the state health service 469 billion levs. -- Elisaveta Konstantinova, Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-981-4145</p>
