<p>Toronto stocks ended higher on Thursday on the back of stronger bank and gold issues, resuming its upward march after two days of weakness.</p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange key 300 Composite Index jumped 35.92 points to close at 6157.44. Trading was heavy at 135.3 million shares worth C$1.8 billion ($1.3 billion).</p>
<p>&quot;The momentum is there and at this stage I have no doubt that Toronto will break new highs&quot; this month, said Montreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels.</p>
<p>Wall Street rallied on the prospect of a proposed capital gains tax cut.</p>
<p>But the markets peaked in late afternoon, surging 1.5 percent in New York and one percent in Toronto before the enthusiasm subsided and they gave back some of their gains.</p>
<p>&quot;Toronto mimics New York, with a bit of delay,&quot; Meisels said.</p>
<p>Eight of Toronto's 14 sub-indices rose. The stronger side was led by golds, base metals, conglomerates and banks, while decliners included media, transportation and consumer products. Advances led declines 599 to 362, while 301 traded flat.</p>
<p>In individual issues, Bank of Montreal rose 0.60 to 52.10 in active dealings.</p>
<p>Waste management Philip Environmental Inc. topped Toronto's net losers, dropping 3.80 to 17.80 after its first-quarter earnings fell short of analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>Tee-Comm Electronics Inc. lost more than half its value, plunging 1.20 to 0.85 after a liquidity crunch this week that put the satellite television provider's future in doubt.</p>
