<p>Philippine police on Saturday rescued a Filipino-Chinese kidnap victim and arrested her nine abductors.</p>
<p>Philippine National Police chief Recaredo Sarmiento told a news conference that the victim, Jocelyn Sy, was freed unharmed four days after she was seized by her kidnappers in her car in a Manila street.</p>
<p>The 70,000 peso ($2,455) ransom money was recovered along with several firearms and ammunition.</p>
<p>Sarmiento said he believed the kidnappers were responsible for a series of abductions in the capital. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Police said Sy was the 49th kidnap victim in the Philippines this year. Last year, more than 100 people were kidnapped by crime gangs.</p>
<p>Kidnapping has become a booming business with the amount of ransom paid out in the first three months of this year already exceeding the 142 million pesos collected for all of 1996, anti-crime groups earlier said.</p>
<p>Families of victims who are mostly ethnic Chinese, one of the country's wealthiest groups, are often reluctant to call in the police because they suspect police involvement. Conversion $=28.51 pesos</p>
