<title>COLOMBIA: Colombia rebels occupy jungle town, military base.</title>

<p>Leftist rebels have occupied the main town in a demilitarized zone of southern Colombia to prepare for the release of 60 soldiers they took prisoner more than nine months ago, local media reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>More than 50 Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas, dressed in combat fatigues and heavily armed, swept into Cartagena del Chaira, in Caqueta province, on Friday, the leading El Tiempo newspaper reported.</p>
<p>At least 500 rebel fighters are expected to pour into the remote jungle town before June 15 -- the date the FARC set earlier this week for the handover of their captives.</p>
<p>According to press and radio reports many of the FARC fighters have taken up positions in the abandoned military base in Cartagena del Chaira.</p>
<p>The respected El Espectador newspaper spoke of rebels openly patrolling the streets and demanding a &quot;tax&quot; of between $100 and $150 from local shopkeepers and merchants to fund the costs of moving hundreds of rebels into the demilitarized zone from other parts of southern Colombia.</p>
<p>President Ernesto Samper ordered the army to pull out of a 5,000 square mile (13,000 sq km) swathe of Caqueta starting late last month to permit the FARC to hand over their prisoners -- the first time Colombia's military has ceded such a large area to the guerrillas.</p>
<p>FARC rebels captured the 60 soldiers and killed at least 27 others when they overran a military base in neighbouring Putumayo province on Aug. 30.</p>
<p>The attack heralded the start of one of the bloodiest guerrilla offensives in three decades of Communist insurgency in Colombia. It also marked the beginning of the Latin America's longest-running hostage crisis -- virtually forgotten in the face of the recent siege of the Japanese embassy residence in Lima.</p>
<p>FARC commanders have said they will release 10 marines captured in fighting in northwest Choco province in January along with the 60 soldiers.</p>
<p>All the troops will be handed over in Cartagena del Chaira to members of Colombia's National Conciliation Commission and the International Committee of the Red Cross before being flown to a army base outside the demilitarized zone.</p>
