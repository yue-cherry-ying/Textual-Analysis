<p>At least 16 people were killed in northwest Rwanda by a group suspected of being former Rwandan soldiers and militant ethnic Hutu Interahamwe militia, the Rwanda News Agency reported.</p>
<p>The agency quoted sources in Ruhengeri Prefecture as saying the group attacked the home of the headmaster of a local secondary school on Thursday night, killing him, his wife and his three children.</p>
<p>&quot;Eleven other people were also killed by the militiamen, and one vehicle burned,&quot; a human rights group in the capital Kigali told the agency on Friday. The comments were monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation in Kenya's capital Nairobi.</p>
<p>&quot;An unknown number of criminals were reportedly killed in the ensuing clashes with the army,&quot; the group added.</p>
<p>Former Rwandan government troops and Interahamwe are largely blamed for the slaughter of nearly 800,000 minority ethnic Tutsi in 1994. Kigali says they attack civilian targets to destabilise the government.</p>
