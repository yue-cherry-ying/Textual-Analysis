<title>FRANCE: French Communist leader urges quick action on jobs.</title>

<p>French Communist Party leader Robert Hue said on Monday he had asked Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to take immediate action to combat France's near-record 12.5 percent unemployment.</p>
<p>Hue said after luncheon talks with Jospin that he had suggested a series of steps to the new prime minister, who has delayed key economic decisions until the autumn.</p>
<p>Hue, whose Communist Party helps make up the new leftist majority in parliament along with Socialists and Greens, urged that state subsidies be cut off for any business which lays off workers.</p>
<p>He also urged the cancellation of departmental civil service lay-offs planned for the summer and said committees should be convened in every department to weigh job-creation measures.</p>
<p>Hue and Jospin met ahead of Jospin's closed-door meeting on Tuesday with the Communist group in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>It was their first meeting since Jospin took office following the left's upset June 1 parliamentary election victory.</p>
<p>Some Communist deputies have since complained about Jospin's go-slow approach to the unemployment problem, which he has said would be his top priority.</p>
<p>Communists also complained when Jospin let carmaker Renault proceed with plans to close a plant in Vilvoorde, Belgium, despite a campaign promise to review the matter.</p>
<p>Though the plant will close, Jospin insisted he had kept his campaign pledge since following his review, Renault agreed to redeploy some plant workers and said none would be laid off outright.</p>
<p>Jospin, in office just five weeks, also pledged during the campaign to create 700,000 new jobs and trim the working week to 35 hours from 39 with no loss in pay.</p>
<p>But in a television interview last week he urged patience, saying he could not move forward on potentially costly programmes until an audit due on July 21 had determined the condition of state finances.</p>
<p>He has ruled out additional austerity measures to assure France qualifies for European economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>The Maastricht treaty on European integration limits public deficits to three percent of gross domestic product for those EU states shifting to the euro single currency, and some officials have acknowledged France is above that target.</p>
