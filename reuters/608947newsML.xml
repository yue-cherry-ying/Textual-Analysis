<p>Argentine stocks continued their two-week advance Friday at the close, recouping early losses despite a drop in volume ahead of the U.S. Memorial Day holiday, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has a definite upward slant and is easily absorbing profit-taking, with special momentum in the oil sector this week and also now in steel stocks,&quot; said Luis Corsiglia at brokers Corsiglia y Cia.</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal index edged up 0.3 percent to 767.67, stretching gains to 6.1 percent in 10 sessions. It closed 3.4 percent higher on the week.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market is underpinned by the new imminent Extended Fund Facility agreement with the International Monetary Fund and by strong economic growth data, all of which is helping the MerVal test resistance levels and move towards the 800 mark,&quot; Corsiglia said.</p>
<p>The broad market index closed flat for the second session running, with risers beating decliners 31 to 19 and 21 issues closing flat.</p>
<p>Floor volume shrank to 22.4 million pesos from 33.9 million Thursday, while over-the-counter turnover slowed to 85 million pesos from 133.3 million Thursday.  </p>
<p>&quot;Trading slowed down a bit ahead of the Memorial Day break Monday in the United States, and perhaps it would be healthy for prices to drop early next week and consolidate at these levels,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>The best main-tier performers were holding company Comercial del Plata, which jumped 3.7 percent, and steelmakers Acindar and Siderca, up 2.6 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Losers were led by pulp and paper maker Celulosa and oil company Astra, both off 2.0 percent, and textile firm and shoemaker Alpargatas, off 1.6 percent.</p>
