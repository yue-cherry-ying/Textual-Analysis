<p>The United Arab Emirates said on Tuesday it expected its 1997 gross national product (GNP) to reach 171 billion dirhams ($46.5 billion), up from 163 billion dirhams last year, thanks to improved oil prices worldwide.</p>
<p>Planning Minister Humaid bin Ahmed al-Mualla, speaking to reporters, also said the non-oil sector was expected to boost its 1997 contribution to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) to 112 billion dirhams -- five percent above 1996 figures.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on our forecasts, the international oil market will witness more demand while amounts supplied to the market will stay the same which will raise the price of oil and reflect on our GNP, the budget and the balance of trade and payments,&quot; Mualla said.</p>
<p>His remarks followed the release of a report on the country's economic performance in 1996.</p>
<p>The public sector accounted for 10.7 percent of GDP last year, followed by trade and services with 10 percent, industries with 9.1 percent and housing with 8.6 percent, he said.</p>
<p>Mualla gave no figures for inflation. Official estimates put inflation at between four and five percent, but economists say it runs as high as 12 percent.</p>
<p>Like its Gulf Arab neighbours, the UAE wants to diversify its economy to reduce vulnerability to fluctuations in world oil prices. ($1=3.67 dirhams)</p>
