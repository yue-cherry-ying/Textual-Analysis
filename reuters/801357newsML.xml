<p>The Swiss cabinet has drafted a plan to lower the federal government's 1998 deficit to roughly 5.5 billion Swiss francs ($3.6 billion) from 8.7 billion francs projected earlier, a Federal Finance Ministry spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Savings will be taken in all areas,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The cuts are part of a longer-term plan to reduce the deficit to four billion francs by 1999 and to no higher than one billion francs by 2001.</p>
<p>By Wednesday evening, the cabinet nearly completed the plan, expected to be finalised later this month. The plan must be trimmed by another 100 million francs.</p>
<p>&quot;We still haven't reached the goal of 5.5 billion. We have to find around 100 million yet,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The 1998 deficit would then come close to the projected 1997 shortfall of 5.77 billion francs.</p>
<p>Deficit figures for 1998 exclude a one-time 1.8 billion franc outlay for the Swiss Federal Railway.</p>
<p>To cut costs in 1999 and beyond, the cabinet foresees lowering transportation, social welfare and defense spending.</p>
<p>Swiss economy minister Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, recovering from an operation, was not at Wednesday's meeting. Some of the proposed cuts would fall in his area, including those relating to unemployment compensation, Swiss press said.</p>
<p>With respect to revenues, Swiss news agency SDA reported Swiss Finance Minister Kaspar Villiger said no tax increases are planned beyond those already announced. These include a planned early increase in value-added tax by one percent in 1999, bringing the regular VAT rate up to 7.5 percent.</p>
<p>But Villiger also said he would not be opposed to having experts study if a capital gains tax should be considered if measures are needed to make up for other shortfalls.</p>
