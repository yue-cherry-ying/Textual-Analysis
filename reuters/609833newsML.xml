<p>The massive platform that will produce oil from Canada's Hibernia offshore oil field began its slow journey to the Atlantic Ocean site on Friday, a trip expected to take up to nine days.</p>
<p>Nine tugboats began pulling the concrete and steel drilling and production unit through the shallow waters of Newfoundland's Trinity Bay, the start of a 500-km (310-mile) trip to the Grand Banks off Canada's east coast.</p>
<p>The journey is one of the last milestones before production at the C$5.8 billion ($4.2 billion) Hibernia project starts at the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Hibernia, Canada's first major offshore producing project, has been 18 years in the making.</p>
<p>The project, expected to produce 135,000 barrels of oil a day, has been touted as the driving force behind the brisk oil industry activity off the coast of Newfoundland, a province that has experienced chronic high unemployment made worse by the collapse of its fishing industry several years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;There's tremendous interest. There's parties going on in all the small towns along Trinity Bay,&quot; Harvey Smith, president of Hibernia Management and Development Co., the project's operating company, told reporters after the platform shoved off to reach a speed of 1.5 knots (3 km/1.8 miles per hour).</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of Newfoundlanders put a lot of hours into this project, so they're watching it leave where it was built,&quot; Smith said.</p>
<p>Partners in Hibernia are Petro-Canada with 20 percent, Mobil Corp. unit Mobil Oil Canada with 33.125 percent, Chevron Corp. unit Chevron Canada Resources with 26.875 percent, Murphy Oil Corp. with 6.5 percent, the government of Canada with 8.5 percent and Norsk Hydro A/S with 5 percent.</p>
<p>The field's reserves are conservatively estimated at 615 million barrels, and production was expected to continue for 18 years.</p>
<p>The platform stands 224 meters (735 feet) high -- half the height of New York's Empire State Building -- and weighs close to 600,000 tons.</p>
<p>Among 12 local residents allowed to watch the operation from a company boat was Betty Gilbert, mayor of the nearby village of Come By Chance.</p>
<p>Gilbert said she felt mixed emotions about the departure of the platform, which was part of the landscape since construction started in 1991 and was a major employer in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;It's one of the greatest things ever to happen to Newfoundland,&quot; she said. &quot;When the fog lifted this morning, it was as if a curtain had lifted and the platform was saying good-bye.&quot;</p>
<p>The tow-out of the platform will follow a route along the edge of the Grand Banks in relatively deep water until it is just north of the Hibernia field, 315 km (195 miles) southeast of the Newfoundland capital of St. John's, before being moved to the site for installation.</p>
<p>Once the platform is parked on the seabed, more than 400,000 tons of iron ore ballast will be added to the iceberg-resistant concrete gravity base structure over a 30-day period. Drilling was slated to start in August.</p>
