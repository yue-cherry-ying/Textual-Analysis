<title>ITALY: Delay in Italy DECT rules bad for users - Antitrust.</title>
<headline>Delay in Italy DECT rules bad for users - Antitrust.</headline>

<p>Italian government delays in approving rules for frequency band access are seriously prejudicing potential users of DECT advanced cordless telephone systems, the country's Antitrust authority chairman said.</p>
<p>Italy has not yet finalised authorisation rules for mobile phones using the DECT (Digital European Cordless Telephony) standard.</p>
<p>The Antitrust body also saw &quot;serious dangers&quot; if public operators were allowed to maintain a long-term monopoly in the sector, Giuliano Amato said in the authority's annual report.</p>
<p>The absence of a national regulatory framework covering access to frequencies, due to Italy's delay in conforming to European Union norms, &quot;has so far hampered the development of the market, seriously prejudicing consumers,&quot; Amato said.</p>
<p>Italy currently has two GSM standard mobile phone service operators, state-controlled Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM) and Olivetti -controlled Omnitel. Both firms are interested in DECT technology and state-controlled fixed line operator Telecom Italia also wants to set up its own DECT service.</p>
<p>An EU directive includes DECT among the mobile services deregulated as of July 1, 1996 and any authorisation must conform to this ruling.</p>
<p>&quot;The current uncertainty is hindering potential entrants and in fact is favouring the public operator,&quot; Amato said.</p>
<p>If the public operator was allowed to operate as a monopoly in DECT for a sufficiently long time &quot;this could further delay an effectively competitive contest for the supply of telephone services,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>To liberalise the entire telecoms market it was not enough just to take on board the EU directives, it was also necessary to accompany them with actual regulations in order to implement them, he said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Amato called for urgent government approval of the law setting up a telecoms sector watchdog authority which is still stuck in the upper house Senate.</p>
