<p>McDonald's is getting McSerious about its french fries -- and is taking the message to television, where, for the first time in years, it is directly targeting its major competitor.</p>
<p>McDonald's launched a national television advertisement in late March, aiming at rival Burger King's french fries. The ad shows a crew supposedly filming a bag of Burger King french fries while munching on McDonald's fries.</p>
<p>The french fry ad is a departure for McDonald's, which, by its own estimation, has not directly mentioned a competitor in its advertising for at least 10 years.</p>
<p>&quot;We consider our fries to be the gold standard in the industry,&quot; McDonald's spokeswoman Anna Rozenich said. &quot;No one can match them.&quot;</p>
<p>While McDonald's often promotes a particular product, its ads often have more of a &quot;touchy, feely&quot; quality to them, featuring happy families or its Ronald McDonald clown mascot, said Dennis Lombardi, director of restaurant consulting for Technomic Inc. of Chicago.</p>
<p>Kim Miller, a spokeswoman for Burger King, said her firm is operating from &quot;a tremendous position of strength,&quot; which is why McDonald's is targeting it.</p>
<p>Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan Plc, is also testing new french fry products, Miller said, but she did not give any further details.</p>
<p>While McDonald's, with more than 21,000 units worldwide, is the largest fast-food chain, it faces a strong threat from Burger King, which has about 9,000 units worldwide.</p>
<p>&quot;Burger King is the one, from a competitive perspective, that has had the biggest impact on McDonald's for two years,&quot; said Dean Witter analyst David Adelman.</p>
<p>By featuring its french fries, Adelman added, McDonald's is promoting a high-volume, high-margin product.</p>
<p>&quot;For years and years and years, McDonald's fries had been one of its signature products,&quot; said Lombardi.</p>
<p>The television ad campaign is by the Leo Burnett agency of Chicago. The value of the contract has not been disclosed.</p>
<p>Advertising targeting a specific competitor, such as the french fry commercial, can be effective as long as consumers do not consider them to be too mean-spiritied, said Satya Menon, assistant professor of marketing at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>&quot;The information that they're getting out of the comparison is useful information,&quot; Menon said.</p>
<p>But the risk is that while promoting its own brand, McDonald's is also putting its competitor in the consumer's mind, added John Lister, chief executive officer of Lister Butler Inc., a New York-based brand identity consultant.</p>
<p>&quot;You cannot continue to run (this kind of) commercial. You are doing as much good for Burger King as you are for McDonald's,&quot; Lister said. &quot;Why do you want to bring up the largest competitor's brand name?&quot;</p>
