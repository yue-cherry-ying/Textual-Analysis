<p>European straight-run fuel held steady on Thursday in very quiet business, though sellers hoping to get three figures for their material took comfort from the rise in Brent futures, traders said.</p>
<p>Low sulphur straight-run was only available out of Antwerp and Scandinavia and was being offered around $100-$101 fob. European public holidays meant most sellers were away from their desk and discussion was limited.</p>
<p>The last physical deal was 25,000 tonnes believed traded from an Irish refiner to a French major on Tuesday at a price around $97 fob.</p>
<p>Russian material was in short supply in the north. One M100 cargo was rumoured to have gone into Britain as bunker material, but the deal could not be confirmed. E-4 cargoes were in demand but none were on offer.</p>
<p>Russian fuel oil flowed more freely in the Mediterranean and premiums were described as poor.</p>
