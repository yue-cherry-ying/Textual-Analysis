<p>Wobbly Indian stock markets steadied Tuesday on hopes a market-friendly budget will survive Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's crisis-wracked government, brokers and analysts said.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda's nine-month old 15-party minority coalition government of Deve Gowda faces a confidence vote by April 11 after the Congress party on Sunday withdrew its crucial support.</p>
<p>&quot;Our basic view is that the budget will remain intact,&quot; said Ajit Dayal, managing director of Quantum Financial Services which advises foreign and domestic clients. &quot;By and large there'll be no changes.&quot;</p>
<p>But analysts pinned hopes on parliament passing the 1997/98 (April-March) budget regardless of the political crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;There might be minor changes but we're hopeful the budget will go through,&quot; said Vinay Motwani at brokerage KBS Capital Management Ltd.</p>
<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) top-30 share index was 69.54 points, or 2.07 percent, higher at 3,430.43 in late trading on Tuesday afternoon, up from an early low of 3,315.36.</p>
<p>The index had plunged more than eight percent on Monday rocked by worries about the fate of the budget after the Congress party pulled the rug from under the government.</p>
<p>The biggest beneficiaries of the budget, which cut corporate and personal income taxes, was India's burgeoning middle class of about 150 million people and no political party or group could ignore them, Dayal said.</p>
<p>&quot;There'll be a whiplash if the tax breaks are withdrawn,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think any government can afford to do that.&quot;</p>
<p>The budget announced on February 28 set forth a new agenda since India began economic reforms five years ago. It restricted government borrowings, raised foreign portfolio limits in firms and allowed companies to buy-back their own shares.</p>
<p>Some traders saw bargains in the fall.</p>
<p>&quot;There're good opportunities at declines,&quot; said S.M. Athalye, vice president (investments) at Tata Asset Management Ltd, which manages mutual funds. &quot;We have been buying into the fall .. some foreign funds have also bought shares.&quot;</p>
<p>The political crisis would however result in populist measures by whatever coalition took office because of the possibility of mid-term polls.</p>
