<p>China's top securities watchdog has set new requirements for 1997 interim reports by listed firms and ordered a fresh audit for firms which have posted losses in the past two years, the Shanghai Securities News said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) in a circular also ordered an audit for companies that want to issue rights and bonus shares and cash dividends in the second half of this year, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Interim results in China have previously not required auditing.</p>
<p>The CSRC also told listed companies to explain in their interim results how they had invested money raised in share issues.</p>
<p>Companies which failed to invest the money in accordance with their issue prospectuses must explain why.</p>
<p>Firms which posted 1996 net profits more than 20 percent lower than their forecasts must give a full explanation and those which posted a 1996 loss must state what they have done in the first half of 1997 to regain profitability, the CSRC said.</p>
<p>The CSRC also urged exchanges to strengthen supervision of the interim reports to ensure the listed firms post accurate and comprehensive results.</p>
