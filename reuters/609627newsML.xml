<p>Hundreds of people protested in the Bangladesh capital Dhaka on Friday against a planned weekend visit by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori aimed at expanding bilateral cooperation.</p>
<p>&quot;We denounce the upcoming visit of Peru's hated President Fujimori who has dealt inhumanely with anti-fascist revolutionaries, including communist leader Abimael Guzman,&quot; said protest organiser Nirmal Sen.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an act that deserves to be protested for the sake of human rights, democracy and freedom,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>The demonstration was organised by the Democratic Revolutionary Council, a grouping of Bangladeshi left-wing political parties.</p>
<p>Guzman, leader of Peru's Maoist Shining Path rebels, was captured in 1992.</p>
<p>His arrest hurt the rebels but they have regrouped in the past year and remain stronger than the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement despite that group's notoriety following the recent hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador's residence in the Peruvian capital Lima.</p>
<p>Peru's guerrilla conflicts have cost at least 30,000 lives and $25 billion in damage to infrastructure since 1980.</p>
<p>Protesters burned an effigy of Fujimori in front of the national press club in Dhaka and criticised the Bangladesh government for inviting him.</p>
<p>They vowed to stage a black flag protest when Fujimori arrives on Saturday for a two-day visit.</p>
<p>The official BSS news agency said Fujimori would be the first South American head of state to visit Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Bangladesh and Peru would sign two agreements for the expansion of trade and scientific cooperation, foreign office sources said without giving details.</p>
<p>Fujimori, who will be flying to Dhaka from Vietnam, will go to India from Bangladesh.</p>
