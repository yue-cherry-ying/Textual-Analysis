<p>The Brough Superior motorcycle which Lawrence of Arabia was riding when he crashed and died in 1935 is up for sale.</p>
<p>John Truss, acting on behalf of the bike's owner, who wants to remain anonymous, said &quot;the world's most famous and romantic motorcycle&quot; was on offer for two million pounds ($3.3 million).</p>
<p>T.E Lawrence was riding the powerful 1,000cc Brough back to his cottage, Clouds Hill, on May 13, 1935 when he shot over the handlebars after trying to avoid two boys on bicycles. Six days later he died in hospital at nearby Bovington Camp.</p>
<p>Lawrence was a keen motorcyclist, who owned  seven of the famed Brough bikes. In a letter to the factory after taking delivery of his last machine, he wrote: &quot;It is the silkiest thing I have ever ridden.&quot;</p>
<p>The bike, registration number GW2775, has been owned by a motorcyle historian in southern England for the past 20 years. He now wants to sell because of failing health.</p>
<p>Truss said he had recently turned down an offer of 1.5 million pounds from an American collector.</p>
<p>Motorcycle experts say that a Brough in the same condition as Lawrence's but without the history should fetch up to 50,000 pounds. What that history is worth is impossible to say, as the bike is unique among the 1,000 or so Broughs that still survive, but the two million pound price tag has raised some eyebrows.</p>
<p>After Lawrence had his accident, the bike was returned to the factory, where it was repaired and sold. Traces of the original damage can still be seen on the front mudguard.</p>
<p>Lawrence crashed only a short distance from his cottage, which he used to revise his masterpiece &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; while serving as a private in the Tank Corps at Bovington.</p>
<p>The peace of the cottage, preserved exactly as he left it more than 60 years ago, is disturbed by the roar of tanks on the army's nearby testing ground.</p>
<p>Lawrence won fame as &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; when he served with Arab forces and united them during World War One to fight against Germany's Turkish allies.</p>
