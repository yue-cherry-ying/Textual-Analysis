<title>SINGAPORE: Asia Fuel Oil-Firm with active bids, Indian demand.</title>
<headline>Asia Fuel Oil-Firm with active bids, Indian demand.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>The high sulphur fuel oil market was supported at firm levels on Tuesday with strong expectations that a big Singapore trading company would continue bidding up prices while India emerged for more April supplies, traders said.</p>
<p>Bids for the 180-cst grade for late April lifting were heard at $100/$101 per tonne while offers came down to $102 from an initial $103.</p>
<p>The 380-cst grade was heard bid/offered at $95/$96 per tonne.  </p>
<p>On Monday, bids from the local trading company for the 180-cst grade moved around $100 per tonne but there were no suppliers.</p>
<p>&quot;It's quite clear that the local trader wants to support the market because he started to bid,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;Suppliers are hoping the local trader to continue bidding up so they are unwilling to sell now,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Recent fuel oil purchase by Taiwan and India also inspired a more bullish sentiment, traders said.  </p>
<p>India issued a tender to buy a 30,000-tonne cargo of 3.5-percent sulphur fuel oil for April 26-30 lifting, after already buying three cargoes for April lifting.</p>
<p>Traders said India's recent purchase was to meet seasonal demand in the summer time.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall the demand side is quite healthy, so prices should continue going up, or at least well-supported,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>In the LSWR market, bids were heard at $17.30 per tonne but sentiment was bearish.  </p>
<p>Indonesia's state oil company Pertamina has announced the loading schedule for its 3.6 million barrels of LSWR for lifting in April, lower than 3.7 million barrels in March.</p>
<p>However, traders were bearish amid weak regional demand and a surplus of barrels with some 400,000 to 500,000 barrels rolled over for lifting in April from March.</p>
<p>There was also about 1.0 million barrels of straight-run LSWR available from Singapore and Malaysia in April, they said.  </p>
