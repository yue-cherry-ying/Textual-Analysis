<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Tuesday were seen $0.50 per cwt lower following the Memorial Day holiday weekend, livestock dealers and packer buyers said.</p>
<p>All major U.S. hog plants will be closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day.</p>
<p>Cash hog prices were seen pressured by an expected increase in hogs that could come to market following the long weekend, sources said. Prices also were seen pressured by continued sluggish pork demand.  </p>
<p>The soft pork demand pulled fresh wholesale loin prices lower this week compared with last, despite reduced hog slaughter, sources said.</p>
<p>Bone-in, fresh loins weighing 13-18 lbs, 1/4-inch trim Thursday were quoted at $145.00 per cwt, a $9.90 drop since last Friday, USDA statistics showed.</p>
<p>The interior Iowa/southern Minnesota top price for hogs delivered to plants Tuesday was seen at $58.50 per cwt and the top at Illinois plants was expected at $57.50, sources said.</p>
<p>Indiana/Ohio top values for hogs delivered to the plant could range $58.50 to $59.00, sources there said.</p>
