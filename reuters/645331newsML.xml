<p>The French Defence Ministry said on Sunday that a French soldier was killed and five others were wounded in a firefight in Congo Brazzaville on Saturday between French and Congolese soldiers.</p>
<p>&quot;One French soldier has been killed and five others wounded, two of them seriously,&quot; a Defence Ministry spokesman told Reuters. &quot;In addition, one senior officer in the Congolese army was wounded.&quot;  </p>
<p>The ministry spokesman said the clash occurred on Saturday evening when French soldiers attempted to evacuate French cooperation workers from a building in Brazzaville where they had been pinned down by Congolese soldiers.</p>
<p>Three days of clashes pitting supporters of former president Denis Sassou Nguesso against soldiers loyal to President Pascal Lissouba and other political and ethnic rivals have rocked Brazzaville, capital of the former French colony.</p>
<p>The French Foreign Ministry said on Saturday it saw no reason for French residents of Brazzaville to leave the country but it advised them to remain in their homes.</p>
<p>French soldiers came to Brazzaville several months ago and had been on standby to evacuate foreign nationals from Kinshasa during the final days of the civil war in the neighbouring country that brought Laurent Kabila to power.</p>
