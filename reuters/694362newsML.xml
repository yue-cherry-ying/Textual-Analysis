<p>The warring factions in the Congo Republic capital Brazzaville agreed a new week-long ceasefire and fighting eased on Saturday in the devastated city.</p>
<p>But as during previous truces in the three-week showdown between President Pascal Lissouba and his predecessor, former military ruler Denis Sassou Nguesso, some shooting continued as the rival forces jockeyed for position.</p>
<p>Civilians, fearing for their lives after battles in which the indiscriminate use of rockets and mortars has made anyone and everyone a target, jostled to take trucks and buses out of the southern suburbs -- relatively unscathed to date.</p>
<p>&quot;The ceasefires here are like fish -- good when fresh, then they go off,&quot; one French official in the city commented.</p>
<p>Military chiefs agreed late on Friday to order their arms silenced for a week, but neutral mediators under mayor Bernard Kolelas, having watched previous accords fall apart, were cautious.</p>
<p>&quot;This was agreed orally but not in writing because we prefer that the population should be the ones who decide if the ceasefire really takes hold,&quot; an aide to Kolelas, whose own fighters have kept out of the conflict to date, told Reuters.</p>
<p>There are not too many residents left to judge.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people fled the city on Thursday and Friday after a battle to control the international airport ignited the heaviest artillery exchanges so far. Both sides claimed victory but independent confirmation was not possible.</p>
<p>More of the city's one million residents jostled to get a place on trucks or buses that were leaving on Saturday, heading into the countryside from the southern suburbs.</p>
<p>The southern suburbs, held by Kolelas' own militia, had provided refuge to people fleeing the front line that bisects the city centre. This week dozens of shells, presumably strays, landed there.</p>
<p>Medical workers estimate that 1,000 to 3,000 people, mostly civilians caught in crossfire, have died since the clashes began on June 5 when Lissouba moved to disarm Sassou's &quot;Cobra&quot; militia in the run-up to a July 27 presidential election.</p>
<p>The president accused his former Marxist predecessor of trying to stage a coup. Sassou Nguesso says Lissouba provoked trouble as an excuse to cling on to power beyond the now suspended presidential election.</p>
<p>France's ambassador and his staff, accompanied by French gendarmes sent in to protect them and by a few journalists, were stuck in his embassy, about 200 metres (yards) from the front line. The embassy was still technically open for business.</p>
<p>A tank from Lissouba's fragmented army fires at the Cobras from the street outside. Mortar shells crash into the area.</p>
<p>Nearby, flows the Congo river, separating Brazzaville and Kinshasa, capitals of the old French and Belgian Congos.</p>
<p>Lissouba has pleaded for immediate military help from France, the former colonial power, in a letter from his ambassador to the national assembly in Paris. &quot;If France does not act as rapidly as possible, Congo's democratic regime will live or perish in bloodshed,&quot; wrote Pierre-Michel Nguimbi.</p>
<p>France withdrew 1,250 soldiers from Brazzaville a week ago after evacuating almost 6,000 foreign nationals. It has ordered a review of military ties to old African colonies and declined front-line troops for a proposed U.N. peacekeeping force.</p>
