<p>China's state-approved Protestant leaders on Monday called on overseas Christians and media to take a more positive view of Beijing's religious record, but warned foreigners not to interfere in matters of Chinese faith.</p>
<p>Beijing's atheist communist leaders were committed to defending religious freedom and foreign reports of the widespread oppression of Christians were false, said Han Wenzao, president of the China Christian Council.</p>
<p>Discrimination was still occasionally suffered by Chinese Protestants -- even those within the state-controlled Church -- but many Western reports focused on such problems and ignored an overall positive situation, Han told a news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;China is so vast, you cannot expect the policy of religious freedom to be implemented equally everywhere,&quot; Han said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think some of the authors... have their own motives, but the fact is there is no general persecution in China,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Both Catholicism and Protestantism are strictly controlled in China by state-established churches that ensure foreign involvement is restricted and that religion influence is kept largely within the walls of the nation's halls of worship.</p>
<p>The days when Protestant expansion was backed by the imperial power of Western invaders were long gone, and China would manage its growing church itself, said Luo Guanzong, chairman of the Three-self Patriotic Movement Committee.</p>
<p>The Three-Self movement, which promotes self-administration, self-reliance and self-propagation, has grouped all Protestant denominations under one body since the 1950s.</p>
<p>Chinese believers who refuse to accept the strictures of the state organisation must worship in unauthorised informal groups or &quot;house churches&quot;.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based Human Rights Watch/Asia says China has stepped up harassment of unauthorised Christian groups in recent years and has tightened controls on contacts with foreigners.</p>
<p>Beijing has tried to counter such reports by publicising its work in ending the oppression suffered by Christians during the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and by arguing that tough action has been taken only against extremist cults.</p>
<p>Protestants from overseas were welcome to help develop the church in China as long as they did not try to carry out secret missionary work or to smuggle in foreign bibles, said Han.</p>
<p>&quot;We want foreign partnerships... but it must be according to our agenda,&quot; said Han, a lay official who described his role in the Protestant Church as that of a &quot;traffic policeman&quot;.</p>
<p>China printed 3.3 million bibles in 1996, more than matching demand and making smuggled imports unnecessary, said Luo.</p>
<p>&quot;Now anyone can buy a bible at our churches and the price is very low,&quot; he said. &quot;China is now the biggest bible printing country in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Luo said there were now around 10 million Protestants in China, adding that about 500,000 new converts joined in both 1994 and 1995.</p>
<p>Another 20 million believers are estimated to practise their faith in underground churches, but Han dismissed such figures as wildly exaggerated.</p>
<p>As a Christian he would be delighted if Protestant ranks had swelled by so much, even if the adherents involved practised outside the state-approved church, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But... to my knowledge, there is not such a big house church movement,&quot; he said.</p>
