<p>Late profit-taking reversed early gains for Taiwan shares on Thursday on fears the domestic political situation will remain unstable in the near term, brokers said.</p>
<p>The weighted index lost 77.22 points, or 0.92 percent, to end at 8,349.85, well off an intra-day high of 8,479.32. Turnover was a heavy T$115.5 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;People appear to be unsatisfied with the ruling party's decision of a partial cabinet reshuffle,&quot; said Alex Chan, an analyst of HSBC James Capel. &quot;Local politics is expected to be unstable and uncertainty is the market's biggest enemy.&quot;  </p>
<p>President Lee Teng-hui has asked Premier Lien Chan to &quot;make some adjustments&quot; in cabinet positions following growing public outcry over worsening social disorder. But Lee rejected Lien's resignation offer.</p>
<p>Brokers said the 8,500-point was a strong technical barrier.</p>
<p>Central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong told the parliament on Thursday that the central bank had no plan to cut banks' reserve requirements at its scheduled board meeting at 0700 GMT.  </p>
<p>&quot;Sheu's comments fall into the market's expectations,&quot; Chan said.</p>
<p>Financial shares were weak, falling 1.33 percent.</p>
<p>Electronics were mixed, with leading chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor falling T$1 or 0.97 percent to T$102.5.</p>
<p>Notebook computer maker Inventec Corp rose by the daily seven percent limit to T$353 on expected sound outlook after U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp on Wednesday launched its new Pentium II microprocessors.</p>
<p>A range of 8,250-8,450 was seen for Friday.</p>
