<p>A fire on Friday damaged the world renowned &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; house on Prince Edward Island, a much loved tourist attraction in Atlantic Canada, authorities said.</p>
<p>Fire officials said the blaze broke out early on Friday and spread through the main rooms of the 19th-century farmhouse, which was the inspiration for Lucy Maud Montgomery's 1908 novel &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a major disaster. We have extensive damage in the central portion of the house at the ground level and we have extenuating fire damage into the upper level,&quot; said Fire Marshall Dave Blacquiere. &quot;There is smoke damage and considerable water damage throughout the building.&quot;</p>
<p>The cause of the fire was under investigation.</p>
<p>Although the exterior of the house was not damaged, the central interior and much of the house's period furniture was scorched and damaged by smoke, soot and water.</p>
<p>Blacquiere said his heart sank when he received the early morning alarm. He had hoped the fire would be anywhere but the Green Gables house.</p>
<p>&quot;We live amongst Anne of Green Gables folklore, so when any small portion of that is taken away from us, it's hurtful,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>But Blacquiere said the house was structurally sound and could be restored.</p>
<p>Parks Canada spokeswoman Elaine Robichaud said officials expected to be able to salvage most of the artifacts and reconstruct the inside of the house. The two-storey, green-gabled house had been open for just more than a week for the summer season when it caught fire.</p>
<p>&quot;We are hoping for August to get the house fully operational,&quot; said Robichaud.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Parks Canada, which operates the site, will offer audio-visual presentations in a recently built addition to the site, and guided visits of the trails and surrounding landscape that inspired much of Montgomery's work.</p>
<p>The house, which is open from May to late October, attracts about 220,000 visitors each season from all over the world, especially Japan.</p>
