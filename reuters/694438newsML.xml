<p>The general who will command China's troops in Hong Kong said the soldiers were ready for service and confident of winning the trust of the territory's people, the Xinhua news agency said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Trucks, naval vessels and aircraft were in place to transport more than 4,500 PLA troops now standing by in neighbouring Shenzhen into Hong Kong to take over the defence of the territory on July 1, Major-General Liu Zhenwu told Xinhua.</p>
<p>&quot;We are determined, confident and able to perform satisfactorily in defence of the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region), to win the trust of the compatriots there,&quot; Xinhua quoted garrison commander Liu as saying.</p>
<p>The troops will enter Hong Kong in two waves before and after the midnight handover on June 30, when 156 years of British colonial rule end.</p>
<p>The first 509 troops are to cross the border at 9 p.m. (1300 GMT) on Monday.</p>
<p>Six hours after the handover they will be followed by another 4,000 soldiers, backed by helicopters, patrol boats and armoured personnel carriers.</p>
<p>Liu called the soldiers an important symbol of China's sovereignty and said they would perform their duties strictly in line with Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law.</p>
<p>&quot;Resplendent in specially designed uniform and in high spirits, the PLA men are awaiting orders to march,&quot; Xinhua said.</p>
<p>The soldiers have received intensive education on politics, law and ethics and every member of the corps knows the laws that apply in Hong Kong under the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; formula by which Beijing recovers sovereignty, it said.</p>
<p>Many have learned to speak English and Cantonese, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;All the drivers have learned the local traffic rules,&quot; it said. They have also had to learn to drive on the left side of the road since Hong Kong follows the British style. China drives on the right.</p>
<p>The prospect of armoured vehicles rumbling through Hong Kong's streets within hours of the handover, igniting painful memories of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, sparked outrage among democracy activists in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Outgoing Governor Chris Patten blasted the move as &quot;a most appalling signal&quot;, not because China did not have the right to post troops to the territory, but because of the timing of the deployment and the method.</p>
<p>International reaction has been muted.</p>
<p>Future Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa sought to calm anxieties on Saturday by insisting that Chinese troops could not move against the local population without his order.</p>
<p>Diplomats and military analysts said the troop movement had been expected and the timing of the move fitted with Beijing's eagerness to assert its sovereignty.</p>
<p>Major-General Liu said the troops had completed all training courses according to plan and were ready to roll into the territory with fuel, provisions and medicine in place.</p>
<p>Their aim was &quot;to accomplish the commission that the motherland and the people have bestowed on us&quot;, Liu said.</p>
