<p>The light at the end of the tunnel of Israel's slowing economy may very well be the glow of a computer screen.</p>
<p>The central bank's 1996 annual report, presented to parliament's finance committee on Tuesday, said that the growth of Israel's gross domestic product slackened last year but the high technology sector flourished and was building the basis for future growth.</p>
<p>&quot;The fast growth rate of past years slowed in 1996....but at the same time the growth trend continued in capital stock -- both physical and research and development stock -- mainly in the sectors rich in capital and human resources,&quot; the central bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is creating an appropriate basis for future export growth,&quot; it concluded.</p>
<p>Israel's GDP grew just 4.4 percent last year, down from an annual rate of six to seven percent in the first half of the decade.</p>
<p>The bank attributed the slowdown to the bus bombings early in 1996, which caused tourists to cancel reservations and Israel to close its borders to Palestinian workers from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>It also cited the political uncertainty generated by last year's general elections as well as the dwindling benefits of the wave of immigration from the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>But while the rest of the economy took a hit, Israeli makers of electronics, software and pharmaceuticals were barely touched.</p>
<p>Exports in Israel's &quot;traditional&quot; industries fell 1.5 percent last year but high-tech exports surged 9.1 percent, the Bank of Israel said. It estimated technology accounted for 80 percent of Israel's industrial exports last year and 34 percent of overall exports.</p>
<p>&quot;The big growth in these sectors was supported by foreign investors -- both private investors and those who invested through public offerings (of Israeli companies) in overseas stock markets,&quot; said the report.</p>
<p>Israeli companies, nearly all of them high tech, raised $761 million overseas last year, 2-1/2 times the amount in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;In some of these sectors bigger (export) growth was constrained by the severe shortage of workers in certain professions,&quot; the bank said.</p>
<p>In fact, the bank said the decline in Israel's unemployment rate to 6.7 percent last year from 6.9 percent in 1995 was due to job growth in high tech.</p>
<p>The Bank of Israel suggested that high tech may even provide a cure for Israel's sluggish productivity growth. After rising 3.0 percent a year in 1990-92, Israel's productivity declined in three out of the next four years, the report said.</p>
<p>But, the bank noted, high technology is more capital intensive and generates higher output per employee.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect that if the trend seen in 1996 towards an increased weighting for high technology industries (in the economy) continues, in the end overall profitability and productivity for industry will also rise,&quot; the bank concluded.</p>
<p>The Bank of Israel warned, however, that continued growth of the country's high-tech sector was threatened by the appreciation of the Israeli shekel since 1994.</p>
<p>Israel's high tech is almost all geared for export, but the shekel gained 4.1 percent last year, according to an index prepared by the Bank of Israel. The shekel's appreciation makes high tech products less price competitive in overseas markets.</p>
