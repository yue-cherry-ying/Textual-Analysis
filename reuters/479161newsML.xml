<p>Indian Foreign Minister Inder Gujral has postponed a planned visit to the United States because of India's political crisis, the State Department said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Gujral was to have come to Washington at the end of next week for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of the constitutional crisis, he will remain in Delhi for the vote of confidence on the government. We hope to reschedule that (visit), of course, as soon as we can,&quot; said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.</p>
<p>India's Congress Party sparked the crisis by deciding on Sunday to withdraw support for Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda of the ruling United Front alliance.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda must call a vote of confidence by April 11.</p>
<p>Burns also applauded India and Pakistan for resuming peace talks after a three-year standoff. &quot;We hope those meetings can continue,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>The four days of talks in New Delhi ended on Monday with a pledge by the two neighbours' foreign secretaries to meet again next week. But both sides said on Tuesday that meeting might be postponed because of the Indian crisis.</p>
