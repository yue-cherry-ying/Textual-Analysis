<p>Russia's known, unmined ore reserves containing gold, platinum and palladium will last for several decades, Natural Resources Minister Viktor Orlov said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our current unmined gold reserves are enough to allow us to produce twice as much as we do now over the next 20 years,&quot; Orlov told a news conference.</p>
<p>Russian gold output last year is estimated to have been about 124 tonnes.</p>
<p>Orlov said that ore reserves of platinum and palladium were enough to continue current production levels in coming decades.</p>
<p>&quot;Unmined reserves are enough to maintain current levels of production of both platinum and palladium for several decades,&quot; he said, without giving numbers.</p>
<p>&quot;The country's platinum situation is promising. We shouldn't be bothered by the quantities produced now,&quot; he said, without giving further details.</p>
<p>But he said it was necessary to explore new ore reserves.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything depends on keeping up geological exploration work. If we can do that, then we can continue to mine gold for several decades,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said that a mine in the Russian Far East's Koryaksky Autonomous Region which is not part of the Norilsk Nickel metals group, Russia's main platinum group metals producer, had produced four tonnes of platinum last year.</p>
<p>A ministry statement said that Russia's ore replenishment rate for lead and zinc last year was 50 percent of yearly output. The rate for nickel was 33 percent and for copper, 23 percent.</p>
