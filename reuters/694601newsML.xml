<p>Scores of people were missing, feared drowned, after a ferry capsized near Sandwip island in the Bay of Bengal during a rainstorm, police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>They said the ferry with at least 150 people on board was overturned by strong winds 25 km (15 miles) from Chittagong port on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Although many of the passengers managed to swim ashore or were rescued by other vessels, some were still missing and may have drowned,&quot; one police officer said.</p>
<p>In another incident, 10 Bangladeshis working for British Cairn Energy Plc, drilling for gas in the Bay of Bengal, were rescued after their boat sank on Friday, a Cairn official said.</p>
<p>A helicopter from Cairn's drilling ship Ismaya rescued them some 45 km (30 miles) from Kutubdia Island.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a clear weather warning against movement of small craft in the Bay because of a persisting monsoon depression. But the boat ignored it,&quot; one meteorology official said.</p>
<p>Maritime officials said they feared more boats might have sunk in strong winds and heavy rain since Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The sea has been very rough forcing vessels to delay movements between the (Chittagong) port and the outer anchorage,&quot; Harbour Master Kamrul Islam said on Saturday.</p>
<p>In Dhaka, heavy rain flooded many streets and disrupted businesses.</p>
<p>A severe storm in May killed over 100 people and left over a million homeless on the Bangladesh coast and islands in the Bay.</p>
