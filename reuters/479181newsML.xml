<p>The U.S. Gulf Coast featured a plethora of foreign crudes on Tuesday, offering refiners a wide selection as they gear up for the summer driving season, trade sources said.</p>
<p>North Sea Brent remained elusive despite continuing talk. Koch Oil was the player last heard offering Brent at May West Texas Intermediate/Cushing minus 65 cents a barrel. Bids were seen around minus 93 cents.</p>
<p>The U.S. company was heard to have cancelled a vessel that was on subjects, however, after failing to acquire the Brents from British Petroleum, which holds 10 cargoes of unsold April Brent, traders said.</p>
<p>Other North Sea crudes have moved more swiftly. Late last week, a Norwegian company sold an Oseberg cargo to Fina at May WTI minus 85 cents for April 25-30 delivery.</p>
<p>Earlier, the same company sold a Troll cargo to Midwest refiner Farmland at an undisclosed price, traders said.</p>
<p>Oseberg and Gullfaks are now on offer at May WTI minus $1.00 and minus 90 cents, respectively, for end-April or early May arrival on the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>The May spread between West Texas Intermediate/Cushing and Brent was around $1.30-35 a barrel Tuesday afternoon, a level deemed as &quot;wide open&quot; for transatlantic trade in light of the depressed price of dated Brent.</p>
<p>A wet Brent cargo for April 7-9 was sold on Tuesday at May Brent minus 94 cents, up two cents from a deal on Monday but six cents weaker than last Thursday's values, traders said.</p>
<p>In Latin America, Chile's state-owned oil company Empresa Nacional del Petroleo (ENAP) is seeking to buy 960,000 barrels of crude oil for delivery May 20.</p>
<p>The tender will be awarded on April 3.</p>
<p>In its last purchase tender before Easter, ENAP bought 950,000 barrels of Nigerian Forcados and 360,000 barrels of Ecuadoran Oriente for delivery April 10-14.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Colombian Cusiana, a gasoline-rich grade, was heard offered at June WTI minus $1.35 fob for May 7-11 loading.</p>
<p>Market talk, however, suggested the crude could plummet to as low as a $1.70 discount.</p>
<p>Cusiana, like other short-haul barrels, has come under sharp pressure from plentiful transatlantic supplies.</p>
