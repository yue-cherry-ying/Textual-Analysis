<p>Germany's Dresdner Bank AG said on Friday that it was cautiously optimistic for 1997 after a good first quarter and expected to post a result for the full year that would allow an attractive dividend.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the environment remains difficult for the German banks in 1997, after a good first quarter we remain cautiously optimistic for the full year,&quot; chairman Juergen Sarrazin told the bank's annual general meeting.</p>
<p>Sarrazin said Dresdner, Germany's second largest commercial bank, increased its operating profit before risk provisions by 10 percent to 991 million marks ($586.4 million) in the first quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;We are also confident of being able to present a full year</p>
<p>1997 result which will enable us to pay an attractive dividend as well as significantly increase our reserves,&quot; Sarrazin said.</p>
<p>&quot;Once again in 1997, given the opportunity, we will continue to transfer some of the unrealised reserves in our non-bank holdings to strengthen equity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dresdner raised its 1996 dividend to 1.45 marks per share from 1.35 marks and also paid a bonus dividend of 10 pfennigs to mark its 125th anniversary, as its net profit rose 31 percent to 1.58 billion marks.</p>
<p>Sarrazin said earnings in the first quarter of 1997 had as usual been influenced by special factors and could not be directly extrapolated for the full year.</p>
<p>The bank posted a particularly strong rise in commission income for the three-month period, with a 20.6 percent rise to 1.2 billion marks on the back of high equity and mutual fund sales.</p>
<p>Net interest income rose rose 8.8 percent to 1.7 billion marks, but was partly boosted by elements of &quot;quasi-trading income&quot;, Sarrazin said, which were not necessarily sustainable over the full year.</p>
<p>Own account trading income was 330 million marks, which Sarrazin said was very satisfactory, without providing a comparative figure. The first quarter result was, however, equal to half the full trading income for 1996.</p>
<p>Administrative costs rose 10.4 percent to 2.3 billion marks, partly due to the first-time consolidation of RCM Capital Management, without which the rise would have been 7.3 percent.</p>
