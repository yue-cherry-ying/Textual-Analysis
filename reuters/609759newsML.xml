<title>USA: Fed seen refraining from open market operations.</title>

<p>The Federal Reserve is likely to refrain from open market operations on Friday, market sources said.</p>
<p>The Fed injected reserves into the banking system via five-day fixed system repurchase agreements on Thursday.</p>
<p>Analysts interpreted Thursday's operation as an attempt by the central bank to provide the market with sufficient liquidity to span the long Memorial Day Holiday weekend.</p>
<p>By Tuesday, the Fed should get a more accurate estimate on currency demand over the holiday and could choose a longer dated operation -- probably six-day fixed system RPs -- then, analysts said.</p>
<p>With the add need growing in coming weeks, analysts said a permanent injection of reserves could come any time during this period, via an outright purchase of bills or, less likely, a coupon pass.</p>
<p>The Fed has performed a bill pass within two weeks after Memorial Day for six of the last seven years, though the add need this year is not so large as to make one a sure bet, analysts said.</p>
<p>The federal funds rate was trading at 5-5/16 percent, above its 5-1/2 percent target rate, early Friday.</p>
