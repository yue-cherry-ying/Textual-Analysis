<p>Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said before signing the charter of a union deal with Russia on Friday that the document would not move the integration of two Slav countries any further.</p>
<p>&quot;We will confirm 'de jure' what has existed 'de facto' for quite a while,&quot; said the hardline Belarus leader, who was due to sign the document on Friday afternoon with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>&quot;By signing the charter we are just going to put into writing the process of integration between owr countries which is already unfolding,&quot; Lukashenko told Ekho Moskvy radio.</p>
<p>Lukashenko arrived in Moscow on Thursday and sorted out the remaining problems on a charter outlining the union and building on a largely declarative document which they signed on April 2.</p>
<p>He said they had decided to remove a disputed clause directing the union between two former Soviet republics towards the ultimate aim of forming a single federation, which Belarus had opposed.</p>
<p>&quot;We decided that the whole concept of our union is based on the prospects of other countries joining it later,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think Ukraine or Kazakhstan would join a Russia-Belarus union, something we would want to see, if it is a federation?&quot; Lukashenko added.</p>
<p>Lukashenko said he and Yeltsin had decided that some of the decisions of the ruling bodies to be set up to oversee the union would be binding for the Belarus and Russian governments.</p>
<p>Among issues entrusted to the union bodies will be social protection, customs policies and coordination of foreign and military policies, he said.</p>
<p>But Lukashenko added that such decisions should be taken unanimously by both presidents, reducing the practical powers of the union's organs to a minimum.</p>
<p>Nationalist opponents of Lukashenko's authoritarian rule in Belarus have condemned the planned union as a plot by Moscow to revive its empire and rob Minsk of the independence it won when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.</p>
<p>A few dozen demonstrators marched through Minsk on Thursday to protest against the planned union. They burned down a Russian flag and tore portraits of Lukashenko. Police did not interfere.</p>
<p>Russian liberals bitterly oppose the union, saying a deal with Belarus, where the transition from communism has been slow, could hurt Russian democracy and tarnish Russia's image abroad.</p>
<p>But opinion polls show that the majority of the population in both states support the idea of close integration between the two former Soviet republics.</p>
<p>The declarative Union Treaty signed on April 2 was watered down after a last-minute intervention by newly-appointed liberals in the Russian government worried that the original document gave Lukashenko too much power.</p>
<p>The charter, initialled at the same time, was then opened to public debate, but details of what the final version involves have been kept under wraps.</p>
