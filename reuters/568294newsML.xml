<title>CANADA: Bre-X  credit protection/Felderhof resigns.</title>
<headline>Bre-X  credit protection/Felderhof resigns.</headline>
<dateline>CALGARY 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Canada's embattled Bre-X Minerals Ltd said on Thursday that it received court protection from its creditors and that its chief of exploration John Felderhof resigned at the company's request.</p>
<p>Bre-X said its request for creditor protection was granted by the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench, which also appointed Price Waterhouse Ltd to monitor the assets and records of Bre-X and its sister companies, Bresea Resources Ltd and Bro-X Minerals Ltd.</p>
<p>Bre-X also said that &quot;in response to a request from the companies, John Felderhof has resigned from the Boards of Directors of each of Bre-X, Bro-X and Bresea, and is no longer in their employ effective immediately.&quot;</p>
<p>Felderhof is currently at his home in the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p>Bre-X Minerals Chief Executive David Walsh said the purpose of the court filing was two-fold.</p>
<p>&quot;Firstly, with the resignation of two outside directors announced yesterday from the respective boards, we felt it was important that shareholders and creditors of Bre-X, Bresea, and Bro-X derive some confidence from the fact that the assets of the various companies will remain intact,&quot; Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh said in a statement.</p>
<p>Bre-X said on Wednesday that directors Paul Kavanagh and Hugh Lyons quit, leaving three Bre-X managers as the company's remaining directors.</p>
<p>&quot;Secondly, this provides the basis for a mechanism by which the various claims being advanced against the companies can be dealt with in an orderly way,&quot; Walsh said.  </p>
<p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police launched an official investigation into the Busang gold scandal on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We're commencing with a preliminary investigation and making some initial inquiries,&quot; RCMP spokeswoman Deleen Schoff said by telephone.</p>
<p>Walsh asked the RCMP on Tuesday to investigate an alleged fraud perpetrated against his company, but he did not name a suspect.</p>
<p>A second fraud complaint was filed by the Ontario Securities Commission, one of Canada's securities regulators.</p>
<p>The commission also was investigating Bre-X for possible violations of insider trading and disclosure laws.</p>
<p>Bre-X had touted Busang as the century's richest gold strike until a consultant said on Sunday there was virtually no gold worth mining at the Indonesian mine and called the case a fraud &quot;without precedent in the history of mining.&quot;</p>
