<p>Most Americans believe accused Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh is probably guilty of setting the 1995 blast that killed 168 people, according to a poll released on Saturday.</p>
<p>The poll for CNN and Time Magazine showed that 26 percent of respondents believed the charges against McVeigh were &quot;definitely true&quot; while 57 percent said they were &quot;probably true.&quot;</p>
<p>Only five percent believed the charges were probably false, while 12 percent were not sure.</p>
<p>McVeigh, 28, pleaded not guilty to the April 19, 1995 truck bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City, in which 168 people died. He faces the death penalty if convicted.</p>
<p>Fifty-six percent of respondents believed McVeigh would get a fair trial while 36 percent said he would not. Jury selection for the trial is currently underway in Denver.</p>
<p>If McVeigh is convicted, 75 percent of respondents said they felt he should be put to death while 19 percent said he should not. About six percent were not sure.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread sentiment against McVeigh, 76 percent of those polled believed that there were other people involved with the bombing not yet captured or identified by law enforcement. Only nine percent believed that all those connected to the attack have been uncovered.</p>
<p>The phone poll, conducted by Yankelovich Partners on April 16-17, questioned 1,040 adults aged over 18. It has a margin of error of plus or minus three percent.</p>
