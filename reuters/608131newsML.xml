<p>--------------------MARKET COMMENT----------------------------Z * Toronto stocks soared 1.35 percent on Friday to post their second straight record close this week * Gains in 12 of 14 sectors * 107 million shares traded worth C$1.65 billion  </p>
<p>Toronto stocks roared to another record finish on Friday as a broad-based rally set new highs on Canada's biggest stock market.</p>
<p>Strong earnings and a favorable interest rate environment are expected to push Canadian equities even higher next week, analysts said.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Composite Index rose 85.49 points, or 1.35 percent, to finish at 6421.51. It was the 14th record close of 1997 and surpassed the previous record set on Thursday.</p>
<p>The key index also reached a new intraday high of 6423.89 on Friday.  </p>
<p>Interest-rate sensitive stocks led Toronto's rally, with financial services up one percent, utilities gaining over two percent and pipelines up 1.8 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;That's an indication that interest rates really are still a great push to the equity market,&quot; said Fred Ketchen, director of equity trading for ScotiaMcLeod Inc.</p>
<p>Canada's big six banks are expected to post their fourth consecutive round of record profits when they begin reporting second-quarter earnings on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The concensus seems to be we are looking at a record second quarter,&quot; Ketchen said.</p>
<p>Trading was brisk with 107.3 million shares exchanging hands worth C$1.65 billion.</p>
<p>Advancing stocks surged ahead of declines 613 to 383, with 292 issues unchanged.</p>
<p>--- HOT STOCKS ---</p>
<p>* Royal Bank of Canada gained 0.45 to 60.05. Toronto Dominion Bank jumped 0.65 to close at 41.90 after earlier hitting a 52-week high of 42.05. Both banks are scheduled to report their second quarter results on Tuesday.</p>
<p>* Among heavy traders, BCE Inc gained 1.40 to 38 on 1.9 million shares.</p>
