<p>A military judge Tuesday rejected a request to allow attorneys for an Army sergeant charged with rape to question top military officials about their involvement in a controversial sex harassment investigation.</p>
<p>Army Trial Judge Col. Paul Johnston rejected the pre-trial request by lawyers for Staff Sgt. Delmar Simpson. Simpson is charged with several counts of misconduct including rape, forcible sodomy and battery.</p>
<p>Simpson, whose trial is scheduled to begin April 7, would be the first of 10 soldiers charged with sexual misconduct at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground to go to trial.</p>
<p>Simpson's attorneys asked in pre-trial heargins that began Monday that charges against him be dismissed due to heavy pre-trial publicity, excess influence by higher-ups on the case, and lack of a speedy trial.</p>
<p>They also had sought to interview top military officials, such as Army Secretary Togo West and Chief of Staff Dennis Reimer about their handling of public relations in the case.</p>
<p>&quot;What we're trying to do is show an atmophere of undue influence,&quot; said Maj. Mike Sawyers, an attorney for Simpson.</p>
<p>He said the rejection of the request was a setback.</p>
<p>The Army's probe into sexual harassment at Aberdeen and elsewhere has been marred by charges that investigators tried to coerce witnesses into making false allegations of rape, and that the probe has unfairly targeted African American soldiers.</p>
<p>All 10 soldiers charged at Aberdeen are black. Army officials have denied the charges of racism and improper investigative techniques.</p>
<p>Of the 10 soldiers charged, four cases have been resolved.</p>
<p>Capt. Derrick Robertson, the highest-ranking soldier charged in the investigation, was convicted earlier this month of consensual sex with a female trainee but cleared of a rape charge.</p>
<p>Under terms of a plea agreement, Robertson is to serve four months in prison, forfeit pay, and be dismissed from the military.</p>
<p>Staff Sgt. Nathanael Beach, was acquitted in an administrative proceeding of sexual misconduct charges but found guilty of lesser charges including abuse of authority and failure to obey an order. He has appealed.</p>
<p>Two other soldiers charged in the probe received a discharge in lieu of court martial.</p>
