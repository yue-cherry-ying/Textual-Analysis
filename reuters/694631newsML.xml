<p>Repatriation of 43,000 tribal refugees, who fled to northeast India to escape a separatist insurgency in Bangladesh's Chittagong Hill Tracts, is expected to resume next month, officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>They said tribal leaders and officials from Bangladesh and India held talks on Thursday on the return of the refugees.</p>
<p>Nearly 7,000 people returned in the first phase in March and April.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the repatriation will resume next month after peace talks between the government and leaders of tribal Shanti Bahini guerrillas expected on July 14,&quot; Mohammad Ismail, Deputy Commissioner of Khagrachari Hill district told Reuters.</p>
<p>Ismail said he was told at Thursday's meeting that the refugees were eagerly waiting to return home, but not until next round of peace talks.</p>
<p>The talks aim to end a decades old insurgency by the Shanti Bahini in which more than 8,500 people have died.</p>
<p>The rebels began the insurgency in 1973 over demands for autonomy for the 5,500 square mile (14,200 square kilometre) Hill Tracts, which border India and Burma.</p>
<p>They also want 500,000 Bengali-speaking settlers to be expelled from the region, which the rebels consider a tribal homeland.</p>
<p>The officials said broad outlines of a peace agreement had already been reached at the last round of talks between the government and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity, the political wing of the Shanti Bahini, in May.</p>
