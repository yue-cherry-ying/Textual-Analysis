<p>Police have arrested a Geneva fund manager on charges of causing client losses amounting to more than $20 million in speculative dealings in U.S. shares, Swiss news agency ATS reported on Friday.</p>
<p>The agency said the unidentified asset manager was arrested on Wednesday after two of his clients lodged a formal complaint with Geneva police, accusing him of portfolio losses caused by speculation on the U.S. electronic stock market Nasdaq.</p>
<p>ATS said the fund manager had assets worth some 200 million Swiss francs ($135 million) under management. He was working for a firm which had just recently been licensed.</p>
<p>No other details were immediately available.</p>
<p>Growing competition in the Swiss private banking and asset management market has seen a swarm of new asset management companies battling over the pool of capital.</p>
<p>Many are boutique-type operations working with a small number of staff, trying to gain business in a market where investors are demanding lower fees and higher returns.</p>
<p>They share the market with established, old Swiss private banks and such well-capitalised Wall Street powerhouses as Merrill Lynch and Bankers Trust.</p>
<p>Switzerland holds an estimated 40 percent of the private wealth managed offshore and some $1.8 trillion in client assets under management, according to recent Swiss bank surveys.</p>
