<p>The IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, meets on Sunday to fine-tune its Northern Ireland &quot;peace strategy&quot; amid charges that it is inextricably linked to a 28-year-old guerrilla war.</p>
<p>The one-day annual party conference in the border town of Monaghan takes place days after its Irish Republican Army sympathisers detonated two devices and created travel havoc in headline-grabbing attacks in Britain.</p>
<p>But delegates are expected to enthusiastically endorse Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams' strategy of trying to win Northern Ireland seats in Britain's May 1 election to underline popular support for his cause.</p>
<p>The party, which shares the IRA goal of an end to British rule and the reunification of Ireland under Dublin's rule, is confident of winning up to three seats in the poll and will use its mandate to press for inclusion in peace talks.</p>
<p>But the British and Irish governments, partners in a three-year attempt to forge a negotiated settlement to the Northern Ireland conflict, say that a vote for Sinn Fein is a vote of support for IRA violence.</p>
<p>They say that until the IRA restores a truce it broke in February 1996 with a bomb attack on London's Canary Wharf business complex which killed two people, Sinn Fein will not be invited to the talks and will be out in the cold.</p>
<p>A man was charged in Britain on Thursday with the Canary Wharf bombing which ended a 17-month IRA truce that gave Northern Ireland's 1.5 million Protestants and Catholics a rare taste of peace and normality. Since then the IRA has bombed a British army base in Germany, Britain's army headquarters in Northern Ireland and mounted weekly attacks on British security forces in a renewal of its war at what it sees as illegal colonial rule.</p>
<p>Its attacks have effectively ended a matching truce by pro-British Loyalist extremists, who want Northern Ireland to stay British, and have been blamed for a wave of violence including the killing of a Catholic and an attempt to blow up a Sinn Fein function in Monaghan earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Loyalists, who cast themselves as the militant guardians of continued British rule, have not officially declared their truce over but security forces fear it is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Adams is expected to call on Britain's next government to invite Sinn Fein to the Belfast talks, which resume on June 3, without any preconditions in recognition of its electoral support.</p>
<p>It won 15 percent of votes in a poll to a peace Forum last year and claims to command a majority of votes in the pro-Irish 40 percent Catholic minority in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Adams may win a seat in the May 1 poll but will not occupy it because of Sinn Fein's &quot;abstentionist&quot; policy of boycotting the British parliament because it would entail allegiance to London's rule.</p>
<p>A win for Adams or his chief Lieutenant, Martin McGuinness, would present the next British government with the dilemma of having to refuse contact with someone elected to the source of parliamentary democracy.</p>
<p>Britain and Ireland have banned all official contact with Sinn Fein until it proves a commitment to democracy by getting the IRA to end its guerrilla war for good.</p>
<p>That view is supported by President Bill Clinton's U.S. administration, deepening Sinn Fein's international isolation at a time when the party says it is enjoying an unprecedented wave of popular support.</p>
