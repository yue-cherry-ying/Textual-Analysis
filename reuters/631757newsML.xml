<p>America's preoccupation with navel-staring is stronger than ever, if any cultural clues were provided Sunday by the thousands of books on self-improvement and alternative spirituality presented at BookExpo America, the U.S. publishing industry's annual convention.</p>
<p>From alternative medicine to Zen meditation, publishers active in the so-called New Consciousness market said they were thriving on sales of books, music, software, crystals and a vast array of related products.</p>
<p>The category is by some estimates the fastest-growing in publishing and is entering the mainstream, said Matthew Gilbert, managing editor of NAPRA Review, a trade magazine put out by the New Age Publishing &amp; Retailing Alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;It's being absorbed into the popular culture. A lot of publishers are trying to create products that bridge the gap between New Age and the mainstream,&quot; Gilbert said in an interview at the convention.</p>
<p>New Age book purchases totalled 10.6 million copies in 1996, up nine percent from 9.7 million copies in 1995, estimated the American Booksellers Association. That rate of growth far exceeded the three percent growth rate for purchases of all types of books over the same period.</p>
<p>Despite such rapid expansion, the category still represents a small slice of the U.S. book market, in which consumers last year bought 1.1 billion books. About half were popular fiction.</p>
<p>At the BookExpo, dozens of New Age publishers were promoting titles and a seminar was held to familiarize booksellers with New Age topics.</p>
<p>One hot area is aroma therapy with fragrant plants, incense and essential oils. &quot;Sales of aroma therapy products are skyrocketing,&quot; Gilbert said.</p>
<p>Also popular is Feng Shui, the art of altering flow of chi, or universal energy, in your home by rearranging the furniture.</p>
<p>Alternative medicine is big and encompasses herbs, acupuncture, prayer, special diets and various invisible life forces, most presented as options for those fed up with the medical establishment and managed health care.</p>
<p>Astrology, yoga, crystals, meditation, channeling, massage, Tarot cards and other non-traditional ways to look for hope and a better life by turning inward fill out the New Age bookshelves, which are nowhere as full as in America.</p>
<p>&quot;Americans are always biting the bit and we're always doing it in these sort of wacko ways,&quot; said Gilbert, who runs his magazine from the tiny community of Eastsound on Orcas Island in Washington state. &quot;We're obssesive and we're self-absorbed ... We are a culture that likes to reinvent ourselves.&quot;</p>
