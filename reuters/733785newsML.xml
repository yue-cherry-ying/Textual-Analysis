<title>USA: Malcolm Shabazz shows violent tendencies-psychiatrist.</title>
<headline>Malcolm Shabazz shows violent tendencies-psychiatrist.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>A New York psychiatrist recommended on Tuesday that the 12-year-old grandson of Malcolm X be sent to a secure facility for two or three years because he shows violent tendencies toward himself and others.</p>
<p>Malcolm Shabazz pleaded guilty last week to setting the fire that killed his grandmother, Betty Shabazz.</p>
<p>&quot;He's still struggling with his impulsiveness that could cause violence to himself and others,&quot; said Dr. Don Heacock, a psychiatrist at the juvenile detention facility where the boy has been held since his arrest.</p>
<p>Heacock told the judge that he made his &quot;preliminary assessment&quot; based on formal and informal examinations of the boy. He said he still hasn't seen the final probation report that will also include a report from a doctor who is an expert in fire-setting by children.</p>
<p>That report will be discussed at a July 29 hearing.</p>
<p>The psychiatrist said that by &quot;secure,&quot; he meant a place where the boy would stay for a period of time, without home visits and without being able to wander around unsupervised.</p>
<p>At the hearing on Tuesday in Family Court in Yonkers, New York, Heacock also said the boy had &quot;severe psychological problems&quot; and needed extensive psychiatric therapy.</p>
<p>Betty Shabazz, 63, died on June 23 from burns she suffered over 80 percent of her body in the June 1 fire. The New York City medical examineer ruled her death a homicide.</p>
<p>Malcolm Shabazz is the son of Qubilah Shabazz, one of six daughters Betty Shabazz had with Malcolm X -- who was assassinated at the Audubon Ballroom in Manhattan on Feb. 21, 1965.</p>
