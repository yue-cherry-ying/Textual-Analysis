<p>Japan Economic Planning Agency (EPA) Minister Taro Aso told a news conference on Friday that there are some companies which can cope with an exchange rate of 105 yen to the dollar.</p>
<p>Asked how the current exchange rate of about 115 yen to the dollar affects the economy, Aso also said there were some firms which could probably cope with a dollar rate of 105 yen but other companies would not be able to cope with that rate.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are companies which can do business at a currency rate of 105 yen, but I wonder, on average, if others can do that as well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;When I make such a statement, it's often the case that small and medium-sized companies complain about such a statement,&quot; he added.</p>
