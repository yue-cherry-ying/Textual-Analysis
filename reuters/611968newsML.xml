<headline>Turkish coalition MP resigns in Islamist row.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>A Turkish MP from the secularist wing of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's Islamist-led coalition resigned on Friday, Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>The True Path Party deputy. Samil Ayrim, was quoted in the Turkish press on Friday as saying he would quit as part of a row over the government's Islamist leanings.  </p>
<p>The resignation leaves the coalition with 279 MPs, a wafer-thin majority in the 550-member parliament.</p>
<p>Erbakan won an opposition censure motion this week by only half a dozen votes. He was helped by six MPs from a small right-wing party who backed the government.</p>
<p>The Hurriyet daily quoted Ayrim as saying he wished he had withdrawn support for Erbakan at the censure motion. &quot;I have realised how wrong I was,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The cabinet failed to hold a scheduled meeting on Thursday for the eighth week running amid reports that True Path leader Tansu Ciller had asked Erbakan to hand her the reins of power.</p>
