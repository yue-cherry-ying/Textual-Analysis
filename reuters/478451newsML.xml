<headline>GDR REPORT - Political crisis sparks India GDR falls.</headline>

<p>Indian global depositary receipts posted sharp declines on Tuesday as the market reacted for the first time to local market losses sparked by a political crisis, traders said.</p>
<p>They said the GDR market, closed for four days for the Easter break, had mostly been marked down following Monday's steep eight percent decline in Bombay. Bombay stocks did pick up about two percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The crisis was sparked on Sunday, after the Congress Party withdrew its support for Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's coalition government.</p>
<p>The coalition faces a confidence vote on April 11.</p>
<p>Direction is being dictated by the fate of the 1997/98 budget, which was only expected to go to parliament after the confidence vote.</p>
<p>Gains in Bombay of Tuesday were aided by speculation that the investor-friendly budget could still be passed intact despite the turmoil.</p>
<p>A trader said the GDR market had been stung following recent bullish sentiment after a GDR issue by telecoms group VSNL and the positive budget.</p>
<p>&quot;It has turned for now. Investors are nervous again,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Traders said direction in GDRs would be dictated by the Bombay market on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The HSBC James Capel Indian GDR index  JCEAI closed 6.87 points, or 8.86 percent, down at 70.72 points, with the premium over the local market at 17.85 percent.</p>
<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share index added 66.12 points to 3,427.01.</p>
<p>The Capel Korea GDR Index ended 0.37 points, or 0.61 percent, off at 60.18, a premium of 26.26 percent over the local market.</p>
<p>The Korea Composite Index shed 4.35 points to 672.99.</p>
<p>The Capel Taiwan GDR Index ended down 4.02 points, or 3.20 percent, at 121.64, a discount of 4.71 percent.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Weighted Index added 1.99 percent to 8,163.41 following a 115 point loss on Monday.</p>
