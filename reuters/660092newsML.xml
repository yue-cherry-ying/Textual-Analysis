<headline>Farmers to plow on in ethanol tax war.</headline>

<p>Farm groups said Friday they were down but not out after the House tax-writing panel narrowly defeated a measure to preserve the ethanol tax break, worth billions of dollars a year to American farmers.</p>
<p>&quot;We lost a vote but by no means lost the war,&quot; said Ellen Dougherty of the National Corn Growers Association. &quot;We're looking at the House floor. We've got strong support from the House leadership on both sides of the aisle.&quot;</p>
<p>Ethanol backers hope to quash the proposal to pare down the tax credit for users of the corn-based fuel when the tax bill goes to the full House for a vote, which is expected before the Fourth of July.</p>
<p>That failing, they'll take their fight to the Senate, where farm-state lawmakers have already said they will &quot;wage an all-out battle&quot; against anti-ethanol legislation.</p>
<p>The House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday voted 21 to 17 against an amendment that would have retained tax subsidies for ethanol at present levels by cutting back on corporate capital gains tax relief.</p>
<p>Currently, oil companies get a tax credit of 5.4 cents per gallon when they blend ethanol with gasoline. Ways and Means Committee chairman Bill Archer has proposed trimming the tax break a third of a cent and eliminating it in the year 2000.</p>
<p>The Texas Republican says companies have sold farmers &quot;a bill of goods&quot; that ethanol production is the only way to make a profit. &quot;It is leading farmers into a dead alley,&quot; he said. &quot;The highest and best use of corn is to feed human beings.&quot;</p>
<p>The subsidy has strong support from cornbelt lawmakers, farm groups and the Clinton administration, who all say ethanol is a clean-burning fuel that spurs economic growth in rural America. They say Congress must make good on its promise to keep the tax break in place until the year 2000.</p>
<p>The ethanol tax credit is worth billions of dollars a year to farmers. Ethanol, an alcohol-based fuel derived from corn and other grains, accounts for 5 percent of corn demand.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman served notice this week the administration would fight for the ethanol tax break and wants it extended past 2000.</p>
<p>Administration sources shrugged off Thursday's dusting.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it (the ethanol tax break) has enough powerful supporters in Congress that they will come to its rescue,&quot; said an administration official who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>Ethanol is not expected to show up in the tax package being drawn up by Senate Finance Committee chairman William Roth, a Delaware Republican, which is slated to be unveiled on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know for sure they're leaving ethanol alone in the Senate but we have no reason to believe it will be in there,&quot; said Pat Wolff of the American Farm Bureau Federation. &quot;Our support for ethanol is much stronger in the Senate.&quot;</p>
<p>Proponents admit it will be difficult to kill the ethanol provision on the House floor. The issue is not a lightning rod for urban lawmakers. Instead, some predict the battle will be won when House and Senate conferees meet to mesh tax plans in July.</p>
