<p>Senior Japanese Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara said in a French newspaper interview published on Friday a rise in the Bank of Japan's discount rate should be expected in the coming year.</p>
<p>But he said the Bank would be unlikely to make such a move before assuring itself that there was a solid economic upturn.</p>
<p>Sakakibara, called Japan's &quot;Mr Yen&quot; because of his powerful influence on foreign exchange markets, told afternoon daily newspaper Le Monde that the discount rate was currently at a very low level and a rise of 0.50 percent would still represent a low level.</p>
<p>He also said he believed the future euro single currency would become a pillar of the world monetary system and Japan had to deregulate its financial markets if it wanted to avoid a risk of the yen becoming a &quot;local&quot; currency.</p>
<p>The euro is scheduled for introduction on January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not think the Bank of Japan will raise its discount rate before it is sure of a solid economic upturn,&quot; Sakakibara was quoted as saying. &quot;But the monetary tightening should not have a major impact on the economic recovery,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The discount rate is currently very low. If it rises by 0.50 percent, it will be at 1.0 percent, which remains low. A move on such a scale should be expected in the coming year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The only certainty is that the euro will become one of the pillars of the world monetary system,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to proceed with a deregulation of our financial markets. If we leave them as they are they will become a local market versus the European and American markets and the yen will become a local currency while the euro and dollar will be international currencies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not know how the creation of the euro will modify the value of the yen and the dollar,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;That remains very uncertain and will depend on the number of countries included in the (euro) monetary zone as well as the participation from the outset of countries like Italy and Spain, as well as the attitude of the United Kingdom,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita said on Wednesday that monetary policy was for now geared to ensuring economic recovery.</p>
<p>Although the Bank is seen as under some pressure to raise interest rates, analysts believe it will hold off for the moment.</p>
<p>Sakikibara told Le Monde that he did not see Asia creating a monetary union of its own, because of cultural, religious and historic differences in the region and because for some in the region the dollar was still the reference currency.</p>
<p>Sakakibara repeated that Japan was capable of achieving economic growth of two percent this year, possibly more.</p>
<p>He also said Japan welcomed the recent recovery in the yen and that there was no disagreement on exchange rate policy between the U.S. Treasury and the Japanese Ministry of Finance.</p>
