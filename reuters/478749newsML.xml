<title>ARGENTINA: Argentine bonds higher as market rebounds.</title>
<headline>Argentine bonds higher as market rebounds.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Argentine bonds finished higher Tuesday as the market rebounded from sharp declines a session earlier with U.S. Treasuries lending support.</p>
<p>Traders said activity remained thin, however, as players continued their caution on worries over signs of a stronger U.S. economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is waiting for the release of U.S. unemployment figures Friday,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>Argentina's FRB Brady bond due 2005 was up 5/8 at 89-5/8, while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose $0.60 to 127.05.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market's outlook for this week is not very notable, I expect a flat market,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>Even if the market sprung back this session, traders said there is continued caution by investors as many think further declines are possible if U.S. bonds fall more on worries of a pick-up in inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not think fund managers see value in the market yet,&quot; said another trader.</p>
<p>In the money markets, call money rates rose to 6.75 percent from 6.30 percent.</p>
