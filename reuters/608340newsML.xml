<p>Steffi Graf needed three hours to overcome South African Amanda Coetzer in the Strasbourg semifinals on Friday, avenging a crushing defeat in Berlin eight days earlier.</p>
<p>Graf, who took only one game from Coetzer in the German Open quarter-finals in her first tournament after a three-month injury layoff, won 4-6 7-5 7-6 to move into the final where she will meet unseeded 15-year-old Croatian Mirjana Lucic.</p>
<p>Lucic, who has no world ranking as she is playing in only her second professional tournament, upset fourth seed Judith Wiesner of Austria 7-5 6-7 7-6 in a match only slightly shorter than Graf's at two and three-quarter hours.</p>
<p>It was Graf's 10th victory in 13 matches against Coetzer, who has proved a handful for the German this year, dumping her out of the Australian Open in the fourth round to end her record 45-match unbeaten run in grand slam tournaments.</p>
<p>It was the second successive match in which Graf has dropped the first set following her 3-6 6-2 6-1 quarter-final win over Frenchwoman Sandrine Testud on Thursday.</p>
<p>But the former world number one said she was happy to get as much clay court action as possible before beginning the defence of her French Open title in Paris next week.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think I'm getting too much, though I hope I won't get any three-hour matches in the French Open,&quot; she said, adding that it &quot;will probably not be until Wimbledon that I get my game back.&quot;</p>
<p>Graf said she might have done better against Coetzer if she had attacked the net more, adding she was still lacking confidence after her knee injury.</p>
<p>&quot;Berlin for me just wasn't a match, I wasn't concentrated and I was nervous,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Asked how she felt about meeting Coetzer again at Rolland Garros where they are both in the same half of the draw, Graf said: &quot;Let's just take it match by match.&quot;</p>
