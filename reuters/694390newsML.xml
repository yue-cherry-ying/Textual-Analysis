<p>Ukraine marked the first anniversary of its post-Soviet constitution with a leftist protest, Italian arias and a sea of blue-and-yellow national flags on Saturday.</p>
<p>About 5,000 people, many of them pensioners hobbling with the aid of walking sticks, proceeded along Kiev's main street Khreshchatyk shouting &quot;Down with the president!&quot;.</p>
<p>Their red banners clashed with official national flags lining the street where mass protests heralded independence from Moscow and the end of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
<p>Nostalgic Soviet songs filled the air, at times drowned out by Italian arias being sung at official events on nearby Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) nearby.</p>
<p>They were protesting at living conditions, which for many have worsened despite economic reforms, and the constitution, passed by parliament a year ago and promising rights for all.</p>
<p>&quot;To hell with your prostitution constitution!&quot; yelled a woman in her 60s in a floppy yellow and white cotton hat.</p>
<p>Parliamentary Speaker Olexander Moroz, a socialist, urged the crowd to vote for the left at elections due next March.</p>
<p>He said deputies would not back President Leonid Kuchma if he tried to extend their term by a year, a move Kuchma said he was considering at a concert in Kiev's Opera House on Friday.</p>
<p>Such a move is not allowed under the constitution unless it wins approval from two-thirds of the left-dominated parliament.</p>
<p>Kuchma launched reforms in 1994 but a mountain of unpaid wages and pensions regularly brings workers onto the streets. Saturday's protest was led by the Ukrainian Workers' Union.</p>
<p>Two women bashed saucepans together, chanting: &quot;Fat cats! Fat cats!&quot; as they passed some of the expensive shops which have sprung up in central Kiev since independence.</p>
<p>Protesters and bystanders pointed to their heads to show they thought the other side was crazy.</p>
<p>A shrunken man in his 80s urged an equally shrunken woman of about the same age to join the protest. But she told him: &quot;You want Kuchma to resign, but someone just as bad will come in his place. They're all former Communists, each one as bad the next&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;You are living in a free, independent country!&quot; a man in his 50s screamed as a new chant of &quot;Soviet Union&quot; began.</p>
<p>Ukraine has received billions of dollars in loans and aid from the West, especially Washington which has a strategic interest in strengthening Kiev's independence from Moscow.</p>
<p>But reforms are sluggish, privatisation has proceeded at a snail's pace and widespread government corruption in the country of 51 million is a problem acknowledged even by Kuchma.</p>
<p>A woman in her early 20s, taken aback by the protest, argued with her grandmother on the pavement. &quot;But the Soviet Union did not let us live,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Memories are still strong in Ukraine of decades of Soviet repression, especially an artificial famine in the early 1930s caused by the policies of dictator Josef Stalin.</p>
<p>Stalin's aim was to wipe out powerful landowners and bearers of national sentiment in rural, agricultural communities. More than seven million people starved to death.</p>
