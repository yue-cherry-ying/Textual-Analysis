<p>British Airways on Monday said it aimed to keep around 80 percent of its flights operating worldwide as a 72-hour strike by cabin crew, starting on Wednesday, looked set to go ahead.</p>
<p>As the main union urged more talks, a BA spokesman told Reuters he held out little hope for averting the strike after negotiation broke down on Sunday between BA and the cabin crews' Transport and General Workers' Union (T&amp;G) in a dispute over pay and conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;The union seems determined to go ahead with this dispute...unless they're prepared to change their position fundamentally it seemed to us yesterday there was no point in continuing the dialogue because the gap was too wide,&quot; the BA spokesman said in an interview.</p>
<p>BA's chief executive Robert Ayling is pushing ahead with a plan to save one billion pounds ($1.7 billion) by the end of the century, but cuts have been opposed by the unions who attack Ayling's aggressive management style.</p>
<p>The strikes will be the first major industrial action under the new Labour government.</p>
<p>BA is also in dispute with ground staff over its plans to sell its catering division at London's Heathrow. Caterers will decide later this week on whether to accept management's proposals or to go ahead with strikes agreed last week in a ballot of union members.</p>
<p>The T&amp;G union told Reuters it was still ready to negotiate with BA but would call further cabin crew strikes if no agreement was reached. Talks were held on Sunday through the arbitration service ACAS.</p>
<p>&quot;We remain ready to talk. If (BA chief executive) Bob Ayling wants to end the confrontation all he has to do is pick up the phone but they have to be talks on the substance of the dispute,&quot; Andrew Murray, a T&amp;G spokesman said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>BA said it has started putting its contingency plans in place with the result that only 20 percent of flights worldwide would not operate. BA was unable currently to estimate how much the strike would cost the airline.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday (Sunday) was a deadline for us and we made it clear that from then on we would have to start the programme of contingency,&quot; the BA spokesman said.</p>
<p>The worst-affected flights will be BA intercontinental services from London's Heathrow and Gatwick Airports and its European services out of Heathrow, BA said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The airline said in a statement that all its domestic and European flights from Gatwick would continue to operate as would international flights from regional airports in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>All services operated by BA's franchise and alliance partners would also continue through the threatened strike.</p>
<p>Out of Heathrow, BA would operate almost half of its intercontinental flights and around a quarter of European services, while around one third of intercontinental flights from Gatwick would go ahead.</p>
<p>Customers booked onto cancelled BA flights would be offered flights on the nearest alternative days, offered a full refund or, where possible, transferred to other airlines, BA said. ($ = 0.591 British Pounds)</p>
