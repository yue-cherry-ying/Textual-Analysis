<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan welcomes continued U.S. arms sales.</title>

<p>Taiwan, which fired two U.S. Hawk missiles in the Taiwan Strait on Tuesday in a test seen as bolstering defences against rival China, said it welcomed continued arms sales from the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally, we would not comment on any ongoing arms deal, but for any deal which can help increase our defence needs or maintain peace and stability in a region, we are pleased to have it struck,&quot; said military spokesman Kung Fan-ting.</p>
<p>Kung declined comment on Taiwan media reports that the United States had agreed to sell 54 AGM-84A Harpoon missiles and 21 Super Cobra attack helicopters to Taiwan, a deal that would be certain to anger China.</p>
<p>The latest agreement was made during a meeting between Taiwan and the United States in mid-March to review Taiwan's defence needs in the face of increased Chinese military intimidation against Taiwan, local newspapers said.</p>
<p>Despite the absence of diplomatic relations, the United States and Taiwan hold regular meetings to review Taiwan's purchases of U.S. arms.</p>
<p>Beijing, which has regarded the island as a renegade province since a civil war spilt them in 1949, has repeatedly warned the United States against selling arms to Taiwan.</p>
<p>Washington insisted that the arms it sold to Taiwan were merely defensive.</p>
<p>The short-range, ground-to-air Hawk missiles Taiwan fired on Tuesday were a third-generation version the island began installing in 1995.</p>
<p>Military officers said Taiwan was a pioneer in deploying the latest version of Hawks and U.S. officials were on hand to see the missiles successfully destroy two target planes.</p>
