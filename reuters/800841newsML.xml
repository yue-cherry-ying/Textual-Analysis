<p>-----------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - Aug 14---------------</p>
<p>Gold is still capped by resistance at $330 despite gyrations in stock and currency markets. But it may yet benefit from volatility in other markets, dealers said.</p>
<p>Silver made upside progress on Wednesday but prices need to decisively clear the $4.50 level before moving higher.  </p>
<p>GOLD - The market's latest attempt to push through the $330 level was spurned on Wednesday as the market is still bearish in the longer term and meeting steady selling pressure, dealers said.</p>
<p>Spot gold was bid as high as $329.20 on Wednesday as it tracked volatile action in U.S. stocks and bonds, but then it was sold down again.</p>
<p>&quot;Any time gold goes up two or three dollars, nervous producers sell into the market. Gold is still in a $326-$329 price range,&quot; a senior European dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;But both gold and silver could benefit from further volatility on the stock market,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Spot gold was quoted at $326.80/$327.20 at 0745 GMT, compared to Wendesday's London close of $327.60/$328.10 and New York finish of $326.90/$327.40.</p>
<p>SILVER - Prices leapt higher on Wednesday, at one point hitting a high of $4.56, but to continue making upside progress silver will have to establish a foothold above $4.50, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It traded above $4.50 yesterday but I don't see it clearly established above there,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Spot silver was last indicated at $4.48/$4.50, off two cents from previous London close.</p>
<p>PLATINUM - A lack of fresh news from producer Russia and importer Japan has left the platinum group metals adrift for now although the market is still very tight.</p>
<p>&quot;The PGMs...continue to consolidate after the sell-offs following the contract highs earlier this month,&quot; brokers Rudolf Wolff said in a commentary.</p>
<p>Platinum should find initial support at $430, then at $425 and $420, while resistance is at $440, analysts said.</p>
<p>Spot platinum was last indicated at $432.00/$435.00, down $1.00 from Wednesday's London close.</p>
