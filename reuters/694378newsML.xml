<p>An uneasy calm descended on Albania on Saturday as last-minute preparations got under way for Sunday's first round of elections designed to halt the Balkan nation's slide into anarchy.</p>
<p>Weeks of political campaigning drew to a close on Friday as both main parties, President Sali Berisha's Democrats and their Socialist rivals, held their final rallies in the capital Tirana. No campaigning was allowed on Saturday.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses said the situation in the country's south, focus of an anti-government rebellion sparked by the collapse of pyramid schemes earlier this year, was largely calm.</p>
<p>A correspondent in the town of Sarande, 300 km (180 miles) south of Tirana, said residents were woken in the middle of the night by the sound of an anti-tank missile being fired into the harbour. There were no reports of damage and calm had returned to the Adriatic port town by the morning.</p>
<p>At least 1,500 people have been killed in four months of unrest after hundreds of thousands of Albanians lost their life savings when five pyramid investment funds collapsed.</p>
<p>The south remains largely outside government control as armed gangs and youths roam the streets freely. A 7,000-strong international protection force dispatched to help restore order across the country has made little difference, residents say.</p>
<p>At Tirana airport, some 200,000 freshly-printed ballot papers were due to arrive from Italy for distribution in 10 constituencies across the country after the Central Election Commission had found original ballots were incorrectly worded.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is overseeing the vote, told Reuters the commission had threatened to call off the entire election unless new papers arrived in time.</p>
<p>The poll was called as part of a pact struck at the height of unrest in March to set up an interim government made up of 10 parties.</p>
<p>The last election was held 13 months ago when the Democrats won a crushing victory in Albania's third multi-party elections since the collapse of communism in 1990. International observers said the vote was marred by widespread manipulation and voter intimidation.</p>
<p>Some 500 OSCE observers took up position across the mountainous country to monitor Sunday's voting but there are doubts that this year's polling will be problem-free.</p>
<p>Top OSCE officials have acknowledged the poll was being held in unusual circumstances -- a state of emergency imposed on March 2 is still in force, including a 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew which will be suspended only for election day.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be fair to say already that there are several areas in which it would be difficult to say that this is a normal election,&quot; OSCE election coordinator Tony Welch said.</p>
<p>The two main parties have complained that they were unable to campaign in areas controlled by rival supporters. Berisha's Democrats said on Saturday their representatives on the election commission in the southern port town of Vlore had received anonymous death threats.</p>
<p>A local human rights group said several Albanian journalists in Tirana had also received death threats.</p>
<p>Berisha has pledged to restore order to the country of 3.4 million within 75 days of the poll. Democrat officials predict they will win around 50 percent of the vote.</p>
