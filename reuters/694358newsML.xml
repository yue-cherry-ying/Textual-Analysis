<p>A four-day truce came into force in the Central African Republic capital Bangui on Saturday, consolidating a lull in a week of bloody clashes between African peacekeepers and disaffected soldiers in the city.</p>
<p>Residents said the city was calm as the truce began at 8 p.m. (1900 GMT).</p>
<p>Mali's respected former military leader Amadou Toumani Toure, who brokered a January peace deal to end three army mutinies in under a year, rallied the two sides around the truce as a basis for relaunching the peace process.</p>
<p>His follow-up committee said in a statement the dissident soldiers, a minority of whom had yet to rejoin their units under the January deal, would hand their mortars and other heavy weapons to the French ambassador.</p>
<p>The ambassador, Jean-Marc Simon, and Toumani Toure himself would act as guarantors of the dissidents' security, the statement added.</p>
<p>Talks will continue on relaunching the January deal, which was signed by President Ange-Felix Patasse, the mutineers and representatives of all political groups and society at large.</p>
<p>Captain Anicet Saulet, leader of the mutineers, and General Edjo N'Kili, commander of the MISAB peacekeeping force, signed Saturday's agreement at the French embassy.</p>
<p>The Red Cross says the clashes, which began on June 20 after an incident involving peacekeepers and mutineers who had yet to rejoin their units, have killed about 100 people, many of them civilians caught in crossfire, and wounded at least 150.</p>
<p>The U.N. refugee agency says the clashes triggered an exodus of more than 60,000 civilians for the relative safety of the surrounding countryside. It has appealed for tents.</p>
<p>The city has been calm since Thursday afternoon and residents said some of those who fled had started to return to see what was left of their homes.</p>
<p>Mutinies in April and May 1996 began as pay protests but evolved into a bid to topple Patasse, a civilian from the north, elected in 1993. A third mutiny began in November and degenerated into ethnic bloodshed.</p>
<p>Most of the mutineers are members of the Yakoma tribe of former military leader Andre Kolingba.</p>
<p>Former colonial power France, which has troops in the country under a defence pact, intervened in support of the peacekeepers and one of its helicopters hit mortar batteries manned by dissident soldiers after its embassy came under fire.</p>
<p>French troops intervened directly to stop fighting in January before handing over to the African peacekeeping force.</p>
<p>Toumani Toure, who steered his West African country to democracy in 1992 after toppling dictator Moussa Traore, has repeatedly said Central African Republic citizens must solve the problem among themselves.</p>
<p>Burkina Faso, Chad, Gabon, Mali, Senegal and Togo have troops in the 800-strong force. Patasse opponents criticise the Chadians, saying Patasse hired Chadians in a private militia.</p>
