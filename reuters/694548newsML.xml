<p>A teenager who murdered his parents, grandparents and sister was sentenced on Friday to 112 years in prison, virtually assuring he will spend the rest of his life behind bars.</p>
<p>Joshua Jenkins, 17, was accused of bludgeoning his father to death on Feb. 16, 1996, then turning on his mother and grandparents, stabbing them repeatedly to make sure they were dead. The next day he drove with his 10-year-old sister to buy an axe and used it to kill her after they returned home.</p>
<p>Jenkins pleaded guilty to the murders, but a trial was held to determine his sanity. While his attorneys argued that Jenkins suffered from schizophrenia, the prosecution argued that he was angry at his parents for placing him in a school for troubled youths.</p>
<p>Last month a jury found Jenkins legally sane in four of the killings but deadlocked on his father's murder.</p>
<p>Under the terms of Friday's sentence, he could be eligible for parole after his 100th birthday.</p>
