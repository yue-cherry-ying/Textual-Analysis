<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle Thursday sold at $69.00 per cwt in light volume, unchanged from brisk sales on Tuesday, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>About 6,500 head sold in Kansas, which brought the week to date figure to 94,000, they said.</p>
<p>An estimated 5,000 head sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area, which brought the weekly movement near 86,000, sources said.</p>
<p>Most of this week's showlists reportedly were almost sold out amid strong demand from packers stocking live inventories to meet a flurry of retail beef orders, they said.  </p>
<p>Retail beef demand was fueled by a push for orders ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, which traditionally kicks off the summer outdoor grilling season, market sources said.</p>
<p>The three-day Memorial Day weekend has a reputation as the most active weekend of the year for beef consumption, they said.</p>
<p>However, beef prices slipped for a second consecutive day, with weakness tied to heavy cattle slaughter this week and belief that retail demand was peaking, the sources said.</p>
<p>Beef prices were quoted down $0.24 to $0.69 per cwt, with 240 fabricated beef loads sold, USDA reported.</p>
<p>Heavyweight choice beef was down $0.44 at $107.07, down $1.51 since prices started falling on Tuesday, USDA statistics showed. Fabricated beef sales for the week totaled 961 loads, down 10.4 percent from the same period last week at 1,072.</p>
