<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has allocated a $14 million loan for the war-ravaged West African state of Sierra Leone, a government statement said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The statement in the capital Freetown said the IMF commended Sierra Leone's efforts to keep a structural adjustment programme on track despite difficult circumstances. It cited efforts at macroeconomic stabilisation and structural reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;The IMF's approval...will facilitate Sierra Leone's access to resources from the country's bilateral and multilateral donors and creditors,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>It said the first of two half-yearly instalments is available immediately. The loan is in response to Sierra Leone's request for a third annual arrangement under the enhanced structural adjustment facility.</p>
<p>Success in bringing annual inflation to 6.4 percent at the end of 1996 from 26 percent in March of the same year was given as an example of Sierra Leone's success in meeting economic targets.</p>
<p>Sierra Leone, rich in diamonds and with significant reserves of titanium ore and other minerals, is one of the world's poorest countries and utterly dependent on foreign aid.</p>
<p>An accord signed in November in theory brought to an end a war which since 1991 had progressively eaten away at what infrastructure years of corruption and lack of investment had left standing.</p>
<p>But sporadic outbreaks of violence between troops and rebels, as well as with local militia groups, have dampened confidence in swift implementation of the accord.</p>
