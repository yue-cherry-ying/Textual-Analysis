<text>
<p>NWE gas oil gained ground on Thursday, bolstered by steady to firmer premiums and stronger futures.</p>
<p>May IPE gas oil, which expires on Monday, closed $1.50 a tonne stronger at $169.00 while the June contract also moved higher gaining $1.00 to $167.50.</p>
<p>Trade was muted because of public holidays throughout Europe although bits and pieces were concluded, traders said.</p>
<p>A Russian cargo was sold cif into Hamburg at June IPE +$4.25 for 10-20 May dates while DIN was pegged around June IPE +$5 cif.</p>
<p>Dealers said interest in FOD was still very slow.</p>
<p>One dealer said that &quot;0.2 pct can only be used for heating now compared with last year when it had an automotive application so the demand should be lower in the summer.&quot;</p>
<p>There was talk that one or two parcels of EN590 had been done, but confirmation was lacking. Suggestions that premiums were around June IPE +$13 cif were discounted by most dealers who said +$11-12 was a more realistic number.</p>
