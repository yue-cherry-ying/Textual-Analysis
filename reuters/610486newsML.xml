<p>*Profit-taking took a slight edge off the Australian debt market's full-scale rally which followed today's unexpected 50 basis point monetary policy easing by the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>*Bill futures price out policy tightening until June 1998.  </p>
<p>Profit-taking took a slight edge off the Australian debt market's full-scale rally which followed today's unexpected 50 basis point easing by the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>However, yields remained substantially lower on the day as the market adjusted to 5.5 percent official rates and bill futures priced out a reversal of the easing until June 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously we are seeing profit-taking now, but their are pretty good two-way flows. The long end has seen some very good buying all the way up,&quot; said one bond trader.</p>
<p>There had been speculation of an easing for some weeks, although today's timing had caught the market on the hop.  </p>
<p>The easing followed hot-on-the-heels of Thursday's downward revision in annual wages growth to 4.3 percent, which was back below the Reserve Bank's 4.5 percent comfort zone.</p>
<p>Announcing the cut, the central bank said the wages data seemed to be consistent with satisfactory inflation, which they expected to fall below 2.0 percent in underlying terms in the coming quarters and below its 2.0-3.0 percent target.</p>
<p>It also said that employment growth was subdued and that economic growth was unlikely to put pressure on inflation.</p>
<p>Most of the reaction occured in the short end and where bill futures struck a record turnover by the lunchtime recess.  </p>
<p>The yield curve steepened sharply on the rate cut, while yields spreads to the dollar bloc were severed.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the long end is a little more sceptical in what's happening here. People are getting nervous that the spread traders might come in here and take profits,&quot; said Matthew Dreenan, senior economist at Axiom Funds Management.</p>
<p>Richard Gibbs, senior International economist at Macquarie Bank said while the RBA was obviously comforted by the wages data he also felt it would have taken on board the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to leave policy unchanged at this week's policy-making meeting.  </p>
<p>&quot;What happens if the Fed does tighten in the future will be very interesting because it means that they move to 5.75 percent and we're at 5.50 percent. I don't think they (the RBA) will reverse their decision,&quot; Gibbs said.</p>
<p>However, Gibbs said it would put to test the RBA's theory that they can run the economy more strongly and that the negative implications for the Australian dollar on a Fed move will not have an adverse impact on inflation.</p>
<p>The Australian currency was sent reeling on the rate cut, slumping to a three month-low against the U.S. dollar, wiping out Thursday's 1-1/2 cent rally and more.  </p>

<p>Local three-year yield spread were brushing with parity with the U.S. and were standing around their lowest level since January. U.S. Treasuries had weakened on Thursday amid a dearth of fresh indicators and ahead of the long holiday weekend.  </p>
