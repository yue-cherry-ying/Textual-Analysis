<p>Singapore is not a good political model for Hong Kong to follow after its handover to China, the opposition Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) says.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to media, SDP Secretary-General Chee Soon Juan said it was &quot;important for Hong Kongers to remember that Singapore is not a good political model to follow. While Singapore has progressed economically, its political development remains decidedly primitive.&quot;</p>
<p>He described the midnight June 30 handover to China as an occasion for rejoicing.</p>
<p>But he warned that the celebration must &quot;be accompanied with the long-term view of maintaining political stability which Hong Kong has enjoyed for so many years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hong Kong has thrived because its people have enjoyed the freedoms which are so essential for today's modern society,&quot; Chee said.</p>
<p>&quot;Singaporeans fear, more than respect, the PAP (People's Action Party) government,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Singapore &quot;is beginning to encounter problems of the backlash of years of stifling over-control by an authoritarian government,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The SDP held three of the four opposition seats in parliament before the last general election in January, but has none in the current parliament.</p>
<p>Other opposition parties hold three seats and the PAP has 81.</p>
