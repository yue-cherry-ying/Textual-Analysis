<headline>Mandela arrives in Britain with &quot;companion&quot; Machel.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>South African President Nelson Mandela arrived in London on Tuesday hand in hand with his companion Graca Machel but shrugged off questions about their romance.</p>
<p>Mandela, 78, is making a semi-official four day visit to Britain while accompanying the widow of the late Mozambique president Samora Machel who is to receive an honorary degree from Essex University on Thursday.</p>
<p>Mandela, who was feted on the streets during a ful-scale official visit to Britain last year, will have brief talks with new British Prime Minister Tony Blair and will take Machel to tea with Queen Elizabeth. He will also receive the freedom of the city of Oxford on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I am accompanying Mrs Machel,&quot; he told reporters as the couple strolled across the tarmac at Heathrow airport. &quot;As you know she is receiving an honorary degree at the University of Essex and I come here as her companion.&quot;</p>
<p>Arriving at their London hotel, they were asked by reporters if they had plans to marry.</p>
<p>The couple looked at each other and smiled before Mandela, with Machel's head briefly resting on his shoulder, said: &quot;Those are questions one doesn't discuss in public.&quot;</p>
<p>Mandela's meeting with Blair will be his first with Britain's Labour government, elected in May, which had close links with the anti-apartheid movement during Mandela's imprisonment and South Africa's international isolation.</p>
<p>Machel, Mandela's companion for about a year,  is an international ambassador for children's rights. She has accompanied Mandela on a number of trips.</p>
<p>Mandela's government is in mid-winter recess. The president is expected to travel on to Thailand and Indonesia.</p>
