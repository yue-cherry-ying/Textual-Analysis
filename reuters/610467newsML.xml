<title>UK: WORLD MARKETS -- Oil prices firm.</title>
<headline>WORLD MARKETS -- Oil prices firm.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>World oil prices firmed on Thursday but trading was quiet ahead of a three-day holiday in the U.S. that is the traditional start to the summer driving season.</p>
<p>July crude futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange opened 14 cents up at $22.00 a barrel, while July Brent on the International Petroleum Exchange here reached a high of $20.34 shortly after the New York market opened.</p>
<p>But by 1545 GMT IPE July Brent had fallen to $20.25, a gain of 12 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;The market looks firm but undynamic,&quot; one trader said, adding that London volume at about 15,000 lots was quite low.</p>
<p>&quot;People are waiting to take new positions before the long holiday (in the U.S. and U.K.). Everyone who is short will try to cover their position tomorrow before the holiday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We should see higher price action pre-weekend,&quot; Prudential-Bache brokers said in their daily energy report.</p>
<p>Dealers also said they were watching NYMEX gasoline, with some in New York hoping that some sort of summer driving season rally in that contract could materialise by the end of May.</p>
<p>News that Turkish troops have moved deeper into Iraq was having little impact on Brent trading, although this sparked last minute short covering on NYMEX at the close on Wednesday, New York traders said.</p>
<p>Iraqi Kurdish officials said Turkish troops pushed 200 km (125 miles) into northern Iraq, much further than in past incursions. The Turkish incursion is now in its ninth day, and there were also reports that Iraq, Syria and Iran have built up their forces in the region.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected that the United Nations would renew the Iraqi &quot;oil for food&quot; deal when it comes up for review by the Security Council on June 7, although the U.S. has not so far confirmed that it will give its approval.</p>
<p>&quot;It is pretty well accepted that the U.S. will agree,&quot; said Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney in London.</p>
<p>The current accord allows Iraq to sell up to $2 billion of oil over six months in order to purchase food, medicine and other goods for its people suffering under U.N. sanctions imposed when Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.N. is ready to recommend an extension. Most governments support a deal. Even the Americans have no problem, despite wanting some changes and additions,&quot; a senior U.N. official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Without going into detail, the official said U.S. suggestions for changes were not supported by other Council members and were believed to have been dropped by Washington.</p>
<p>But the U.N. will not include a recommendation to raise oil sales above the current $2 billion ceiling, the official added. &quot;Iraq wants an expansion in sales, but an expansion would be extremely difficult.&quot;</p>
