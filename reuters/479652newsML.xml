<p>Aprogenex Inc said Tuesday that in the opinion of Arthur Andersen LLP, its independent public accountants, the company's operation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional working capital to complete research and development and other activities and to attain successful future operations.</p>
<p>Aprogenex said it currently has cash resources to fund its operations into June, which it says it believes should allow sufficient time to meet its funding requirements.  </p>
<p>The company also announced that it is finalizing its strategy to meet its financial requirements.</p>
<p>&quot;Our focus in 1996 was on the application of our DNA probe technology into HIV testing and to securing partners to further develop our prenatal genetic probe products,&quot; said president and chief executive David M. Leech.  &quot;The collaborative agreement signed last month with Centocor Inc will enhance the development efforts in the HIV area while the AmCell Corp and BioSeparations Inc agreements align us with two companies focused on cell separation for genetic applications. Our focus for 1997 will be on the expansion of our technology beyond diagnostics through the acquisition and in-licensing of medical therapeutics.&quot;</p>
<p>Aprogenex reported a loss for the fourth quarter of 1996 of $612,212, or $0.12 per share versus a loss of $1,163,668, or $0.22 per share, in the fourth quarter of 1995.  Cash and short term investments at December 31, 1996 totaled $327,400.</p>
<p>Aprogenex develops next-generation diagnostic tests based on its proprietary DNA probe technology.</p>
