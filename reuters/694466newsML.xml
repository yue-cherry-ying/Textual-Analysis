<title>HONG KONG: Hong Kong press plays down China troop-surge plan.</title>

<p>Hong Kong's editorial writers reacted calmly on Saturday to China's plan to deploy 4,000 troops here just six hours after Britain hands the territory back to Beijing at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten on Friday had termed the announced Chinese troop movement as &quot;appalling&quot; and a &quot;most unfortunate signal to send to the people of Hong Kong&quot;.</p>
<p>But Patten, not China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), got a hard time in Saturday's leader in the English-language Hong Kong Standard.</p>
<p>&quot;Any hopes that the British might be able to leave Hong Kong in an amicable and dignified manner were dealt a cruel blow yesterday when Britain (read Patten) denounced Beijing's troop deplyment plans,&quot; the Standard leader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Ask the average person in Hong Kong how they feel about the arrival here early on July 1 of 4,000 mainland troops and they would probably shrug and say: 'There is nothing surprising or frightening about that. It was only to be expected.&quot;</p>
<p>Chinese-language newspapers were even more vehement that Patten and the British, not Beijing, were guilty of stirring a row.</p>
<p>The independent daily Sing Tao said &quot;Patten's criticism would not raise any response from Hong Kong&quot; because people are readying for five days of handover celebrations rather than worrying about the PLA.</p>
<p>The Beijing-controlled Ta Kung newspaper termed Patten's criticism of the deployment &quot;nonsense and irresponsible&quot; and added it was none of the departing Governor's business anyway.</p>
<p>Tin Tin Daily, another Chinese language newspaper, accused Patten of stirring a row by trying to link the handover deployment to the PLA's bloody 1989 crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators in Bejing's Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>The South Chnna Morning Post, Hong Kong's leading English language daily, defended China's right to make the deployment but doubted the wisdom in making such a high-profile so soon after the handover.</p>
<p>&quot;The impression must be either that the PLA is simply unaware or unconcerned about the reaction likely to be aroused by the arrival of 21 armoured cars and 400 other vehicles plus 10 ships and six helicopters,&quot; read the Post's lead editorial.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps it (China) wants to make a statement to Hong Kong through its military presence on the roads in the early hours of July 1...What matters more than the manner of the garrison's entry is its behaviour once here.&quot;</p>
<p>The British garrison numbered about 10,000 at its peak. The PLA currently have fewer than 200 unarmed soldiers in Hong Kong as an advance party. Another 509 armed with pistols and rifles will move across the border at 9 p.m. on June 30 to be in position at midnight.</p>
