<p>The leader of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy group, Martin Lee, said on Thursday the plan by the territory's future chief Tung Chee-hwa to curb civil rights was outdated.</p>
<p>&quot;What Mr Tung has shown, I think it's clear, is that his set of Chinese values is at least two generations outdated compared with modern Hong Kong people's thinking,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>The chairman of the popular Democratic Party was commenting during a radio interview on Tung's remark this week that demonstrations promoting independence for Taiwan or Tibet should not be allowed in Hong Kong after the handover to China.</p>
<p>The territory returns to China on July 1, ending more than 150 years of British colonial rule, and becomes a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China.</p>
<p>&quot;What Mr Tung said clearly indicates that if people demonstrate about things which he agrees, then you can demonstrate,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>&quot;But if you demonstrate against something and Mr Tung doesn't agree with you, he will not tolerate it. Now that's precisely the sort of thing that we don't want to see in Hong Kong,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>Tung has sparked controversy with his plan to force demonstrators to get police permits before staging protests and to prohibit foreign funding for local political parties.</p>
<p>In a taste of future challenges Tung could face, an anti-communist group on Thursday was set to unveil plans for extensive protests next month to mark the anniversary of China's bloody 1989 crackdown against pro-democracy protesters.</p>
<p>A member of Tung's inner cabinet, Henry Tang, said on Thursday some moderation of the original plan was likely as a result of a three-week &quot;public consultation&quot; exercise to gauge reaction to the plan.</p>
<p>Lawyers and pro-democracy groups have vehemently opposed the proposals.</p>
<p>&quot;So we feel that certain relaxation is in order and we are in the process of redefining that,&quot; Tang said on radio.</p>
<p>The new legislation would be drawn up quickly and might be considered at a meeting in China on Saturday of the post-handover Hong Kong legislature chosen by Beijing.</p>
