<p>Russia's footballers need a good dose of Soviet-style patriotism if they are to achieve any success, former national coach Oleg Romanstev said on Thursday.</p>
<p>He also condeming foreign-based stars for putting money before the Russian motherland.</p>
<p>&quot;Notions like patriotism, honouring the motherland, the flag, the national anthem have been completely levelled,&quot; the Spartak Moscow chief trainer told Argumenty i Fakty weekly.</p>
<p>&quot;The younger generation need time to learn to respect new values...We should inspire them to see that it's important.&quot;</p>
<p>Sacked after the national side's poor performances in Euro'96, Romantsev reminisced fondly about how he used to get goosebumps when the Soviet anthem was played during his Cold War-era playing days, recalling his &quot;pride in the superpower&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We honoured all that -- Lenin, the party, the flag, the motherland. Now we say Lenin's no good, our motherland's been more or less torn apart and we don't even have any words for the national anthem,&quot; Romantsev said.</p>
<p>Russia dropped the Soviet song, but has still to find lyrics it likes for the new one.</p>
<p>Romantsev, who accused key players of lacking passion during his two years in charge, complained that foreign-based stars were demanding large fees for playing for their country.</p>
<p>Some were reluctant to play at all, others held back from full commitment for fear that injury could cost them millions of dollars in salaries from their wealthy western clubs.</p>
<p>Romantsev's successor, Boris Ignatyev, has also grumbled about the exiles who make up the spine of his team and dropped several for last week's 3-0 World Cup win over Luxembourg.</p>
