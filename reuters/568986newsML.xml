<p>Former Zimbabwe president Canaan Banana, under investigation on allegations of raping and forcing an aide into a homosexual relationship, is facing more accusations of sodomy, a police official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The official, who declined to be named, confirmed a report by Zimbabwe's independent Financial Gazette newspaper that dozens of current and former students from Harare's University of Zimbabwe and some state security force members made the allegations before a police panel in the past two months.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it's true that the panel has interviewed dozens of people charging that they were sodomised and abused. Others allege they were witnesses to such acts of homosexuality,&quot; the officer told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There are so many cases and we are still investigating,&quot; he said, refusing to go into details.</p>
<p>The Financial Gazette quoted highly placed police sources as saying the investigating team was overwhelmed but had isolated eight complaints for further inquiry.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully, we will have the matter heard in court within the next four weeks. Banana has been extremely cooperative with the investigations taking place,&quot; it quoted one of the sources as saying.</p>
<p>Banana's lawyers declined to comment on the issue, saying it was sub judice.</p>
<p>Banana, a 61-year-old Methodist minister, came under police investigation after accusations by his former aide de camp Jefta Dube, 35, that he raped and forced him into a homosexual relationship during his presidency in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Dube was sentenced to 10 years in jail in February for the 1995 fatal shooting of a fellow policeman who goaded him by calling him &quot;Banana's wife&quot;.</p>
<p>Dube told the high court that his subjugation by Banana, a largely ceremonial president for seven years until 1987, made him depressive and an alcoholic. Judge David Bartlett ruled that Dube's case should be treated as one of diminished responsibility.</p>
<p>The judge said the Dube's charges against Banana were probably true and ordered police to investigate further.</p>
<p>Dube last month sued Banana for damage claims of Z$1.3 million (U.S.$115,044).</p>
<p>The Financial Gazette said the police had interviewed Vice-President Simon Muzenda, Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa, former army commander Solomon Mujuru and ex-police commissioner Henry Mukurazhizha, all named by Dube as being aware of his complaints against Banana.</p>
