<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Argentine stocks rebounded Tuesday from a sharp slump a session earlier, supported by a rise on Wall Street and firmer Brady bonds.</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal index recovered 1.29 percent to close at 715.25 points after a dive of 4.47 percent Monday.</p>
<p>Traders said activity was choppy but after the gains by bonds and Wall Street in the wake of U.S. economic figures, the Argentine stock market followed suit.  </p>
<p>At one stage in the session, the MerVal was down 0.53 percent but the market recovered to close at the day's highs.</p>
<p>Sergio Martinez, a stock trader, said the market was set to closely follow the U.S. market ahead of the release of key U.S. unemployment figures Friday, which will give a better indication of inflation pressures in the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has no alternative but to follow the U.S. markets,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The sellers did not come out today like in recent sessions. The key day will be Friday,&quot; said Miguel Daneri, an analyst at Boston Securities.</p>
<p>Trading volume fell to 17 million pesos from 19.9 million pesos Monday.</p>
<p>Of the 58 stocks traded this session, 22 advanced, 23 fell and 13 were unchanged.</p>
<p>The stock markets' general index rose 0.66 percent.</p>
<p>Among top performers this session were holding company Garovaglio which rose 4.68 percent, and oil company Astra which added 3.52 percent.</p>
