<headline>SOCCER-HILL RESIGNS AS FULHAM CHAIRMAN.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Jimmy Hill, one of the more outspoken and colourful characters in English soccer, announced on Friday he was standing down as chairman of Fulham after 10 years in charge.</p>
<p>The London club have just won promotion to the second division, and Hill said: &quot;Throughout my career I've always believed you should get out when on top, which is what I'm doing.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking on BBC Radio, Hill, 70, a well known television personality, said his decision to step down heralded: &quot;A new chapter in the story of this unique club. The end of an era,&quot; but he added it was &quot;a happy day.&quot;</p>
<p>Fulham last played in the top division n 1968 and have faced extinction several times in the last few years as their Craven Cottage ground next to the River Thames in fashionable west London became a target for property developers.</p>
<p>But the club are about to regain ownership of the ground for the first time in 20 years and their future looks healthier than it has done for many years.</p>
