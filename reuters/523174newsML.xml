<title>MALAYSIA: French climber scales 32-storey Malaysian building.</title>
<headline>French climber scales 32-storey Malaysian building.</headline>

<p>Frenchman Alain Robert, known as &quot;Spiderman&quot; for scaling high-rise buildings, on Sunday added the 32-storey Sabah Foundation building in Malaysia's eastern Sabah state to his list of conquests.</p>
<p>Robert began his climb at the 16th floor of the building instead of the ground floor due to a horizontal aluminium shaft at the bottom of the building's podium, the national Bernama news agency reported.</p>
<p>Watched by a crowd of hundreds in Sabah state's capital of Kota Kinabalu, Robert reached the top of the building from the 16th floor in less than five minutes.</p>
<p>He scaled the cylindrical building by gripping a vertical high-tension metal shaft on the outside wall.</p>
<p>Robert descended from the top to the 16th floor, and after a short rest, re-climbed the building, Bernama reported.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old Frenchman made headlines in Malaysia when he was arrested last month for scaling the world's tallest building, the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, without permission. He said he did Sunday's climb for charity.</p>
<p>&quot;I am satisfied with this climb because I did it for charity. The building itself is not a big challenge. The real challenge for this occasion is to raise money for the various charity organisations,&quot; Robert said after the climb.</p>
<p>For his feat on Sunday, Robert will get 10 percent of the 445,000 ringgit ($177,291) raised at the event which was organised by the Lions Club of Kota Kinabalu.</p>
<p>Among the 30 structures he has climbed since 1994 are New York's Empire State Building, London's Canary Wharf and the Far East Finance Centre in Hong Kong. His exploits have earned him nicknames such as &quot;Spiderman&quot;, &quot;Madman&quot;, &quot;Human Fly&quot; and &quot;Big Little Man&quot;.</p>
