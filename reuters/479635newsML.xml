<p>IEC Electronics Corp said Tuesday that sales and earnings for the second fiscal quarter ending March 28, 1997 will be substantially above prior estimates.</p>
<p>Net earnings per share are expected to range between $0.20 and $0.24 per share on revenues of between $57 and $60 million. Revenues during the second quarter of the last fiscal year were $44.4 million with earnings of $0.06 per share.</p>
<p>&quot;The company has had a very good first half and currently has a record backlog, which suggests that sales for the year will set a new record with earnings substantially in excess of last year,&quot; said president and chief executive officer Russell Stingel. &quot;Darrell Cottle, the president and founder of the company's wholly owned subsidiary, Accuteck, has announced his retirement.  New management is being installed in Alabama and additional management changes are also being implemented elsewhere in the company.  Moreover, the company's diversification strategy continues to enhance its position in the marketplace and service demand remains strong,&quot; he added.</p>
