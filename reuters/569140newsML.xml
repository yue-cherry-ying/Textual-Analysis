<p>Croatia's central bank said on Thursday it expected to see good growth in the economy and welcomed recent cuts in lending rates as positive for both corporates and individuals.</p>
<p>In a statement released after Wednesday's board meeting, the National Bank of Croatia said it had decided to leave official rates and reserve requirements unchanged in May after making slight cuts in recent months to boost economic activity.</p>
<p>The discount rate and Lombard rates have been 5.9 and 9.5 percent respectively since March and the reserve ratio for banks now stands at 34.85 percent of kuna deposits.</p>
<p>Croatia's macroeconomic environment remained stable in April, with very low inflation and minimal fluctuations in the exchange rate of the domestic kuna currency, the bank said.</p>
<p>It described banking sector liquidity as satisfactory, adding that stronger demand for money at the end of last month due to annual tax payments was bridged by Lombard loans.</p>
<p>&quot;The government repaid all its obligations to banks in April, widening the space for an increase in credits to companies and citizens,&quot; it said, also citing reductions in the banks' lending rates for kuna loans as very encouraging.</p>
<p>&quot;Both the credit growth and increase of cash in circulation say much about a revival of economic activity.&quot;</p>
<p>The National Bank of Croatia noted what it described as &quot;favourable trends&quot; in production, trade, construction, transport and tourism -- the last two being a strategic base for the development of Croatia's economy.</p>
<p>It put 1996 direct foreign investments at $350 million and added: &quot;It is to be expected that all this will contribute to faster structural changes of the economy, enabling an increase in productive employment and decreasing unemployment, which is particularly important for further development.&quot; -- Kolumbina Bencevic, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075</p>
