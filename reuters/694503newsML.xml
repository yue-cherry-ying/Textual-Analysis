<p>Turkey's secularist prime minister-designate Mesut Yilmaz secured a parliament majority on Saturday to deny Islamists power after two MPs quit the ruling pro-Islamist alliance, Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>True Path Party (DYP) deputies Turhan Arinc and Ali Uyar resigned from the DYP. Seven MPs -- six from Tansu Ciller's DYP and one from Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's Welfare Party (RP) -- have deserted the Islamist-led coalition in the past two days.</p>
<p>The latest resignations reduced the Islamists and their allies to 272 MPs on paper, compared with 275 deputies who are likely to back Yilmaz at a confidence vote in his left-right alliance.</p>
<p>Turkish newspapers say further MPs are likely to quit.</p>
<p>Liberal Yeni Yuzyil said three DYP MPs and two RP MPs were expected to resign soon.</p>
<p>Yilmaz, 50, was appointed prime minister-designate last week to replace Necmettin Erbakan, who resigned after a stormy year as modern Turkey's first Islamist prime minister.</p>
<p>Yilmaz is expected to present the new cabinet list to President Suleyman Demirel next week.</p>
<p>Erbakan's coalition with Ciller was hampered by frequent rows with secularists, led by the army, over the role of religion in public life and NATO member Turkey's ties to the Moslem world.</p>
<p>Secularist politicians began on Friday to draw up the Yilmaz government programme and work out the distribution of ministries.</p>
