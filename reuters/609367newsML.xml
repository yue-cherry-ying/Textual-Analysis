<p>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on Friday that the United States was &quot;on the right track&quot; in its dealings with North Korea despite a failure so far to set up four-party talks on the future of Korea.</p>
<p>She told a news conference there had been &quot;some positive reaction&quot; from Pyongyang to a U.S.-South Korean proposal made more than a year ago to hold the discussions, which would also include China.</p>
<p>The talks would be aimed at closing the book on the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a now-fraying armistice.</p>
<p>At a meeting in New York last month, North Korea agreed to join such talks if it was first guaranteed large-scale food aid, U.S. diplomatic recognition and an easing of trade sanctions. Washington has made clear that once peace talks start, stepped-up aid is a strong possibility.</p>
<p>Albright admitted that there had been &quot;a delay in finding the time&quot; to stage the negotiations.</p>
<p>But, she added: &quot;I would say that we're very much on the right track and that it's a matter of seeing what the conditions are to make sure that those talks do in fact take place.&quot;</p>
<p>The status of the four-party talks was at the centre of a meeting Albright held later with visiting South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha.</p>
<p>South Korea, like the United States, has provided North Korea with small-scale food aid to offset a severe shortage in the isolated Stalinist country, but agrees with Washington that major assistance must await the opening of peace talks.</p>
<p>Albright told reporters the talks would cover the food situation in North Korea as well as implementation of a 1994 agreement under which Pyongyang agreed to freeze its nuclear programme in return for supply of new nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>Despite periodic scares in South Korea that the United States is dealing with North Korea behind Seoul's back, Yoo told reporters his country's relations with Washington had &quot;never been stronger&quot; than now.</p>
<p>Albright and Yoo signed an agreement bringing into force a treaty originally signed between the two countries in 1993 on mutual legal assistance.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said it provided for cooperation in investigations of a wide variety of crimes including drug trafficking and terrorism.</p>
