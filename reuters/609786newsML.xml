<p>Wall Street is expected to open a bit higher Friday but trading will be light ahead of the three-day U.S. holiday weekend. In the absence of fresh economic data, bonds are expected to once again lead the way.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 32.56 points at 7258.13 yesterday and bonds weakened as investors had second thoughts about a Federal Reserve decision to leave interest rates unchanged.</p>
<p>The long bond, which hit a key seven percent yield level yesterday, was up 6/32 to yield 6.98 percent early today.  </p>
<p>&quot;We should have a slightly positive open,&quot; said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker. &quot;But volume will be down because of the holiday weekend, and there is not much corporate news driving the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Markets will be closed Monday because of the Memorial Day holiday in the United States, and no economic data are due today. In such an environment, analysts expect volatile trading that trails off as the day wanes.</p>
<p>&quot;Most action will occur in the early part of the day, with less participation later. We could see erratic movement,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, research director at Westfalia Investments.  </p>
<p>Bonds will guide share prices, analysts said. If bond prices fall, rising yields will lure money managers away from stocks, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;A seven percent yield on the long bond is the cusp level for asset allocators,&quot; Cripps said. &quot;If we go over seven percent, programs will kick in to shift money from stocks into cash and bonds.&quot;</p>
<p>Some analysts have said bonds were disappointed the Fed did not make a pre-emptive strike against inflation by raising interest rates. The bond market closes early at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT today ahead of the long holiday weekend.  </p>
<p>While blue chips tracked bonds lower yesterday, smaller-capitalization issues remained firm.</p>
<p>The Russell 2000 index ended up 1.40 points or 0.38 percent at 371.46.</p>
<p>Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average rose 131.61 points, or 0.66 percent, to 20,009.00.</p>
<p>In London the FTSE 100 was up 6.6 points at 4658.4. U.S. stocks were little changed and quiet in London.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poors futures index was up 1.55 points at 841.80.  </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column said shares of Japanese telephone company Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp have finally started rising but may be close to topping out for now.</p>
<p>The New York Times's Market Place column said the Securities and Exchange Commission is proposing broad ideas to alter the manner in which it regulates stock markets, in order to keep pace with innovation.</p>
