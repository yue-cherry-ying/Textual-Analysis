<title>PERU: Lima stocks track Dow Jones to close weaker.</title>
<headline>Lima stocks track Dow Jones to close weaker.</headline>
<dateline>LIMA 1997-03-31</dateline>

<p>The Lima Stock Exchange lost ground Tuesday, tracking falls in New York, but was expected to recover its stability Wednesday, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The internal fundamentals are fine,&quot; said Julio Alcalde, an analyst with MGS and Asociados brokerage.  &quot;The problem is the correction of the Dow Jones index due to the high prices reached and the possibility of new hikes in interest rates.&quot;</p>
<p>The bolsa's General Index  fell one percent to 1,657.06 points while the blue-chip Selective Index was off 1.14 percent to close at 2,371.49 points.  </p>
<p>Turnover was 31 million soles ($11.7 million) on 1,506 trades as 38 stocks fell, 37 were flat and 14 rose.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was unaffected by the publication of March's inflation result of 1.27 percent.  This was higher than previous months but was attributed to normal seasonal factors rather than an inflationary upswing.</p>
<p>Among leaders, miner Buenaventura fell 4.82 percent to 22.70 soles on 33,742 shares, while fellow miner Morococha ended down 4.04 percent to 2.14 soles on 318,560 shares.  Benchmark Telefonica del Peru accounted for 41.57 percent of trade and fell 0.34 percent to 5.90 soles.</p>
<p>&quot;The market suffered a contraction, but I am sure this will be taken advantage of progressively by investors because there are stocks like the miners that have a lot of potential,&quot; said Pablo Mavarro, of Fortuna brokerage.</p>
