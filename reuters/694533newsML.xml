<p>Despite a dismal weather forecast, the countdown began on Saturday for the rerun of a shuttle mission cut short in April because of power trouble.</p>
<p>The space shuttle Columbia was scheduled to blast off at 2:37 p.m. EDT (1837 GMT) on Tuesday, but U.S. Air Force meteorlogists gave the spaceship only a one-in-10 chance of getting off the launch pad.</p>
<p>&quot;At this juncture, it appears not very promising for Tuesday's launch,&quot; weather officer Ed Priselac told a news conference on Saturday.</p>
<p>Thunderstorms and showers in the vicinity of the Kennedy Space Centre were expected to thwart NASA's efforts to launch Columbia for much of the week.</p>
<p>Severe storms and hail could also prevent workers from retracting the shuttle's protective launch pad gantries, Priselac said.</p>
<p>Columbia was making a second attempt at a science mission that was cut short in April after only five days aloft. The flight was supposed to last 16 days, but NASA flight controllers ordered an early end to the mission because of a troublesome electricity generator.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the opportunity to refly a flight that had to come home early and it's just worked out magnificantly,&quot; shuttle commander Jim Halsell told reporters after arriving at the launch site on Saturday.</p>
<p>The shuttle's mission is unrelated to the crisis at Russia's Mir space station. Columbia is not equipped to dock at Mir and is too heavy to reach the space station's orbit.</p>
<p>NASA's next planned visit to the troubled Mir is not scheduled until mid-September. Atlantis was scheduled to pick up the station's current NASA crewmember, Michael Foale, and drop off another astronaut for a four-month stay.</p>
<p>Workers at the Kennedy Space Centre were taking steps to move up Atlantis' launch by about a month in case an earlier visit becomes necessary.</p>
<p>NASA's Shuttle-Mir programme manager, Frank Culbertson, said on Saturday there was at present no need to launch Atlantis early.</p>
