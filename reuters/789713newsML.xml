<p>Philippine police have arrested two Chinese nationals and seized 10.8 million pesos ($3.78 million) worth of illegal drugs.</p>
<p>Interior Secretary Robert Barbers told a news briefing on Saturday that the two arrested were believed to be members of a Taiwan-based drug-trafficking syndicate operating in the Philippines and other Asian countries.</p>
<p>Barbers said a police team last Thursday raided the suspected drug laboratory where the Chinese nationals were staying.</p>
<p>Some 800,000 pesos ($28,060) worth of methamphetamine hydrochloride, otherwise known as ice or shabu, and 10 million pesos worth of the drug ephedrine were seized by the police.</p>
<p>Barbers said police chased five other men who ran from the laboratory but lost them.</p>
<p>The drug bust came three days after Philippine police and military officials agreed to set aside their differences after warring among themselves over who should lead the anti-drugs campaign.</p>
<p>Last week, a businessman in military custody named 15 police officers as part of a drug syndicate. The statement angered the police department which said military officials may have fabricated it to damage their reputation. ($= 28.51 pesos)</p>
