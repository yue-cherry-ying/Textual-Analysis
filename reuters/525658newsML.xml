<p>Chocolate-flavoured carrots, pizza-flavoured corn and baked-bean flavoured peas -- cancer researchers admit they sound less than appetising to adults but hope they can lure children into eating their vegetables.</p>
<p>The Cancer Research Campaign joined forces with British frozen-food chain Iceland on Monday to launch a new range of frozen vegetables aimed at children.</p>
<p>&quot;These products are designed for children. Adults in the main are not thrilled with them,&quot; Malcolm Walker, chairman and chief executive of Iceland, told a news conference.</p>
<p>But Gordon McVie, chairman of the Cancer Research Campaign, said the charity was willing to try anything after a survey earlier this year showed many British children were eating hardly any fruit or vegetables at all.</p>
<p>One-third of all cancers are due to poor diet, McVie said. British cancer charities have adopted the U.S. government health message that people should eat at least five servings of fruit and vegetables a day.</p>
<p>McVie said he came up with the idea when shopping. He saw aisles loaded down with flavoured crisps (potato chips). Although spiced up with &quot;a disgusting range of tastes&quot;, the children liked -- and bought -- them. He said he spoke to Walker about the possibilities. &quot;We had an impromptu discussion on whether we could do something constructive rather than preaching from the pulpit thou shalt eat they veg',&quot; McVie said.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose the first hurdle is to get children to eat any vegetables,&quot; he said. &quot;This for me is an experiment in changing behaviour patterns...I think it is worth a shot.&quot;</p>
<p>He said education programmes urging people to eat their vegetables had not worked. &quot;Children are thumbing their noses at the official approaches...and they are choosing not to eat fruit and vegetables.&quot;</p>
<p>Walker said it was a good opportunity for Iceland.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to sell these products in great quantities. We have manufactured tonnes of the stuff,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The company tested a number of different taste combinations of five to 13-year-olds and came up with chocolate-flavoured carrots, cheese and onion-flavoured cauliflower, pizza-flavoured corn and baked-bean-flavoured peas.</p>
<p>&quot;We wouldn't be launching it if children didn't like it,&quot; he said. And the children had been fairly sensible, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Crazy things like bubblegum-flavoured broccoli were knocked out by the children straight away.&quot;</p>
<p>They will sell for 99 pence ($1.60) for a one pound (half a kg) bag, as opposed to 1.29 pounds for a two-pound (one kg) bag of frozen carrots.</p>
