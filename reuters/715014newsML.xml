<p>An apparent arson attack destroyed a restaurant in Bahrain, causing extensive damage but no casualties, a government official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The fire took place on Monday and completely gutted the restaurant. There were no casualties,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the restaurant was closed when the blaze occured. &quot;Initial indications showed the fire was a sabotage act,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The fire was the latest in a series of arson attacks to hit Bahrain, the Gulf's main financial and banking centre.</p>
<p>A Bangladeshi man was killed and another was injured when arsonists attacked a cold store in Sitra, linked with the capital Manama by a three km (1.8 miles) causeway, on Saturday. Four suspects had been arrested after the attack.</p>
<p>A power generator blew up at a luxury hotel on Saturday, but there were no reports of damage or casualties.</p>
<p>On Friday, a restaurant was set ablaze in a Manama district and three other fires broke out in Muharraq, linked with Manama by another three km (1.8 miles) causeway.</p>
<p>Four Indians died from smoke inhalation and a fifth was critically injured after fire gutted a shop in Manama in June.</p>
<p>A series of arson attacks in early June were described by a government official as &quot;continued acts of terrorism.&quot;</p>
<p>Members of the islands's majority Shi'ite Moslem community have waged sporadic protests, bombings and arson attacks since December 1994 to press the Sunni-led government to introduce economic and political reforms.</p>
