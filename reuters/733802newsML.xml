<p>The Clinton administration said on Tuesday it would wait until fall to set the targets for reducing heat-trapping pollution it will push in international talks on global warming that are to end in December.</p>
<p>The administration said its effort to use a series of computer models to show the economic effects of various plans to reduce pollution had failed.</p>
<p>Instead, White House economic adviser Janet Yellen and Undersecretary of State Tim Wirth said, it will use a variety of economic tools, studies and information gleaned from a White House conference on global warming set for September.</p>
<p>&quot;The effort to develop a model or set of models that can give us a definitive answer as to the economic impacts of a given climate change policy is futile,&quot; Yellen, chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told a House Commerce subcommittee.</p>
<p>Wirth testified that &quot;the president wants to go through ... a major airing process all summer long to early fall, and it will then all culminate at the end of September or early October at the White House conference.&quot; Clinton will then decide on U.S. anti-pollution goals, he said.</p>
<p>Subcommittee members complained that the White House was taking far too long to give them information they needed to evaluate the administration's scheme to curb global warming through an international deal.</p>
<p>They said the White House planned to unveil its plan just before one of the last rounds of global talks on climate change began in October. Final talks are to be held in Kyoto, Japan, in December.</p>
<p>&quot;What I'm hearing you tell me is that shortly before it's a done deal, it's a done deal,&quot; Idaho Republican Michael Crapo told Yellen.</p>
<p>&quot;For the past two years, the administration told us we would get an economic assessment, and it still isn't complete, and it's a failed project,&quot; Subcommittee Chairman Dan Schaefer, a Colorado Republican, said. &quot;This committee is concerned that the administration is going to make a decision based on its intuition,&quot; Schaefer said.</p>
<p>Yellen said the administration had other ways than computer models to gauge the economic effects of reducing pollution from burning fossil fuels.</p>
<p>She said economic models were misleading, because they could not take into account the benefits of measures the administration would use to ease the cost to industry, such as allowing companies to trade credits to pollute. The right policies could produce economic gains, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It boils down to this -- if we do it dumb, it could cost a lot, but if we do it smart, it will cost much less and, indeed, could produce net benefits in the long run,&quot; Yellen said.</p>
<p>Economic studies of climate change also showed that &quot;developing, as well as developed, countries must be part of the process,&quot; Yellen said. &quot;Thus, any comprehensive plan to deal with this global problem must include a mechanism to bring developing countries into the process,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>In his remarks to the panel, Wirth stressed that the United States was calling for developing countries to have obligations to control their pollution through measures such as phasing out energy subsidies and better conservation.</p>
<p>A number of congressmen have criticised the administration for agreeing to seek binding commitments from the United states and other industrialised countries to reduce fossil fuel emissions while rapidly developing economies such as China would not face such requirements.</p>
