<p>Regional power Nigeria ruled out on Tuesday postponing Liberia's post-war general elections and urged nations that had promised to finance the polls to come up with the money.</p>
<p>&quot;Election in Liberia will be held on July 19 as scheduled. Everything is going according to plan, no change is contemplated,&quot; Nigerian foreign minister Tom Ikimi told foreign diplomats at a meeting with them in the capital Abuja.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;The required financial resources are yet to be met because of the failure of donors to redeem their pledges barely 10 days to the election day.&quot;</p>
<p>Twelve of the 13 political parties contesting the election have sought a postponement because of alleged irregularities.</p>
<p>But leading presidential contender Charles Taylor, the man who launched the Liberian civil war in 1989, opposes any delay.</p>
<p>Originally scheduled for May 30, an Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) group overseeing Liberia's peace agreement met here in May and shifted the polls to July 19 after Liberian leaders sought a postponement to August/September.</p>
<p>ECOWAS contends that a long delay will derail the peace process, brokered by the 16-member group last year to end Liberia's seven-year civil war and which is policed by the Nigeria-led West African force ECOMOG.</p>
<p>Ikimi said what was needed was for donor nations to pay up to ensure a successful poll.</p>
<p>&quot;Please, the international community should not bog us down with pledges which are not redeemable,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>ECOWAS has $5.4 million budgeted for the poll.</p>
<p>Ikimi said ECOWAS members had contributed $1.5 million while Taiwan had given $1 million. But donations pledged by the United States and the European Union had not been paid.</p>
<p>Freed American slaves founded Liberia in 1847. The civil war has killed more than 150,000 people and displaced half the pre-war population of 2.5 million.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Liberians are refugees in neighbouring Ivory Coast, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Others are in Ghana and Nigeria.</p>
