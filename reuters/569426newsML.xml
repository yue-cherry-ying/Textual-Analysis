<p>Trading in the Singapore rubber market finished on a quiet note on Thursday with most people trying to gauge the near-term direction of the market after the yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar, dealers said.</p>
<p>The trade is also trying to see if any impact will result in the coming days from Bangkok's decision to raise its intervention price for RSS3 grade rubber to 29 baht a kg from 27.50 baht.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to digest all this, the rise in the yen and the Thai news. That's one reason why the big boys are out for now,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;They can always come back tomorrow.&quot;  </p>
<p>Another trader said the Thai news was largely &quot;discounted by the trade towards the end of the day although there was some movement earlier this morning from covering by some people.&quot;</p>
<p>A Moslem holiday in Indonesia and Malaysia capped any gains in the market, traders said. &quot;You'd want to see how the market will play itself out tomorrow,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>At 0945 GMT, June RSS3 was seen unchanged at 108.00 U.S. cents a kg.</p>
<p>June RSS1 was seen at 156.25 Singapore cents (US$1.08) a kg from 156.00 cents. All months of TSR20 grade rubber were untraded on Thursday.</p>
