<p>The Spanish seeds enjoyed a quiet evening stroll into the third round of the Italian Open women's tennis tournament on Wednesday as Germany's fourth seed Anke Huber fell sick and lost to a teenage wild card.</p>
<p>Conchita Martinez, champion at the Foro Italico for a record four years in succession, swept past American Chanda Rubin 6-2 6-3 in a floodlit match on a chilly centre court to set up a clash with Russian 12th seed Elena Likhovtseva.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't give her too many opportunities, I changed the rhythm playing high and low balls and that is it,&quot; she said in an accurate summation of her hour on court.</p>
<p>Former world number one and second seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, a late entry to the tournament, earlier reached the last 16 -- where she meets Belgium's 13th seed Sabine Appelmans -- by blasting aside Argentine Paola Suarez 6-2 6-2.</p>
<p>While the top two seeds in action barely worked up a sweat, three others including 1996 Australian Open finalist Huber failed to progress beyond the second round.</p>
<p>Huber was the biggest shock, losing to 19-year-old 73rd-ranked Italian Francesca Lubiani 6-2 6-4.</p>
<p>The surprise was dimmed somewhat when it later emerged that the German was suffering from gastritis.</p>
<p>A WTA statement said that Huber, who withdrew from the doubles tournament where she had been due to partner world number three Monica Seles, had suffered a stomach ache, headache and nausea that came on during practice.</p>
<p>It said she was returning to her home in Austria.</p>
<p>Huber did not attend a post-match news conference but made clear that she had been way below her best.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to take anything away from her but I haven't been playing well for some time now,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not the way I play tennis. I really don't know what else to say about my game today.&quot;</p>
<p>Huber had staged a brief comeback in her second set, pulling back from 5-1 down to 5-4 before giving in.</p>
<p>Her already erratic serve deserted her and, with Lubiani enjoying two match points, she hastened the end by double-faulting into the net.</p>
<p>&quot;Its the most important win of my career,&quot; said the Bolognese winner, who is coached by her father and now meets Austrian 11th seed Barbara Paulus.</p>
<p>&quot;I knew she was the most erratic of the top 10, the most beatable, I knew I could win.&quot;</p>
<p>The other seeds to fall, after the departure on Tuesday of 15th-seeded Frenchwoman Nathalie Tauziat, were France's Sandrine Testud and Brenda Schultz McCarthy of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Sixteenth seed Testud lost 7-6 6-0 to Switzerland's Patty Schnyder while ninth seed Schultz went out to South African Joannette Kruger 6-2 7-5.</p>
<p>There was little real threat to the remaining seeds in action although some had a few problems on the way.</p>
<p>Romanian Ruxandra Dragomir lost her first set to Belgian Els Callens while Croatia's fifth seed Iva Majoli was taken to three sets by American qualifier Nicole Arendt, who needed a massage to her right thigh while ahead 2-1 in the third set.</p>
<p>Dragomir won 3-6 6-2 6-0 and now faces Majoli.</p>
<p>France's Mary Pierce beat American Ann Grossman 6-2 6-2 and now meets top seed Seles on Thursday.</p>
<p>South African sixth seed Amanda Coetzer sent 15-year-old Russian Anna Kournikova out of the tournament after also dropping a set to the crowd favourite. REUTER</p>
