<p>Ten mines placed by Nazi forces during World War Two have been found under a soccer pitch where the German and Ukrainian under-21 teams played a week ago, a spokesman for the stadium said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition to the three mines found late on Thursday, today military sappers found seven more German mines -- all dating from 1943,&quot; Olexander Serdyuk, a spokesman for Dynamo stadium, said by telephone.</p>
<p>The anti-infantry mines had been discovered about 1.5 metres (yards) below ground during modernisation work in the corner of the pitch, he said.</p>
<p>All the mines were removed and detonated on the outskirts of Kiev. &quot;The sappers have investigated all the pitch and running tracks. They have assured us there are no more mines,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably a German mine-launcher was deployed at the stadium during World War Two and mines were abandoned after German troops left Kiev in 1943.&quot;</p>
<p>Dynamo Kiev, Ukraine's top soccer club, usually plays at the 40,000-seat stadium in the heart of the capital of the former Soviet republic.</p>
