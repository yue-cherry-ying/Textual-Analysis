<headline>Staples expert says merger would lower prices.</headline>

<p>An economist for Staples Inc and Office Depot Inc testifed in U.S. District Court Friday that if the two office superstore chains were permitted to merge, their prices would drop by roughly two percent.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission has gone to court to try to halt the merger, contending it would lead to higher prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The merger will lead to 2.2 percent lower prices overall in all stores and all products,&quot; testified Jerry Hausman, an economist from MIT and a consultant hired by the office superstores.  </p>
<p>Hausman's testimony came on the final day of a five-day hearing conducted before U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan.  Closing arguments and final briefs will be filed later, and Hogan has said he will rule by mid-June on whether to grant the government a preliminary injunction to halt the merger.</p>
<p>Hausman testified that the merger would lead to greater efficiencies that would permit prices to decrease.  </p>
<p>And while the FTC contends that the companies would be in a position to raise prices because their competition constrains each other's prices, Hausman said that other competitors would help hold prices down.</p>
<p>&quot;They face potentially the fiercest competition in the history of this country,&quot; he testified, referring to competition in the stationery market.</p>
<p>During cross examination, Hausman said that in certain analyses he had excluded some rural stores in California after a statistical test showed they should be grouped apart.</p>
<p>Hausman said he had been unable to apply that statistical test to most stores but had taken the suggestion of Staples on which rural stores to look at.  For example, a store in Santa Cruz, Calif., was among those excluded.  Asked about the choice of Santa Cruz, he replied: &quot;I would argue that Santa Cruz is pretty rural.&quot;</p>
