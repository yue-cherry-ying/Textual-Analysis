<p>A new sense of gloom took hold of Peruvians as hopes for a quick solution to the 15-week hostage crisis were dashed by tough talk from both the government and Marxist guerrillas holding 72 VIPs captive.</p>
<p>&quot;Bit by bit, we're getting closer. But I have nothing new to add,&quot; Archbishop Juan Cipriani, who is overseeing negotiations, told reporters late on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;With all the pain the country has gone through, Peru's heart is completely broken,&quot; he said of a nation longing for a peaceful solution to the 104-day standoff at the Japanese ambassador's residence.</p>
<p>Earlier, Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels accused President Alberto Fujimori of stalling the talks.</p>
<p>&quot;The slowness is due to the government's intransigence,&quot; MRTA leader Comrade Alejandro said from Peru's jungle. He told Reuters by short-wave radio that the main guerrilla demand for the release of jailed comrades had not been resolved.</p>
<p>&quot;We will stay (in the residence) as long as necessary to obtain the freedom of our prisoners,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>President Fujimori said over the weekend that he was still hoping for a negotiated outcome to the crisis but was not prepared to change his refusal to free jailed MRTA members.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a lot of speculation over Easter that there would be a peaceful solution, but we were aware that we were not in the final stage, that the conditions were not right,&quot; Fujimori said in a television interview.</p>
<p>The tough talk by Fujimori and the MRTA poured cold water on hopes of a settlement based on speculation that the rebels inside the Japanese residence would accept asylum in Cuba, a ransom and the release of some lower-level MRTA prisoners.</p>
<p>Talks between guerrilla leader Nestor Cerpa and government mediator Domingo Palermo, were expected to take place on Monday or Tuesday, but have been put off.</p>
<p>The two sides have not held direct talks since March 12, though they have communicated through the guarantors commission formed by Cipriani, Canadian ambassador Anthony Vincent and Red Cross representative Michel Minnig.</p>
<p>Cipriani, Vincent, Palermo and Japanese government observer Terusuke Terada met on Monday with Fujimori at the presidential palace but left without making any comments.</p>
<p>Cerpa led 20-odd rebels who blasted their way into the diplomatic residence during a cocktail party on Dec. 17.</p>
<p>They are holding the ambassadors of Japan and Bolivia, two dozen Japanese citizens, Fujimori's brother Pedro and two of his cabinet ministers.</p>
