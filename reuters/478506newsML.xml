<p>African finance ministers said on Tuesday the qualifying criteria for debt reduction under an IMF initiative were too rigid and might kill a well-meaning project.</p>
<p>The criteria took no account of differing conditions under which countries implement economic reforms, and no note of poverty resulting from reforms.</p>
<p>The ministers were speaking in Addis Ababa at a conference of African finance ministers and of officials of major multilateral institutions including the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>&quot;The IMF is displaying its usual fears, over-caution. That will blunt or completely kill an instrument that would have been productive,&quot; Tanzanian Finance Minister Daniel Yona said.</p>
<p>&quot;The six years required (of good economic performance) is too long. History explains that these institutions (IMF and World Bank) have always been too cautious, which is wrong. Some countries could qualify after two years,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said the problem with World Bank and IMF bureaucrats was they saw nothing wrong in their planning, assumed they never made mistakes and sat on a high pedestal.</p>
<p>&quot;Governments keep changing. World Bank officials are there for 20, say 30 years. That's the problem,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>This month the IMF and the World Bank gave their stamp of approval for a debt relief plan for Uganda, making it the first candidate for the Debt Initiative for Heavily Indebted Countries (HIPC).</p>
<p>But Ugandan Minister of State for Finance Basoga Nsandhu said Uganda was &quot;confused and baffled&quot; by a decision to put back to next year the date Uganda should benefit from the initiative.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not understand these people,&quot; said Nsandhu. &quot;We put money earmarked for servicing debt to rehabilitating roads, hospitals and increasing opportunities for primary education. Now we hear this money is not coming on time.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Uganda had expected the reduction as early as September but now was told it might come sometime next year.</p>
<p>Nsandhu said Uganda qualified under any criteria. If Uganda encountered difficulties with the initiative then it was unlikely any other African country could qualify.</p>
<p>Africa's international debt stands at around $340 billion.</p>
<p>In general, a country is required under the initiative to establish a six-year record with IMF tutorship that shows strong efforts on economic reform, although substantial flexibility is provided on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>The initiative was undertaken when it became clear that the repayment of old loans to lending agencies such as the World Bank and IMF were draining some of the poorest countries, making it impossible for them to get on their feet no matter what reform efforts they made.</p>
<p>The World Bank has set aside $500 million for an initiative fund while other donor agencies have so far raised $43 million.</p>
<p>World Bank Vice-President for Africa Jean-Louis Harbib said Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast were the other African candidates for the programme and 10 countries were targeted this year.</p>
<p>The initiative could lead to a reduction of $385 million of Uganda's $3.4 billion international debt.</p>
