<p>Australia rugby union coach Greg Smith said his team had done France a favour by beating them 26-19 in the second and final test on Saturday.</p>
<p>Smith said the Five Nations champions could learn from their experience during a short tour to Australia after losing the test series 2-0.</p>
<p>Smith created a furore before the second test at Ballymore by claiming the touring side were guilty of deliberately flouting the rules in a misguided attempt to disrupt the Wallabies.</p>
<p>&quot;I know they have reacted fairly angrily to what I said but we are trying to do them a bit of a favour,&quot; said Smith, who has accused French players of repeatedly breaking the offside rules and illegally trying to spoil their opponents' possesion.</p>
<p>&quot;I am talking about violations against the spirit of the game. I think they will benefit from what they have learned over here,&quot; said Smith.</p>
<p>Australia, who won 29-15 in Sydney a week ago, stunned the touring team with an early assault during which prop Richard Harry, winger Ben Tune and centre Jason Little all scored tries.</p>
<p>That gave the home side a 17-0 lead inside the first 20 minutes and although French centre Christophe Lamaison brought his side back into the match with a fine kicking display, Australia defended superbly late on to protect their lead.</p>
<p>The match was marred by a number of ugly incidents that prompted Welsh referee Clayton Thomas to twice warn rival captains about their sides' conduct.</p>
<p>In the worst incident, back rowers Troy Coker and Fabien Pelous wrestled each other to the ground before the Australian forward landed several punches to his opponent's head.</p>
<p>Coker said he was provoked after accusing Pelous of deliberately trying to gouge his eyes in a ruck.</p>
<p>&quot;When you've got someone's knuckle buried in your eye socket, the first thought is self-preservation,&quot; Coker said.</p>
<p>Pelous earned a further warning from Thomas when he felled Wallaby flanker David Wilson with a high tackle.</p>
<p>French lock Olivier Brouzet was also penalised for stamping on Wallaby flanker Brett Robinson at the fringe of a ruck just before halftime.</p>
<p>France's only try was scored by Thomas Castaignede in the 36th minute to reduce Australia's lead to 20-13 at the interval.</p>
<p>&quot;In that spell before halftime we came close to producing the form that won us the Five Nations championship but we could not maintain that,&quot; Benazzi said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very disappointed to lose two test matches in a row and we were unable to recover our balance after Australia scored those early tries.&quot;</p>
<p>Lamaison kicked four penalties and one conversion to keep the French in a match that was marred by ill-discipline from both sides.</p>
<p>His accuracy brought the touring team to within one point of the home side at 20-19 early in the second half before Eales landed two of his three penalties to put the match out of France's reach.</p>
