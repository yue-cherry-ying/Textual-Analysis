<headline>CBS says Lund resigns as TV chief.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Westinghouse Electric Corp's CBS unit said Peter Lund, president of its CBS television and cable group, has resigned.</p>
<p>The company said all of its television and radio stations will be consolidated into a single organization as part of a corporate reorganization.</p>
<p>Mel Karmazin, head of its radio division, will be chairman and chief executive of the new CBS station group.  </p>
<p>Michael Jordan, Westinghouse chairman and chief executive, said in a statement that the reorganization was coming in advance of its corporate split this fall, when the industrial businesses become one company, Westinghouse Electric Co, and the media businesses becomes CBS Corp.  Jordan will run CBS.</p>
<p>Beginning immediately, the television and cable units will report directly to Jordan, the company said.</p>
<p>All CBS radio and and television stations will be consolidated into a single organization led by Karmazin, who ran Infinity Broadcasting, when Westinghouse acquired it last year for about $4.9 billion.  </p>
<p>CBS said Lund &quot;declined the opportunity to lead the remaining television and cable businesses and elected to leave CBS.&quot;</p>
<p>While the statement did not detail Lund's title or responsibilities had he remained with the company, a spokesman said that Lund would have been president and CEO of the CBS television network and cable.</p>
<p>Lund would have been responsible for the network businesses and CBS Enterprises, the off-network production group, and other businesses.  </p>
<p>Lund's resignation was reported to have been sparked when Jordan decided to give Karmazin control of the CBS stations. A CBS source said the resignation came earlier this week,</p>
<p>CBS said that Lund &quot;agreed to assist in the transition to the new organization.&quot;</p>
<p>CBS said Jordan &quot;endorsed the leaders of the three core network businesses&quot;: Leslie Moonves, president of entertainment; Andrew Heyward, president of CBS news; and Sean McManus, president of CBS Sports.</p>
<p>The CBS businesses posted first quarter EBITDA -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization -- of $110 million versus $146 a year ago, including accounting changes, according to a Westinghouse spokesman.</p>
<p>By the end of this year, CBS will own four cable channels -- The Nashville Network, Country Music Television, the Spanish-language TeleNoticias, and the recently launched CBS Eye on People.</p>
