<p>A Russian navy lieutenant who had not been paid for several months shot himself dead at a Pacific Fleet base on an island in the Far East, a fleet spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Pacific Fleet, as well as most other units of the Russian armed forces, is owed trillions of roubles (millions of dollars) by the state.</p>
<p>&quot;On Sunday on Russky Island Lieutenant Doroshenko committed suicide, shooting himself with a Kalashnikov assault rifle while on guard duty,&quot; spokesman Viktor Ryzhkov told Reuters. He did not give the officer's first name.</p>
<p>He said the motives were unknown and an investigation was under way, but added Doroshenko had received his March wage only last month.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said overall debt to the Pacific Fleet was 2.4 trillion roubles ($414 million), while back wages to officers and soldiers amounted to 554 billion roubles. The government has pledged to repay wage arrears to the armed forces within two or three months.</p>
<p>There have been several cases of demoralised and even underfed soldiers and junior officers committing suicide. ($=5,791 roubles)</p>
