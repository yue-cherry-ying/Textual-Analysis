<p>Manuel Gonzalez Guerra, president for more than 30 years of Cuba's Olympic Committee and a champion of the island nation's efforts to become a world sporting power, died of a heart attack on Friday at the age of 83, state media reported.</p>
<p>The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said Gonzalez had been recovering from recent heart surgery in Mexico.</p>
<p>The national news agency AIN called Gonzalez's death a loss for the Cuban sporting movement and for the international sports scene, noting that Gonzalez had been Cuba's representative to the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</p>
<p>Gonzalez had been president of the Cuban Olympic Committee since 1963 and became a member of the IOC 10 years later. He remained an honorary IOC member since 1995.</p>
<p>Gonzalez was a boxer in his youth and a veteran of the guerrilla struggle that brought President Fidel Castro to power in 1959. AIN called him an &quot;exemplary revolutionary.&quot;</p>
