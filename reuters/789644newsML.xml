<p>Norway's Trine Hattestad conquered her nerves on Saturday to recapture the world women's javelin title.</p>
<p>&quot;This was my most nervous competition ever,&quot; Hattestad said. &quot;I knew I had to get a big throw out in the first round.&quot;</p>
<p>The plan worked to perfection when she unleashed the winning throw of 68.78 metres in the first round.</p>
<p>Australian Joanna Stone ensured the Norwegian could never entirely relax.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought I had won the gold for sure after the first round but then the Australian was throwing further and further and I was getting more worried,&quot; Hattestad said.</p>
<p>Hattestad, 31, won the 1993 world title but did not compete in Gothenburg two years ago because she was pregnant with her son Robin, who was born in December, 1995.</p>
<p>She bounced back at the Olympics last year to take a bronze medal but said on Saturday that she had not really got back to her best in time for Atlanta.</p>
<p>Stone, who moved to Australia from Britain as a baby, produced three throws over 68 metres, including personal bests of 68.16 in the second round and 68.64 in the fifth to take the silver medal.</p>
<p>Stone was taken aback by Hattestad's first throw.</p>
<p>&quot;But then I relaxed,&quot; Stone said. &quot;It has gone much better than I ever thought it would back home.&quot;</p>
<p>Stone attributed her surprise silver medal to the inspiration of watching her compatriot Cathy Freeman take the women's 400 metres gold on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Seeing Cath get a gold medal showed me you can do anything you put your mind to,&quot; the extrovert Australian added.</p>
<p>Germany's Tanja Damask won the bronze medal with a personal best of 67.12. Finland's Olympic champion Heli Rantanen failed to find her best form and finished 10th.</p>
