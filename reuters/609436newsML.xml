<p>A key New Jersey lawmaker has proposed rescuing Gov. Christine Whitman's faltering proposal to sell $2.8 billion of pension bonds by linking the deal to a court-ordered increase in school funding, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported Friday.</p>
<p>Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, proposed earmarking the first $250 million in budget savings generated by Whitman's pension bond deal for the state's 28 poorest school districts.</p>
<p>The New Jersey Supreme Court last week ordered Whitman to spend that much to help equalize spending between rich and poor school districts in the state.</p>
<p>The governor's plan was to sell the bonds to eliminate the state's unfunded pension liability. The move would also include legislation allowing the state to skip its annual contribution into the pension system and free up nearly $600 million of budget savings.</p>
<p>But stiff opposition to the idea has emerged in the state Legislature, where even many of Whitman's Republican allies have said they would vote against it.</p>
<p>The newspaper said that opposition has grown in recent days, and the Legislature's Republican leadership believes the pension bond plan is &quot;dead.&quot;</p>
<p>Lawmakers said a windfall from much higher-than-expected tax revenue collections could be used to balance the budget instead, and proposals to accomplish that are expected to be introduced over the next several weeks.</p>
<p>Whitman said she has not given up on the bond idea, however, and urged lawmakers to approve the deal quickly to capitalize on low interest rates.</p>
