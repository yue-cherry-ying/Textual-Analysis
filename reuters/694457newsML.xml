<p>The Indonesian mines and energy ministry is likely to reverse a proposal which requires foreign mining companies to allocate the government a 10 percent stake in future projects, Neraca newspaper reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The paper quoted Adjat Sudradjat, director-general of mining, as saying on Friday that the proposal was not compulsory.</p>
<p>&quot;If we follow what has been said by (State Secretary) Murdiono, there is a possibility that the proposal will not be continued,&quot; Sudradjat was quoted saying.</p>
<p>State Secretary Murdiono told reporters on Thursday the government would be consistent with its policy that allowed 100 percent foreign-owned companies to operate in the country.O</p>
<p>Officials at the ministry were not available for comment.</p>
<p>&quot;The proposal is not yet included in the draft of the seventh generation contract of work,&quot; Sudradjat said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not true. Our position now is that we are about to enter negotiation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is impossible for us to drastically change the principles of contracts of work before both parties agree (contractor and government),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Investment Minister Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo said he was not aware of the reasons or motivation behind the proposals.</p>
<p>Under the proposed changes for the minerals mining sector, foreign companies are required to allocate at least a 10 percent stake in future ventures to the government for free.</p>
<p>The companies would also be required to share capital gains made in stock exchanges outside Indonesia with their shareholders, and the raising of additional capital through a public offering of shares must be done in Indonesia.</p>
<p>The government informed mining companies on Thursday that similar changes would be made to the coal sector.</p>
<p>A copy of the proposed changes obtained by Reuters showed that coal companies had to divest 51 percent of their equity in projects to Indonesians by the 10th year of operation.</p>
