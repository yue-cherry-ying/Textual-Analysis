<p>FIFA has suspended Portuguese referees from international matches until the country's referees' association and soccer federation resolve a dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;The dispute between the two associations has led to a situation where FIFA decided to suspend the referees from international duty,&quot; FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;As soon as the dispute is settled the situation will be reviewed.&quot;</p>
<p>The swearing-in of the seven-strong referees' council of the Portuguese Soccer Federation in March was suspended against its wishes after the referees' association lodged a complaint in a civil court over an appointment.</p>
<p>The referees' association said in the complaint that Avelino Ferreira Torres was not eligible for a seat on the council because he did not have a &quot;clean record&quot;.</p>
<p>Ferreira Torres was suspended from administrative duties for six months in 1990 for allegedly making unethical remarks in a press interview.</p>
<p>Both national associations are holding talks to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>Herren said the immediate impact of the FIFA ruling was that Portuguese referee Jorge Monteiro Coroado would not take charge of the World Cup qualifier between Lithuania and Romania in Vilnius on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He has been replaced by German Edgar Steinborn.</p>
