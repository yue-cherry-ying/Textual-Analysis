<p>Jewish settlers hurled stones at Palestinian cars passing their enclave in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, hours after an apparent suicide bomber blew himself up in the same area, Palestinian police and witnesses said.</p>
<p>There were no injuries in the bombing, which Israeli authorities said was aimed at killing Jews. In a second blast near another Gaza settlement on Tuesday, a Palestinian was killed and at least five injured under disputed circumstances.</p>
<p>&quot;I was driving my car passing the Netzarim settlement, and my car was hit by stones thrown by more than 20 settlers from inside the settlement and from the side of the road,&quot; Palestinian motorist Hafez Matar told Reuters.</p>
<p>PLO security official Colonel Salem Dardona confirmed the report, saying settlers threw stones at several passing Arab cars until a Israeli-PLO police patrol arrived at the scene.</p>
<p>&quot;We went there in a joint patrol, and the Israeli army controlled the situation and sent the settlers back into the settlement,&quot; Dardona said.</p>
<p>Motorists reported no injuries.</p>
<p>Jewish settlers, enraged by Tuesday's blasts, demanded Israeli troops invade PLO-ruled areas to uproot &quot;terror&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The first thing we have to do is re-enter to uproot the terror bases,&quot; said Yechiel Leiter, spokesman for the YESHA Jewish settler council.</p>
<p>In conflicting accounts over the second bombing at a settlement south of Netzarim, Israeli military officials said an apparent suicide bomber blew himself up. Palestinians said the man was killed by an explosive charge thrown at him from an Israeli army jeep.</p>
<p>In separate incidents on Tuesday, Israeli security forces shot dead two Palestinians in the West Bank, where street battles over Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem flared for the 13th straight day.</p>
