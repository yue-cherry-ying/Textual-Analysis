<p>Cotton producer and marketer Colly Cotton Ltd said on Thursday that Twynam Investments, which is linked to agricultural investor John Kahlbetzer, had raised its stake to 43 percent with the acquisition of an 18 percent block.</p>
<p>The shares were purchased under a pre-emptive right negotiated at the time of Colly Cotton's float in October 1996.</p>
<p>The deal gave Twynam the first right to purchase shares held on behalf of four government superannuation funds if they decided to sell.</p>
<p>It did not release the purchase price of the shares.  </p>
<p>A further 7.2 million shares remain subject to the pre-emptive agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;The acquisition was of mutual benefit to all shareholders and a sign of confidence in the cotton industry in Australia and Colly's future plans,&quot; said Colly Cotton chairman Bill Cutbush.</p>
<p>The company also said it had completed picking its current season harvest and had optimistic yield forecasts.</p>
<p>Colly Cotton shares closed one cent lower at A$1.12, three cents off its record high, on turnover of 126,016 shares. The stock has a market capitalisation of A$119.84 million with 107.0 million shares on issue.  </p>
