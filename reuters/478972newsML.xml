<p>Bridgestone is said to be waiting for more offers in the market while Singapore rubber futures drifted on Tuesday in thin dealings, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We heard Bridgestone is waiting for some more offers for SIR20 rubber. I think they bought a modest amount yesterday for forward delivery,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Traders said Bridgestone probably bought the rubber at a price between 50-51 U.S. cents a kg.</p>
<p>&quot;Bridgestone wants to look at some more offers this afternoon and are waiting for them to come in,&quot; another dealer said.  </p>
<p>Another market player was also bidding for SMR20 rubber for around 278-280 Malaysian cents a kg, but most sellers were seen a few cents higher, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that group wants to sell a few hundred tonnes of SMR20 to China,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>At around 0945 GMT, May RSS3 was seen at 118.00-120.00 U.S. cents a kg from the previous 120.00 cents. May RSS1 was seen at 172.00-174.00 Singapore cents (US$1.19-$1.21) a kg from 173.50 cents. June TSR20 was seen unchanged at 161.75 Singapore cents (US$1.12) a kg.</p>
