<p>Lebanon's weekly treasury bill issue of March 27 raised 426 billion Lebanese pounds after the Bank of Lebanon restricted sales of most bills.</p>
<p>The previous issue raised 366 billion pounds.</p>
<p>The issue posted a nominal surplus of subscription against maturity of 138 billion pounds. It raised the following amounts (in billion of pounds, previous week in brackets):</p>
<p>    Term			  Yield		    Amount</p>
<p>    Three months	    13.75 (13.78)	    55.6  (38.5)</p>
<p>    Six months		14.49 (14.50)	    80.0 (104.1)</p>
