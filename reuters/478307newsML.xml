<p>University of Cincinnati junior forward Danny Fortson, Conference USA's Player of the Year the last two seasons, said Tuesday he will forego his senior year to enter the NBA draft.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-7 (2.01 m), 260-pound (118 kg) Fortson averaged 21.4 points and nine rebounds to lead the Bearcats in both categories this season.</p>
<p>&quot;It was basically a business decision,&quot; said Fortson. &quot;I just thought about my dream and my dream has always been to play in the NBA. I'm going with my heart.&quot;</p>
<p>Cincinnati, the preseason number one team in the country, had a disappointing season. The Bearcats (26-8) struggled against the nation's elite, with seven of their losses coming to NCAA Tournament teams. Cincinnati was eliminated in the second round of the NCAA Tournament by Iowa State.</p>
<p>Fortson had an inconsistent junior year, scoring 30 or more points on six occasions, but also had four games in which he scored less than 10 points.</p>
