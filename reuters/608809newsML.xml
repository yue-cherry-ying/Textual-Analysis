<p>The Croatian average lending rate held steady on Friday in somewhat livelier trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>Total settlements were 46.7 million kuna almost half of which were renewed borrowings. The supply stood at 60 million kuna.</p>
<p>Dealers said liquidity improved after central bank interventions earlier this week and repayments to banks by the pension fund.</p>
<p>Fresh loans accounted for 26.5 million kuna, most of which were call money at an unchanged 10.5 percent. The rest were term loans at rates ranging between 13.5 percent for two-week funds and 15 percent for one-month.</p>
<p>Insurers rolled over previous loans at nine percent for 10-day funds and at 13.5 percent for one-month.</p>
<p>Banks charged 10.5 and 11 percent for old call money and between 11 and 22 percent for renewed term borrowings.</p>
<p>The central bank calculated its kuna midrates for the weekend and Monday firmer at 6.0469 against the dollar and slightly stronger at 3.5700 versus the German mark. -- Laura Lui, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075</p>
