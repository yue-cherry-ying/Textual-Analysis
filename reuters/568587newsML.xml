<headline>IBM rises after upbeat analyst meeting.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Shares of International Business Machines Corp moved higher after what analysts described as an optimistic meeting with the company late Wednesday, with some analysts raising their price targets on the stock.</p>
<p>&quot;I think management is coming out swinging for a very conservative company,&quot; said Ahmet Chopra, a First Boston analyst who raised his 12-month price target on IBM to $195. &quot;They are showing a lot of confidence in their ability to deliver on a business model they have been touting for years.&quot;</p>
<p>IBM Chief Executive Louis Gerstner told analysts that IBM does have many opportunities for growth and its execution is key.  </p>
<p>John Jones, a Salomon Brothers analyst, said that the tone of the meeting was &quot;very positive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting solidified our view that there is significant long-term revenue and earnings growth opportunities which should lead to a huge stock price over the next two to three years,&quot; Jones said in a note to clients.</p>
<p>Jones said that with projected consistent 15 percent earnings growth over the next few quarters, the shares should approach his current price target of $180 ($90 post split) and position itself for price/earnings ratio expansion to a multiple of about 14 times 1998 earnings estimates.  </p>
<p>IBM shares were up 6-1/4 to 168-3/8.</p>
<p>Analysts said they were impressed by IBM's focus on speed in getting its products to market, and by the combative and aggressive attitude illustrated by Gerstner in his comments.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a very different company today,&quot; Gerstner told analysts on Wednesday. &quot;We have very specific programs to go after our competitiors' business. This was not something IBM did in the past because the consent decree made it very difficult for IBM to behave that way.&quot;</p>
<p>Don Young, a Prudential Securities analyst, also raised his price target, to $225 a share, from $190 previously.</p>
