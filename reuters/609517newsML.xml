<title>ITALY: Algerian prisoner in Italy on hunger strike.</title>
<headline>Algerian prisoner in Italy on hunger strike.</headline>
<dateline>MILAN, Italy 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>An Algerian held in jail on arms trafficking charges in Italy has been on hunger strike for three weeks, his lawyer said on Friday.</p>
<p>Francesco Piscopo said Djamel Lounici, who was arrested in 1995 on suspicion of links with the armed wing of the Algerian Salvation Front (FIS), had not eaten solid food for 20 days.</p>
<p>He began drinking liquids recently after earlier refusing all nourishment, the lawyer said.</p>
<p>The trial of Lounici and ten other Algerians in the southern city of Naples was postponed last week for procedural reasons. It was scheduled to begin on November 6.</p>
<p>Italy dropped earlier terrorism charges against Lounici and has agreed to extradite him to France once he has faced arms trafficking charges in Naples.</p>
<p>Lounici was charged in absentia by a French court earlier this year and given a five-year jail term for involvement in guerrilla attacks in Morocco, including one in which two Spaniards died in 1994.</p>
<p>Lounici, who is being held in a northern jail, was arrested in Italy after a wave of bomb attacks in France in 1995 in which eight people were killed and 160 injured.</p>
