<p>An actor playing &quot;Barney,&quot; the purple dinosaur loved by millions of children, suffered smoke inhalation when a cooling fan inside the 60-pound (27-kg) suit shorted out during filming of the TV show, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>There was no fire but the actor inhaled smoke as he tried to get out of the suit at a Dallas studio on Tuesday, said Susan Elsner, a spokeswoman for Lyrick Studios and The Lyons Group, which created and produces the hugely popular children's show &quot;Barney &amp; Friends.&quot;</p>
<p>She said the actor, who was not named, inhaled a &quot;slight amount of smoke&quot; but was released after a routine examination.</p>
<p>Once the incident was reported on television, scores of anxious parents called to say their children were worried their favourite dinosaur had been burned or, worse still, was a fake.</p>
<p>&quot;It can be really devastating to a 3-year-old,&quot; Elsner said. &quot;They love Barney and they think that something terrible has happened to him, or that it's not real.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; airs on the U.S. Public Broadcasting System and is a top-ranking programme for children under age 6. It appears in 30 countries across six continents.</p>
<p>Elsner said Tuesday's incident came as the cast was filming shows for the fall season.</p>
