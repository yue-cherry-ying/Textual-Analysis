<p>Following are brief portraits of French left-wing and centre-right figures likely to play a role in government if their parties win Sunday's parliamentary election runoff.</p>
<p>----------------------</p>
<p>If the left wins:</p>
<p>Lionel JOSPIN, 59, would almost certainly be prime minister. He took over as leader of the Socialist Party from Francois Mitterrand on his election as president in 1981. Jospin held the post until 1988, when he became education minister. Disillusioned with the sleaze and drift of the late Mitterrand years, he left politics in 1992 but returned to become Socialist presidential candidate in 1995, winning 47.3 percent of the runoff vote. He took control of the party shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>Dominique STRAUSS-KAHN, 47, is the likely finance minister. The elegant &quot;DSK&quot; drafted the Socialist Party's economic policy and was its frontline spokesman on economic affairs. A believer in an active government industrial policy, he served as industry minister in 1991-93. A skilled debater with a sense of humour, he is married to star television interviewer Ann Sinclair.</p>
<p>Jacques DELORS, 71, would probably be a special adviser to Jospin on European affairs, without a cabinet post. The former European Commission president has acted as moral reference for the European credentials of Socialist leader Lionel Jospin in the campaign but has given no hint he is prepared to return to government. He was Socialist finance minister in 1981-84.</p>
<p>Martine AUBRY, 46, Delors' daughter, is tipped to be employment and/or social affairs minister. A former senior civil servant expert on employment policy, she was a respected labour minister in 1991-93. Sharp-minded and dynamic, she set up a Foundation for Action against Social Exclusion, working to bring the young unemployed and poor back into the world of work.</p>
<p>Michel ROCARD, 66, could be foreign minister. A leftist turned moderate social democrat, he earned Francois Mitterrand's enduring enmity for twice challenging him for the presidency. Mitterrand made him prime minister in 1988 but took revenge by firing him three years later. He briefly led the Socialist Party after its 1993 general election rout but was ousted a year later. He is a member of the French Senate and of the European parliament.</p>
<p>Elisabeth GUIGOU, 50, a possible Europe or social affairs minister, was a behind-the-scenes architect of France's European policy as personal adviser to Mitterrand. The cool, hard-working blonde was catapulted to prominence as European affairs minister at the time of the Maastricht Treaty. A skilled technocrat, she found it hard to communicate with ordinary voters.</p>
<p>Daniel VAILLANT, 47, a likely interior minister, is Jospin's closest ally and number two in the Socialist party. He gained expertise on urban safety and immigration after winning control of Paris's 18th district -- a hotbed of crime, prostitution and drug-use -- from the right in 1995. Vaillant managed Jospin's 1995 presidential campaign and has had the tough job of settling internal disputes in the faction-ridden party.</p>
<p>Bernard KOUCHNER, 57, tipped to return as health minister. The founder of the Medecins sans Frontieres medical charity stirs both admiration as the champion of refugees and war victims, and antipathy for his publicity-seeking. As minister of humanitarian action in 1991-93, he persuaded the United Nations to back the right to humanitarian intervention in civil wars.</p>
<p>Dominique VOYNET, 38, could be environment minister. The iron lady of France's Greens, she was the youngest candidate in the May 1995 presidential election. She became active in the ecology movement at age 18, campaigning against nuclear power, and was a co-founder of the Greens at 26. She advocates a major shift to public transport and rail haulage and away from motorway-building and private cars.</p>
<p>----------------------</p>
<p>If the ruling centre-right coalition is re-elected:</p>
<p>Philippe SEGUIN, 54, a socially-minded Gaullist would almost certainly be prime minister. The outgoing National Assembly speaker led the &quot;no&quot; campaign in France's 1992 referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on European union but says he would honour France's signature and wants to put the single currency to the service of employment. Social affairs minister in 1986-88, he supports a strong, protective state and regularly fulminates against the prevailing economic &quot;ultra-liberalism&quot;.</p>
<p>Alain MADELIN, 51, an irrepressible free-marketeer who was sacked as finance minister in 1995 after causing a furore by denouncing civil servants' &quot;privileges&quot;, is tipped to regain the finance portfolio as part of a &quot;dream ticket&quot; with Seguin. Before his brief period as finance minister, he was an energetic industry minister in 1986-88 and small business minister in 1993-95.</p>
<p>Charles PASQUA, 70, a hardline ex-interior minister, is tipped to return to the post. He earned hatred on the left and admiration, though little gratitude, on the right with tough laws to curb immigration. A blustering and charismatic Gaullist, Pasqua was one of the Right's most controversial figures until he fell from power in 1995.</p>
<p>Nicolas SARKOZY, 42, went into political exile after being the spokesman for ex-premier Edouard Balladur's unsuccessful 1995 presidential campaign against Jacques Chirac, the eventual winner. A skilled debater with a quick wit and sharp tongue, he became one of France's youngest cabinet members ever in 1993 when he was named budget minister at the age of 38.</p>
<p>Francois LEOTARD, 55, is tipped to return as defence or foreign minister. The leader of the centre-right UDF, junior partner in the ruling coalition, he has been nicknamed the &quot;French Clinton&quot; because of his media skills and ambition. An economic liberal and strong supporter of European integration, he served as culture minister in 1986-88 and defence minister in 1993-95 before backing Balladur's presidential bid and going down with him.</p>
