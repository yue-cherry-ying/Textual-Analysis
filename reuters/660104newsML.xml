<p>A House panel voted Thursday to give states billions of dollars to provide health care for up to half the nation's 10 million uninsured children while making broad cuts in Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p>The measure approved by the House Commerce Committee is one of the most significant domestic initiatives to move through Congress this year.</p>
<p>It calls for $15 billion in five-year savings in the Medicaid health program for the poor, elderly and disabled while providing $16 billion in grants to states to cover uninsured children.</p>
<p>The bill also includes policy changes needed to realize $115 billion in spending cuts in the Medicare insurance program for all senior citizens. It is needed to implement a five-year budget deal between Congress and the White House.</p>
<p>Children's health has been a hot issue this year as politicians of both parties have moved to expand coverage.</p>
<p>The legislation would provide about $2.6 billion a year in grants states could use to expand care to poor children. The program would be voluntary and states would have to contribute funds of their own.</p>
<p>Governors would have wide latitude in designing their programs, which could include vouchers, managed care, direct aid or other approaches. They could also expand existing Medicaid programs to reach more children.</p>
<p>Democrats argued the plan was too broad and would allow states to use the new money to make up partially for cuts in Medicaid. They tried unsuccessfully to rework the program to include more stringent requirements.</p>
<p>&quot;(Children's care is) only in the budget because the president and the Democrats have been pressing,&quot; New Jersey Democrat Rep. Frank Pallone said. &quot;It's not clear the Republican proposal will even cover 5 million kids.&quot;</p>
<p>Republicans said states could deliver services more cheaply and efficiently than Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither plan covers all the 10 million children. I just wish we could come up with something that could do that,&quot; Florida Republican Rep. Michael Bilirakis said, complaining that Democratic alternatives also fell short.</p>
<p>In a key move, the panel repealed a long-standing Medicaid law requiring states to pay &quot;reasonable and adequate&quot; rates for nursing home, hospital and other long-term care. Medicaid pays more than half of the U.S. nursing home bills.</p>
<p>Governors, backed by President Clinton, argue they have been forced to pay unduly high rates because of court decisions.</p>
<p>Many Democrats said that without the rule, states would cut payments to vulnerable Medicaid recipients.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's regrettable that the president ... has thrown in with the governors on this, because it's going to hurt people,&quot; California Democrat Anna Eshoo said.</p>
<p>The bulk of the Medicaid savings comes from cutting federal aid to hospitals that serve a large number of poor and uninsured patients. The committee voted to give charity and teaching hospitals top priority for the remaining funds.</p>
<p>The committee also voted to cut from the bill $100 million that was set aside to provide Medicaid coverage to children who will lose disablity aid under a new welfare law.</p>
<p>Most of the Medicare savings come from slowing payments to doctors and other health care providers and offering more managed care options to patients.</p>
<p>Democrats failed to eliminate a pilot project allowing 500,000 seniors to set up tax-free medical savings accounts rather than participate in the traditional Medicare program.</p>
<p>Democrats say the healthiest seniors will use the accounts, leaving older, sicker people in Medicare and boosting spending by $2 billion. They wanted to use that money instead to pay Medicare premiums of poor seniors.</p>
<p>The budget called for $1.5 billion to subsidize Medicare premiums, but Republicans spent only about $500 million.</p>
<p>The bill also provides that health plans contracting with Medicare and Medicaid would not have to provide end-of-life or abortion services if they objected on moral grounds.</p>
