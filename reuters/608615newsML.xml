<p>Laurent Kabila's troops fired into the air to break up a protest against the new government in Kinshasa on Friday as tension rose between his former rebels and the political opposition in the capital.</p>
<p>Veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi said he did not recognise the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo formed on Thursday which excluded him.</p>
<p>&quot;This government doesn't exist for me. I ask all the people to resist with their last energy all attempts to impose a government without popular legitimacy,&quot; Tshisekedi said.</p>
<p>The firebrand politician called for the withdrawal of foreign troops who helped Kabila's guerrilla alliance drive veteran dictator Mobutu Sese Seko from power in former Zaire.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Tshisekedi followers chanted anti-Kabila slogans and called for the pullout of Rwandan troops from his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL).</p>
<p>They marched from Tshisekedi's house in Limete into the city centre, past the U.S., French and Belgian embassies, but troops firing in the air blocked them before they reached the People's Palace, the seat of parliament.</p>
<p>At his news conference, Tshisekedi did not directly ask his fanatical supporters in the the city of five million people to take to the streets. He appeared to leave the door open for talks with Kabila, acknowledging that the guerrilla leader deserved to be president but insisting on &quot;popular legitimacy&quot;.</p>
<p>Mobutu, who went into exile on Sunday, arrived in Morocco from the West African state of Togo, on Togo president Gnassingbe Eyadema's official plane.</p>
<p>Sources close to Eyadema said Mobutu would go on to France, where he has a Riviera villa, after the French elections which end on June 1.</p>
<p>Weakened by cancer, Mobutu left with his wife and children, including his son Captain Mobutu Kongolo, and an entourage of about 50 people on Eyadema's presidential Boeing. A DC-8 was expected in Lome later to collect his extensive luggage.</p>
<p>Giving the new government a more sympathetic reception, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said he would not try to persuade Kabila to include Tshisekedi and warned against pressure for quick elections, saying there were serious obstacles to achieving a fair poll so soon after taking power.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be unfair to say to somebody who walked into Kinshasa the day before yesterday: 'Set a date for elections'. They can't and if they did it would be entirely a thumbsuck,&quot; said Mbeki, speaking in the Zimbabwe capital Harare.</p>
<p>He said South Africa would finalise plans next week to send a team of experts to help reconstruct the economy of the mineral-rich but bankrupt state.</p>
<p>Formner colonial power Belgium said it would start bringing home troops sent to neighbouring Brazzaville ready to protect and evacuate Belgian nationals if necessary.</p>
<p>Kabila had intense domestic pressure and some Western encouragement to appoint Tshisekedi to a key post such as the prime ministership.</p>
<p>Announcing an incomplete list of 13 cabinet ministers on Thursday, he brushed aside those calls despite warnings that Tshisekedi, a longtime political foe of Mobutu, remains a hugely popular political figure in the capital.</p>
<p>Senior Alliance members said six of the ministers were not from the Alliance but the pro-Tshisekedi La Reference newspaper said the Alliance had awarded itself all but four posts.</p>
<p>Across the river from Kinshasa, neighbour Congo noted the change of power in former Zaire and said it was ready to support the efforts of the new authorities there to promote democracy.</p>
<p>In a tacit acknowledgement of Kabila's decision to rename Zaire as the Democratic Republic of Congo, its neighbour referred to itself as Congo Brazzaville -- the name it used before 1971 when the two nations had the name Congo in common.</p>
