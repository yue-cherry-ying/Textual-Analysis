<p>Fire ripped through the residence of Indonesia's ambassador to Sweden on Thursday, causing one injury and seriously damaging the upper part of the house.</p>
<p>One person was admitted to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation but ambassador Haringon Hardjotanojo was not in Stockholm at the time of the fire.</p>
<p>Some 50 firemen were involved in fighting the fire, which began at around 0800 GMT.</p>
<p>By 1000 GMT, firefighters said the blaze was under control, although white smoke was pouring from the house, in the leafy suburb of Lidingo.</p>
<p>The Swedish news agency TT quoted embassy officials as saying the ambassador's family had been on their way to Stockholm by car when they were alerted that the house was on fire.</p>
<p>Four embassy staff were in the residence when the fire began and everyone had been accounted for. Officials said no threats head been received against the ambassador or his family.</p>
