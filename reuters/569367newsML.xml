<p>Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd on Thursday announced 12.5 percent growth in net profits but analysts questioned its long-term prospects in an increasingly competitive cellular phone market.</p>
<p>The company said it earned HK$11.18 billion (US$1.4 billion) during the year to March 31.</p>
<p>&quot;Results like this are too good to be luck,&quot; said Richard Brown, deputy chief executive of Hongkong Telecom and chief executive of Cable and Wireless, which holds 58.5 percent of Hongkong Telecom.</p>
<p>Hongkong Telecom chief executive Linus Cheung said the utility was rebalancing its portfolio of services, and lessening its reliance on international direct dial (IDD) revenues.</p>
<p>&quot;Revenues for our mobile services increased by 43 percent, and a 45 percent rise in customer numbers ensured that we remain the market leader,&quot; Cheung said.</p>
<p>However, analysts predicted tougher times in the Hong Kong cellular market in future.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you'll see a deterioration in the cellular business,&quot; said Lloyd Fischer, head of regional telecommunications research with BZW Asia.</p>
<p>Fischer said excess capacity would lead to precipitous falls in cellular call prices, a prime source of Hongkong Telecom's growth in the past few years.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly they are in the pole position, but I think the (cellular) market itself is going to be a lot harder place to make money in,&quot; Morgan Stanley analyst Jeff Camp said.</p>
<p>Cheung said IDD revenue now constituted 53 percent of total revenue, down from more than 60 percent two years ago, but declined to reveal the utility's share of the IDD market.</p>
<p>The utility faces increasing competition in the market for international calls from callback operators despite a theoretical monopoly until 2006.</p>
<p>Until then, competitors must route their international traffic through Hongkong Telecom lines.</p>
<p>Analysts questioned whether the reduced IDD revenue reflected Hongkong Telecom's moves to diversify or whether it indicated the company's shrinking share of the international market.</p>
<p>They estimated Hongkong Telecom's international share had fallen to about 75 percent, although its introduction of its own callback service might stem loss of market share, they said.</p>
<p>An analyst, who declined to be named, said investors wanted to know how the company would cope with the possible loss of its IDD monopoly before its designated end in 2006.</p>
<p>&quot;Hongkong Telecom is still holding a monopoly on the international gateway,&quot; he said. &quot;It will hurt when it loses that.&quot;</p>
<p>Fischer said the utility's prospects this year depended on how it managed change in a rapidly changing environment.</p>
<p>&quot;The company will have to decide whether it will have to take a short-term view to prop up short-term revenues, or to roll up its sleeves and protect its market share for the longer term,&quot; Fischer said.</p>
<p>Both Brown and Cheung declined to comment on speculation the utility might be taking on a mainland partner.</p>
<p>The rumours drove Hongkong Telecom's share price to a new high for the year of HK$15.05 on Thursday, before it slipped back to HK$15.00 at the close.</p>
