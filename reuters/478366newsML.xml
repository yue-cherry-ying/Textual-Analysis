<p>Industrial company Norma is looking both east and west as it jostles for market share in Russia's unpredictable car parts market, company chief executive Peep Aaviksoo said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is our future to be there and to know the market and if Western car manufacturers are coming to Russia, to be a partner with them is part of our future,&quot; Aaviksoo, head of the company for a year, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;This year's main target is not to lose our market share in Russia and to take small slices from the cake from the western market. The question is which is the western market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The company's main product is car safety belts with production mainly aimed at Russian car makers. However, the company is trying to find access to Western car makers as well.</p>
<p>&quot;Our core or best product is car safty belts to Russia and to Poland and some small parts to Saab in Sweden and we won a contract to the new General Motors plant in Poland,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The move toward supplying Western suppliers is a key aim of the company and the way they measure their success with an eye to possible Western car makers in the Russian market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that (the GM Poland contract) is our big break, our breakthough to the real market,&quot; Aviksoo said.</p>
<p>To take advantage of the increasing Western interest in the Russian market, Norma is improving its own production and its ISO 9000 standard certification is one important part of the company's 1997 strategy.</p>
<p>The certificate covers all key management areas and most Western firms are themselves still striving to get the document.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to have it (the certificate) this month or next month.&quot; he said. The company also recently won important niche contacts to supply saftey belts for European bus companies.</p>
<p>&quot;This year we got contracts with European bus manufacturers...It is a niche market, not a big market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;For us it is very important, because it is the western market, we need the experience and need to prove ourselves on that market,&quot; he added.</p>
