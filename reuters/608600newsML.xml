<p>Canadian bonds closed little changed to slightly weaker in quiet trade on Friday, as an early close for the U.S. bond market kept activity in the Canadian market subdued, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not significantly weaker I think. It's been a relatively quiet day ahead of a long weekend,&quot; said Craig Wright, deputy chief economist with Royal Bank of Canada. &quot;It should be relatively quiet again next week.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond fell C$0.30 to C$111.15 to yield 7.058 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond rose 1/32 to yield 6.99 percent. The spread between the bonds widened to seven basis points from five basis points at the close of trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>Analysts said a widening of Canada-U.S. spreads at the long end of the curve was not unusual after a week in which the spread at the 30-year level narrowed to an all-time low of three basis points.</p>
<p>With the U.S. bond market closing early at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT ahead of Memorial Day on Monday, there was little for Canadian bonds to trade on. There were no significant economic data released in Canada today.  </p>
<p>Although Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen spoke in Calgary earlier today, his comments were seen as benign and had no significant impact on prices.</p>
<p>Trading activity next week was expected to be light, with U.S. and European markets closed for various holidays on Monday and little significant Canadian economic data expected during the week, analysts said.</p>
<p>In other prices, Canada's 10-year benchmark bond fell C$0.16 to C$103.32 to yield 6.521 percent. The U.S. 10-year bond rose 1/32 to yield 6.75 percent.  </p>
<p>The negative spread between the two bonds narrowed to 23 basis points from 25 basis points at the close of trading on Thursday. The spread was as wide as 28 basis points at the close of trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The three-month cash T-bill traded with a yield of 2.87 percent against its U.S. equivalent, which yielded 5.15 percent.</p>
