<p>Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's popularity has risen since May despite an alleged cash-for-votes scandal in Congress, daily newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo said.</p>
<p>A poll published on Friday showed 55 percent of the population approved of Cardoso's administration, up from an all-time low of 49 percent in May, despite reports congressmen accepted bribes in exchange for voting in favour of Cardoso's re-election bid.</p>
<p>According to polling company Ibope, 45 percent rated Cardoso's performance as average, while 31 percent rated him good and 7 percent very good. Eight percent thought he was doing a bad job and 9 percent rated him very bad.</p>
<p>Cardoso's image has recovered from a sharp drop in May because the political scene has calmed down, the newspaper quoted Ibope President Carlos Augusto Montenegro as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;The government's weak performance in the May survey was the result of the negative repercussions from the sale of (mining giant) Vale do Rio Doce, the municipal bond scandal, the march of the landless peasant movement to Brasilia and the rise in the minimum salary, considered derisive,&quot; Montenegro said.</p>
<p>Cardoso's popularity was higher among poorer, less educated Brazilians, men and young people. Ibope polled 3,000 people between June 11 and 18. It did not give a margin of error.</p>
