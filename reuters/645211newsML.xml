<p>A United Nations delegation visiting Angola's diamond area in the northeast said it had found evidence of fighting there between government and former rebel UNITA troops, a military official said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw a lot of evidence to support what has been reported about fighting in the area,&quot; the official, who was among the delegation led by U.N. force commander Philip Sibanda to Lunda Norte province on Friday, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There is without doubt a FAA (Angolan Armed Forces) offensive going on against UNITA-held terrain in the northeast,&quot; the official added.</p>
<p>The delegation had seen wounded government soldiers and Angolan national police members at hospitals in neighbouring towns of Andrada, Canzar and Cambulo, in the northeastern corner of the province.</p>
<p>A U.N. statement, faxed to Reuters in Johannesburg, said the delegation's visit had been authorised by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who left Luanda on Thursday for a three-week private visit to Italy.</p>
<p>Until now the Angolan government has forbidden U.N. agencies to travel to Lunda Norte, where mining sources told Reuters the government army has attacked UNITA-held diamond areas for the past three weeks.</p>
<p>The fighting is the biggest in two years, since the Angolan government signed a peace treaty with UNITA in 1994 to end two decades of civil war.</p>
<p>Initially, the government said its raids were aimed at flushing out armed Rwandan and Hutu refugees who had crossed into the diamond area from the former Zaire, but analysts said this was a pretext to retake diamond-rich territory under the control of UNITA.</p>
<p>Both factions were joined in a power-sharing government in April, but the former rebels still hold vast areas of the Angolan countryside, including the richest diamond areas around the Cuango River valley in eastern Lunda Norte province.</p>
<p>The country's diamond production, much of which is ferried by UNITA illegally through central Africa to the open market, is estimated to be worth up to $1 billion.</p>
<p>Western diplomats in Luanda said their governments had warned Dos Santos' MPLA to halt the strikes in the diamond area fearing a return to war.</p>
<p>One diplomat said there was concern that UNITA might retaliate in neighbouring provinces, even though many of its troops have been disarmed and integrated into a single Angolan army or demobilised by the U.N. in terms of the peace agreement.</p>
