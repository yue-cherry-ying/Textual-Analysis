<p>Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien's re-election campaign has sprung a leak in Western Canada amid voter anger with his decision to hold a federal election during Manitoba's worst flooding in 145 years.</p>
<p>Despite a commanding lead in nationwide opinion polls, support for Chretien's Liberal Party appears to be suffering in the West -- from flood-ravaged Manitoba on the prairies to British Columbia on the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>Chretien's election call 1-1/2 years earlier than required despite the floods has revived chronic complaints that the West's concerns are ignored in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Westerners have long felt that the eastern provinces of Ontario and Quebec unfairly dominate national politics. Quebec is Chretien's native province.</p>
<p>&quot;The Manitoba flood is another bead on the rosary of grievances in the West,&quot; said Allen Seager, director of the Centre for Canadian Studies at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. &quot;The anger is an illustration of the electoral marginalization felt by people in the West.&quot;</p>
<p>The Liberals are nonetheless expected to win enough seats in Parliament to form another majority government. A Reuters survey by the Zogby International polling firm released on Monday showed the Liberals supported by 47.6 percent of decided voters, more than 30 points ahead of their nearest rivals.</p>
<p>But in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, the Liberals trailed the right-wing Reform Party and were ahead of Reform by only a slim margin in British Columbia. The West is the traditional stronghold for Reform, based in Alberta.</p>
<p>In the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the Zogby poll showed Reform leading the Liberals by 35.5 percent to 25.4 percent, with the left-wing New Democratic Party at 20.6 percent.</p>
<p>The Zogby poll found that 68 percent of western voters did not think there was a good reason to call an election now and that number rose to 79 percent in the prairies.</p>
<p>Chretien visited flood-ravaged Manitoba a day before calling the vote on April 27. Many westerners were irritated by images of Chretien touring the dikes with a media entourage while residents scrambled to save their homes.</p>
<p>Handed a sandbag when visiting one hard-hit area, the prime minister asked what he was supposed to do with it, a comment that for some Manitoba residents has come to symbolise his detachment from their plight.</p>
<p>Chretien has tried to blunt the criticism by sending $25 million Canadian (US$18.5 million) in emergency aid to Manitoba last week and has promised more help to come.</p>
<p>But some political analysts believed the bitterness would recede with the floodwaters and not have a major impact on the final vote tally. &quot;It seems like it's a relatively short-lived effect,&quot; said pollster John Zogby.</p>
