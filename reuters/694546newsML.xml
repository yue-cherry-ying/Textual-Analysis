<headline>US judge denies Kaczynski bid to throw out evidence.</headline>
<dateline>SACRAMENTO, Calif. 1997-06-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>A federal judge on Friday denied a motion by Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski to throw out evidence seized by the FBI during a search of his Montana cabin.</p>
<p>Kaczynski's lawyers had alleged that the April 1996 search was illegal because the FBI's affidavit supporting its request for a search warrant contained misleading information.  </p>
<p>But U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell rejected the arguments put forward by Kaczynski's attorneys and denied the motion in an order released late on Friday.</p>
<p>The motion was considered crucial to the case because if Burrell had excluded the large amount of evidence seized at the cabin, it would have greatly weakened the government's case against Kaczynski.</p>
<p>Kaczynski, a reclusive former mathematics professor, is accused of being the shadowy Unabomber who killed three people and injured 23 during an anti-technology bombing campaign between 1978 and 1995.</p>
<p>Kaczynski, arrested in Montana last year, has been charged in Sacramento with four of the bombings, two of them deadly. He could face the death penalty if convicted in a trial scheduled to start in Sacramento in November.</p>
