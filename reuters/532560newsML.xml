<p>Homosexuals can achieve holiness in the Roman Catholic Church but only if they follow the Church's rules of abstaining from sexual activity, the Vatican newspaper said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In an article concluding a 14-part series of reflections on homosexuality and Christianity, the semi-official newspaper L'Osservatore Romano also said some priests needed to overcome their &quot;fears and repulsion&quot; of homosexuals.</p>
<p>&quot;God loves all of us as we are, with our limits, our peculiarities, which can become paths to holiness,&quot; said the article, written by Jean-Louris Brugues, a member of the International Theological Commission.</p>
<p>The article, however, repeated the Church position that homosexuality or homosexual tendencies were not wrong or sinful but that homosexual acts were. It referred to homosexual acts as &quot;genital practices&quot;.</p>
<p>It also restated themes from a major 1986 Vatican document that deplored violence against homosexuals.</p>
<p>It said Catholics, including priests, should not show &quot;contempt&quot; for homosexuals but treat them with the same charity as they would other Christians.</p>
