<p>European officials attending a conference on promoting democracy in Cuba dissociated themselves on Saturday from the tough stance taken by the United States towards the Communist-ruled island.</p>
<p>Dutch European Affairs Minister Michiel Patijn said the controversial Helms-Burton Act, which seeks to penalise trade with Cuba, was politically misguided because it was based on the idea that Cuba still posed a threat to U.S. national security.</p>
<p>&quot;But Cuba is no longer a national security threat, it is rather an embarrassment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Patijn described a deal struck by the European Union (EU) and the United States last week to defuse their row over Helms-Burton as a &quot;precarious armistice&quot;.</p>
<p>He said the EU would not hesitate to reopen a World Trade Organisation (WTO) disputes panel over Helms-Burton if the deal ran into problems in the U.S. Congress. &quot;I hope that the U.S. administration can deliver the goods,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Patijn said the Helms-Burton row was regrettable because the EU and the U.S. shared the same goal of a peaceful transition towards democracy and a market economy in Cuba.</p>
<p>The EU has agreed to suspend the WTO disputes procedure but warned that it would start it up again if any measures were taken under the act against EU companies or citizens.</p>
<p>EU Commission official Mendel Goldstein told the conference that the best way to promote peaceful democratic change in Cuba was to end the country's international isolation.</p>
<p>The European Union was seeking to do this by stepping up political, economic, cultural and media contacts, he said.</p>
<p>Goldstein -- head of the Commission's Cuba, Mexico and Central America unit -- said Europe preferred to maintain its own distinct approach to encouraging reforms in Cuba and did not agree with the tough economic sanctions imposed by the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult to have a policy of very severe sanctions, of embargo, of isolation and have this second track of promoting democracy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck said Washington was committed to maintaining economic sanctions but agreed these needed to be complemented by other measures.</p>
<p>&quot;Change in Cuba must come from within and increasing the flow of information and ideas is critical,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>With this in mind, he said, President Bill Clinton had recently taken steps to promote better contacts between U.S. groups and the Cuban people, such as the recent decision to allow U.S. news organisations to open bureaux in Cuba.</p>
