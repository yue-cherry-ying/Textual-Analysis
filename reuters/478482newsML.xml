<p>Zairean government soldiers continued to flee a rebel advance on Tuesday while thousands of wretched refugees trudged desperately through the jungle away from rebel-held areas.</p>
<p>Some 120 government soldiers, who seized a train for the 24-hour journey from the abandoned rail and military town of Kamina, arrived in Lubumbashi, the hub of Zaire's copper industry in southern Shaba province.</p>
<p>The city is the immediate target of rebels who took up arms last October to topple President Mobutu Sese Seko, in power since 1965.</p>
<p>The retreating soldiers were disarmed, without resistance, by military police at Lubumbashi's elegant colonial railway station, expatriate sources said.</p>
<p>Zaire's undisciplined troops have a reputation for looting as they retreat.</p>
<p>The fall of Kamina, 600 km (370 miles) to the northwest, effectively cuts off Lubumbashi from the rest of government-held Zaire. But there was little sign of any attempt to mount a credible defence of the town, whose streets were full of talk that the army was melting away as the rebels approached.</p>
<p>President Mobutu, suffering from prostate cancer, will send a seven-man team headed by his security adviser to represent the central authorities in talks with Laurent Kabila's rebels, the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) in South Africa this week, Zaire's state television said on Monday.</p>
<p>The team, which includes Foreign Minister Kamanda wa Kamanda and representatives of both the opposition and the president's supporters in the transitional parliament, will travel to South Africa on Thursday, it said.</p>
<p>In the northeast, thousands of sick and exhausted Hutu refugees straggled to get clear of the battle zone.</p>
<p>The Rwandan and Burundian refugees moved south of rebel-held Kisangani and in the east towards Rwanda.</p>
<p>Aid workers said nearly 20,000 Hutu refugees, who abandoned their camp at Lula seven km (four miles) south of Kisangani on Monday, were in poor shape, straggling nearly 20 km (12 miles) along a jungle path.</p>
<p>&quot;It is desperate. You have people by the side of the road lying on a few bits of cloth trying to cover themselves with leaves and blankets,&quot; said U.N. refugee agency spokesman Paul Stromberg in Kisangani.</p>
<p>&quot;Now with these rains it is much worse. People are lying on their backs moaning or trying to wave to attact attention.&quot;</p>
<p>The ADFL demanded the refugees leave Lula on Monday and move south away from Kisangani city for security reasons.</p>
<p>The Tutsi-dominated rebels fear that among the refugees are former Rwandan Hutu troops and militiamen who had a major role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and Hutu moderates.</p>
<p>Stromberg said 700 of the most vulnerable refugees remained at Lula and the rest were strung out to the south, where another 60,000 Hutu refugees are trapped after fleeing rebel advances.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of having one long refugee site up a single-lane road is impracticable. Water points would be a problem and traffic would be impossible,&quot; said Stromberg, adding rebels had made it clear they did not want refugees stopping in villages.</p>
<p>He said the U.N. refugee agency had made little progress in negotiations with rebels on a plan to move the refugees, some of whom are too weak to walk, by air, road and on foot to Rwanda.</p>
<p>The agency said on Monday up to 30,000 refugees had arrived at Karuba village in Masisi district west of the eastern city of Goma, which borders on Rwanda, saying they wanted to go home.</p>
