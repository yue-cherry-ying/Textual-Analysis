<headline>Monsanto to buy rest of Calgene for $240 million.</headline>
<dateline>ST. LOUIS 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Monsanto Co. said Tuesday it has a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining shares of Calgene Inc. that it does not already own for $8 each, or about $240 million.</p>
<p>Monsanto, a life sciences company with agricultural, food science and pharmaceutical operations, said it will commence a tender offer by April 7.</p>
<p>Calgene, an agricultural biotechnology company based in Davis, Calif., has conducted research in oils, fresh produce and cotton.</p>
<p>The deal was unanimously approved by a special committee of Calgene's directors who are neither designees of Monsanto nor Calgene employees, it said .</p>
<p>The offer is subject to the tender of a majority of outstanding Calgene shares not owned by Monsanto.</p>
<p>Monsanto, based in St. Louis, now owns 36.4 million Calgene shares, or a stake of about 54.6 percent.</p>
<p>Monsanto first invested in Calgene in March 1996 by acquiring a 49.9 percent equity stake. In November 1996, Monsanto purchased an additional 6.25 million shares to raise its equity ownership to 54.6 percent. In January 1997, the company made a proposal to the Calgene board to acquire the remaining shares outstanding at a price of $7.25 a share.</p>
<p>This proposal was subject to the approval of a Calgene special committee, Monsanto said.</p>
<p>&quot;This will promote the closer working relationships and the greater sharing of technologies that are only possible with full ownership of the company,&quot; Hendrik Verfaillie, Monsanto executive vice president, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We can now better realise the benefits from Calgene's research by combining our technology efforts and bringing products to market more rapidly.&quot;</p>
<p>Lloyd Kunimoto, Calgene president, said his company has built a &quot;robust pipeline&quot; of products and technologies that can be commercialized through Monsanto's operating companies, affiliates and strategic partners. Monsanto holds a minority stake in agricultural company DeKalb Genetics Corp.</p>
<p>Monsanto said it has agreed in principle with Calgene to settle putative class action lawsuits, which were filed in the Delaware Chancery Court following the announcement of Monsanto's initial acquisition proposal. The lawsuits had challenged the fairness to Calgene's shareholders of the transaction as initially proposed.</p>
