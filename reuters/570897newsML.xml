<headline>ASIAN EXOTICS - Baht firms but worries persist.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>* Regionals quiet with Malaysia and Indonesia on holiday.</p>
<p>* Thai baht firmer on dollar/majors weakness but worries about more finance company defaults give dollar bid tone.</p>
<p>* Buying of ringgit/Singapore dollar cross by short-term players lifts ringgit and dampens Sing, but both currencies still in range against U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>* Indonesian rupiah steady in thin trade. Downside seen limited as market long on dollars.</p>
<p>The Thai baht firmed on the back of the dollar's weakness against the majors on Thursday, but dealers said concerns about Thailand's finance sector and the stock market's poor performance would limit the baht's gains.</p>
<p>&quot;Dollar/baht is being offered on the weaker majors but people are afraid about more debt defaults by Thai finance companies so they're cautious of being short dollars,&quot; a European bank dealer in Singapore said.</p>
<p>He said there was good buying interest in the dollar/baht at the 26.06 level, just above the central bank's mid-rate of 26.05 on Thursday.</p>
<p>The baht was quoted around 26.070/26.075 to the dollar at 03415 GMT versus 26.075/26.080 late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bangkok dealers said foreign investors who sold shares heavily in the local stock market recently had started to repatriate funds.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the money from the stock market is still parked in the money market, but we noticed active buying in the past few days which indicated that some foreign stock investors might be sending money home,&quot; a dealer at a major U.S. bank said.</p>
<p>He said the dollar buying had drained baht from the system, and this, coupled with the new round of reserve requirements, had pushed the interbank rate up.</p>
<p>The interbank rate was quoted around 9.00-9.50 percent early against 8.75-9.00 percent late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Singapore, some buying of the Malaysian ringgit/Sing dollar cross provided the only point of interest in a market dulled by the absence of Malaysia and Indonesia, dealers said.</p>
<p>A European bank dealer said short-term players had bought the cross around the 0.5750 level, partly due to reports clearing up concerns about Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's health after news he would be taking a long vacation.</p>
<p>&quot;The Malaysian press said he would be going for a rest and not for medical reasons and the Malaysian (authorities) also confirmed that so it gave the market confidence to buy the Malay again,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>News of Mahathir's impending leave -- the longest he has planned since becoming prime minister in 1981 -- stirred up much speculation in financial markets on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But officials firmly denied the break had anything to do with his health.</p>
<p>The dealer said the ringgit/Sing buying was a short-term move after the cross was sold down from the 0.5770 level on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. funds with long positions are still holding a short ringgit against the Sing dollar view and the market will take its cue from them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said investors seemed to have turned bullish on Singapore's prospects for the second half compared with the beginning of the year when Malaysia was more in favour.</p>
<p>But any weakness in the ringgit was likely to be confined to the 2.5150 level to the dollar for the time being as Bank Negara was expected to intervene to stem declines beyond that area.</p>
<p>&quot;With the lacklustre stock market, they're afraid of the ringgit weakening further on more capital outflows as that would be very bad for their long-term projects,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The ringgit was quoted at 2.5097/107 to the dollar at 0415 GMT against 2.5125/35 at its Kuala Lumpur close on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Sing dollar slipped on the ringgit/Sing buying but remained wedged between corporate demand for the U.S. dollar around 1.4430 and selling interest above 1.4470, dealers said.</p>
