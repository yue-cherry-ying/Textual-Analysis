<p>The National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY) will not risk relaxing its tight monetary policy or allow any inflation for more industrial growth, a senior central bank official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our industry growth would have been higher if we allowed some inflation, but under the circumstances, we cannot afford any programmed inflation which could easily spin out of control,&quot; NBY Vice-Governor Ratko Banovic told a meeting of economists.</p>
<p>According to official statistics, Yugoslavia has managed to bring its monthly inflation down to zero percent in April, from one percent in March.</p>
<p>Industry output grew 7.4 percent in March. April figures are still not available.</p>
<p>&quot;This level of restrictiveness (of monetary policy) allows only a modest growth. Stability on the one side and growth on the other are two completely contradictory targets,&quot; Banovic told Reuters.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia's monetary authorities were entrusted with keeping the prices and the dinar stable throughout the year while enabling growth, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Key targets of the 1997 economic policy are price stability with zero inflation for the December-on-December period, stability of the dinar exchange rate and a 13 percent production growth,&quot; Banovic told a two-day economic seminar in the southern Serbian town of Nis.</p>
<p>But official economic policy plans were extremely difficult to achieve in an economy with a troubled banking sector, huge inter-company debts, widespread illiquidity, lack of working capital, low disposable forex reserves, big trade gap and limited markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Under such circumstances, manoeuvring space for monetary policy is very limited,&quot; Banovic said.</p>
<p>&quot;The dinar and price stability are evident and it is now up to companies and banks to maintain liquidity from their own hard currency reserves,&quot; Banovic added.</p>
<p>During years of sanctions, Yugoslav companies and banks transferred big amounts of hard currency cash abroad and were now still unwilling to get the money back to the country. Officially, they were never publicly called to do either.</p>
<p>But Banovic insisted that companies and banks had to use their hard currency reserves for improving their dinar liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;The dinar liqudity cannot be treated separately from hard currency liquidity. Any hard currency income should be converted into dinars and used for an improved dinar liquidity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The vice-governor rejected criticism that the NBY was keeping the M1 money supply too low.</p>
<p>The NBY could have chosen between increasing the M1 money supply by the expected GDP growth rate, gradually throughout the year, or letting the M1 rise only by the rate of achieved industrial output growth.</p>
<p>&quot;We have opted for the latter,&quot; Banovic said.</p>
<p>According to the latest NBY figures, M1 stood at 5.157 billion dinars ($906 million) at the end of February, sharply down from an almost 5.5 billion dinars at the end of December 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;In case of Yugoslavia, M1 money supply stands between six and seven percent of the gross domestic product. In developed economies it stands between 15 and 20 percent of the GDP, but those countries have a different relation between price and currency stability and the size of their GDP,&quot; Banovic said.</p>
<p>He also played down criticism that a low M1 money supply was the reason why beside the dinar many payments in Yugoslavia were conducted also in German marks. -- Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254</p>
