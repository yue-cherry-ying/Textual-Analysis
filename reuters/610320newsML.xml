<p>French stocks opened higher on Friday, the last trading day before the first round of the legislative election, helped by a poll showing the centre-right going into Sunday's election with a lead, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is reacting to the poll published in the Tribune de Geneve, but we're advising people to protect themselves against an adverse reaction on Monday,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index was up 8.26 points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,749.91 at 0900 GMT, while the CAC-40 May futures contract was 11 points higher at 2,745.</p>
<p>Traders said the bourse was also helped by higher bond prices but they said it could consolidate later in the day.</p>
<p>Monday risks to be a volatile session because the closure of the U.S. and British markets means liquidity will be thin.</p>
<p>Volume was 800 million francs in the first 40 minutes, inflated by the monthly settlement taking place.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe on Friday predicted a difficult first-round for his centre-right coalition because of the record number of candidates which is likely to disperse the votes.</p>
<p>One Paris brokerage sees the CAC index gaining 10 percent if the conservatives win the two-round election -- the runoff is on June 1 -- and a loss of the same magnitude if the Left wins.</p>
<p>Shares in companies undergoing restructurings are seen as the biggest beneficiaries of a conservative victory, while defensive stocks are expected to outperform if the Socialists win.</p>
<p>Oil major Elf Aquitaine said its Financiere Valorgest and Sogapar subsidiaries will buy two million Elf shares, or 0.7 percent of the capital, sold by Axa subsidiary UAP-Vie.</p>
<p>Elf's stock, which rose on Thursday on news it would also buy back a 0.9 percent stake sold by Renault, climbed a further 0.82 percent to 618 francs.</p>
<p>Paribas signed a memorandum laying out plans to transfer Paribas Belgique to Groupe Bacob-Arco. Its stock was up 0.86 percent at 400.40 francs.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel shares were up 0.78 percent at 6.45 francs after the Intergovernmental Commission responsible for the Channel Tunnel authorised the resumption of its Shuttle freight service on Thursday evening after safety tests due to be completed by June 15.</p>
