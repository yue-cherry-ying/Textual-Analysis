<p>Italian investors plan to invest billions of dollars in eastern Europe in cooperation with Hungarian companies, Gabor Szeles, president of the Hungarian Industrialists Alliance (GYOSZ) said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is true that we got an opportunity for investments of $1 billion annually in eastern Europe,&quot; Szeles told the Hungarian Radio following his talks with the investors in Italy.</p>
<p>Szeles said the funds would finance projects, but he did not disclose who the Italian investors were nor that how many years were covered by the agreement.</p>
<p>Szeles said the investments were likely to be carried out in cooperation with GYOSZ.</p>
<p>&quot;This indicates that western investors' confidence in Hungary is very strong,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, visiting Hungary earlier this week, said that trade links between Hungary and Italy had grown substantially and urged more Italian companies to enter the market.</p>
