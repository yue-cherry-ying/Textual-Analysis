<title>RUSSIA: Russian MinFins track low US bonds, shrug off data.</title>
<headline>Russian MinFins track low US bonds, shrug off data.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Russian MinFin bonds were unaffected by what traders said were neutral U.S. unemployment statistics but eased earlier, tracking lower U.S. Treasuries and Brady bonds on Wednesday, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>			tranche   May 8		   May 7</p>
<p>    1999 maturity   (3)     86.20-86.50	   87.30-87.60</p>
<p>    2003 maturity   (4)     61.60-61.90	   62.50-62.80</p>
<p>    2008 maturity   (5)     43.60-43.90	   44.30-44.60</p>
<p>    2006 maturity   (6)     49.60-49.90	   50.10-50.40</p>
<p>    2011 maturity   (7)     37.90-38.20	   38.35-38.65</p>
<p>U.S. jobless claims were unchanged at 347,000 the week ending May 3 from the previous week, the U.S. Labor Department reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no impact as the figures are neutral. Prices eased in the morning as U.S. Treasuries closed lower yesterday and on weaker Bradies,&quot; Avtobank dealer Ivan Kuznetsov said.</p>
<p>MinFins and other emerging debt are sensitive to any news which would suggest a further rise in U.S. interest rates because this would push down U.S. Treasury bond prices.</p>
<p>On May 20, the U.S. policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets and it will be closely watched for possible changes to U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market had found support for the most actively traded third, fourth and fifth tranches at 86.20, 61.60 and 43.60, respectively.</p>
<p>They said selling was seen mostly from Western players, with Russian banks trading less because of a shortened trading session ahead of the May 9 Victory Day holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;Western banks were selling today as actively as they were buying before. It could be due to either profit-taking or correction after some days of rise on client interest,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
