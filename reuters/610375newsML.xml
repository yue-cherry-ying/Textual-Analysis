<p>Indonesia on Friday blocked a request by the European Union to set up a dispute settlement panel to look into whether Jakarta's &quot;national car&quot; project breaks World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, trade envoys said.</p>
<p>EU officials made the move at a closed-door meeting of the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body, where a country has the right to hold up the creation of a panel the first time it is sought.</p>
<p>Trade diplomats expect the 15-member EU to bring its complaint against Jakarta to the next WTO meeting set for June 25, when Japan could also formally make a second request.</p>
<p>Indonesia could not block a second request for a disputes panel to be set up, although a panel investigation into the complaint that could last into next year.</p>
<p>Indonesia's Halida Miljani told the meeting that Jakarta could not support establishment of a WTO dispute panel at this session and was discussing the possibility of a settlement with its partners, according to trade envoys.</p>
<p>Timor Putra Nasional, a joint venture controlled by President Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, and South Korea's Kia Motors , was granted tax and tariff breaks to build a national car early last year. The EU, Japan and the United States say the incentives discriminate against competitors.</p>
<p>EU Ambassador Ron Abbott said the car programme violated a series of rules regulating international trade -- the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMS) accord and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.</p>
<p>Indonesian measures included granting relief on import-duty for parts and components used to assemble motor vehicles in Indonesia, and local content requirements. They also gave exemption from luxury tax for certain categories of motor vehicles assembled in Indonesia and in certain third countries, he added.</p>
<p>The measures caused &quot;serious prejudice&quot; to the EU's interests &quot;in particular by displacing or impeding imports of Community motor vehicles, and of parts and components thereof, into the Indonesia market and /or by creating significant price undercutting, price suppression, price depression and or loss of sales for Community exports in that market,&quot; the EU said in a statement to the WTO.</p>
<p>The EU held bilateral consultations with Indonesia in November and December, but failed to reach agreement.</p>
<p>Japan's trade ambassador Nobutosi Akao supported the EU's request. He originally sought a WTO panel on April 30 and would renew the request if no proposal was forthcoming from Indonesia, he said.</p>
<p>In Brussels, the European Commission issued a statement on the Indonesian case as well as its recent request for formal consultations with Brazil on its car investment incentives -- the first step in the WTO dispute settlement process.</p>
<p>&quot;Both regimes are prime examples of government-mandated trade distortions, including incentives to investment coupled with very high protection of the domestic market and discriminatory trade practices which allow those companies investing locally to import their products under preferential conditions,&quot; the Commission said.</p>
<p>&quot;The measures taken by Indonesia and Brazil are particularly worrying because they constitute the first challenge to the disciplines of the TRIMS agreement,&quot; it added, referring to a WTO pact aimed against trade-restrictive measures such as local content requirements.</p>
<p>&quot;If unchallenged, they would create a precedent for other WTO partners wishing to develop their local automotive manufacturing base at the expense of European exporting interests&quot;,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Both MERCOSUR (the Southern Cone Common Market) and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) trade blocs harbour &quot;some of the most promising trade prospects for EU automotive manufacturers&quot;, according to the Commission.</p>
