<headline>BASEBALL-NATIONAL LEAGUE TEAM SKETCHES FOR 1997 SEASON.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Following are brief sketches of National League teams heading into the 1997 season starting on Tuesday (in order of last season's finish):</p>
<p>--- EAST DIVISION ---</p>
<p>ATLANTA BRAVES - Added game's premier leadoff hitter in Kenny Lofton. Traded away Marquis Grissom and David Justice and made room for young phenom Andruw Jones. Still boast one of the great pitching rotations of all time around core of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz.</p>
<p>1996 record: 96-66 (National League champions)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>MONTREAL EXPOS - Talent drain continues for small market team that has always struggled to compete within budget. Gone this year are starter Jeff Fassero, stopper Mel Rojas and outfielder Moises Alou, manager Felipe Alou's son. Bright hope is much heralded rookie outfielder Vladimir Guerrero. 1996 record: 88-74.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>FLORIDA MARLINS - May be league's most improved team. Hired former Pittsburgh manager Jim Leyland to run the club and fortified the lineup with Bobby Bonilla and Moises Alou. Added White Sox ace Alex Fernandez to impressive starting staff. 1996 record: 80-82.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>NEW YORK METS - Added John Olerud, one-time sweet swinging first baseman from Toronto who hopes to regain stroke. Need turnaround season from Carlos Baerga and help from young pitchers to make any headway.</p>
<p>1996 record: 71-91</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES - New manager in Terry Francona. Added</p>
<p>Danny Tartabull, Rico Brogna and Rex Hudler. Former stalwarts Darren Daulton and Lenny Dykstra hurting. Time for rebuilding. 1996 record: 67-95.</p>
<p>--- CENTRAL DIVISON ---</p>
<p>ST LOUIS CARDINALS - Added Delino DeShields as second baseman for a dash of speed. Ozzie Smith finally gone, leaving shortstop solely in the hands of Royce Clayton. Could repeat again in weak division if ageing stopper Dennis Eckersley has anything left.</p>
<p>1996 record: 88-74</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>HOUSTON ASTROS - Pulled broadcaster Larry Dierker out of the</p>
<p>booth and made him manager without any coaching or managing experience. Lost Brian Hunter, Orlando Miller and Todd Jones. Have had three successive runner-up finishes but need big pitching year to contend.</p>
<p>1996 record: 82-80</p>
<p>--- CINCINNATI REDS - Added Deion Sanders, Ruben Sierra. Lost</p>
<p>Eric Davis, Kevin Mitchell. Need strong pitching, including bounce back from injury by Pete Schourek, to threaten Cards. 1996 record: 81-81</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>CHICAGO CUBS - Added Mel Rojas and brought back shortstop</p>
<p>Shawon Dunston. Lost starter Jaime Navarro. Starting pitching is not good weakness to have in hitter-friendly Wrigley Field. 1996 record: 76-86</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>PITTSBURGH PIRATES - Gene Lamont is new manager. Added Kevin</p>
<p>Elster but lost Jay Bell, Jeff King, Carlos Garcia and Orlando Merced. Can't tell the players without a scorecard. --- WEST DIVISION ---</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO PADRES - Won first division title since 1984 last season. Added second baseman Quilvo Veras and lefthander Sterling Hitchcock. Lost Scott Sanders, Bob Tewksbury and Jody Reed. Inability to sign Japanese pitching star Hideko Irabu a disappointment. If Ken Caminiti bounces back from shoulder surgery to regain 1996 MVP form, Padres could repeat.</p>
<p>1996 record: 91-71</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES DODGERS - Bill Russell gets first full season as successor to legendary manager Tommy Lasorda. Added Todd Zeile at third. Lost Delino De Shields and Mike Blowers. Strong starting rotation featuring Hideo Nomo and Ramon Martinez keeps them in contention. International rotation may also feature Korean fireballer Chan Ho Park.</p>
<p>1996 record: 90-72</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>COLORADO ROCKIES - A Jekyll and Hyde team, extremely tough to</p>
<p>beat at home but tied for worst road record last year.</p>
<p>Basically unchanged but a healthy Dante Bichette and Larry</p>
<p>Walker could make an improvement.</p>
<p>1996 record: 83-79</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS - Team belongs to Barry Bonds but loss</p>
<p>of prime time slugger Matt Williams will cost in run</p>
<p>production. Infield underwent off-season face lift with</p>
<p>addition of Jeff Kent, Jose Vizcaino and J.T. Snow. Shaky</p>
<p>pitching keeps them at bottom.</p>
<p>1996 record: 68-94</p>
