<headline>NBA BASKETBALL-MIAMI HEAT'S PAT RILEY WINS COACH OF THE YEAR AWARD.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Pat Riley of the Miami Heat on Thursday was named 1996-97 NBA Coach of the Year, becoming the first coach in league history to win the award with three different teams.</p>
<p>In his second season as Miami's head coach, Riley guided the Heat to a franchise-best 61-21 record -- an improvement of 19 victories over the previous season -- and the club's first division title.</p>
<p>The Heat posted winning records for six consecutive months this season, including franchise-best 11-3 records in December and March on the way to finishing first in the Atlantic Division.</p>
<p>Riley won his first Coach of the Year Award with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1990 after not getting the honour despite guiding the team to four NBA championships in the 1980s.</p>
<p>He earned his second Coach of the Year nod with the New York Knicks in 1993.</p>
<p>Riley joins Don Nelson as the only coaches in NBA history to receive the honour three times. Nelson won twice with the Milwaukee Bucks (1983, 1985) and once with the Golden State Warriors (1992).</p>
<p>Riley received 69 out of a possible 115 votes in balloting by a panel of sports writers and broadcasters, easily beating out Charlotte's Dave Cowen for the award.</p>
<p>Cowens finished second in the balloting with 22 votes, with Utah's Jerry Sloan third with 13 votes. Eight coaches received at least one vote, the NBA announced.</p>
<p>&quot;When you win, people are going to recognise that and I'm flattered,&quot; Riley said at a news conference in Miami Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a lot of fun watching this team grow.</p>
<p>&quot;This has been a real special team for me because of some young players that have developed and some veteran players that have really sort of come back and played well, so it's a great experience.&quot;</p>
