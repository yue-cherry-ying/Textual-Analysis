<p>Rising floodwaters of the Red River burst through clay dikes on Saturday, swallowing more land, submerging hundreds of homes and forcing authorities to evacuate thousands more residents.</p>
<p>Sirens wailed throughout the night as authorities ordered mandatory evacuations in Grand Forks and across the river in East Grand Forks, Minn. Grand Forks Mayor Pat Owens asked for a voluntary evacuation of her entire city.</p>
<p>Heartbreak and frayed nerves tore at volunteers and emergency workers as more areas of the community disappeared beneath the muddy, murky waters.</p>
<p>&quot;I watched these young engineers today as some of the dikes were failing, and they actually sat down and cried... and that was where I just broke up,&quot; Owens told a news conference early Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Officials could not specify how many people had been displaced by the evacuations, but estimated that at least 10,000 were affected. There were no reports of serious injuries.</p>
<p>&quot;We're evacuating various parts of the city as they become more prone. Nobody's had time to actually sit down and count heads, but you can say at least 10,000,&quot; Grand Forks Police Lt. Dennis Eggebraaten said.</p>
<p>The situation was similar across the river in East Grand Forks, where authorities begged citizens to move to higher ground after the river overcame a clay dike and invaded most of the downtown commercial district.</p>
<p>Water surged over part of the Kennedy Bridge in East Grand Forks, which until Friday had been the only open link between the two cities. The North Dakota Highway Patrol reported Saturday that the bridge was closed to all vehicles except emergency traffic.</p>
<p>Running water in the streets caused authorities to evacuate most of downtown Grand Forks, and even the Emergency Operations Center in the Police Department was forced to move further inland. The Grand Forks water treatment plant also shut down, and citizens were asked to limit water consumption to essential purposes.</p>
<p>The threat of rising water forced several emergency shelters to close down, and evacuees were being shuttled to a larger shelter at the Grand Forks Air Force Base.</p>
<p>The floods, unleashed by the thaw of a record winter snowfall, have covered thousands of acres in the valley of the Red River along its flat and gently sloping course northwards toward Canada.</p>
<p>The Red River rose to 52.89 feet on Saturday at Grand Forks, nearly three feet above a record set in 1897 and more than 24 feet above flood stage.</p>
<p>The unpredictable floodwaters forced the National Weather Service to once again revise its crest forecast. The agency said it now expects the Red River to crest at 54 feet later (n)Saturday in Grand Forks.</p>
<p>Seventy-five miles upstream at Fargo, officials began building a back-up dike to fight water advancing over farm fields. They said 200 to 300 homes would wind up on the wrong side of the barrier and could be swamped.</p>
<p>The Red River in Fargo appeared to be holding steady at 39.53 feet, down from 39.8 feet Friday but but still more than 20 feet above flood stage.</p>
