<title>JAPAN: TIFFE euroyen slightly up following stocks' fall.</title>
<headline>TIFFE euroyen slightly up following stocks' fall.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Key December three-month euroyen deposit rate futures on TIFFE were slightly firmer at midday on Tuesday following a fall in Tokyo stocks and bank merger news.</p>
<p>The December ended the morning up 0.02 at 99.07. Turnover was 22,316.</p>
<p>&quot;Euroyen futures rose following the Nikkei's fall. However, most players were unwilling to trade actively before the release of the BOJ's 'tankan',&quot; said a city bank trader.</p>
<p>At midday, the Nikkei 225 stock average was down 361.64 points, or 2.01 percent, at 17,641.76, after falling as low as 17,529.05.  </p>
<p>Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Hokkaido Bank said on Tuesday they plan to merge in April 1998.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nippon Credit Bank (NCB) said its three non-bank financial affiliates had filed for bankruptcy at the Tokyo District Court.</p>
<p>The assorted news was positive for euroyen futures, underscoring the lingering problem of Japan's financial system, traders said.</p>
<p>Market participants, however, were cautious ahead of the release of the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) key quarterly &quot;tankan&quot; corporate survey on Wednesday, traders said.  </p>
<p>The December's gains were pared on profit-taking after it hit an intraday high of 99.10, as the key unsecured overnight call rate failed to fall substantially on Tuesday morning, traders said.</p>
<p>The BOJ injected 400 billion yen into the money market on Tuesday morning, supplying 300 billion yen more than the market needed to offset a fund shortfall for the second consecutive day.</p>
<p>The overnight call rate was traded at 0.55 percent shortly after the BOJ operation, but rose to 0.65 percent by late morning, money traders said.  </p>
<p>Fiscal year-end fund demand pushed the weighted average of the overnight rate to 0.72 percent on Monday, the highest level since September 1995.</p>
<p>Banks' preference for short-term funds was responsible for the higher overnight rate, traders said.</p>
<p>No new certificates of deposit (CDs) were issued on Tuesday morning. One-, two- and three-month CDs were all offered at 0.55 percent.</p>
