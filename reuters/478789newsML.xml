<title>COLOMBIA: Refugee crisis grows in northwest Colombia.</title>

<p>Hundreds more families are still fleeing from violence through the jungles of northwest Colombia, adding to a burgeoning refugee crisis in the town of Mutata, its mayor said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>At least 2,500 people arrived in a village close to Mutata, in the violence-torn Uraba region, over Easter and Mayor Luis Renteria said another 1,500, mostly women and children, were expected to arrive in the next few days.</p>
<p>The army has accused Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas of ordering the peasants to abandon their homes in the Rio Salaqui basin of neighbouring Choco province in order to create &quot;social disorder&quot; in the main towns of Uraba.</p>
<p>But a FARC spokeswoman said on Tuesday that the peasants had fled in the face of &quot;indiscriminate&quot; aerial bombardments by the army and threats from right-wing paramilitary groups.</p>
<p>&quot;Three thousand displaced people have already arrived in the village of Pavarando (near Mutata) and 1,500 more are still making their way through the jungle,&quot; Renteria told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;They say they will not return until they have guarantees from the government that paramilitary groups will be forced out of their communities,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Horacio Serpa and provincial governor Alvaro Uribe are scheduled to visit the refugees in Mutata on Wednesday. The British embassy in Bogota has offered Colombia emergency aid to help deal with the crisis.</p>
<p>Renteria said one-third of the refugees in Pavarando were children and more than 80 women, who spent up to four weeks walking from their homes along treacherous jungle tracks, were pregnant.</p>
<p>The human tide of refugees drew sharp criticism from army commander Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett, who said: &quot;The guerrilla strategy is to force these people to move out and occupy towns to create a huge social problem.&quot;</p>
<p>But a FARC spokeswoman told Reuters in a phone interview: &quot;We have been in contact with our people in the area and they say there has been intense fighting with the army. Because the army has not been able to wipe out the guerrilla it has staged indiscriminate aerial bombardments of the area.&quot;</p>
<p>Uraba, which covers parts of Choco, Antioquia and Cordoba provinces, is the scene of bitter conflict between the army and the guerrillas. The army says it is a key arms and drug smuggling route for the rebels while the guerrillas say right-wing forces are trying to force peasants out of the strategically important, resource-rich region close to the border with Panama.</p>
<p>There are an estimated 7,000 internal refugees spread across Uraba and more than 900,000 people have been displaced in the last decade by Colombia's long-running guerrilla war.</p>
