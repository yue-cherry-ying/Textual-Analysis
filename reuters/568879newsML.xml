<headline>New UK agency seen taking over food safety role.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>A new agency would take on responsibility for the safety of British food from the farm ministry under proposals in a report sought by new Labour Party Prime Minister Tony Blair that was published on Thursday.</p>
<p>Blair, when his party was in opposition to a Conservative government before his May 1 landslide election victory, had asked university professor Philip James for the report.</p>
<p>The James report was issued against a background of  alarm about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) or &quot;Mad Cow&quot; disease and concern that the farm ministry may be too sensitive to lobbyists for farmers and sections of the food industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Many national surveys reveal that the public has lost confidence in the safety of British food,&quot; James reported.</p>
<p>&quot;Secrecy characterises decision-making and inappropriate political and industrial interests are perceived to determine decisions on food safety to the detriment of public health and consumer interests,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The agency that James envisaged would report to parliament through the health ministry. He suggested it be called &quot;The Food and Health Commission.&quot;</p>
<p>A basic goal would be to reestablish public confidence in the way problems with food are handled within three years.</p>
<p>Besides BSE, Britons have been alarmed by an outbreak in Scotland of E.coli food poisoning that killed 20 people.</p>
<p>&quot;The escalating rates of food-borne infection bear witness to the unsatisfactory state of current food safety measures,&quot; James said.</p>
<p>He recommends that the new agency be established as a non-departmental public body, along the lines of the existing Health and Safety Commission/Executive. It should have consumer and other public interest involvement within its structure.</p>
<p>The agency's funding should be the responsibility of health ministers and it should report to parliament through them.</p>
<p>&quot;Other ministers, such as the minister of agriculture, however, will retain a substantial and legitimate interest in this policy area.&quot; James added.</p>
<p>He proposed a commission with about 10 members to oversee the agency.</p>
<p>James accepted that it is unlikely that the necessary legislation could be introduced before 1998-99. But he suggested that a cabinet committee could take the proposals forward.</p>
<p>&quot;As an interim measure elements of the agency, including the commission, could be formed rapidly, albeit in an advisory capacity,&quot; James said.</p>
<p>The food and drink manufacturers organisation, Food and Drink Federation, welcomed the recognition by the government of the importance of food safety.</p>
<p>&quot;The restoration of consumer confidence in the safety of British food and in the implementation of food safety regulations should be the overriding objective of food safety arrangements,&quot; the FDF said in a statement responding to the report.</p>
