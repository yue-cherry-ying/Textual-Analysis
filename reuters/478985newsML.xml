<p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) said on Tuesday its planned introduction of the Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system for financial institutions with accounts at the BOJ will include yen bond transactions.</p>
<p>The BOJ announced a framework on the introduction of the RTGS after gathering suggestions from the financial institutions since December, but the bank said it was still a &quot;skeleton&quot; plan that may need further adjustments.</p>
<p>The BOJ said given strong supports, it would, as planned, introduce the RTGS system by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Japanese government bond transactions would not be excluded, the bank said. They are currently settled once a day at 3 p.m. through checking accounts at the BOJ.</p>
<p>The BOJ's Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) system, under which JGB transactions are currently settled, only reduces a time gap between money transactions and delivery of the bonds.</p>
<p>The BOJ also said if a fund shortage occurred, it would provide liquidity by allowing overdrafts without interest payments, adding that there would be no limit for fund supply to each borrower for the time being.</p>
<p>The bank has said the biggest obstacle to the introduction of RTGS is that it would require more liquidity than the current system.</p>
<p>The RTGS would allow the financial institutions to settle transactions on a real-time basis, whereas under the current system transactions are settled at four specific points within a business day -- 9 a.m., 1 p.m., 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. -- through the accounts that the institutions have at the BOJ.</p>
<p>The current system is efficient as long as there is no bank failure. But once there are any defaults, all transactions would need to be halted, paralysing the entire system. -- Tokyo Treasury Desk +81-33432-8570</p>
