<p>The latest bout of selling to hit the Philippine Stock Exchange abated on Thursday but investors were still wary and the market's direction was hard to predict, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said the near-term outlook remained hazy as investors would rather wait for a more definitive buying trend before returning to the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is on a wild mood swing. We don't know where it is heading ... Nobody's an expert in this type of market,&quot; Valentino Bagatsing, vice president of RCBC Capital Corp, said.</p>
<p>He attributed the swings to the herd mentality among investors and fund managers, and not on any major change in economic fundamentals.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors were still in shock on what had happened to the stock market. Many of them were burned so badly that they decided to shy away in the meantime,&quot; Marco Lucena, an analyst at BNP Prime East Securities, said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the key index slipped 12.30 points, or 0.46 percent to close at 2,682.10 points after an initial selldown threatened to break the near-term support of 2,650.</p>
<p>Blue chip issues were mixed with oil refiner Petron Corp closing 20 centavos higher to 8.50 pesos and phone giant Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co up 10 pesos to 755 pesos, while Ayala Corp B dipped 25 centavos to 17 pesos.</p>
<p>Allan Araullo, vice president of Regina Capital Development Corp, said the buying support near 2,650 indicated a steadying of the market after reeling from an almost 18 percent fall last month.</p>
<p>The stock market spiralled downward since the start of April as fears of a collapse in property prices and a crisis in the banking industry spooked investors.</p>
<p>It rebounded earlier in the week, mainly due to technical buying, but skidded another 2.96 percent on Wednesday amid heavy volume.</p>
<p>Government officials have been vehement in their defence of the Philippine economy saying that fears of an overheated property sector and problem loans among banks were unfounded.</p>
<p>&quot;But the more we hear those denials, the more investors get nervous,&quot; Bagatsing added.</p>
<p>Analysts said strong first quarter gross national product (GNP) and gross domestic product (GDP) figures would finally put to rest any fear of an economic crisis. The figures are due out later in the month.</p>
<p>Many analysts were not expecting spectacular growth in the first quarter this year, but remained hopeful that the GNP would still attain the government's full-year target of seven to eight percent.</p>
<p>A possible interest rate increase in the United States on May 20 would have a short-term effect on the market, they said.</p>
