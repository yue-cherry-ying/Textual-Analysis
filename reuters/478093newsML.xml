<title>USA: IMM currency futures close higher, yen paces rise.</title>
<headline>IMM currency futures close higher, yen paces rise.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Key IMM currency futures closed higher, paced by an accelerated afternoon rally in yen.</p>
<p>Traders linked the yen surge to fundamentals including comments from U.S. officials overnight and during pit-trading hours, as well as crosses and technicals.</p>
<p>Yen, which shook off a brief kneejerk fall to the day's low during the early morning, recovered and continued ratcheting upward in spotty trade marked by spurts of fund buying and powered by occasional buystops, floor brokers said.</p>
<p>The unit penetrated various technical barriers during its runup, including $0.008235 or 122.78 spot.  </p>
<p>June yen crossed more-critical resistance at $0.008285 or 122.00 spot and at $0.008300 or 121.80.</p>
<p>The rise lost power at $0.008335 or 121.35 and where some expected that yen sellers might enter, floor brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It ran out of steam and (traders feared) you could start to see good selling,&quot; said one floor broker of the reason the yen rise stalled. &quot;It's also overextended.&quot;</p>
<p>Yen also gained ground from afternoon remarks by U.S. Treasury secretary Robert Rubin, who said it was important that Japan's recent progress in cutting its trade surplus not be reversed.  </p>
<p>His remarks, although not viewed by analysts and brokers as new, served to fan trade-tension jitters reignited overnight by remarks by U.S. House speaker Newt Gingrich.</p>
<p>He warned Japan against adopting &quot;predatory export&quot; policies to solve its economic problems.</p>
<p>Talk also circulated that Wednesday's release of the Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan survey will reveal more economic strength than originally expected, brokers said.</p>
<p>Some also said rumors have intensified since last week's U.S. rate hike that Bank of Japan might be poised to tighten credit soon, added Lisa Finstrom, analyst, Smith Barney.  </p>
<p>Finstrom also tied part of yen's morning move up, which helped tug already-firm marks and Swiss francs upward versus the dollar, to position-squaring on the mark cross near Europe's close and heading into the March national purchasing manager's index.</p>
<p>NAPM rose to 55.0 versus forecasts for 53.6 from February's 53.1, but price component fell to 50.9 from 55.1.</p>
<p>June yen settled up $0.000144 at $0.008322, marks rose $0.0040 to $0.6040, Swiss francs added $0.0043 to $0.6999, pound rose $0.0140 to $1.6526, Can dollar off $0.0022 at $0.7237, Aus off $0.0006 at $0.7850,Mpeso off $0.000050 at $0.122275.
