<p>One child was killed and four were hurt when a bomb they found on an army shooting range in Turkey's southeast province of Erzurum exploded after they took it home, the state-run Anatolian news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>It said the children found the bomb near their house in Pasinler township. Four-year-old Fedia Ogurce died and four other children in the family, aged between six and 12, were badly hurt and taken to hospital.</p>
<p>Anatolian said security officials had begun to search houses in the township after rumours that other children had picked up bombs from the shooting range.</p>
<p>More than 22,000 people have been killed in over 12 years of fighting between government troops and Kurdish rebels seeking self-rule in the mainly Kurdish southeast.</p>
