<headline>Med oil products mixed, arbitrage proves linchpin.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Mediterranean oil products were mixed on Thursday, some holding firm, others softening.</p>
<p>Gasoline continued firm with recent demand from the East Med and West Africa leaving avails fairly tight.</p>
<p>NYMEX unleaded prices rallied on short covering triggered by technicals and talk of refinery problems in the U.S. Gulf. The effects were muted in Europe by public holidays.</p>
<p>Eurograde cargoes firmed $1 to $206 a tonne cif.</p>
<p>Naphtha softened with weaker Far East likely to kill off arbitrage and start a fresh build in supplies. Losses were limited by stronger afternoon crude and gasoline futures.</p>
<p>Traders said over-supply was pushing Asian naphtha down, shutting the Far East arbitrage. Around 750,000 tonnes has gone to Asia since the arbitrage window from Europe opened in March.</p>
<p>Fuel oil business has been active in recent days, with bunker demand in Las Palmas being satisfied, Italian high sulphur barrels sold and fresh cracked material offered. The market was now long and interest slim, dealers said.</p>
<p>A U.S. major sold into Las Palmas at high cif + $3 on Tuesday, traders said. The Italian barrels held by an Anglo-Dutch major were sold privately and a Spanish refiner offered cracked material in both the north and the south.</p>
<p>One percent markets were boosted by higher Asian and U.S. prices but the big buyers was unwilling to buy at the higher levels reached by swaps.</p>
<p>Gas oil premiums came under pressure from better supplies because there is no longer an Asian arb opportunity, but losses were limited by stronger IPE futures. Russian 0.2 pct material was now pegged between high fob +$1-1.50. Italian 0.2 pct was holding on to high fob +$2-3.</p>
