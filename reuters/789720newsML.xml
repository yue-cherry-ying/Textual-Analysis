<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan to shut African offices.</title>
<headline>Taiwan to shut African offices.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-08-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Taiwan said on Saturday it was considering closing three unofficial outposts in Africa, despite the diplomatically isolated island's desire to seek recognition in the international community.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to effectively and carefully utilise our limited diplomatic sources, the Foreign Ministry is considering to temporarily close several overseas representative offices that have limited functions,&quot; the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>It would close the unofficial representative offices in Libya, Nigeria and Congo.</p>
<p>Taiwan currently has diplomatic ties with only 30 countries -- mostly poor states in Latin America and Africa dependent on the wealthy island for economic succour.</p>
<p>It has 10 allies in Africa, but South Africa, Taiwan's biggest diplomatic ally, has said it would switch ties to Beijing from Taipei by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Beijing, rival with Taipei since a civil war split them in 1949, considers Taiwan a renegade province not entitled to foreign relations.</p>
<p>Taiwan maintains unofficial relations with most other countries, including vibrant trade links with economic powers such as the United States, Japan and even mainland China.</p>
<p>Taiwan severed unofficial ties with Cambodia in July, recalling its representatives from Phnom Penh and ordering closure of Cambodia's Taipei office.</p>
<p>Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen on July 22 ordered the closing of Taiwan's office, alleging illicit Taiwanese aid to the royalist forces of co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh during bloody fighting in early July.</p>
<p>Taipei has denied complicity in Cambodia's political turmoil and laid the blame for the row squarely with communist China, saying Beijing was calling the shots in Phnom Penh and now was widening its long-time diplomatic embargo of Taiwan to non-official spheres.</p>
