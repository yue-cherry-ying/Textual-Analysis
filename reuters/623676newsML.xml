<p>John Sengstacke, publisher of Chicago's black-owned Defender newspaper who crusaded for desegregation in all phases of American life has died, his friends said Thursday.</p>
<p>The Georgia-born Sengstacke, 84, died Wednesday after spending several weeks in the hospital.</p>
<p>Sengstacke was given numerous presidential appointments including one from Harry Truman in the 1940s to help undo the segregation of black soldiers in the armed forces.</p>
<p>He took over the Chicago Defender after the 1940 death of his uncle, Robert Abbott, who launched the paper that became one of the main voices that lured millions of southern blacks to factory jobs in northern cities. The paper, with circulation at one time of 200,000 copies making it the largest black newspaper in the country, was distributed throughout the South by black railroad porters.</p>
<p>Sengstacke crusaded for black equality in housing and employment, and managed to get Defender reporter Harry McAlpin into the White House as the first black correspondent to cover the presidency.</p>
<p>Sengstacke joined Paul Robeson in a meeting with Brooklyn Dodgers owner Branch Rickey and baseball's commissioner that ultimately led to Jackie Robinson breaking the sport's colour barrier in 1947.</p>
<p>He founded an organisation of black publishers that became the National Newspaper Publishers Association.</p>
<p>Sengstacke provided a solid foothold in Chicago's black community for white Chicago political boss Richard J. Daley but refused when Daley asked him to help prevent violence when rioting broke out in the city during the summer of 1967.</p>
<p>The Chicago Sun-Times said he told the mayor that black leaders had &quot;been giving you suggestions for two years, and you've been ignoring them. And now you want me to create a miracle.&quot;</p>
<p>Daley's son and current Mayor Richard M. Daley said in a statement, &quot;I am deeply saddened by the death of my friend, John Sengstacke.&quot;</p>
