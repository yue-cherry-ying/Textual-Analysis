<headline>Overnight guilders higher as market finds its feet.</headline>

<p>Dutch money market players were still finding their feet on Friday after the Dutch central bank introduced a new set of money market instruments, dealers said.</p>
<p>The new range of instruments -- introduced to bring Dutch money market practice into line with other European countries ahead of monetary union -- came into effect today.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems like a busy market, but there's more asking than real trade going on,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade came on stream rather late, as market players first wanted to see what the allocation was like,&quot; another said.</p>
<p>The central bank allocated 3.84 billion guilders to the money market this morning, under a new seven-day special advances pact at an unchanged rate of 2.90 percent.</p>
<p>Call money edged higher to trade between 3.25 and 3.75 percent, up from 3.06 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The allocation seems reasonable to me, so I guess the higher overnight rate can be put down to unfamiliarity with the new situation,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Additional paper work linked with the new monetary instruments, causing some parties to have uneven positions, added to upward pressure on call rates, one dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said trade focused on call money and deposits up to one month. One month-deposits were quoted at 3.12/20 percent bid/ask, unchanged from Thursday.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry's Agent no longer gave an indicative price for Dutch Treasury Certificates (DTCs) maturing in June.</p>
<p>&quot;We've reached the maximum amount of 7.5 billion guilders in the June one yesterday, and will not reopen it -- unless we first buy some of it back, which is unlikely,&quot; an Agency official said.</p>
<p>Dealers said there had been some brisk business in DTCs on Thursday, notably in the June programme.</p>
<p>The Agent set indicative prices for the July DTC at 3.13 percent, versus 3.17 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We've collected so much this week that, on the short term, we no longer feel the urge to steer the public treasury...these are quite defensive prices,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;It also depends on what we've already collected under the programme....we often announce a new DTC at the end of the month,&quot; he added.</p>
