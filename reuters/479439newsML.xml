<p>Embattled Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda moved to win public support on Tuesday with a proposal to push his government's budget through parliament despite a threat to his own political survival.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda's United Front alliance said it was confident of getting the budget for fiscal 1997/98 (April-March) approved, either before the vote of confidence he must face by April 11 or soon afterwards, by proposing a special session of parliament.</p>
<p>The 10-month-old centre-left ruling coalition was plunged into crisis on Sunday when Congress president Sitaram Kesri withdrew his party's crucial support for Deve Gowda and staked a claim to form his own government.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we owe it to the country not to force an economic crisis,&quot; said Sitaram Yechury, a member of the United Front's decision-making Steering Committee representing the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M).</p>
<p>&quot;This government has generated unprecedented enthusiasm in the country for coalition politics. People will not forgive us if politicians hold the economy to ransom for their narrow ambitions. I am confident the budget will be passed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Politicians said Sunday's crisis had prompted hectic parleys, with all major parties holding meetings to find a solution without resorting to a premature election.</p>
<p>India held a general election in April and May last year.</p>
<p>Congress, seeking to take power from Deve Gowda if he loses the vote of confidence, said the budget could be amended before it is passed.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not see any problem in passing the budget with minor amendments,&quot; Congress spokesman Ved Prakash said. He did not say what changes Congress wanted.</p>
<p>The rightwing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) insisted on taking the confidence vote before the budget.</p>
<p>&quot;The budget would not be possible before the confidence vote,&quot; BJP spokesman K.R. Malkani told Reuters. &quot;I don't see how Congress or the BJP will agree with that.&quot;</p>
<p>BJP president L.K. Advani sought a formal meeting of political parties to discuss the United Front's proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;Let them convene a meeting. Let them do it properly,&quot; Advani told Reuters.</p>
<p>The BJP, saying it expected mid-term polls to follow next week's confidence vote, expressed its preference for Deve Gowda as the head of a caretaker government instead of Kesri. The BJP regards Congress as its chief electoral rival.</p>
<p>&quot;Let them (Congress) expose themselves thoroughly, then elections will become inevitable,&quot; a senior BJP official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We would rather have Deve Gowda as interim prime minister than Kesri. Incidentally, Deve Gowda has never attacked us personally,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The United Front's proposal to try to press ahead with the investor-friendly budget spurred Bombay's 30-share index, which added 2.3 percent before easing following the BJP statement.</p>
<p>In late trade, the index was up 1.59 percent.</p>
<p>President Shankar Dayal Sharma asked Deve Gowda on Monday to face a vote of confidence in parliament by April 11.</p>
<p>United Front spokesman Jaipal Reddy said the government would ask the speaker of the lower house, P.A. Sangma, to determine if Congress and the BJP could agree to pass the budget before the test vote, saying minor amendments would be allowed.</p>
<p>The United Front controls only 178 seats in the 545-member Lok Sabha. Congress, which finished second in last year's elections, had reluctantly shored up the government with its 140 deputies since June.</p>
<p>The BJP and its allies have 194 deputies.</p>
