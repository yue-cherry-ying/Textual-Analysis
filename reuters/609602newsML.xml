<p>A new storm lashed coastal Bangladesh on Friday, hampering disaster relief efforts just days after a cyclone killed at least 105 people and made more than one million homeless, officials said.</p>
<p>Strong winds and heavy rain blasted Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar resort and nearby islands in a lower-key rerun of Monday's devastating storm.</p>
<p>Unofficial sources put the feared death toll from the cyclone at nearly 1,000 with hundreds of fishermen still missing in the Bay of Bengal. Sources also reported some deaths from diarrhoea, which was spreading among those left homeless.</p>
<p>Officials said Friday's 75 kph (45 mph) storm swept areas still recovering from the cyclone, duming nearly 80 mm (three inches) of rain on and around Cox's Bazar and adding to the miseries of thousands of families sleeping outside.</p>
<p>The high winds blew away many houses which were being rebuilt following Monday's storm, they said.</p>
<p>Nearly 150 fishermen missing at sea for four days returned to their island homes on Thursday night, but the fate of 600 others were still not known, fishing community leaders said.</p>
<p>&quot;We only hope they all would come back,&quot; said Kabir Ahmed, leader of Mechanised Fishing Boats Association in Cox's Bazar.</p>
<p>Residents of Cox's Bazar and islanders told reporters that the most affected areas had been without relief supplies till Thursday and that electricity was still out.</p>
<p>The state-run Dainik Bangla newspaper said on Friday that 14 people had died as diarrhoea spreads in cyclone-battered areas.</p>
<p>Health officials in Chittagong declined to confirm the deaths but said around 400 medical teams had been deployed in coastal areas to try to prevent disease.</p>
<p>&quot;After giving first aid to cyclone victims they are now mainly working against disease,&quot; said Dr. Mazharul Islam, deputy civil surgeon of Chittagong.</p>
<p>Unofficial sources said on Friday that about 10,000 people had contracted diarroea and at least 15 had died. Hospitals in Chittagong and Cox's Bazar had received about 1,000 patients suffering from diarrhoea since Monday, doctors told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;Scattered incidents of diarrhoeal attack are very common in many areas during this time of the year,&quot; one Chittagong hill official earlier said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are not very health conscious and they sometimes drink water from derelict sources and eat rubbish (which cause the disease),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jawadul Karim, press secretary to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, told reporters on Thursday that 105 people had so far been confirmed dead after the cyclone,</p>
<p>He put the number of people affected at nearly 2.5 million, most of them made homeless. Karim said about 10,000 people were injured and more than 600,000 houses damaged.</p>
<p>The U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs in Geneva said on Wednesday the cyclone had killed at least 200 people. Officials in the stricken areas earlier put the death toll at least 121.</p>
<p>Low-lying Bangladesh is prone to devastation from cyclones. The country's worst storm in 1991 killed at least 138,000 people and left millions homeless.</p>
<p>The government said it had been been conducting a massive relief operation backed by navy vessels and airforce helicopters.</p>
<p>On Thursday it asked for international help to build more cyclone shelters in coastal areas to minimise deaths from future storms.</p>
<p>&quot;We have told the international community that we need help for building 2,000 more shelters in cyclone prone areas,&quot; Foreign Secretary Farooq Sobhan told a news conference in Dhaka.</p>
