<p>Leading Republican senators said Monday that proposed legislation would reduce the threat of chemical weapons regardless of whether the Senate approves an international treaty outlawing such weapons.</p>
<p>The legislation, seen as an alternative to the Chemical Weapons Convention, sets penalties within the United States for possession of chemical and biological weapons and requires U.S. sanctions against against other countries using such weapons.</p>
<p>A statement by six senators, including Foreign Relations Chairman Jesse Helms, said &quot;the legislation takes practical steps toward achieving the goal of ending the chemical weapons threat, irrespective of whether or not a resolution of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention might be crafted to make that treaty more effective.&quot;</p>
<p>Helms opposes the treaty, but indicated last week that he would be willing to allow a Senate vote on the pact.</p>
<p>&quot;There'd be no problem with it (the treaty) if we can continue to negotiate as we have been for the last few days,&quot; Helms said during an appearance with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Wingate, North Carolina, Helms's home state.</p>
<p>The administration made a concession related to the chemical treaty last week when it agreed to seek the Senate's two-thirds majority approval of amendments to other arms control treaties.</p>
<p>Helms had linked such action to progress on the chemical weapons treaty.</p>
<p>In their statement on the Republican legislation, Helms and five other senators said: &quot;This bill is the best thing we can do to protect our country and the world from the horrors of chemical and biological weapons.&quot;</p>
