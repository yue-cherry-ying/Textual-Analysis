<p>The 1970 World Cup semifinal in which Italy dramatically beat West Germany 4-3 was voted the best World Cup match ever played in a poll of 50 of the world's greatest players.</p>
<p>The poll, published in the weekly magazine of the French sports newspaper L'Equipe on Saturday to mark the one-year countdown for the start of the 1998 World Cup in France, included votes from Pele, Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer, Alfredo Di Stefano and Bobby Charlton.</p>
<p>Although Charlton was in England's 1966 World Cup-winning team, he was one of 12 who chose Brazil's win over Italy in the 1970 final as the best World Cup match ever.</p>
<p>Between them the 50 panelists, who also included Michel Platini, Stanley Matthews, Eusebio and Zico, played a total of 454 World Cup matches, and made 102 appearances in the final itself.</p>
<p>Each player was asked to name the best three World Cup games ever played and Italy's match against West Germany, which took place in the Aztec Stadium in Mexico City on June 17, 1970, topped the list with 50 points. Thirteen players voted for that match, including five who played in it.</p>
<p>The 1970 World Cup Final, played in the Aztec Stadium three days later and which ended with Brazil beating Italy 4-1, was second with 40.5 points, and the 1982 second round match in which Italy beat Brazil 3-2 in Barcelona, was voted third with 34.0 points.</p>
<p>Fourth was the 1982 semifinal in which West Germany beat France on penalties after they drew 3-3 and fifth the 1966 World Cup Final in which England beat West Germany 4-2.</p>
<p>Pele who played in Brazil's 1958 and 1970 World Cup winning teams, opted for another match he played in as the greatest ever: Brazil's 1-0 win over England in Leon in the opening round of 1970. His second choice was the 1958 final in which Brazil beat Sweden 5-2, and in which he, as a 17-year-old, scored twice.</p>
<p>His third choice was a surprising one -- the 1966 game between Portugal and Brazil which he was kicked out of and which ended in a 3-1 win for the Portuguese.</p>
<p>Beckenbauer, the only man to captain and then coach a side to victory in the World Cup and who famously finished the 1970 semifinal with his arm in a sling after dislocating his shoulder, voted for that game as the greatest played. His second choice was the 1966 final in which he was on the losing side and his third was the 1954 quarter-final in Lausanne in which hosts Switzerland beat Austria 7-5.</p>
<p>The 1970 semifinal was a truly remarkable game which at one time appeared to be heading for an unremarkable finish.</p>
<p>Italy had gone ahead in the seventh minute through Roberto Boninsegna and had defended resolutely until almost the very last kick of the match deep into injury time when Karl-Heinz Scnellinger equalised for West Germany to force extra time.</p>
<p>Five minutes later the Germans went ahead through Gerd Muller, but five minutes after that Tarcisio Burgnich made it 2- 2. Another goal quickly followed when Luigi Riva put Italy 3-2 ahead after 104 minutes, only for Muller to score five minutes later with his 10th goal of the tournament to make it 3-3.</p>
<p>The Germans had hardly stopped celebrating when a minute later Italy finally clinched the game. With 111 minutes on the clock golden boy Gianni Rivera scored the sixth goal in a 21-minute burst to make the final score 4-3.</p>
