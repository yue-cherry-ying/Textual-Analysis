<p>Hong Kong action film star Chow Yun-Fat and &quot;Lone Star&quot; director John Sayles will participate in the Toronto International Film Festival's &quot;Dialogues: Talking with Pictures&quot; series, organizers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The &quot;Dialogues&quot; series consists of acclaimed filmmakers and performers introducing films that have strongly influenced them.</p>
<p>It is the third year the series has appeared at the festival, which runs from September 4-13.</p>
<p>Sayles, who received an Oscar nomination for writing &quot;Lone Star&quot;, is presenting Mario Monicelli's &quot;I Compagni&quot; (The Organizer). The film tells the story of a union activist in turn-of-the-century Turin, Italy.</p>
<p>&quot;Men With Guns&quot;, Sayles' latest film, has already been confirmed as a gala presentation at the festival.</p>
<p>Action star Chow will present &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; as his part of &quot;Dialogues&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Watching this film (was) one of the most memorable experiences of my lifetime,&quot; Chow said in a statement. The Hong Kong film legend is best known in North America for his work with &quot;Face/Off&quot; director John Woo on such films as &quot;The Killer&quot;.</p>
<p>Canadian director Guy Maddin will also participate in the program, presenting &quot;The Devil Doll&quot;. The film stars Lionel Barrymore as an unjustly imprisoned financier who avenges himself by shrinking people to doll size and forcing them to kill and torment his enemies.</p>
<p>Maddin's latest film, &quot;Twilight of the Ice Nymphs&quot;, will be screened at the festival.</p>
<p>Other participants in the program include Mexico's Jaime Humberto Hermosillo and Iceland's Fridrik Thor Fridriksson, and documentary filmmakers Errol Morris and Chris Hegedus. Sally Potter, D.A. Pennebaker and James Toback will round out the lineup.</p>
