<p>Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman on Tuesday called on U.S. authorities to give permanent residence to thousands of Nicaraguans who have lived illegally in the United States for more than seven years.</p>
<p>&quot;Many Nicaraguans have more than seven years in the United States with excellent conduct who now deserve their residency according to U.S. immigration laws,&quot; Aleman said in a live interview on CBS-Telenoticias.</p>
<p>Aleman's call for permanent residency for these Nicaraguans, many of whom fled its civil war in the 1980s, followed a special last-minute reprieve on Monday as a U.S. federal judge delayed the scheduled April 1 implementation of tough, new immigration laws.</p>
<p>The reprieve, however, was later lifted by another court after the Justice Department appealed the stay.</p>
<p>(Correction adds overnight court decision that followed Justice Department appeal).</p>
<p>Aleman said the 60,000 Nicaraguan nationals in danger of deportation will have until July to legalise their status under a special agreement with the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Aleman said Central America's foreign ministers met with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Tuesday and assured them there would be no &quot;deportations, not in drops, not en masse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The people of Central America can rest easy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He warned that a mass deportation of Central Americans would be devastating to the region's economies and political stability, and said the U.S. government must not turn its back on the region now that its civil wars are over.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. government must think of how to avoid the enormous problems that such a disturbance, such a destabilisation could mean to our democracies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Aleman said Central America's presidents would discuss the immigration issue with President Bill Clinton when he visits San Jose, Costa Rica, in early May.</p>
<p>The feared deportations of thousands of Nicaraguans living illegally in the United States would sink the country even deeper into poverty, economists said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Aleman, Nicaragua's Catholic Church and economists said that Nicaragua, with 50 percent of its work force unemployed or underemployed and 70 percent of its population in poverty, was not prepared to receive these deported Nicaragans.</p>
<p>At his Easter mass, Nicaragua's powerful Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo said the most damaging result would be the loss of the incoming money these people send to support their families in Nicaragua.</p>
