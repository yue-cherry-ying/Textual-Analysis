<title>RUSSIA: Russian PGMs still steeped in secrecy, unlike gold.</title>
<headline>Russian PGMs still steeped in secrecy, unlike gold.</headline>

<p>Russia has lifted the veil of secrecy from its gold market, but extending similar transparency to the even more opaque world of platinum group metals (PGMs) will be slower and more painful, industry analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Reformist economist Grigory Yavlinsky lifted the lid on the Russian gold industry in 1991 when he announced to shocked bullion watchers that reserves were only 240 tonnes -- way below Western expectations and a fraction of the 2,000 or so tonnes piled up in Soviet coffers back in 1953.</p>
<p>&quot;When information first started to come out about Russian gold (in 1991), there was talk that within a year similar disclosures would be made about PGMs,&quot; said Andy Smith, precious metals analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland in London.</p>
<p>&quot;We still have not had this information, and you could take it from this that it will take a few more years to come out.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said that Russia's secretive approach to its PGM policy was not at all surprising.</p>
<p>&quot;Wouldn't you be secretive if you produced nearly two thirds of the world's palladium?&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Its strategy came under close scrutiny this year, when the world's largest palladium producer and second biggest platinum supplier after South Africa stopped exporting PGMs.</p>
<p>This left consumers in Japan, the world's biggest palladium buyer, scrambling for alternative sources, forcing prices sharply higher. Palladium is a rare metal used in cellular telephones and catalytic convertors in car engines.</p>
<p>Pandemonium on the precious metals market quickly translated into a growth industry for people guessing and second-guessing the reasons for Russia's failure to deliver.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose at least we can thank Russia for supporting such a burgeoning industry,&quot; Smith said.</p>
<p>A popular theory was that a battle for control over the country's lucrative PGM sales to hard currency markets was behind the delays, with the central bank seen as a rival to the existing sole PGM export agent, Almazjuvelirexport (Almaz).</p>
<p>Russian officials denied the rumours all along, saying the delays were caused by changes in the cabinet and problems with passing the 1997 budget, a theory some Western analysts support.</p>
<p>&quot;There are more important things going on in Russia than PGM policy,&quot; Smith said. &quot;Until we come out of the other side of macro economic change, Russian precious metals will carry a high risk premium.&quot;</p>
<p>Russian PGMs could remain a mystery to the outside world for some time. Unlike gold, power is concentrated in very few hands.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a greater degree of independence in the gold market than in platinum and palladium,&quot; said Raj Kohli, metals analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London. &quot;With PGMs there is only Norilsk and one government agent.&quot;</p>
<p>Giant metals group Norilsk Nickel  NKEL.RTS is the dominant producer of palladium and platinum, and Almaz the government's sole export agent.</p>
<p>That is not to say that Norilsk and Almaz always see eye to eye on PGM policy.</p>
<p>Norilsk wants a greater say in marketing its precious metals, and eventually hopes to be able to export them directly, rather than selling to Almaz. But officials said the ultimate aim could be a long time in coming.</p>
<p>&quot;It is still not definite that our final aim will be met, because Almaz speaks for the government in these matters. We are still not sure to what extent our plans will be realised,&quot; said Norilsk spokesman Anatoly Komrakov.</p>
<p>In the meantime Norilsk wants to collect the 400 billion roubles the government owes it for precious metals already sold. It also wants a greater role in pricing PGM sales to the government, Komrakov said.</p>
<p>Western analysts have said that Almaz pays only about 80 percent of the world market value for Norilsk's PGMs.</p>
<p>There are signs that Russia's PGM policy, in the short term at least, may be returning to some semblance of normality.</p>
<p>On Wednesday an Almaz official said he understood the long-delayed PGM export quota decree had at last been signed, allowing talks with Japanese trade houses to resume soon.</p>
