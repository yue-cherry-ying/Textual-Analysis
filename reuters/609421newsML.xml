<title>USA: Hydro Magnesium has no plan to hike US tag.</title>

<p>Hydro Magnesium, part of Norway's Norsk Hydro A/S, said despite Friday's announcement of a hike in European pure magnesium prices, there were no plans to raise tags in North America.</p>
<p>Robert Edgar, Hydro Magnesium's vice president of marketing, said the company's European primary metal list price had lagged behind its North American prices and there was a need to narrow the gap.</p>
<p>Friday, Hydro raised its European producer price to 5.55 DM per kilogram from 5.40 DM a kilo. The alloy magnesium price was left unchanged at 5.40 DM a kilo.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hydro's European price is still below its North American price.</p>
<p>Officials at U.S. based Dow Magnesium were not immediately available to say if the company would be changing its European prices.</p>
<p>Asked if U.S prices would be hiked, Edgar replied: &quot;It's always under review, but our first focus is on Europe. Until we can get Europe in line with North America, it does not make sense.&quot;  </p>
<p>Edgar said the magnesium market had tightened up quite a bit, with a surprise fall in first quarter production in the West.</p>
<p>First quarter magnesium shipments were the best ever at 79,800 tonnes, the International Magnesium Association reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>Inventory at the end of the quarter was down 5,400 tonnes at 36,700 tonnes, and Western production fell 9,500 tonnes in the first quarter to 55,700 tonnes.</p>
<p>Edgar said Hydro was exporting some pure magnesium to the U.S. &quot;It's not great amounts,&quot; Edgar said.  </p>
<p>The company operates a production plant in Canada, and its bulk shipments to the U.S. is magnesium alloy for auto parts.</p>
<p>The U.S. countervailing duty on Canadian pure magnesium has been cut recently to 4.48 percent from 7.6 percent, with a recent review indicating a preliminary duty of 3.18 percent.</p>
<p>The final review's outcome is due by August, Edgar said.</p>
<p>There are no dumping duties on Canadian pure magnesium imports into the U.S.</p>
