<headline>Calif. electric utilities file to issue securities.</headline>
<dateline>LOS ANGELES 1997-05-07</dateline>

<p>California's three major investor-owned utilities have asked the state's Public Utilities Commission to approve their plan to issue up to $7.3 billion of &quot;rate reduction bonds,&quot; documents showed Wednesday.</p>
<p>The securities are a key element of the state's plan to deregulate its electricity industry while allowing traditional monopoly utilities to recover investments made under the existing regulatory framework.</p>
<p>The bonds will lower the carrying costs on a portion of the utilities' &quot;stranded costs&quot; by spreading out the recovery over the 10-year life of the bonds. Stranded costs are investments such as nuclear power plants which are unlikely to be profitable under market competition.</p>
<p>The utilities plan to transfer the assets which will back the securities to special entities so that the bonds will be &quot;bankruptcy remote.&quot;</p>
<p>Issuance of the securities through the state infrastructure bank is expected to begin in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The bonds are structured to enable the utilities to meet requirements for a 10 percent rate cut for small business and residential customers in the state between January 1, 1998 and March 31, 2002.</p>
<p>PG&amp;E Corp's Pacific Gas and Electric Co applied to issue up to $3.5 billion in bonds, while Edison International's Southern California Edison Co is seeking approval to issue up to $3.0 billion and Enova Corp's San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co will issue up to $800 million in the new securities.</p>
<p>Actual issuance amounts are expected to be slightly below the requested amounts.</p>
<p>Each of the utilities said they intend to use net proceeds from the bond financing to reduce their capitalization, with the cuts roughly equal to current debt and equity ratios.</p>
<p>California state Treasurer Matt Fong on Wednesday announced the appointment of Lehman Brothers as the co-senior manager for the sale of $6 billion in rate reduction bonds this year.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley will join Lehman in handling the PG&amp;E and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric securities, while Salomon Brothers will help manage Edison's portion.</p>
<p>Revenues to repay the bonds will come from separate, nonbypassable charges to be levied on the utilities' existing customers.</p>
<p>The actual amount of the charges -- which will show up as a special item on electricity bills -- will be determined by the Public Utilities Commission later this year.</p>
