<p>U S West Media Group is in talks to sell its Minnesota cable properties to cable system operator Charter Communications Inc., sources familiar with the negotiations said Friday.</p>
<p>The potential deal, which has a reported valued of about $600 million, was first disclosed in Friday's Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>U S West acquired the Minnesota cable properties last year when it purchased Continental Cablevision. Charter Communications is privately held.</p>
<p>The cable properties lie in and around Minneapolis/St. Paul and are part of MediaOne, the new name for U S West's Continental Cablevision unit.</p>
<p>Officials at U S West Media, MediaOne, and at Charter Communications declined to comment on the possible deal.</p>
<p>Federal law currently prohibits a company from owning both cable and phone operations in the same geographic region.</p>
<p>As such U S West Media faces a regulatory-imposed deadline of August 15 to sell its Minnesota properties because they overlap with the phone operations of U S West Inc., through its separate U S West Communications Group unit.</p>
<p>U S West Communications provides local phone services in 14 states, including Minnesota. Englewood, Colo.-based U S West Inc is the holding company parent of both companies.</p>
<p>The MediaOne unit's Minnesota operations now serve 290,000 customers, a spokeswoman for U S West Inc said. In total, MediaOne has about five million subscribers in 19 states, making it the third largest U.S. cable operator, she said.</p>
<p>Charter Communications offers cable services in 18 states. Earlier this year its subscriber count surpassed the one million mark, making it among the top 12 U.S. cable operators.</p>
<p>St. Louis-based Charter Communications has grown agressively through acquisition since its founding in 1993. It has reportedly received more than $2 billion in equity financing from backers including Toronto-Dominion Bank and New York-based buyout firm Kelso &amp; Co., among others.</p>
<p>There had been widespread speculation that U S West Media would dispose of the Minnesota properties as part of a larger deal to restructure its cable partnership with Time Warner Inc., which has dragged on for a year and a half.</p>
<p>Officials at the two companies have said they do not expect a settlement in this larger deal until later this year.</p>
<p>But analysts said the need to reach an agreement on the Minnesota cable business by August has put pressure on U S West to find an alternative buyer like Charter Communications.</p>
<p>If a deal is reached, Minnesota would not be contiguous with any of Charter's existing cable properties, which lie mainly in California, the Southeast United States and several Central States, including Illinois, Kansas and Missouri.</p>
