<title>CHINA: SWIMMING-CHINA'S LE JINGYI TO FOCUS ON NATIONAL GAMES.</title>
<headline>SWIMMING-CHINA'S LE JINGYI TO FOCUS ON NATIONAL GAMES.</headline>
<dateline>BEIJING 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Chinese swimming sensation Le Jingyi will focus on the Eighth National Games in October rather than the World Short Course Swimming Championships this month, the China Sports Daily said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The World Short Course Swimming Championships, for me, will be a warm-up for the National Games in Shanghai in October,&quot; the newspaper quoted Le as saying. The World Short Course Swimming Championships will be held in Sweden this month.</p>
<p>Le took China's only gold in the swimming pool at the Atlanta Olympic Games last summer in the women's 100 metres freestyle and won silver in the 50 metres freestyle.</p>
<p>&quot;I am the fastest swimmer at that distance (50 metres), but I felt quite depressed about my performance in Atlanta.&quot;</p>
<p>She still holds the world record for the 50 metres.</p>
<p>She said she hoped to take part in the Sydney Olympics.</p>
<p>&quot;If I am able to take part in the next Olympic Games in Sydney, I will try to take the gold,&quot; she was quoted as saying. &quot;But who knows what will happen next, as the Sydney Games are still three years away.&quot;</p>
