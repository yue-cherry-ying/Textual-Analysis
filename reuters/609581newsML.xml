<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Dutch shares swung a touch higher in late session as a higher Wall Street opening injected some enthusiasm into a lacklustre market.</p>
<p>The AEX index of leading shares finished up 3.12 points at 803.96, back from a high of 804.98, after spending most of the day hovering around 802 points.</p>
<p>Dealers said that while underlying sentiment was firm, a lack of major corporate or macro-economic data coupled with the upcoming market holidays in New York and London had kept most players sidelined.</p>
<p>Many stocks looked to be trading on old news, dealers said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market thinks the Vedior issue will prove very lucrative, and that's why they're getting into Vendex now,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Among the smaller caps, builder BAM BAMNc.AS shrugged off news of its failed bid to merge with unlisted sector rival Wilma, adding one guilder to 125.50 after it said it was maintaining its forecast of a return to the black in full-year 1997 with profits of at least 20 million guilders.</p>
<p>Shipping and marine construction group IHC Caland rose 3.30 guilders to 104.80, after a recent heavy seller exited the market and bargain hunters stepped in.  </p>
<p>Semiconductor equipment maker ASM Lithography surged strongly in brisk trade, adding 7.30 guilders to 97.30 on news broker Merrill Lynch had reiterated its buy rating.</p>
<p>&quot;ASM is a very volatile stock anyway,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
