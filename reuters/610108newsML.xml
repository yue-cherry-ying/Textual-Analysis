<p>The dollar debuted lower against the mark and yen in U.S. trade on Friday after sticking to relatively narrow overseas ranges ahead of a long holiday weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;I still think we're in the exhaustion mode after the breathtaking move down in dollar/yen,&quot; said Bob Near, vice president on the corporate foreign exchange desk at Bank of New York. &quot;The holiday here and in London on Monday is just a prescription for a do-nothing market.&quot;  </p>
<p>Currency traders said the market was likely to become largely illiquid after midday. PSA The Bond Market Trade Association has recommended an early 1400 EDT/1800 GMT close for debt markets on Friday.</p>
<p>The big mover overnight was the Australian dollar, which tumbled over a full U.S. cent after a cut in official Australian interest rates.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia surprised the markets by chopping 0.5 percentage points off the official cash rate, the fourth cut since last July, pushing the rate to 5.5 percent -- its lowest level since August 1994.  </p>
<p>The Australian dollar began trade in the U.S. at $0.7665/75, down from $0.7770/75 at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>The greenback debuted at 115.68/73 yen against 116.10/15 on Thursday, and at 1.6924/27 marks, down from 1.6940/50.</p>
<p>Remarks from key Japanese Ministry of Finance official Eisuke Sakakibara, who was interviewed in French newspaper Le Monde, did little to shake the dollar out of its overseas torpor.</p>
<p>Sakakibara, known as &quot;Mr Yen&quot; for his past influence on currency markets, said that a rise in Japan's discount rate should be expected by the end of the year.  </p>
<p>&quot;The discount rate is currently very low. If it rises by 0.50 percent, it will be at 1.0 percent, which remains low. A move on such a scale should be expected in the coming year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also noted, however, that he did not believe the Bank of Japan would would raise the rate before it was sure of a solid economic upturn.</p>
<p>&quot;If anything, I think it confirms that a rate hike is unlikely anytime soon,&quot; said Marc Chandler, senior currency analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think the bottom line is the comments suggest that Japanese officials are out trying to stabilize the dollar,&quot; he added. &quot;They're happy with it here.&quot;</p>
<p>Chandler said the thin pre-holiday trading conditions could make for more volatile conditions on Friday and predicted further dollar strength in the near-term, shrugging off market talk of solid offers near 116.50 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the upper end of where the dollar has been and it makes sense for people to think there's selling up there but we could go through that chart point and accelerate,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;It does represent a hitch for the dollar but I think we'll get past it in the next day or two.&quot;</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the dollar dipped to its overseas lows against the mark in European trade after Bavarian May consumer prices rose a larger-than-expected 0.5 percent month-over-month.</p>
<p>Sterling also recovered above $1.63 on Friday after sinking Thursday on talk that Bank of England Governor Eddie George -- a market favorite -- might not be reappointed at the end of his five-year term next year.</p>
<p>The pound opened at $1.6305/15, up significantly from Thursday's close of $1.6237/42. The dollar retreated to 1.4070/40 Swiss francs by the open, from 1.4145/55 and began relatively unchanged at Canadian $1.3729/34 versus C$1.3730/35 on Thursday.</p>
