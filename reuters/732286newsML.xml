<p>This December's scheduled global warming conference in Kyoto, aimed at setting targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions in over 170 countries, is shaping up more like a rugby scrum than a unified push to save the planet.</p>
<p>With moral support from both the United States and Australia, Japan went public on Wednesday with grievances over the European Union's proposal for a blanket 15 percent cut by 2010 from 1990 emissions levels.</p>
<p>&quot;We have, certainly, several problems with this type of proposal,&quot; said Hironori Hamanaka, a senior official at the Environment Agency and Japan's point man on the greenhouse gas issue.</p>
<p>In a speech in Tokyo on Wednesday, Hamanaka stopped short of saying Japan would ask the EU to retract its proposal, but said the plan could cause serious problems at the Kyoto discussions.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't think it would be realistic to expect that the other parties can agree upon, and also can implement, this ambitious target.&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hamanaka pointed out that the EU proposal allowed its own member states to set different numerical targets for emission reductions on a country-by-country basis, with the overall EU decrease amounting to 15 percent.</p>
<p>Portugal, for example, would be allowed a 40 percent increase in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels, with increases allowed also for Spain, Greece, Sweden and Ireland.</p>
<p>Non-EU conference participants, meanwhile, would be subject to the 15 percent decrease on a blanket basis, Hamanaka said.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't think this is equitable or fair treatment (for non-EU countries),&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Australia, which exports some 65 million tonnes of coal to Japan each year, has shown a keen interest in the numerical target Japan sets for emissions reduction.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been very active in expressing our views with the Japanese at very high levels, from the prime minister down, and we happen to see eye-to-eye with the Japanese on the EU proposal,&quot; said a senior official with the Australian embassy in Tokyo who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Japan, whose recent efforts to lift a ban on the ivory trade and resume commercial whaling have cast a dark cloud over its reputation as a protector of the environment, has also been hard pressed to take a leadership role on greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>Although it will be hosting the Kyoto conference, its position has been undermined by domestic turf battles between the environment and trade ministries.</p>
<p>But the two ministries have faced increasing pressure from Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in recent weeks to harmonise their views ahead of the December conference, following a flurry of international criticism.</p>
<p>Both Japan and the United States were dealt verbal blows by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who, after back-to-back environment talks last month at the Denver G7 summit and the United Nations Earth Summit, took the two nations to task for failing to pinpoint specific emissions reduction targets.</p>
<p>Hamanaka said neither Japan nor the United States would have a numerical target ready for the next round of climate talks, scheduled to begin in Bonn on July 31.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to find agreement within the Japanese government, it may take some time. Perhaps sometime in the fall of this year would be the most likely time to announce targets,&quot; Hamanaka said.</p>
<p>&quot;But very, very intensive discussions will be necessary,&quot; he added.</p>
