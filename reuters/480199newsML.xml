<p>New car sales in France fell 21 percent in March, the third consecutive monthly drop, from inflated year-earlier levels, the French carmakers association CCFA said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sales fell to 151,586 units from 191,942 in March 1996.</p>
<p>For the first three months of the year, car sales in France were down 26.5 percent, it said in a statement. They fell 24.6 percent in February and 33.6 percent in January.</p>
<p>&quot;The (March) results, while an improvement over recent months, show the market suffers from the sales pulled forward by the car rebate incentives,&quot; the CCFA said.</p>
<p>Orders surged ahead of the expiry last September of a year-long state rebate scheme as buyers rushed to take advantage of discounts. But sales and orders have slumped since then.</p>
<p>CCFA chairman Yves de Belabre told a news conference he expected sales to improve in coming months, but the market would show a full-year drop of between 10 and 11 percent to around 1.9 million units.</p>
<p>His forecast is in line with those of the French carmakers, Renault SA and PSA Peugeot Citroen.</p>
<p>Belabre said the distorting effects of the rebates were starting to ease. The slow growth of the French car market, which has not recovered the 1989-1992 sales levels of more than two million units, suggests many old vehicles are due for replacement. &quot;That's why we're reasonably optimistic,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Last month's fall also reflected the fact that there were 20 business days, compared with 21 in March 1996. On a comparable basis, the sales drop was 17.1 percent, the CCFA said.</p>
<p>Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen took 55.4 percent of the market in March and foreign carmakers had 44.6 percent.</p>
<p>Renault's new car sales fell 23.3 percent, giving it a 28 percent market share. Sales of the PSA group, which makes Peugeot and Citroen cars, fell 25.1 percent, leaving it with 27.4 percent of the French car market last month.</p>
<p>Of the foreign car makers, Volvo was the only one to show a gain. Its sales rose 9.6 percent but its market share is only half of one percent.</p>
<p>Mercedes, Volkswagen and the Japanese carmakers showed sales declines of less than five percent.</p>
<p>GM, Ford and Fiat and BMW-Rover showed double-digit sales declines.</p>
