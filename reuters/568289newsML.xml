<p>Separatist Jacques Parizeau, weighing into a Canadian election campaign set ablaze by a report that he had planned to unilaterally declare Quebec independent in 1995, denied on Thursday that this had been his intention.</p>
<p>The newspaper Le Soleil on Wednesday printed excerpts from his memoirs, which it said showed that as Quebec premier he had planned to rapidly lead the French-speaking province out of Canada if the separatists had won a sovereignty referendum in 1995.</p>
<p>Federalist politicians jumped all over the remarks, saying they showed that the separatists could not be trusted. Separatists campaigning for the June 2 election distanced themselves from the report, but Parizeau said on Thursday it was all a lie.</p>
<p>&quot;The assertion by journalist Michel Vastel in Le Soleil on Wednesday to the effect that, contrary to everything I had said and everything I had been committed to, I would have proclaimed sovereignty in the days following a referendum, is more than a falsehood, it's a lie,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;I regret that such a lie provoked such a commotion and challenge whoever to find in the pages of the book 'For a Sovereign Quebec,' which I will launch on Monday, a sentence implying that I would have acted that way.&quot;</p>
<p>The furor over Parizeau's real intentions in 1995 has damaged the separatists, who have vowed to hold referendum after referendum until they win.</p>
<p>&quot;I deeply believe that Quebeckers deserve the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,&quot; Prime Minister Jean Chretien declared on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>He used the excerpts to justify his Liberal government's controversial decision to go to Canada's Supreme Court to rule on the legality of a unilateral declaration of independence.</p>
<p>Conservative leader Jean Charest, a rival of Chretien's in the federal election campaign but united with him in the goal of keeping Canada united, had asked: &quot;How much can you really trust what the sovereigntist leaders are telling you?&quot;</p>
<p>The excerpts put in question the sincerity of the Bloc Quebecois slogan &quot;Parole de Quebecois&quot;, meaning &quot;The word of a Quebecker&quot; or &quot;trust us&quot;.</p>
<p>Quebec has always had a hard core of separatists, but also many &quot;soft sovereigntists&quot; who want more power for Quebec but are uneasy about breaking away from Canada altogether.</p>
<p>Vastel stood by his interpretation of the excerpts.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not the liar. Parizeau is. I have his book in my brief case,&quot; he told the Quebec City radio station CJMF.</p>
<p>The excerpts describe advice Parizeau got from Valery Giscard d'Estaing as French president in January 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;It was necessary, he (Giscard) said in essence, in the hours or days that followed a Yes vote in the referendum, that Quebec undertake a solemn gesture to declare sovereignty.</p>
<p>&quot;Without that, no rapid recognition by a foreign country, that is to say in the week or 10 days to follow, would be possible,&quot; the excerpts published in the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The excerpts quote him further as saying it was fine to try to negotiate a partnership with Canada as promised, but France would not recognize an intention, only a country.</p>
<p>In Vastel's accompanying article, he quoted the book further: &quot;One week before the referendum of 1995, the operation meant to end up with the recognition of Quebec by France had been engaged.&quot;</p>
<p>Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe, who had earlier said this was bad news both for the separatist movement and for his party, said later that he was satisfied with Parizeau's explanation.</p>
<p>The issue was certain to stay alive in the coming days.</p>
<p>For his book launch, Parizeau is to meet reporters in Montreal on Monday and Quebec City on Tuesday, the very days the sole debates of the campaign are to be held.</p>
