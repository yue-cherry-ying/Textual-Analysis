<p>The Czech National Bank  (CNB) on Friday apparently won its latest battle against an attack on the crown, but analysts said the war was not over and speculators would return sooner or later.</p>
<p>The CNB, for the second consecutive day and fourth time in the past week, intervened directly on the market after speculators in London pushed the crown more than five percent below the midpoint of its dollar/mark basket.</p>
<p>The counter-attack pushed the crown to a month high of 0.8 percent below parity in the basket, which the central bank uses to fix the crown's exchange rate daily.</p>
<p>Analysts said the intervention had succeeded with surprising ease, costing only an estimated $200-300 million -- a small sum in the fabulously expensive business of fending off currency speculators.</p>
<p>The CNB is estimated to have spent $2-3 billion in direct intervention alone in the week-long battle for the currency, made vulnerable by a soaring balance of payments deficit and a sharp slowing in Czech economic growth.</p>
<p>The CNB doggedly refuses to devalue the crown, once considered the most stable currency in post-communist central Europe, and analysts said it may have broken the spirit of speculators, at least in the short-term.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a shortage of Czech crowns in London, and all of those with short positions into next week are likely to be sweating. It looks like the speculators may have lost this round,&quot; said Pavel Pinkava of Nomura International.</p>
<p>&quot;(It) seems as though there may be no sense in fighting this now. They (speculators) can always come back in a couple of months' time once they have licked their wounds,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Speculators can make spectacular profits by selling a vulnerable currency short and buying back to cover their positions after a devaluation. The most notable such attack forced sterling out of the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992.</p>
<p>The CNB used a mix of intervention and interest rate tools to support the crown as speculators pushed it to record lows against the basket.</p>
<p>It has raised its Lombard lending facility to 50 percent from 14 percent, its repurchase rate to 75 percent from 12.9 percent, and cut off non-residents from Czech money markets, all with the hope of easing pressure on the crown.</p>
<p>Dealers said that while the threat of speculative selling remained, the CNB's actions on Friday showed it was willing to stand up for the crown, and may have won a battle for the currencies of eastern Europe, not just the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>&quot;This was the first real currency battle in eastern Europe, and if the Czech crown falls, no doubt others would have been targeted,&quot; said another London-based trader.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they have broken the back of a lot of speculators with this one,&quot; added another Prague-based dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>But analysts said the CNB, with limited reserves and few effective options at its disposal, does not have much room to manoeuvre if the attack resumes after London and New York return on Tuesday from a long weekend.</p>
<p>Some added that any easing of rates next week might tempt speculators to try to force a widening or elimination of the fluctuation band within which the CNB fixes the currency, a key part of Czech currency management since the fall of communism.</p>
<p>&quot;They can't afford to keep rates as high as they are, so at some point rates will ease and people will pile back in 'to have a go' at the crown,&quot; said one trader at a German bank in London before the intervention.</p>
<p>&quot;The war is obviously not over, but they (the CNB) really have done an excellent job this week, especially when you consider they were the first to face this in the region,&quot; said Nomura's Pinkava.</p>
