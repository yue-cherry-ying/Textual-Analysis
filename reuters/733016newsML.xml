<text>
<p>Pakistan on Wednesday decided to hold a long-delayed census of the fast-rising population.</p>
<p>A government statement said Pakistan's fifth population census would be held between October 18 and 31.</p>
<p>Pakistan's population, growing at an estimated 2.77 percent a year, is officially put at around 135 million against 84 million recorded in 1981.</p>
<p>A census was due in 1991 but was postponed several times because of law and order problems in the southern province of Sindh and bad weather.</p>
<p>Punjab province, the most populous, had expressed fears the other three provinces could over-count their populations and undercut Punjab's share of federal jobs and funds.</p>
<p>Legislators in the tense southwestern province of Baluchistan feared the predominantly Pushtun refugees from neighbouring Afghanistan, many of whom carry local identity cards, could be counted as Pakistanis.</p>
<p>Pakistan was host to more than three million Afghan refugees at the height of the 14-year civil war in Afghanistan. Most returned home after the mujahideen guerrillas took power there in 1992.</p>
