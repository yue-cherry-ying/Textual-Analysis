<p>President Bill Clinton plans to meet with the Dalai Lama on Wednesday despite China's strong objections, White House officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The officials said the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled leader, will meet with Vice President Al Gore at his White House offices and Clinton will make a &quot;drop-by visit.&quot;</p>
<p>The White House uses the drop-by technique as a diplomatic gambit that allows the president to show support for a controversial visitor while saving some face for the foreign government that objects to the visit.</p>
<p>Clinton used it just last week when Hong Kong democracy leader Martin Lee paid a call in another event that stirred Beijing's wrath, and he has met this way before with the Dalai Lama, whom China considers politically provocative.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dalai Lama is always a welcome visitor to the White House,&quot; one administration official said. &quot;He is a respected spiritual leader.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As the leader of hundreds of thousands of Buddhists, including many Americans, we appreciate his contributions and welcome his visit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In a move that would soften Chinese sensitivities to the visit, Chinese Foreign Minsiter Qian Qichen is due in the United States on Sunday and will meet with Clinton.</p>
<p>His talks are expected to include preparations for a summit in Washington in the fall between Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his peaceful campaign for Tibetan autonomy, has been in exile since an abortive 1959 uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Nick Burns, discussing plans by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to meet with the Tibetan leader, said: &quot;We see the Dalai Lama as obviously a person of high moral authority, someone who deserves the respect of ... people around the world.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he expected talks with Albright will not &quot;be on political issues as much as religious issues because that seems to be the point of greatest concern here.&quot;</p>
<p>In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai voiced his government's objections to any meeting between top U.S. officials and the man China claims is not a religious leader but a political activist trying to divide the country.</p>
<p>&quot;We resolutely oppose any meetings between U.S. leaders and the Dalai Lama,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Beijing last year issued a warning that countries whose leaders meet with the Dalai Lama would suffer the consequences in its trade and business ties with China.</p>
<p>Washington has been trying to improve relations with Beijing, particularly as it attempts to expand trade and open the country to U.S. business interests.</p>
<p>Clinton has lately walked an especially fine line in his dealings with China, in part because of allegations Beijing funnelled money illegally into Democratic Party coffers during Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign. China denies the charges.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama last visited Washington in September 1995. Clinton met with him briefly in Gore's office then too.</p>
<p>China, which has occupied Tibet since 1950, administers it with a heavy military presence. The Dalai Lama has proposed that China have military and diplomatic control of Tibet, but allow Tibetans to govern themselves.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama also plans to meet with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and Democratic leaders of Congress.</p>
