<p>Finnish bonds were expected to track German Bunds slightly lower at the start on Friday but trade was seen quiet particularly ahead of the weekend since U.S. markets will be closed on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>The 2006 bond yield was quoted at 6.19 percent ahead of the open, keeping the gap over Germany steady at just below 30 basis points.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the spread will be steady there, but it is so narrow if it were to go lower, profits would be taken,&quot; one dealer said.  </p>
<p>The 2006 bond closed yielding 6.16 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market was also expected to be calm, but some operators said there were pressure on all mark crosses to rise. The markka traded at 3.0160 per mark early.</p>
<p>&quot;All crosses look bid at the moment ... DEM/FIM could test 3.03 soon,&quot; one interbank forex dealer said.</p>
