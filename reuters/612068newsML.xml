<p>The turbulent political currents lapping the banks of the River Congo have left smugglers and dugout canoe paddlers busier than ever.</p>
<p>Officially the river border has been closed since Laurent Kabila's rebels toppled Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko at the weekend, but neither in the capital Kinshasa or in Congo's capital Brazzaville can anyone stop the traffic.</p>
<p>&quot;It is busier than ever, this is the only way that anyone can travel at the moment,&quot; said Everiste Somba, the foreman of a canoe fashioned from a single tree trunk.</p>
<p>After a seven-month war Kabila proclaimed himself president and said he would change Zaire's name to the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>Congo, whose president Pascal Lissouba was close to Mobutu, on Friday noted the change of power across the river and said it was ready to support the efforts of the new authorities there to promote democracy.</p>
<p>Slithering down a steep and muddy cliff in Brazzaville a constant stream of porters carrying sacks and crates passes a similar trail coming the other way.</p>
<p>Security forces would not dare show their faces at the Brazzaville terminal, in the opposition Bakongo stronghold, where militiamen with AK-47s carry out a cursory customs inspection for a fee.</p>
<p>Travellers are registered in the militia's exercise book, for which another fee, but definitely no rubber stamp.</p>
<p>&quot;You can feel absolutely safe once you are registered, if anyone tried to rob you then we would deal with them,&quot; assured one militiaman.</p>
<p>Paddles driven deep into the Congo take the canoe way upstream, past bathers and women washing clothes, to allow for the current which sweeps down the river -- less than three km (two miles) across at its narrowest point.</p>
<p>Only from inside the canoe, just above the surface, does the scale of the traffic appear. Muscular boatmen reaching high into the air are silhouetted in an almost unbroken line against the horizon.</p>
<p>The only sound is the plunging of the paddles into the current, stirring a stream of froth from the ale-coloured water and pushing aside drifting clumps of water hyacinth.</p>
<p>The only exhaust fumes come from the marijuana cigarette of paddleman Francois Wazikanda.</p>
<p>&quot;Towards Zaire we go with rice and flour, then from the other side we bring back beer, clothes and little luxuries and at the moment petrol,&quot; said Wazikanda.</p>
<p>Wazikanda brought senior members of Mobutu's government out on his canoe as the rebels moved into the city at the weekend, and then went back to the landing point to pick up their families.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very good business, they paid very well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Free trade on the river stretches over 1,600 km (1,000 miles) into Africa's forested heart and existed long before rival colonial powers founded Kinshasa and Brazzaville in the 1880s.</p>
<p>Journalist turned explorer Henry Morton Stanley founded Leopoldville, later renamed Kinshasa, on behalf of Belgian King Leopold II at the lowest navigable point of the river before rapids that lead to the Atlantic.</p>
<p>His French rival Pierre de Brazza planted the tricolour on the north bank.</p>
<p>The colonialists brought often barbarous methods to exploit the supposed riches of the interior, but neither their new rules nor any government since have been able to effectively control the river trade.</p>
<p>Since the rebel takeover in Kinshasa the traders have pushed their landing point as far as a nearby road skirting foreign embassies in an exclusive residential area.</p>
<p>Taxis wait for the surge of goods which, since the takeover, have no other way of entering the country.</p>
<p>Not a rebel soldier is to be seen, nor a customs official.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't worry about the rebels, they haven't disturbed us yet and we know they could never stop us,&quot; said Somba. &quot;The river is too big&quot;.</p>
