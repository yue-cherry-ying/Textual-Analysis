<p>NWE oil products all fell by at least $1 a tonne on Friday in calm trading ahead of a long weekend in the U.S. and Britain, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gasoline was particularly quiet with buyers and sellers at a standoff, quoting $209/$211, down from yesterday's high eurograde trades at $212 fob Rotterdam.</p>
<p>June swap offers came down $1 to $210.</p>
<p>Heating oil barges were off about $2 a tonne, mainly due to IPE future losses. Premiums were also slightly weaker, a reflection of poor physical buying. Offers were at June IPE +$2 fob Rotterdam for prompt or +$1.50 for first half June delivery.</p>
<p>High sulphur fuel oil barges was slow to fall, offered at an unchanged $82/$82.50 fob Rotterdam. However, two deals were concluded at $80 and later offers were down $1 at $81.</p>
<p>Initial indications suggested weak bunker demand.</p>
