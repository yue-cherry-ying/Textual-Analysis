<p>Broker Wilson HTM Ltd said it had recommended Petroz NL as a buy investment based on the oil and gas explorer's participation in the Timor Sea's potentially-rich oil exploration programme.</p>
<p>&quot;Buy Petroz. The recent Kakatua North discovery confirms our view the potential for further oil discoveries in ZOCA 91-12 is under-rated,&quot; Wilson's resources research director Phil Hutchings said in a report.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a number of other prospective structures nearby which we believe will ultimately result in oil production well beyond the four to five years currently envisaged,&quot; Hutchings said.  </p>
<p>Hutchings said the company's estimated nine percent share of the Bayu-Undan gas condensate field in ZOCA 91-12 was due for a revaluation. The ZOCA permits are shared between Australia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>&quot;Our valuation places a value on all Petroz' assets, including exploration assets and cash, of between A$1.15 and $1.45 per share,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hutchings said of this, the nine percent in Bayu Undan was valued at between A$90 million and $120 million, or between 45 cents and 61 cents per share.  </p>
<p>Hutchings forecast Petroz net profit for the current year ended June 30, 1997 to be A$4 million compared with a net profit of $6.3 million in the 1995/96 year.</p>
<p>Petroz' share price was A$1.11 when the report was prepared and was five cents lower at A$1.08 at the end of Tuesday morning trade.</p>
