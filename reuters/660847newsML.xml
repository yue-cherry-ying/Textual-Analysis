<p>Britain's health and education policies have failed to stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and the rise of teenage pregnancy, an expert complained on Friday.</p>
<p>Gonorrhoea, AIDS and other diseases were still widespread among the young, proving that trying to protect children by withholding facts did not work, Michael Adler of the University College London medical school said in a commentary in the British Medical Journal.</p>
<p>&quot;The Health of the Nation has so far failed to deliver,&quot; Adler wrote, referring to the then-Conservative Party government's 1992 health push.</p>
<p>&quot;New cases of gonorrhoea among homosexual men have not shown a rapid decline,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;Genital herpes, warts and chlamydial infections also show no decline in homosexual men and heterosexual men and women.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The total number of newly reported cases of AIDS and HIV infection continues to rise, with substantial increases in 1996; new cases of HIV infection are particularly common in young homosexual men.&quot;</p>
<p>He said &quot;family values&quot; did not protect children but in fact allowed them to remain ignorant and become pregnant or infected.</p>
<p>&quot;Attempts to withhold information on  the basis of a particular agenda of family values and morality have resulted in large numbers of people not protecting themselves against sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancy,&quot; Adler wrote.</p>
<p>Being squeamish about advertising condoms helped no one, he argued.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the highest teenage rate of conception and termination in Europe, illustrating the failure of our education programmes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The high level of sexually transmitted diseases among young people, some homosexual men, and ethnic minorities, and such high rates of teenage pregnancies, are indicators of both the failures and the way forward.&quot;</p>
