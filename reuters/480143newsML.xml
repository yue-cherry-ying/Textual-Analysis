<p>French glassmaker Saint-Gobain, which is a key player in a planned merger between utilities company Lyonnaise des Eaux and holding group Cie de Suez, expects to boost net profit by at least 20 percent in 1997, its chairman Jean-Louis Beffa said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He was speaking at a briefing on the company's 1996 results published in January which showed a 2.6 percent gain in net attributable income to 4.32 billion francs ($767.9 million).</p>
<p>&quot;The total increase in Saint-Gobain's net result will be at least 20 percent,&quot; Beffa said.</p>
<p>Beffa also called on Suez, in which Saint-Gobain holds 6.3 percent, to pay out some 10 percent of its 34 billion francs in financial assets ahead of merging with Lyonnaise des Eaux.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to say that out of the 34 billion francs in financial assets, a distribution of around 10 percent to shareholders would not seem shocking to me,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Suez investors had been let down by the company's disastrous property lending and was now facing new risks as it refocuses as a utilities company by merging with Lyonnaise des Eaux, he said.</p>
<p>He added that &quot;all calculations show that Suez is worth around 340 to 350 francs&quot; per share. Suez was trading around 287.50 francs around midday on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Beffa added that Saint-Gobain would reduce its holdings in its group of stable shareholders, which include Suez, utilities firm Cie Generale des Eaux, bank Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) and insurer Axa-UAP.</p>
<p>Asked by reporters whether that disposal plan included the Suez stake, he said &quot;Yes&quot;. Asked how much of Suez he would sell, Beffa said, &quot;a reasonbable proportion.&quot;</p>
<p>Newspaper Le Monde reported Saint-Gobain would halve its stake but a Saint-Gobain spokeswoman declined to confirm the figure.</p>
<p>Saint-Gobain is unwinding its cross-shareholdings with other French firms, as part of a strategy of viewing them purely as financial investments, Beffa said. Only the stake in lens-maker Essilor was not under review, as Saint-Gobain regards it as an industrial investment, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We must have a vision of profitability&quot; on share cross-holdings, Beffa told analysts. The group would reduce its stakes this year, he added.</p>
<p>Saint-Gobain joins the list of big French companies, including Elf-Aquitaine and Alcatel Alsthom, keen to realise profits on shares held as part of a pact of cross-shareholdings, which have served as a defence against hostile take-overs.</p>
<p>The rise in share prices on the Paris Bourse over the last year offers scope for capital gains.</p>
<p>Shares in Saint-Gobain were down 3.5 percent at 822 franc at 1145 GMT, while the CAC-40 Paris blue-chip index was down 3.04 percent.</p>
