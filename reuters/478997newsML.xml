<p>Asian stock markets generally declined on Tuesday as traders reacted negatively to a sharp drop in U.S. share prices and their own domestic problems.</p>
<p>On Wall Street, the Dow industrials plunged 157 points or 2.33 percent to 6,583 on Monday on mounting concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve would follow last week's interest rate hike with more of the same.</p>
<p>The Dow's sharp decline, unofficially the sixth-largest in history, followed a 140-point skid on Thursday.</p>
<p>In those parts of Asia where stock markets were closed on Friday and Monday for the Easter holiday, Tuesday's session was the first chance local players had to react to Wall Street's tumble, analysts said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was battered by declines in interest rate-sensitive property and banking stocks.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index closed down 460.13 points or 3.67 percent at 12,074.19 points.</p>
<p>&quot;The rate hikes were well discussed but still everybody is panicky about the outlook,&quot; said James Robertson, vice-president at Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the Nikkei average closed down 133.81 points or 0.74 percent at 17,869.59, as traders reacted to renewed worries about Japan's financial system as well as to the U.S. market decline.</p>
<p>Nippon Credit Bank Ltd (NCB), which is working out a restructuring plan, said on Tuesday that three non-bank financial affiliates had filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>&quot;Every time such news appears, it creates fears among investors about how much more bad debts Japanese banks hold,&quot; said Keiko Kondo, a strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.</p>
<p>Wall Street's drop also hit markets in Australia, New Zealand, Manila, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Australia's All Ordinaries Index plummeted 2.9 percent or 70.1 points to close at 2,352.2 on Tuesday, but brokers said thin volumes and a lack of institutional selling would likely limit losses.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no sign of panic,&quot; said HSBC James Capel institutional adviser David Irons.</p>
<p>In Wellington, share prices ended sharply lower, with the NZSE-40 Capital Index falling 1.31 percent to 2,207.48.</p>
<p>The Philippines Stock Index shed 51.19 points or 1.59 percent, closing at 3,171.79.</p>
<p>&quot;Selling was noticed across-the-board. I think people are just scared of what happened and what's going to happen in Wall Street,&quot; said Poch Zamora, dealer at Peregrine Securities.</p>
<p>At about 0830 GMT, Thailand's SET index had fallen 1.72 percent to 693.28 points, while Malaysia's benchmark Composite Index of 100 large-capitalised stocks was about 1.35 percent lower at 1,186.</p>
<p>Share prices were also down in Seoul, Jakarta and Bombay for mainly domestic rather than global reasons.</p>
<p>In Korea, the composite index slipped 4.35 points to close at 672.99 in a correction linked to Monday's news that the ceiling on foreign shareholding would rise to 23 percent from 20 percent.</p>
<p>Foreign-led selling pushed the Jakarta composite index down by more than 1.8 percent to 650 points at about 0830 GMT.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the Straits Times Industrials index was up 0.55 percent to about 2,084 points at 0835 GMT.</p>
<p>Asia's bright stock markets were Taiwan and Bombay.</p>
<p>In Taipei, late buying on electronics led a sharp rise in prices, and the benchmark index closed up 1.99 percent to 8,163.41 points.</p>
<p>In Bombay, the possibility that government proposals for sweeping cuts in corporate and personal taxes announced in the February 28 budget would be unscathed by the current political crisis sent the Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share index higher.</p>
<p>In late trading, the index was at 3,402 points, up 1.23 percent.</p>
