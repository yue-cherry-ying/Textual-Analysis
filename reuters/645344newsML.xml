<p>Ireland's main Fianna Fail opposition party was heading for a narrow win over Prime Minister John Bruton's ruling coalition in Friday's election, an exit poll in the Irish Times said on Saturday.</p>
<p>But the survey showed that Fianna Fail and its progressive Democrats ally might not have enough of the 166 seats in parliament to form a government on their own, it said.</p>
<p>It suggested that Fianna Fail, which is led by Bertie Ahern, and Mary Harney's Progressive Democrats might have to court support among small parties, which include the Green party, which were seen winning 11 percent of the poll.</p>
<p>&quot;Bertie Ahern is poised to become the next Taoiseach (Prime Minister) and lead a Fianna Fail government in the Dail (parliament),&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is not yet clear whether Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats will have sufficient seats to form a government,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;The outgoing Rainbow government has no chance of being elected,&quot; the newspaper said, hours before the official start of the day-long count on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>The poll, carried out by MRBI among 1,239 electors, showed Fianna Fail winning 44 per cent of votes and the Progressive Democrats four percent.</p>
<p>Bruton's Fine Gael would win 27 percent, and its Labour and Democratic Left ally in a so-called Rainbow coalition would win eight and three per cent respectively, the survey said.</p>
<p>A hung parliament is the result most feared by financial markets, which say it could usher in an era of uncertainty as the rival coalitions try to form a government with smaller parties.</p>
<p>The Fianna Fail/Progressive Democrats alliance is a centre- right grouping formed to contest the election. It has promised to trim taxes, fight crime and keep a tight lid on government spending.</p>
<p>Polling stations stayed open until late on Friday evening and electoral officials said a turnout of around 70 per cent may have been recorded, compared to 62 percent in the last poll 1992.</p>
<p>The Green party, anti-abortion groups, Independents and Sinn Fein, political wing of Northern Ireland's Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas are among the smaller parties seen winning seats in parliament.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein is tipped to take its first seat in parliament in modern Irish history and will use it to press its call for automatic entry into Northern Ireland peace talks, from which it is barred because of IRA violence.</p>
<p>Both Sinn Fein and the IRA want an end to British rule of Northern Ireland, a goal of the Irish constitution, but established Irish political parties have frozen contact with Sinn Fein until the IRA ends its campaign of violence.</p>
<p>Bruton was confident on Friday that the 2.7 million electorate would break with history and return an incumbent government for the first in time in almost 30 years.</p>
<p>Fianna Fail ruled with the Labour party of Dick Spring until a row over legal appointments brought down the coalition in 1994.</p>
<p>Labour switched support to Bruton and, with the smaller Democratic Left, has been in power ever since but opinion polls say that voters could abandon Labour and whittle its presence in parliament from 32 seats to around 20.</p>
