<p>Britain's new Labour government on Thursday reached agreement on a crowded legislative programme for its first 1-1/2 years in office, deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have agreed the Queen's Speech,&quot; he told reporters at the end of the first meeting of Prime Minister Tony Blair's news cabinet.</p>
<p>&quot;It reflects all those priorities that we had in the general election -- that of education, of crime, of jobs, of decentralisation, of devolution,&quot; Prescott added.</p>
<p>Earlier, the minister responsible for presentation of government policy said the government would produce a White Paper policy document on freedom of information during the initial parliamentary session, which is expected to last until October 1998.</p>
<p>Peter Mandelson, minister without portfolio, speaking to Channel 4 television, said a Freedom of Information Bill would not be presented to MPs until later in the parliament. &quot;Freedom of Information has not been dropped and it will feature in the Queen's Speech,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Following long-established tradition, Queen Elizabeth will open the new parliamentary session next Wednesday by reading a speech on the government plans, which ministers will have written for her.</p>
