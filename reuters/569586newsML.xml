<p>U.S. West Coast crudes rose sharply Thursday, boosted by a rally in West Coast/Cushing (WTI) prices, but buyers said the discount for Alaska grade will widen under pressure from incoming foreign barrels.</p>
<p>The physical market for WTI tracked a rally in benchmark U.S. crudes, which gained support on a rally in unleaded gasoline futures.</p>
<p>Benchmark U.S. crudes rose 70 cents to $20.30-40 late Thursday, sparked by the 1.58-cent rise in NYMEX gasoline.</p>
<p>Traders said Atlantic Richfield Co. was close to buying two 400,000 barrel cargoes of Mesa crude, a Venezuelan lookalike to Alaska North Slope (gravity 30 degrees), for June delivery to West Coast refiners.</p>
<p>Another major buyer, Texaco, was well supplied for June after taking two to three cargoes of Oriente, traders said.</p>
<p>The high volume of imports could undermine the value of ANS,  last sold at minus $1.32 a barrel on May 5.</p>
<p>Refiners saw offers as high as $1.15 a barrel, and as low as the $1.30-40 a barrel range.</p>
<p>&quot;I would expect a deal to get done at $1.50 (under WTI),&quot; a buyer said.</p>
<p>Outright ANS prices rose 75 cents a barrel to $18.93/19.13, $1 a barrel higher than Line 63, a similar grade, and $4.12 overCalifornia heavy grades.</p>
<p>The Department of Energy had not found a buyer for light crude leftover for June/July delivery from the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve.</p>
<p>Ample foreign crudes dampened demand for the crude, which saw only 11,025 of 16,100 barrels-per-day (bpd) purchased in last week's auction.</p>
<p>Kern River crude was pegged $14.01/14.11 a barrel.</p>
<p>Wilmington and Line 63 markets remained idle.</p>
