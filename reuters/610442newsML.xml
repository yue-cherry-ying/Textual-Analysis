<p>June BTPs on LIFFE need to remain above 129.00 to fend off a strong downmove, technical analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We had April peaks in the 129.00 area and there is a little support there,&quot; said Susan Rigg, technical analyst at Chart Analysis in London.</p>
<p>The June contract reached highs between 129.02 and 129.05 on April 15, 16, and 17, before making a sustained rise in May.</p>
<p>It was trading at 129.50 at 0759 GMT, five basis points above Thursday's close.</p>
<p>The longer-term outlook is weak, analysts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;If the market violates that 129.00 level, we are going to look a lot softer,&quot; said Rigg.</p>
<p>The contract has failed to pierce resistance at the January highs, and this is foiling any upmove, analysts said.</p>
<p>June BTPs made a high of 131.70 on January 22 and 131.76 on January 23. The contract hit 131.40 on Wednesday, the top of a rally from 123.60 on March 18, before sliding on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The contract looks very vulnerable,&quot; said a technical analyst at Merrill Lynch International in London.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless we get through 131.00, we can go two points to the downside.&quot;  </p>
<p>June Eurolira futures were at 93.33 at 0815 GMT, two basis points below Thursday's settlement.</p>
<p>Support at 93.30 should hold, said a European bank in a research note.</p>
