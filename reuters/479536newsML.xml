<p>Sri Lanka is to tighten controls on industrial effluent after the capital's drinking water supply was shut down after black dye leaked from a textile factory, the Central Environmental Authority said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The government is to formulate colour standards in the release of effluent to waterways, authority's director general, Lionel Jayasinghe, said.</p>
<p>&quot;So far, we have not had standards for colour in effluent,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;But we have taken serious note of what happened last week, and within the next two months, plan to formulate national standards for colour in effluent.&quot;</p>
<p>Colombo's drinking water supply was stopped on Saturday after a thick black dye was found in the Kelani river, from where the city's supply is pumped through a purification plant.</p>
<p>Government officials said the dye came from a textile factory in an export processing zone near the river.</p>
<p>They said the discoloured water was non-toxic but the supply was disconnected for about eight hours to clear the system.</p>
<p>The city's treatment plant could purify the water but could not remove the colour, explaining the need for colour standards, the officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;An investigation has been launched and the factory concerned has voluntarily agreed to stop operations till it is over,&quot; Jayasinghe said.</p>
<p>He said regulations would be framed under the National Environmental Act of 1980 to ensure effluent was checked and treated for colour before being released into waterways.</p>
