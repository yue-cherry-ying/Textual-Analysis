<title>ITALY: Italian bonds/futures closing report.</title>

<p>Italian debt futures closed easier but off session lows after a nervous session with all eyes on the U.S. markets and weaker T-bonds in the afternoon.</p>
<p>A raft of strong U.S. data out at 1500 GMT just as the Btp market was closing was first seen as negative and then seen differently which gave a push to prices, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;People had been waiting for these figures all day,&quot; one trader said. U.S. Treasuries immediately fell on the NAPM index for March of 55.0 against 53.1 in February, but then analysts examined the lower price index component.  </p>
<p>February construction spending was up 2.3 percent, the biggest jump in a year, and leading indicators in February rose 0.5 percent. &quot;But a second reading of the data, especially the NAPM, helped the market avoid touching new lows,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>The lira was steady against the mark with the dollar mixed but off lows after the data in a market keeping a wary eye on the stock market.</p>
<p>One analyst said the Btp contract's close below 124.00 could open up a new falling trend but noted that Bunds had recovered in late trade towards 99.50 after an intraday 99.26 low.</p>
<p>&quot;With such nervous U.S. markets no one wants to go home with open positions,&quot; another said. &quot;And the domestic situation over addressing the crucial issue of welfare reform isn't helping,&quot; he added.</p>
