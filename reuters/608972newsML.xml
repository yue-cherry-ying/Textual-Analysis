<headline>Brazil TV shows police officer shooting kidnapper.</headline>
<dateline>RIO DE JANEIRO 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Brazilian television Friday showed a police officer in Sao Paulo state shooting in the head at point-blank range a man who had kidnapped a 2-year-old girl and was threatening her with a knife.</p>
<p>Globo Television footage showed the kidnapper holding the child in his arms with a knife to her throat as he paced nervously up and down on the side of a road. Then a police officer suddenly raised a gun to the man's head and shot him.</p>
<p>The kidnapper died later in a hospital, and the child was immediately returned to her family unharmed, Globo reported.</p>
<p>The man, who had been fleeing the police for five hours, took three children hostage at first but let two of them go before being encircled near the town of Valinhos. Police tried to negotiate with him for several hours.</p>
<p>The shooting of the kidnapper, in the early hours of Friday, caused controversy, and the police officer responsible was suspended from duty to undergo psychological examination. His commander, however, said he believed the shooting was the correct action.</p>
<p>&quot;The officer was sure of what he was doing,&quot; Marci Elber, the commander of an elite police force, told Globo. &quot;He waited for the right moment, making sure the life and well-being of the hostage could be preserved.&quot;</p>
<p>Elber said the police had tried everything in their efforts to negotiate with the kidnapper.</p>
