<p>Iran and other Moslem countries renewed pledges to offer free military training and other assistance to the Bosnian federation army at a conference in Sarajevo, Pakistan's foreign secretary said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Iran, Turkey, Jordan, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Pakistan have pledged to help train Bosnian soldiers as part of efforts to bolster the Moslem-Croat federation army, Shamshad Ahmad, Pakistani foreign secretary, told reporters.</p>
<p>Ahmad spoke at the close of a two-day conference of the Organisation for Islamic Countries (OIC) which met to discuss peacetime aid for Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>
<p>Pakistan planned to train 200 soldiers and 57 had already begun their courses, Ahmad said.</p>
<p>&quot;Iran has also offered to train about 3,000 personnel and to provide assistance in de-mining operations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A report issued by an OIC military committee said that Iran had promised to establish a training camp in Bosnia for the federation, to assist with rebuilding the local defence industry and to train pilots and air traffic controllers.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a full session of the military committee and member states reviewed progress in fulfillment of the commitments made earlier under the train and equip programme,&quot; Ahmad said.</p>
<p>Under the &quot;train and equip&quot; military aid programme, the United States and Islamic states are donating weapons and funds to strengthen the federation army as a counterweight to Bosnian Serb forces backed by the Yugoslav army.</p>
<p>During the 1992-95 war in former Yugoslavia, Iran and other Islamic countries violated an international arms embargo and supplied weapons to the Moslem-led Bosnian army, which was badly outgunned by Serb forces.</p>
<p>Washington did not object to the arms deliveries but now demands the federation sever all military ties with Iran, which it accuses of sponsoring terrorism.</p>
<p>Apart from Iran's offers of assistance, Turkey has promised to train one tank and one artillery company, Jordan offered to instruct soldiers on M-60 tanks, Egypt said it planned border security courses and Indonesia pledged training for engineering and medical units, Ahmad said.</p>
<p>Malaysia had offered military training and was also considering providing assistance to arms factories and setting up English language instruction for federation soldiers, the OIC report said.</p>
<p>Envoys attending the Sarajevo conference called on former warring factions to abide by their commitments under the Dayton peace agreement, which ended fighting in November 1995 between separatist Serb forces and the Moslem-led Bosnian government.</p>
<p>The treaty divides Bosnia into autonomous Serb and Moslem-Croat entities governed by a small central government.</p>
