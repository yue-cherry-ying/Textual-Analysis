<p>A model who claims she was engaged to be married to Dodi Fayed until pictures of him kissing Britain's Princess Diana appeared in newspapers sued the millionaire playboy on Thursday for breach of contract.</p>
<p>Kelly Fisher, 31, who with her willowy figure, blonde hair and shy smile in many ways resembles Diana, broke down in tears at a news conference as her attorney Gloria Allred related how her client had been &quot;shocked&quot; and &quot;shamed&quot; by the now famous &quot;kiss photo.&quot;</p>
<p>A series of more than 60 blurry pictures snapped by an Italian photographer showed Diana and Al Fayed kissing and embracing on his yacht in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Allred told reporters that even while the photographs were being taken, Fisher was on a nearby yacht also owned by the Al Fayed family.</p>
<p>Dodi Fayed's father, Mohamed Al Fayed, one of the richest men in the world, owns the posh Harrods department store in London where the British royal family frequently shops.</p>
<p>&quot;Ms. Fisher loved, trusted and believed in Mr. Fayed. In return he took her love and gave her every indication they were going to get married, and he would fulfill all his promises to her,&quot; Allred said.</p>
<p>Al Fayed told Fisher he bought a home in Paradise Cove, an exclusive Malibu neighborhood near Los Angeles, for the two of them to live in, and he told her to start shopping for furnishings, Allred said.</p>
<p>She said from the timing of the photographs it would appear Al Fayed, 42, was romantically involved with the 36-year-old princess at the same time as he was promising marriage to Fisher. As she spoke, Allred held one of two sapphire and diamond rings Fisher claims Al Fayed bought for her.</p>
<p>Allred said Fisher would not talk to the press, but when asked by a reporter why she was still wearing the other engagement ring, she sobbed &quot;because I loved him.&quot;</p>
<p>She was also asked if there was any chance of a reconciliation, and she replied emphatically, &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>Allred stressed the lawsuit was not a &quot;palimony suit&quot; even though Al Fayed &quot;led her emotionally all the way up to the altar and abandoned her when they were almost there.&quot;</p>
<p>Instead, the lawyer said it was based on certain financial promises that Al Fayed had made to Fisher in order to convince her to put her successful modeling career on hold to spend time with him.</p>
<p>Al Fayed, Allred alleged, also had given Fisher a check for &quot;a substantial amount of money&quot; only for it to be returned &quot;account closed&quot; when she tried to cash it.</p>
