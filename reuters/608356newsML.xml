<p>The British Lions suffered a double setback on Friday on the eve of their tour opener in Port Elizabeth when both centre Scott Gibbs and wing John Bentley were withdrawn from the starting line-up as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>Gibbs, who has not fully recovered from a thigh strain, is replaced by uncapped Englishman Will Greenwood and Bentley (bruised toe) makes way on the right wing for the experienced Welshman Ieuan Evans.</p>
<p>&quot;Although both Scott Gibbs and John Bentley would probably have played if we had been further into the tour, it would be crazy to put them in when we don't have to,&quot; Lions coach Ian McGeechan said.</p>
<p>&quot;Scott Gibbs was very close to playing and he's probably only two days away from playing. But another bump on the same point could then put him out for a further two weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;But I anticipate that both of them will be fit for the game on Wednesday.&quot;</p>
<p>Greenwood, the 24-year-old Leicester centre, is the only uncapped player in the Lions tour party and he relishes the chance to partner Jeremy Guscott in midfield.</p>
<p>&quot;It's nice to get the first game -- we've done the training and now we're keen to get out on the paddock,&quot; Greenwood said.</p>
<p>&quot;For me, it's also the chance to get the first crack of the whip, to state my case for the rest of the tour.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been looking forward to playing alongside Jerry for a long time but, so far, it's been avoided on the England front. Now, luckily for me, I get the opportunity to play with somebody who I've had a great deal of respect for over the years. I hope we can click and gel.</p>
<p>&quot;I remember Jerry's Lions match against Australia in 1989 when he scored that great try -- if I can set off half as good, I'll be doing all right.&quot;</p>
<p>The opening tour match is against an Eastern Province invitation side which includes Springboks Kobus Wiese and Hennie le Roux and former Wallaby flank Sam Scott-Young. McGeechan knows the Lions cannot afford to underestimate them.</p>
<p>&quot;They've been strengthened by the Gauteng players and others in their line-up have played Super 12 rugby this season,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's certainly a different side to that which represented Eastern Province earlier in the year.&quot;</p>
<p>Teams:</p>
<p>British Lions: Neil Jenkins; Ieuan Evans, Jeremy Guscott, Will Greenwood, Nick Beal; Gregor Townsend, Rob Howley; Scott Quinnell, Richard Hill, Lawrence Dallaglio, Doddy Weir, Simon Shaw, Jason Leonard (captain), Keith Wood, Tom Smith.</p>
<p>Eastern Province Invitation XV: Theo van Rensburg; Henry Pedro, Rian van Jaarsveld, Hennie le Roux, Deon Kayser; Ken Ford, Chad Alcock; Jacques Greeff, Sam Scott-Young, Matthew Webber, Kobus Wiese, Armand du Preez, Daniel Saayman, Jaco Kirsten, Willie Enslin.</p>
