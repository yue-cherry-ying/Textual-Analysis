<p>Pope John Paul on Saturday emotionally recalled the day in 1981 when he was nearly killed by a would-be assassin's bullet and thanked his countrymen for praying for his life to be spared.</p>
<p>The Pope, wrapping up a three-day, mostly private stay in the southern Poland mountain town of Zakopane that was dear to him in his youth, inaugurated a church built by local people as a votive offering to the Madonna of Fatima for saving his life.</p>
<p>&quot;The history of this church is linked to the event which took place in St Peter's Square on May 13, 1981,&quot; the Pope said in the sermon of a mass at the new church, built in a style resembling a mountain chalet, typical of the Tatra region.</p>
<p>&quot;At that time I experienced great mortal danger and suffering but also the great mercy of God,&quot; said the Pope, who rarely speaks in public about the attempt on his life.</p>
<p>Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca shot the Pope in the hand and abdomen in St Peter's Square as the Pontiff was riding in an open jeep before thousands of people at his general audience.</p>
<p>Emergency surgery saved his life. Agca, whom the Pope later forgave publicly and visited in jail, was wrestled to the ground by pilgrims, including a nun, and is serving a life sentence in Italy.</p>
<p>The Pope believes that his life was spared through the intercession of the Madonna of Fatima, because the shooting took place on the anniversay of the day in 1917 when she is said to have appeared for the first of six times that year to three poor Portuguese shepherd children.</p>
<p>&quot;By the intercession of Our Lady of Fatima, my life was given back to me. During my stay in hospital I was the object of a great outpouring of human kindness from all parts of the world,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The assassination attempt against the Pope is one of the enduring mysteries among the great crimes of the 20th century.</p>
<p>At a major trial in 1986 Italian prosecutors failed to prove their charges that the Bulgarian secret services had hired Agca on behalf of the Soviet Union in order to snuff out the Pope's support for the Solidarity union in his homeland.</p>
<p>At the time, Solidarity was threatening the stability of the Soviet bloc and the Pope reportedly told the late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev that if Moscow invaded Poland he would support resistance.</p>
<p>The so-called &quot;Bulgarian Connection&quot; trial ended with an &quot;acquittal for lack of sufficient evidence&quot; of three Turks and three Bulgarians who had been charged with conspiring with Agca.</p>
<p>The Portuguese children who reported they had seen the Madonna in 1917 said she had spoken to them of a three-part secret, the third part of which has never been revealed.</p>
<p>The first involved a vision of hell and war engulfing Europe, the second was an invitation to all believers to pray for the conversion of the world amid the coming challenge to the Church by Marxism on the eve of the October revolution.</p>
<p>The third, so-called &quot;Secret of Fatima&quot; is known only by three people: the Pope, Sister Lucia, the last surviving visionary, and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, head of the Vatican's doctrinal office.</p>
<p>Ratzinger has said the secret is not a prophesy of an apocalyptic event.</p>
<p>In his sermon, the Pope referred to the first two parts of the message, saying the 20th century had been &quot;marked by war, hatred, the fundamental violation of human rights, the immense suffering of individuals and nations&quot;.</p>
<p>In a reference to Marxism's failed attempt to wipe out all forms of religious belief, the Pope spoke of the &quot;struggle against God, carried out even to the denial of his existence.&quot;</p>
<p>John Paul, on an 11-day pilgrimage to his homeland, was due later on Saturday to leave his beloved Tatra mountains for Krakow, where he was Cardinal before his 1978 election as Pope.</p>
