<title>USA: Pentagon findings on Gulf War illness criticized.</title>
<headline>Pentagon findings on Gulf War illness criticized.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-15</dateline>

<p>There is &quot;substantial evidence&quot; linking chemical agents and the kinds of illnesses experienced by Gulf War veterans, the New York Times reported on Sunday, quoting a government study to be released this month.</p>
<p>The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, criticised a special White House panel and the Defence Department for finding that Iraqi chemical weapons were probably not responsible for the illnesses, the Times said.</p>
<p>The government report said the Pentagon should not rule out the possibility that Iraqi biological weapons, especially afla-toxins, any of a group of potent liver carcinogens, might be responsible for some ailments reported by the estimated 80,000 Gulf War veterans who have sought special medical checkups, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;It also criticised the Pentagon for trying to discount another potential risk, a tropical disease spread by parasites that produces symptoms that might not surface for years, and questioned whether pesticides had contributed to their health problems,&quot; the Times said.</p>
<p>Both the White House and the Pentagon told the newspaper they would not respond to the criticism until the report was officially released.</p>
<p>&quot;It supports the idea that we should take the Gulf War research programme away from the Pentagon and give it to someone who really wants to find some answers,&quot; Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, told the Times. Shays has been critical of the Defence Department's handling of the probe.</p>
<p>The General Accounting Office report also said that &quot;clouds of chemical weapons might have reached American troops as a result of the aerial bombing of Iraqi chemical plants and storage depots early in the war,&quot; the Times reported.</p>
