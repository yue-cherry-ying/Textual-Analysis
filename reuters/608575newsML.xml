<headline>Budget deficit control all the rage in US, Europe.</headline>

<p>Budget deficit control is top of the agenda in industrialised nations -- a priority which economists predict thrifty governments will enforce well into the next millennium.</p>
<p>The discipline of monetary union in Europe and the expected passage of an agreement to balance the bulging U.S. budget, mean the spiralling deficits of the late 1980s are becoming just a memory, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we'll be seeing much lower government deficits, and even some surpluses appearing,&quot; said Stephen Lewis, director of London Bond Broking, here.</p>
<p>&quot;Even left wing governments nowadays feel it's better to have a low deficit. The only contentious issue is the proportion achieved by tax increases versus spending cuts.&quot;</p>
<p>Budgetary prudence is a vote winner, despite sometimes painful side-effects.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton has strayed from the traditional Democratic party line and thrown his weight behind the proposed balanced budget agreement, which sets goals for deficit reduction through 2002.</p>
<p>An agreement, which is expected to get final approval by both chambers of Congress on June 3, would give the U.S. its first balanced budget since the 1960s.</p>
<p>And on the other side of the Atlantic, countries such as former free-spender Italy are squeezing their once hefty deficits into more manageable sizes in the drive to join European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Under the Maastricht criteria EMU aspirants must aim to reduce their government deficits to three percent of GDP.</p>
<p>And provided the stability pact is passed into law -- ruling out excessive deficits for EMU countries -- economists see little to upset the applecart for a while.</p>
<p>Lewis said any recession waiting to ambush the global economy in the next 15 years or so would not be too much of a problem.</p>
<p>&quot;But heightened political or military tension around the world -- whereby governments would build stockpiles of raw materials and defence spending would rocket -- may be one risk (to deficits),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Even the prospect of ageing populations in most industrialised nations is of little concern right now.</p>
<p>&quot;The demographic problems don't really pose any threats to budget balance until well into the next century,&quot; said Lewis. &quot;It's right that governments should be thinking about it now, but for year on year budget balances, there's no problem until 2010 or thereabouts.&quot;</p>
<p>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell chief economist Steven Bell was slightly less optimistic. He expected some slippage in European governments' efforts to rein in deficits and doubted the success of the stability pact.</p>
<p>&quot;For one thing, sovereign nations feel very, very nervous about inflicting penalties on other sovereign nations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But despite the rhetoric about the virtues of spending control and budget discipline, there may be valid reasons in some cases for maintaining a deficit, economists said. It isn't always the irresponsible act it is sometimes made out to be.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether (slashing deficits) is always the right thing to do is another question,&quot; said Adrian Schmidt, international economist at Chase in London.</p>
<p>&quot;A budget deficit -- borrowing money from the future to pay for the present -- might be justified with a population that is getting younger, because of declining pension liabilities in the future,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There's also the question of the actual budget deficit versus the structural shortfall -- the underlying debt.</p>
<p>The actual deficit may soar in recession, but the underlying position may be deceptively healthier.</p>
<p>&quot;The big deficit we had in the UK was quite correct,&quot; said Bell.</p>
<p>&quot;In a major recession with inflation pressures collapsing...governments are quite right to allow their budget deficits to widen.&quot;</p>
<p>So while there is little to separate politicians when it comes to preaching good government housekeeping, differences remain on their approach.</p>
<p>Left-wing governments traditionally plump for tax increases to cover any spending increases -- as this allows a redistribution of income within the economy.</p>
<p>But Schmidt said &quot;If you tax and spend more, it might make society more equitable, but less efficient -- it reduces the incentives to work more.&quot;</p>
<p>Cutting welfare spending is conversely seen as improving efficiency -- a tack traditionally adopted by more right wing policy makers.</p>
