<headline>Koop, Kessler top tobacco panel for Congress.</headline>

<p>Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and former Food and Drug Administration chief David Kessler will head a panel being formed by members of Congress to advise them on the tobacco settlement talks, lawmakers said on Friday.</p>
<p>The two prominent tobacco foes agreed to chair an advisory committee that five senators and four representatives were assembling to push strong health protections in legislation that arises from a settlement, a spokesman for California Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman said.</p>
<p>Lawmakers including Democrats Rep. Henry Waxman of California and Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Republican Rep. James Hansen of Utah, sent letters this week asking health advocates to join the committee to review any government-tobacco industry deal.</p>
<p>Tobacco companies and state attorneys general reportedly made progress this week in negotiations to limit the companies' liability in hundreds of anti-tobacco lawsuits in exchange for tighter controls on cigarette advertising and other measures.</p>
<p>Congress likely would take up legislation based on a settlement, the lawmakers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Advisory Committee will advise us on any tobacco settlement that may be proposed and will work with us to develop a comprehensive and united approach to any tobacco legislation that Congress may consider,&quot; their letter said.</p>
<p>&quot;A unified public health position developed by the Advisory Committee will allow us to respond to any weakening amendments effectively -- and to insist on public health amendments to strengthen the legislation,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>Groups being asked to participate in the panel included the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, the American Heart Association, Americans for Nonsmokers Rights, and the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids.</p>
<p>Koop and Kessler could not be reached for comment.</p>
