<p>Turkish authorities will monitor mosques and religious education courses for signs of militancy as a part of an army-inspired curb on Islamist activisim, state-run Anatolian news agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It was determined that some preachers at the mosques and teachers at the Koran courses have recently made speeches against Ataturk and the Turkish armed forces,&quot; the agency quoted the interior ministry as saying in an order to police.</p>
<p>Police will closely watch religious centres, recording speeches made there and increasing their intelligence activities about religious activism, the agency said. It did not say how many mosques or education classes would be observed.</p>
<p>Anatolian said plainclothes police would also listen to sermons by suspected extremist religious leaders and report back to their superiors.</p>
<p>&quot;From now on we will put more importance on intelligence work. Speeches that constitute crimes will be recorded by tape cassettes and cameras,&quot; the agency quoted an unnamed senior police official as saying.</p>
<p>A fierce row between Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and the secular army over religious sentiment has brought the coalition government to breaking point.</p>
<p>The generals see themselves as the guardians of Turkey's official secularism, first championed by national hero Kemal Ataturk.</p>
<p>Erbakan, modern Turkey's first Islamist leader, is expected to swap jobs with his secularist coalition partner, Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, this week in a bid to deflect military criticism.</p>
<p>A military-dominated council in February demanded a government crackdown on a religious upsurge, including tighter implementation of dress restrictions, the closure of unofficial Islamic education courses and efforts to limit the role of religious schools.</p>
