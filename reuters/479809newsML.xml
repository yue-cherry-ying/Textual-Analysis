<headline>Major says UK economy booming.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prime Minister John Major kicked off his campaign for the May 1 election on Tuesday by visiting the south London suburb of Croydon and declaring &quot;the economy is booming, what we have to do is make sure nobody changes it&quot;.</p>
<p>Major toured a home improvements store where he was invited by shoppers to sign autographs on lampshades they had just bought.</p>
<p>After a weekend dominated by reports of political sleaze, he told one man jokingly: &quot;I would like to have some light on the real issues.&quot;</p>
<p>Major spent about 30 minutes at the store before returning to London on his election battle bus.</p>
<p>The store is the Croydon North constituency, a new seat which according to experts' calculations would have been won by just 160 votes by the Conservatives at the 1992 election.</p>
