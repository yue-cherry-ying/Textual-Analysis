<p>Russia, bitter at NATO plans to expand the alliance, on Friday commemorates the anniversary of Russia's last great military victory with rallies and parades to mark the end of World War Two.</p>
<p>Victory Day, the day when the war against Nazi Germany ended in Europe, was and is one of the most solemnly observed public holidays in the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>But this year's events will be overshadowed by the NATO row, described by President Boris Yeltsin as the most acute issue between Russia and the West since the Cuban crisis -- the 1962 standoff over Soviet missile bases on the Caribbean island.</p>
<p>&quot;For all of us, Victory (Day) will remain the holiday with tears in our eyes,&quot; Yeltsin said in an address due to be delivered on Moscow's Red Square.</p>
<p>&quot;The time of war strengthened our confidence in the greatness of Russia. It gave us back a feeling of self esteem without which there is no path to freedom and democracy.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin, Russia's first freely-elected president, has invited soldiers to join the Red Square celebrations in the first military parade there in half a decade.</p>
<p>He has also promised to reinstate the goose-stepping guard of honour at Moscow's tomb of the unknown soldier, but will not bring the ceremonial &quot;honour guard number one&quot; back to the tomb of Soviet State founder Vladimir Lenin.</p>
<p>Yeltsin removed the guards at the tomb and at Lenin's red marble mausoleum after he took power in the Kremlin, prompting fury from communists, who plan to demonstrate on Friday against government policy.</p>
<p>Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, defeated by Yeltsin in last July's presidential election, will address the rally shortly after Yeltsin reviews the Red Square parade.</p>
<p>An official from the FSB federal security service told NTV television that police would step up security at railway stations and other public places on Victory Day.</p>
<p>At least two people were killed last month in explosions at railway stations in southern Russia which officials blamed on Chechen separatists.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's main foreign policy focus has been on how to respond to NATO's expansion plans.</p>
<p>He says he hopes to sign a special agreement with the alliance later this month, well before a July summit at which NATO is expected to invite the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary to join.</p>
<p>&quot;About 98 percent of the document is ready,&quot; he said on Thursday, adding: &quot;There has probably not been such an acute issue between Russia and the USA and NATO since the Cuban crisis.&quot;</p>
