<headline>Senate panel set to back $6 mln for Colorado dam.</headline>

<p>A Senate subcommittee was likely to approve $6 million to support a controversial water project in southern Colorado, panel chairman Sen. Pete Domenici said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The energy and water subcommittee is today expected to recommend inclusion of the president's $6 million budget request for the Animas-La Plata project,&quot; the New Mexico Republican said in a statement.</p>
<p>The administration asked for the money to support ongoing talks to revise the long-delayed project, which is opposed by green groups and taxpayer advocates including House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, and for preliminary work.</p>
<p>Critics have said Congress should reject any new money for the project because at least $8 million of $9 million approved last year has yet to be spent.</p>
<p>The original proposal, which stemmed from a 1988 water rights settlement with Native American tribes, was expected to cost more than $740 million, including $500 million from the federal government. The project was designed to pump water from the Animas River to a reservoir to channel it into the La Plata River in order to supply ranchers, industries, municipalities and Ute and Navajo tribes.</p>
<p>Local tribes on Tuesday announced a proposal to scale back the project, slashing its cost to $290 million including $260 million from the U.S. government, by dropping irrigation facilities for non-Indian farmers and ranchers from the plan.</p>
<p>&quot;This proposal presents a realistic alternative that addresses the problems raised by critics yet resolves the issue of water usage in the region,&quot; Domenici said.</p>
<p>The Clinton administration had no immediate comment on the compromise that the Indians were due to present to White House officials later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not been provided a copy of the revised proposal, nor had any chance to conduct analysis on this scaled down proposal,&quot; said Paul Bledsoe, a spokesman for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.</p>
<p>Babbitt last year set up negotiations, led by Colorado Gov. Roy Romer and Lt. Gov. Gail Schoettler, to resolve the controversy. Schoettler asked for supporters and opponents of the project to offer new proposals by July 31.</p>
