<p>The U.S. lumber industry is trying to close what it sees as a loophole in a lumber pact that allows framing studs with a hole drilled through one end to enter the United States from Canada, industry sources said.</p>
<p>The holes are enough to classify the studs as modified or manufactured lumber, which exempts them from being counted as part of Canada's quota-regulated lumber exports to the U.S., thr sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not a big deal right now,&quot; said Scott Shotwell, executive director of the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports.  </p>
<p>&quot;It could become a big loophole because there is about four billion board feet (of normal studs) coming in a year,&quot; Shotwell said.</p>
<p>Under an agreement with the United States, Canada can ship 14.7 billion board feet of lumber annually to the U.S. duty-free. Quantities beyond that amount are subject to a tariff of $50 per 1,000 board feet. If the excess exceeds 650 million board feet, the tariff goes to $100.</p>
<p>&quot;It is being done wholly to bypass the agreement,&quot; said John Ragosta, a Coalition lawyer, referring to the drilled studs.  </p>
<p>The Coalition, which represents about 65 percent of U.S. softwood lumber manufacturers, is trying to persuade the U.S. Customs Service to disallow the practice.</p>
<p>&quot;We are talking with Customs and saying a stud is a stud,&quot; Shotwell said.</p>
<p>Customs officials were unavailable for comment Thursday.</p>
<p>Studs are 2x4s about eight feet in length, used in walls of homes.</p>
<p>Canfor Corp, a Vancouver, British Columbia-based forestry company, began producing modified studs for the Canadian market in 1996 and is now shipping them to the U.S.  </p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't qualify under the quota, but we do pay a duty,&quot; said Ralph Eastman, Canfor's manager of corporate communications.</p>
<p>U.S. lumber sources said the U.S. assesses duties on imports of quota-exempt lumber, but that the duties are much lower than the tariffs would be if the quota was exceeded.</p>
<p>&quot;We introduced it (the modified lumber) in Canada first and now we are trying to market it in the U.S.,&quot; Eastman said.</p>
<p>He said the modified studs account for about three to four percent of the firm's total production, and &quot;what is exported to the U.S. is even smaller.&quot;  </p>
<p>The studs are designed for housing and the holes were added to accommodate electrical wiring, he said.</p>
<p>Dave Evans, associate editor of the lumber trade publication Random Lengths, said the mill had apparently found a loophole in the Canadian-U.S. lumber agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;If a significant volume of studs were drilled, that would give them (mills) room to ship other (lumber) dimensions. That would basically negate the effectiveness of the agreement,&quot; Evans said.</p>
