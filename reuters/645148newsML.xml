<p>Martina Hingis showed at the French Open on Saturday that she does not only know how to win -- she also knows how to lose.</p>
<p>The 16-year-old Swiss, who has sometimes shown a propensity to pout and throw her racquet when matches have not gone her way, accepted her defeat to Iva Majoli with a smile and the grace of a champion.</p>
<p>&quot;If you lose a Grand Slam final you don't feel very happy but Iva was just the better player today,&quot; said Hingis, her trademark smile never leaving her face. &quot;I don't mind losing to her because we're very good friends.</p>
<p>&quot;It's no problem for me, I've had a great year so far. For sure it's frustrating to lose in the final but my career doesn't end right now.&quot;</p>
<p>The world number one, however, will take some extra time off to rest the knee she injured when she fell off a horse in April. The injury sidelined the teenager for the five weeks leading up to the start of the French Open.</p>
<p>Hingis said she would now resist the urge to play in the grass court tune-up tournaments ahead of Wimbledon, returning instead to her home outside Zurich.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't feel like I want to play another tournament next week,&quot; said Hingis, who became the youngest ever Wimbledon champion last year when she teamed up with Helena Sukova to win the doubles title. &quot;The knee is not 100 percent yet, I'm going to take it a little easier.</p>
<p>&quot;No one can appreciate what it took to compete at this tournament. No one sees what hard work it was to get here after the surgery.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to be tired for Wimbledon. I've played enough tennis for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>Hingis, under the guidance of her mother and coach Melanie, appears willing to pace herself and take advice.</p>
<p>&quot;You can always learn from losing,&quot; said Hingis, who hasn't had too many lessons this season having strung together 37 consecutive victories before her loss to Majoli.</p>
