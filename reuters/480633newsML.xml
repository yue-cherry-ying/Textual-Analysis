<p>German overnight funds kicked off the new month trading between 3.10 and 3.15 percent as conditions normalised after dealers, scrambling to meet month-end requirements, sent rates soaring late last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Conditions were still pretty lively today after last week's difficult month-end,&quot; said one chief money market dealer, adding however, &quot;but rates have come back to trade around 3.10 to 3.15 percent with the bulk of trades conducted around 3.125 percent this morning.&quot;</p>
<p>The morning's session was largely characterised by redistribution of funds, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Consequently dealers said it was difficult to predict where rates could move during the afternoon. Looking ahead, dealers were confident however that conditions would normalise further in the next few days with rates returning to familiar territory, just above the three percent level.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank has kept its main money market rate, the repo, fixed at three percent since last August, leaving little room for rates to move significantly from that level.</p>
<p>Eyeing Wednesday's weekly Bundesbank repo award, dealers predicted the central bank would largely replace the 71.9 billion mark pact which expires tomorrow.  </p>
<p>Banks held 43.4 in non-interest bearing accounts at the Bundesbank on Thursday, down from 46.2 billion marks held a day earlier. The monthly average rate however rose to 41.5 billion marks on Saturday from 41.1 billion marks.</p>
<p>Lombard borrowings stood at 600 million marks on Thursday after 2.1 billion marks a day earlier. Frankfur markets were closed on Friday and Monday in observance of the Easter holiday.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt Interbank Overnight Average was set at 3.15375 percent on Monday after 3.85167 percent on Thursday.</p>
