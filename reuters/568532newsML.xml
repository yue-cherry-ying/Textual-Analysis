<headline>U.S. mortgage-backeds cling to session highs.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. mortgage-backed securities prices were trading near session highs at late afternoon Thursday, taking their cue from a small rally in Treasury prices.</p>
<p>Most fixed-coupon pass-through yield spreads to Treasuries were relatively flat as credit markets had little new economic information to digest.</p>
<p>&quot;(Yield spreads) are pretty stable here,&quot; said one trader. Given the shape of the Treasury yield curve, he said, mortgage yield spreads &quot;are in pretty decent shape.&quot;  </p>
<p>Mortgage prices remained firm amid light trading volume.</p>
<p>One pass-through trader said there were rumors earlier in the session of a &quot;big seller&quot; of mortgages versus a buyer of 10-year notes.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the dollar rolls have all collapsed, and that might be an indication of it, I have not seen any selling and I have seen absolutely no selling from mortgage bankers,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>By 1500 EDT/1900 GMT, fixed-coupon mortgage prices were up 5/32 to 11/32 overall, while comparable Treasury prices were 6/32 to 10/32 higher.  </p>
<p>Specifically, Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5-percent paper was up 8/32 at 99-11/32, yielding 89 basis points over the five-year Treasury note.</p>
<p>Comparable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issues were up 8/32 as well, at 99-15/32 and 99-19/32, respectively.</p>
<p>Five-year Treasuries were up 6/32 at 6.59 percent, and 10-year notes were up 10/32 at 6.72 percent.</p>
