<p>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Cargo said from April 5 it will operate a Saturday freighter service between Milan-Linate and Amsterdam, starting on April 5, following France's decision to ban most weekend truck movements.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been considering a freighter service from Italy to Schiphol for some time to get round the ban and from next weekend we will be operating a 30 tonne-capacity Belfast aircraft from Linate, wet-leased from Heavylift Cargo Airlines,&quot; KLM Cargo's Paris-based Operations manager, Southern Europe, Simon Groenenboom, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Since March 24 trucks exceeding 7.5 tonnes, are banned from French roads between 2200 local (2000 gmt) Saturday until the same time on Sunday with exception of perishables, live animals and printed matter shipments as well as loads for which a special permit has been obtained.</p>
<p>Previously truckers were allowed to return back to their home base during this period.</p>
<p>&quot;Along with Spain, Italy is a very important market for us and we have very dense trucking operation over weekend periods carrying airfreight to Amsterdam to catch both freighter and passenger flights,&quot; Groenenboom said.</p>
<p>He added: &quot;Having a weekend freighter service from Linate will take some of the pressure off our pallet consolidation centre at Milan and enable us to fly out the more urgent cargos for which it is imperative connections are made at Schiphol.&quot;</p>
<p>KLM Cargo had taken steps to allow trucks to leave Milan earlier for Schiphol so as to avoid crossing France when the ban is in force. There were also plans to operate direct trucking links from Rome, Florence and Bologna to Amsterdam.</p>
<p>&quot;While we are starting with the Belfast between Milan and and Amsterdam, it's still our intention to put on a bigger aircraft orr alternatively make Milan a stopover on our Schiphol-Far East freighter services,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, a large part of our shipments to the Far East is accounted for by Italy-originating freight. But, we don't want to proceed hastily,&quot; Groenenboom said.</p>
<p>KLM will use the same Belfast on a second weekend frequency on its Zaragosa-Schiphol freighter service which the airline has tested out successfully since February in anticipation of the truck ban in France.</p>
<p>&quot;From April 5, we will have two frequencies on the route, the other operated by a five-pallet, 22-tonne capacity Lockheed Hercules wet-leased from Southern Air Transport,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Both the Zaragosa and Milan services will give our customers of 80-odd tonnes of airlift from southern Europe during the crucial weekend period and will arrive in good time to be fed into our global cargo network from Schiphol early Sunday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;It may sound ironic but the truck ban has served to stimulate our long-standing plans to establish freighter feeders in Europe and the Zaragosa service has already surpassed our expectations,&quot; Groenenboom added.</p>
