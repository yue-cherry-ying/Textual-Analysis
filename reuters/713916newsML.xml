<title>USA: Urohealth faces class action suit.</title>
<headline>Urohealth faces class action suit.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-08</dateline>

<p>A civil complaint alleging securities fraud has been filed against Urohealth Systems Inc and certain of its officers and directors, plaintiffs' lawyers said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, for which class action status is being sought, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of investors who bought Urohealth common stock between July 18, 1996 and July 1, 1997, the lawyers said.  </p>
<p>The complaint, which is similar to one announced by another group on Monday, alleged that the defendants issued materially false and misleading quarterly financial statements that overstated revenues and earnings, according to the law firm of Wolf Popper LLP.</p>
<p>During the period in which the alleged violations were committed, Urohealth's stock traded at inflated prices and when troubles concerning Urohealth surfaced, its stock declined, falling to as low as $4.75 a share, from a high of $15.125, the firm said.  </p>
<p>Urohealth, a Newport Beach, Calif.,-based maker of medical products for the healthcare market, was not immediately available to comment.</p>
