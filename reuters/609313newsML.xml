<title>USA: CME butter surges for second day on stronger cash.</title>
<headline>CME butter surges for second day on stronger cash.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>CME butter futures surged as much as the expanded 5.00 cent per lb daily limit and ended up sharply as rising cash markets sparked demand, traders said.</p>
<p>Futures ended 4.25 to 0.050 cent higher with June up 3.25 at 107.75 cents. September rose the expanded limit before ending up most at 117.25 cents.</p>
<p>Commercial and speculative buying prompted by tight supplies and rising cash markets again boosted futures after closing limit up of 2.50 cents on Thursday. Talk that one producer needed butter to meet commitments added to the bullish tone, they said.</p>
<p>Butter prices shot up 12 cents Friday in the cash market with AA grade butter up to 105.00. A and B grades were also up 12 cents showing the strong demand.</p>
<p>Much of the strength in butter developed from continued reductions in butter production, low stocks that total only a few days and concern ice cream producers will take cream away from butter production.</p>
<p>&quot;All of the fear is ice cream producers will take all the cream,&quot; said floor trader Nick Kelne.</p>
<p>Market analyst Jerry Dryer also attributed the demand to building of stocks for the fall.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand is two-faceted -- buyers are starting to build stocks for fall use, and demand for cream from ice cream makers also is increasing, in the hopes that the Northern Tier states (will) eventually see some summer-like weather,&quot; Dryer said.</p>
<p>But the runup may be over in cash butter prices as increased milk production takes care of short term needs.</p>
<p>&quot;With more milk available for churning, we wouldn't expect butter prices to move up any more,&quot; Dryer said.</p>
<p>But futures traders were more bullish, especially in deferred futures contracts.</p>
<p>Kelne said that butter prices may be in an area where cash market traders feel more comfortable, but futures traders still see more gains this summer which added to the gains in September futures.</p>
