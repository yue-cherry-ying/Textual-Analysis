<headline>Israeli troops kill Arab in West Bank - witnesses.</headline>
<dateline>HEBRON, West Bank 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian youth in clashes early on Tuesday near a Jewish settlement bordering the West Bank town of Hebron, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They identified the dead youth as Kemal al-Zaro, killed near the industrial zone of Kiryat Arab settlement. They said he was 16 or 17 years old.  </p>
<p>The army said it was checking the incident.</p>
<p>Clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces entered their 13th day on Tuesday. The unrest erupted in response to Israel's breaking ground on a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, a step which has plunged Israeli-Palestinian relations to near-collapse.</p>
<p>The West Bank incident coincided with two apparent suicide bombings near Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, Israeli security sources said.</p>
<p>They said in both cases guerrillas apparently blew themselves up at an hour when buses of schoolchildren leave the heavily guarded settlements of Kfar Darom and Netzarim. Witnesses said there may have been Palestinian bystanders injured in the Kfar Darom blast.</p>
