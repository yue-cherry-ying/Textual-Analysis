<title>RUSSIA: Space crocodile, $500 Mercedes on Russia Fool's Day.</title>
<headline>Space crocodile, $500 Mercedes on Russia Fool's Day.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>An alligator bit a U.S. astronaut on the Mir space station, Russians were invited to join NATO to dodge the draft at home and a Mercedes went on sale for $500 on Tuesday as Moscow's media enjoyed their April Fool's Day jokes.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said the crocodile, called Gena after a Russian cartoon figure, was born from one of the quails' eggs being used for experiments aboard the station.</p>
<p>&quot;Gena is growing rapidly and experts are considering transferring it to the international space station Alpha,&quot; Tass said, referring to the yet-to-be-launched orbiting station.</p>
<p>Many Russians failed to get a joke in newspaper reports that the government was selling foreign cars belonging to officials for as little as $500 apiece.</p>
<p>&quot;These newspapers had to switch off their telephones today as people kept phoning in to find out the details,&quot; chief government spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov told a news briefing.</p>
<p>Russian officials want to stop buying foreign cars to help local firms and they plan to auction off imported models. But Shabdurasulov said no auctions had yet been scheduled.</p>
<p>Moskovsky Komsomolets admitted only a handful of its April 1 stories were true and it promised to pay two million roubles ($350) to those who said how many true stories there were.</p>
<p>Articles included application forms for individuals wanting to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation -- the newspaper said membership would help people to dodge the draft in Russia -- and a promise by Ukraine to hand over files on unidentified flying objects in return for rescheduling of Russia's debts.</p>
<p>Komsomolskaya Pravda said Russian and British scientists wanted to clone the abominable Snowman, found 20 years ago in Siberia.</p>
<p>&quot;The Snowman is two metres (six foot six inches) high and its feet are 40 cm long. A young woman has already volunteered to give birth to the clone,&quot; Komsomolskaya said, promising free subscription to those who identify its April 1 spoofs.</p>
