<p>SSouth African shares ended the week down on Friday, suffering a case of the blues inspired by a month of weaker than expected corporate earnings, dealers said.</p>
<p>The industrials sector drifted downwards for most of the day as poor sentiment held the market in its grip. The market launched a late mini-rally as Wall Street kicked off to a strong start, but the main indices still ended firmly in negative territory.</p>
<p>The all-share index dropped 24.4 points to 7,071.7 as the industrials index shed 39.9 points to 8,312.1. Volumes were light at 587 million rands worth of trade.</p>
<p>Since clothing firm Edgars posted poor results at the start of May other large players have followed suit.</p>
<p>But market players are looking to a flood of economic figures due next week for fresh guidance as to the country's economic health. Numbers coming out include April trade, first quarter gross domestic product, money supply, private credit and April consumer price inflation.</p>
<p>The golds sector had its third losing day in a row, dropping 3.4 points to 1,192.1.</p>
<p>The price of bullion has been stuck in a range of $340-45 an ounce in recent weeks and market players see no prospect of any firm break out.</p>
