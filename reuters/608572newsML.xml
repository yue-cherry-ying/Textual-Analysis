<p>Chase Asset Management is considering launching a global emerging market equity fund this year, and also has plans to fully focus an international yield fund on emerging markets.</p>
<p>Mark Richardson, chief investment officer of global asset management at Chase Manhattan Bank, told Reuters there was strong value in emerging markets equities.</p>
<p>Chase has about $125 billion assets under management.</p>
<p>&quot;These markets have lagged the debt markets dramatically. On any relative valuation basis emerging equity markets look very attractive,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an attractive area and we are thinking of a fund.&quot; It will not be targeted at retail investors.</p>
<p>He also said Chase's international high yield fund, which invests 50 percent in emerging market debt and 50 percent in high yield Europe, may move into emerging markets only.</p>
<p>&quot;I need hardly say that it's tough to find high yield Europe at this stage. There is a proposal that we turn out a pure emerging market debt fund. We think that is an attractive area.&quot;</p>
<p>Richardson said he was backing Hong Kong and Korea in mixed Asian emerging equity markets, with Hong Kong offering the most promise, and the easiest exit in the event of something going wrong.</p>
<p>There has been a major disparity in performance in Asia, with Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines and Indonesia all suffering amid overheating in the property market.</p>
<p>But Hong Kong would probably see 20 percent earnings growth on a multiple of about 12 and should be able to make ground on other markets in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't really see why it should continue to trade at a 30 percent discount to the region any longer.&quot;</p>
<p>Korea has been depressed, but had held up well despite recent crises, and earnings growth was looking better going forward, Richardson said.</p>
<p>Latin American markets had done extremely well this year, with Brazil and Chile the most favoured markets so far. But he said Latin America could mark time following the recent steep ascent.</p>
