<headline>LIFFE cocoa futures subdued, July loses ground.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>LIFFE cocoa futures stayed lower by Friday's finish amid razor-thin, pre-holiday trade.</p>
<p>July slipped five stg at 1,024 stg per tonne and September dropped seven at 1,041 by the close.</p>
<p>Volume reached a meagre 1,707 lots.</p>
<p>Traders attributed losses to light speculative liquidation after New York closed sharply lower on Thursday. They said thin conditions before a three-day weekend exaggerated the moves.</p>
<p>The firming up of sterling against European units also deterred many European manufacturers.</p>
<p>U.S. and London markets are both closed on Monday for holidays, reopening on Tuesday. New York was lower by midsesssion Friday on long liquidation.</p>
<p>Technically, some analysts still expected London's July to edge up in the next couple of weeks to test resistance near 1,060 again. July has tested that level twice and failed, but analysts said the third time could succeed.</p>
<p>They said oscillators were looking bullish despite the recent sideways market.</p>
<p>July support rests at 1,000 and then, at the April 9 low of 980.</p>
<p>In other news, German cocoa trader Albrecht &amp; Dill GmbH said on Friday the Ivory Coast could have sold 550,000 tonnes from its upcoming 1997/98 cocoa main crop (October/September).</p>
<p>The trader's weekly report cited information received from shippers and added this would be a higher figure than so far expected.</p>
<p>Some of A&amp;D's sources even estimated sales in excess of 600,000 tonnes, the report said.</p>
