<p>The IPE natural gas futures contract was untraded on Friday morning, but OTC market dealers were not surprised on the eve of the bank holiday weekend.</p>
<p>One physical market trader pointed out that several market participants who went to the cricket at Headingley on Thursday are making a long weekend of it and have taken Friday off as well to add to the public holiday on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We're likely to see nothing but day ahead and weekend gas (on the physical market),&quot; said the trader. &quot;There's going to be relatively little done till the week after next.&quot;</p>
<p>With such a quiet overall market, interest in futures was limited. Bids and offers were posted for all periods, but they straddled the previous settlement price in all periods, and were generally far apart. Front-month June saw a bid/offer range of 11.25/11.65 pence a therm by the close of the session, against a previous settlement price of 11.44 pence.</p>
