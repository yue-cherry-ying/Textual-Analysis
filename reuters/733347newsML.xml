<p>The Senate likely will pass a resolution before the August recess opposing a global climate change treaty that does not require developing, as well as developed, countries to limit industrial pollution, a Republican senator said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Speaking to a conference on global warming, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said he expected a resolution pushed by Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska will get &quot;very, very close&quot; to the two-thirds majority needed to override a White House veto. It has 60 sponsors &quot;and five or six hanging in the wings,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While the Byrd-Hagel resolution would not carry legal force, Craig said it was &quot;an expression both to this administration and to the world that the very body that could make this law is highly skeptical at this moment of the strategy that this administration is incorporating.&quot;</p>
<p>After his speech, Craig told reporters: &quot;I do not believe the Senate will pass a binding treaty and the rest of the world needs to know that.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States is in talks with other industrialized nations to try to set legally binding targets to reduce pollution from burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels that trap heat in the atmosphere. Those negotiations are to culminate in December in Japan.</p>
<p>Craig and others say rapidly developing economies, such as China, also should have to commit to limiting their pollution or else they will have an unfair advantage over industrialized countries. But developing countries contend the United States and other big economies have caused the bulk of the problem, and should work first to clean it up.</p>
<p>Craig also said he was concerned that the administration was reworking economic models to shift a chunk of the costs of complying with a global warming treaty to its new stricter air quality standards against smog and soot.</p>
<p>&quot;The administration's plan is to subdivide the pain so that its initiative will appear to be less costly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also complained that the White House was trying to mask costs of reducing pollution by stressing use of emissions credits trading and other market-based programs.</p>
