<title>USA: Safe homes sought for glut of research chimps.</title>

<p>A leading scientific think tank said on Wednesday that an overpopulation of research chimpanzees should be given safe homes rather than face the possibility of being euthanized.</p>
<p>&quot;Euthanasia should not be endorsed as a general means of population control,&quot; said a report by the National Research Council, entitled &quot;Chimpanzees in Research -- Strategies for Their Ethical Care, Management, and Use.&quot;</p>
<p>The report recommends finding qualified homes for the chimps in sanctuaries and zoos with the option of calling back the animals if demand for research chimpanzees increases.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health launched a successful breeding programme in 1986 to meet an expected increase in demand for chimpanzees in AIDS research, but the need was less than expected, and now there is an excess of chimps, the council said.</p>
<p>The National Research Council also called for a breeding moratorium until 2001 on laboratory chimps and the formation of a central office within the federal government to assume ownership of about 1,000 chimpanzees.</p>
<p>The council estimated the population of research chimps to be 1,500, which it said exceeds current research needs.</p>
<p>Chimpanzee research has led to the development of a vaccine for hepatitis B and other important medical breakthroughs.</p>
<p>The apes are among humans' closest relatives. Both species stem from the same ancestor, with an evolutionary split occurring some 6 million years ago. Today, human DNA varies from that of chimps by only about two percent of known genes.</p>
