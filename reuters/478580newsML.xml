<p>Major Slovak shares were mixed in sluggish trading on the Bratislava Stock Exchange on Tuesday, with losses to oil refinery Slovnaft and drugmaker Slovakofarma pulling the SAX down 1.35 points to 205.67.</p>
<p>Brokers said post-holiday trading was slow, with significantly low volumes of directly traded shares. Only 33,000 shares changed hands in direct deals, while 2,000 were traded on the BSE floor.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this was more or less extreme...I don't expect this would be a trend,&quot; Libor Briska of Creditanstalt said.</p>
<p>He added that investors have been showing relatively strong demand for the shares, including blue chips, but shareholders have remained steadfast, refusing to sell until annual results for 1996 are seen.</p>
<p>Steel maker VSZ firmed 10 crowns to 725, and Briska said the issue's price remained interestingly compared to similar issues in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;I also expect Slovnaft to hover around its nominal 1,000 crown value, for the longer perspective,&quot; Briska said. Slovnaft eased 10 crowns to 1,000.</p>
<p>Overall volume fell to 35,302 shares, from 196,577 shares traded on Thursday, while turnover decreased to 28.72 million crowns, from 170.21 million.</p>
