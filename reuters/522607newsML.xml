<p>Hashan Tillekeratne rescued Sri Lanka with a defiant, unbeaten 65 on the opening day of the first test against Pakistan at the R. Premadasa stadium on Saturday.</p>
<p>The left-hander held the innings together for 216 minutes, hitting seven fours, to see Sri Lanka recover from 90 for four to 254 for five at the close.</p>
<p>Tillekeratne, at ease on the slow pitch which suited his style of play, was involved in two stands which checked the touring side.</p>
<p>He added 89 for the fifth wicket with his captain Arjuna Ranatunga, who made a good 49 in 168 minutes before falling to a bat-pad catch at short-leg off part-time spinner Asif Mujtaba.</p>
<p>Tillekeratne found another able ally in Romesh Kaluwitharana, who helped to add 75 in an unfinished stand for the sixth wicket.</p>
<p>Kaluwitharana, who got off to a quick start, struck seven fours in his unbeaten 48 which took 92 minutes.</p>
<p>Pakistan, without injured strike bowlers Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, initally gained the upper hand through Mushtaq Ahmed's wrist spin, after Ranatunga won the toss and opted to bat.</p>
<p>Sanath Jayasuriya and test debutant Russel Arnold put on 61 for the first wicket before Mushtaq struck twice just before lunch.</p>
<p>Jayasuriya made 31 with four fours before being bowled when attempting to cut a leg-break from Mushtaq.</p>
<p>Arnold, playing in place of the injured Roshan Mahanama, made a sedate 24 in nearly two hours before Mushtaq beat him in flight and bowled him.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka lost Marvan Atapattu for a duck - his sixth in nine test innings - when off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq had him caught at silly point by Salim Elahi.</p>
<p>At this stage Sri Lanka had lost three wickets for three runs and were 64 for three.</p>
<p>Aravinda de Silva sparkled briefly with 23 off 31 balls, with four fours, before Mushtaq drew him out of his crease and Moin Khan made the stumping. The decision was left to the third umpire, as de Silva was only fractionally out of his crease.</p>
<p>While Saqlain bowled economically to take one for 67 in 31 overs, Mushtaq proved costly in the later stages of the day as Ranatunga scored off him with ease. His three wickets cost 100 runs in 24 overs.</p>
<p>Pakistan are playing two tests on their short tour.</p>
