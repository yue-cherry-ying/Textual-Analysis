<title>ISRAEL: Thousands in anti-Netanyahu protest in Tel Aviv.</title>
<headline>Thousands in anti-Netanyahu protest in Tel Aviv.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1997-06-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Chanting &quot;Bibi resign&quot;, tens of thousands of Israelis demonstrated against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday in the Tel Aviv square where Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated.</p>
<p>The protest organised by the Movement For Early Elections, which says it is unaffiliated with any political party, was the biggest anti-Netanyahu demonstration in Israel since the right-wing Likud leader became prime minister a year ago.</p>
<p>It coincided with tensions within Netanyahu's fractious coalition and a Middle East peace crisis over his government's building of a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Many in the crowd in Rabin Square wore stickers with a photo of a scowling Netanyahu and the slogan &quot;Bibi is bad for all of us&quot;.</p>
<p>But most of the demonstrators appeared to be Ashkenazis -- Jews of European descent -- and not Sepharadi, or Middle Eastern Jews, who provide the Likud with its power base.</p>
<p>Police gave no official estimate of the size of the crowd but Israel Radio said between 40,000 and 50,000 people were in the plaza where Labour Prime Minister Rabin had addressed a peace rally in 1995 moments before he was shot.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has vowed to lead Israel into the 21st century but some political analysts have predicted his government of right-wing, religious and immigrants' parties will not survive until the next elections scheduled for the year 2000.</p>
<p>The prime minister won a no-confidence vote in parliament on Tuesday but 11 coalition legislators pointedly withheld their support, angry at they view as his autocratic style of government.</p>
<p>In a separate demonstration a few blocks from Rabin Square, thousands of secular Jews took part in a &quot;Stop the ultraorthodox&quot; protest.</p>
<p>The gathering was held against the backdrop of the recent closure at the behest of ultraorthodox Jews of a main Jerusalem street to traffic on the Jewish Sabbath and a controversy in Israel and Jewish communities abroad over conversion to Judaism.</p>
