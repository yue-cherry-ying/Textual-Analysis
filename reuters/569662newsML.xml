<p>Three firefighters were killed and more than a dozen injured battling an explosion and fire that released toxic fumes at an Arkansas chemical plant Thursday, emergency officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's bad. I don't know how much worse it's going to get. I'm not sure anybody knows right now,&quot; Arkansas State Police spokesman Wayne Jordan said.  </p>
<p>The explosion released azinphos-methyl, an insecticide that attacks the central nervous system and is used as a pesticide and to control mites, a hazardous materials expert said.</p>
<p>Brief exposures can generate symptoms ranging from breathing problems to paralysis. Longer exposures could cause permanent, degenerative damage to the central nervous system, University of Houston chemist James Cox said.</p>
<p>&quot;If I were exposed to it I would regard it as exceedingly hazardous,&quot; Cox said.</p>
<p>The explosion at the BPS Co. chemical plant in northeast Arkansas released an &quot;unknown quantity of toxic gas&quot; into the air, Arkansas Office of Emergency Services spokeswoman Francis Huddleston said.</p>
