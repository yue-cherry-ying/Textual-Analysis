<p>The privatization of Brazilian mining giant CVRD ends an era of industrial selloffs and sets the stage for multibillion dollar sales of state-run utilities and telephone firms, analysts said.</p>
<p>Tuesday's auction of a 41.73 percent voting stake in CVRD to a group led by Brazilian steelmaker CSN was the last of a series of sales of manufacturing and industrial companies in the country's six-year-old privatization program.  </p>
<p>The government's selloff of CVRD -- a conglomerate including aluminum, steel, pulp and paper industries -- is to be finally concluded late this year with the global offering of a 28-percent voting stake.</p>
<p>&quot;The CVRD privatization sets the tone for upcoming sales of utilities and public services. Now the government will dedicate exclusively to concessions and infrastructure,&quot; said Luiz Chrysostomo de Oliveira Filho, director at Banco Patrimonio/Salomon Brothers.  </p>
<p>Brazil is expected to raise some $25 billion in 1997 and 1998 with federal and state-level privatizations, according to government estimates.</p>
<p>The government will concentrate its efforts in selling power distributors and generators, ports, sewage firms, concessions to run roads and telephone companies.</p>
<p>Last year, federal privatization receipts totalled $4.1 billion. In 1997, the CRVD selloff alone is expected to net the government at least a total of five billion dollars.  </p>
<p>Sao Paulo state is expected to begin privatizing its network of power utilities by October. Companhia Paulista de Forca e Luz, or CPFL, is the state's first power unit slated for the auction block.</p>
<p>The federal government kicked off the privatization of the telecommunications sector by taking bids for Band B cellular concessions. But the choicest assets in the telecom industry are are federal Telebras' subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Analysts expect the first Telebras units to be sold off late this year or early in 1998.  </p>
<p>They also said the CVRD auction, which faced a long legal battle, reinforces the government's commitment to its privatization drive.</p>
<p>&quot;What was more important was the government's will to overcome all political difficulties. It gave a clear signal that it wants to consolidate its privatization process,&quot; said Jose Mauro Delella, economist at Lloyds Bank, Brazil.</p>
<p>Brazil's privatization program started with the sale of the federal government's interests in the steel sector. It moved to the petrochemical industry and just recently entered the area of infrastructure and public services by selling almost all of federal rail concessions and two power distributors.</p>
<p>It took several years for the government to sell the assets, prompting criticism its program was moving slowly. But the sale of most of the government's industrial firms has prepared the ground for the privatization of large public utilities.</p>
