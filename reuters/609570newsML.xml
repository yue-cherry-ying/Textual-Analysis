<p>French bond futures settled higher ahead of the first round of voting in a parliamentary election on Sunday after a volatile day's trading, rife with talk about private polls which traders said was weighing on the franc late in the session.</p>
<p>The June bond future settled up 0.16 at 129.00 while June PIBOR, probably most at risk to an adverse reaction in the case of an election upset, was unchanged. The French franc slipped as low as 3.3704 against the mark from 3.3676.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very choppy today,&quot; said a trader at a French brokerage in Paris.  </p>
<p>The spread between French and German 10-year bond yields remained stable at minus 15 basis points.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said the market was pricing in a win for the ruling centre-right coalition so the risk remained that a strong showing by the opposition left could hit French assets, especially at the short end of the curve.</p>
<p>French law prohibits the publication of private poll results in France the week before the first round of voting or inbetween the two rounds.  </p>
<p>&quot;In percentage terms, 37 percent or less for the centre-right in the first round would be dangerous territory and a real cause for concern for the markets,&quot; Iain Lindsay, senior bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais said.</p>
<p>Marie Owens-Thomsen of BIP said most investors appeared to be waiting on the sidelines for now to wait for the election dust to settle.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think people are shorting the French market or thinking about a negative outcome. People would rather sit it out and get back in when it is over,&quot; she said.  </p>
<p>The results of the first round of voting were due Sunday evening so the first opportunity investors will have to PIBOR or bond futures will be the start of the GLOBEX session on Monday at 0500 GMT.</p>
