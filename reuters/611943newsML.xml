<p>ASIAN FOREX ACTIVITY:</p>
<p>0003 GMT</p>
<p>*Dollar down vs yen on interbank dealer selling partly due to fall in Aussie/yen in Tokyo after Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut official cash interest rate by 0.5 percentage point to 5.5 percent. Aussie/yen around 88.96/06 yen at 0011 GMT.</p>
<p>*Dollar supported near 115.50 yen with steady bids seen.</p>
<p>*Australian dollar slumped against U.S. dollar to 3-month low on rate cut in Sydney. Aussie dollar was quoted at US$0.7675/85 at 0011 GMT, versus US$0.7761/66 just before RBA annoucement.  </p>
<p>*A trust bank dealer said interbank dealers and possibly some securites houses were keen to sell Aussie against yen, which indirectly weighed on dollar versus yen.</p>
<p>*He added Aussie will find technical support near 88.60 yen, but if it clearly breaks below that point, it could fall toward 86.50 yen.</p>
<p>*But a city bank dealer said the impact was still limited, with steady bids emerging near 115.50 yen, supporting dollar's downside.</p>
<p>*Dollar offers from exporters likely above 116 yen, some dealers said.  </p>
<p>*Dealers said growing perception that dollar's recent sharp drop has stopped, at least for now, may encourage traders to buy dollars for yen, while market watches for any comments by monetary officials.</p>
<p>*&quot;Recent comments by Japanese monetary officials have suggested that they are also concerned about the yen's rapid and excessive rise,&quot; a city bank dealer said.</p>
<p>*He added that Japanese institutional investors may start buying dollars, as they think risk of further dollar fall has ended for now, given such official comments.  </p>
<p>*Dealers said they will keep focusing on comments from monetary authorities as market seeks near-term direction. *Dollar received boost on Thursday after Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka supported current policy of Bank of Japan to maintain low interest rates.</p>
<p>*His comments helped ease expectations of imminent rise in Japanese official discount rate by central bank, dealers said.</p>
<p>*Finance Minister Mitsuzuka and Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita expected to attend credit associations meeting at 0600 GMT.</p>
