<p>Hundreds of Hong Kong people on Friday rushed to snap up the latest in a gush of souvenirs of the British colony's looming handover to China -- special Bank of England five-pound notes with a commemorative 1997 cipher.</p>
<p>And in the best tradition of this money-spinning territory, it wasn't the memory that was so important but the prospect of the banknotes making huge gains in value.</p>
<p>&quot;The value has the potential to go up, it's a beautiful design, it's a limited edition, so I think it's a very good buy, said housewife Elaine Fong, as she scrambled to pick up one of the bills, on sale at a financial services fair.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very pleased to see so many people. I thought there would be a good response,&quot; Robin Baker, commercial operations manager of the Bank of England, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Long queues snaked in and out of the Hong Kong Convention Centre, with crowds avoiding other stalls and the main purpose of the fair -- to view and deal in the currencies of the world.</p>
<p>Word had got around that the venerable old central bank had reconfigured its presses to print 500,000 five pounds notes numbered with &quot;HK97&quot; serials.</p>
<p>Single notes cost HK$138 to HK$150 (US$17.85 to US$19.40), while an uncut sheet with 35 of the notes cost HK$5,000.</p>
<p>Those with unusual numbers were auctioned off. A note with the serial number &quot;HK97 979797&quot; fetched HK$68,000.</p>
<p>Britain is handing its colony of 156 years back to China at midnight this June 30, and the territory has seen a flurry of souvenir items hit the streets, ranging from t-shirts and pens to stamps, coins and watches commemorating the flag change.</p>
<p>(US$1 = HK$7.73)</p>
