<p>Total advertising expenditure in Britain is expected to grow 6.9 percent in 1997 in constant prices, slightly down from the 7.0 percent growth rate posted in 1996, Zenith Media said on Friday.</p>
<p>The 1997 forecast represented a 3.8 percent increase in real terms, after accounting for inflation, it said.</p>
<p>Television revenues, which increased 6.9 percent in 1996 in constant prices, are expected to gain by 5.8 percent this year, said Zenith, the media planning and buying arm of advertising and marketing group Cordiant Plc.</p>
<p>Radio continues to be the fastest-growing advertising medium in Britain and is forecast to grow 12 percent in 1997, down from 14 percent growth in 1996, Zenith said.</p>
<p>Zenith, which said the outlook for advertising expenditure has improved since its last forecast in September 1996, said total advertising expenditure is expected to grow 5.9 percent in 1998.</p>
<p>Advertising expenditure in 1996 totalled 10.5 billion pounds ($17.1 billion), representing 1.4 percent of Britain's gross domestic product. Zenith said that by the year 2003 it expects advertising will reach 15.1 billion pounds or 1.5 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>In looking at the UK television market, Zenith said it expects Channel 5, the country's fifth terrestrial station which launched on March 25, to attract 80 million pounds in advertising revenue and a five percent share of the viewing audience this year.</p>
<p>Zenith said it expects ITV, Britain's leading commercial TV station, to grow advertising revenues one percent in 1996 to 1.675 billion pounds. But Zenith expects ITV's revenues in real terms to fall over the next seven years, dropping to 1.465 billion pounds in 2003.</p>
