<p>Rescue teams scrambled to evacuate people from inundated areas throughout the eastern Czech Republic on Tuesday as some of the worst flooding this century worsened.</p>
<p>Torrential rains began battering the Northern Moravia region on Saturday and showed no signs of relenting on Tuesday as flood waters from the Morava and Opava rivers and smaller tributaries pushed downstream, forcing thousands from their homes.</p>
<p>The Czech news agency CTK said that 18 people were missing and presumed drowned in the floods. Districts under a state of emergency expanded, and rescue officials redoubled their calls for humanitarian aid, including drinking water.</p>
<p>Television footage from various locations throughout the area showed cars floating away in some villages and water reaching up to the ubiquitous ceramic-tiled roofs.</p>
<p>Forecasts said heavy rain would continue into Tuesday night, and the first respite might come on Wednesday when the storms from a static weather pattern were expected to ease.</p>
<p>The second city of Brno in the southeast started seeing the brunt of the flooding, which had already forced evacuations in parts of other cities such as Ostrava and Opava.</p>
<p>Parts of southern Poland, Slovakia, and Austria have also been swamped by the heavy midsummer rain.</p>
<p>Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and parliamentary chairman Milos Zeman, usually strident political enemies, flew together over the flooded zone to survey the damage.</p>
<p>They told CTK in Ostrava that they agreed the first priority was to provide what was necessary to protect lives and then look for long-term help for displaced residents.</p>
<p>The government on Monday dispatched helicopters, soldiers, police and fire units to aid in rescue efforts, and begin housing evacuees in hotels and dormatories.</p>
<p>In Litovel, a town of about 10,000 residents north of the city of Olomouc, utility trucks brought in rubber dinghies to ferry people to safety. By mid-afternoon the water was still rising at chest level in the worst places.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people from the higher floors don't want to leave their homes, but many are leaving,&quot; Jiri Vrba, a rescue worker told Reuters as he made another attempt to get to stranded residents in Litovel.</p>
<p>&quot;One old man we were evacuating said he has never seen so much water around in the last 70 years he's been living in the same place.&quot;</p>
<p>The flooding is believed to have been responsible for destabilising a bridge which caused the derailing on Monday of a Vienna-to-Warsaw express train near the Czech city of Ostrava. Sixty-four people were injured, 10 seriously.</p>
