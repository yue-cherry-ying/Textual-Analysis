<p>Hungarian privatisation agency APV Rt and MOL Rt officials said on Thursday they were confident the domestic issue of MOL shares will be successful.</p>
<p>&quot;All signs point to a similar (subscriber) interest to the international private placement,&quot; APV General Director Pal Szabo told a news conference.</p>
<p>APV has offered 12.3 million shares or a 12.5 percent stake in MOL internationally, with a 2.5 percent over-allotment option, and a one percent stake with a three percent over-allotment option domestically.</p>
<p>The domestic subscription will start on May 12, at an issue price of 2,970 forints per share.</p>
<p>Szabo said that after the international roadshow from April 21 to May 2, the stake was more than six times or some $1.2 billion oversubscribed.</p>
<p>The proportion of U.S. investors was 41 percent, followed by the UK with 35 percent, Europe with 16 percent and the Middle and Far East with 8 percent, Szabo said.</p>
<p>&quot;This shows that even traditionally conservative Japanese investors were prepared to venture into buying these shares,&quot; Szabo said.</p>
<p>MOL's General Director Zoltan Mandoki said the company wants to prove it can grow into a true multinational.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue our expansion plans in the neighbouring countries... and we are also expanding our exploration and mining activity,&quot; Mandoki said.</p>
<p>He said MOL has not abandoned its plans to buy a 12.5 percent stake in the Adriatic pipeline but would only do so as a strategic investor with a proportional role in decision-making.</p>
<p>The Croatian privatisation agency HFP accepted in January MOL's offer of some 90 million German marks for a 12.5 percent stake in the pipeline operator Janaf but the deal is yet to be concluded.</p>
<p>Mandoki also said the company, which had made a loss on its gas sales for the last years, hopes that the government will fulfill its legal obligation of an eight percent return on equity for the energy sector.</p>
<p>Hungary promised investors in its privatised energy sector an eight percent return on investment.</p>
<p>The first energy prices adjusted to that effect were set in January and are revised quarterly by Hungary's Energy Office.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of our costs, like the 22 billion forints invested in the Zsana gas storage facility, were not taken into account when prices were set,&quot; Mandoki said.</p>
<p>On the Budapest Stock Exchange, MOL shares closed at 3,460 forints, down 30.</p>
