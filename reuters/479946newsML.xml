<p>The Oklahoma City bombing trial opened on Monday with lawyers for Timothy McVeigh trying to find out if potential jurors knew about news reports he allegedly admitted planting the bomb that killed 168 people.</p>
<p>McVeigh, 28, who if found guilty could be executed, read juror questionnaires, whispered to his lawyers and occasionally smiled and joked as the process of selecting a jury began.</p>
<p>Delayed once and its venue moved twice, the trial of the man accused of blowing up the Alfred P. Murrah federal building which killed 168 people on April 19, 1995 could last up to four months.</p>
<p>Both sides worried that it might take weeks to seat a panel of 12, plus six alternates. Only six prospective jurors were questioned during the first day and at least three of them expressed strong reservations about serving in a trial that may last at least four months.</p>
<p>Chief defence attorney Stephen Jones zeroed in on whether jurors were influenced by news reports that McVeigh had admitted to his attorneys that he planted the bomb. The first man questioned said he had heard of the reports, which McVeigh's lawyers deny, but said that would not affect his decision.</p>
<p>Prosecutors wanted to know if jurors had been influenced by speculation the federal government had staged the bombing or at least knew about it and did nothing -- contentions the defence might make once the trial starts.</p>
<p>One of the six had heard of allegations that the government may have been behind the bombing.</p>
<p>McVeigh was on trial for the &quot;use of a weapon of mass destruction&quot; and the murder of eight federal officials. A second defendant, his former Army buddy Terry Nichols, will be tried separately on charges resulting from the worst domestic bombing in U.S. history. No date has been set for that trial.</p>
<p>Three marshals sat behind McVeigh as a sign of the intense security. The federal courthouse was ringed by concrete barriers and surveillance cameras swept the sidewalks.</p>
<p>Trash cans were removed and replaced by clear plastic bags and manhole covers were sealed. Courtroom visitors had to go through metal detectors and show picture identification.</p>
<p>Prospective jurors were called by U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch from a pool of 1,000 people who filled in a 40- page questionnaire on background and opinions about the case.</p>
<p>The first prospective juror, who was hidden from the public by a courtroom screen, said he knew about mixing explosives and thought there was government &quot;overkill&quot; in the Branch Davidian siege in Waco, Texas, that killed some 80 people in 1993, an event the prosecution said McVeigh wanted to avenge.</p>
<p>Identified only as juror 858, he admitted knowing about news reports of McVeigh's alleged confession but said he quickly turned away from the radio when the story came on.</p>
<p>The potential juror said he would not be influenced by the reports, adding: &quot;It's not the first time that the press was wrong and not the last time. They want to sell their broadcasts and newspapers ... I don't know if they are wrong, I don't know if they are right.&quot;</p>
<p>Other prospective jurors included two grandmothers who talked about seeing pictures of McVeigh on television and a woman who said she had suffered two nervous breakdowns. An unemployed pipefitter said he did not believe he could sit in judgment of another person. One woman, whose birthday falls on April 19, said she has come to dread that date.</p>
<p>A tense-looking William McVeigh, the defendant's father, was in court, where 12 seats were also set aside for the survivors and family members of those killed.</p>
<p>Tom Kight, whose stepdaughter Frankie Merrell, 23, died in the blast, said the family was still haunted by her loss. &quot;Yesterday was a difficult day because it was Easter. We were recalling hiding Easter eggs when Frankie was small,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In Oklahoma City, a closed-circuit telecast was beamed to a Federal Aviation Administration facility where survivors and family of the victims could see the proceedings.</p>
