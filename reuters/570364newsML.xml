<headline>LIFFE white sugar tightly mixed, shuns tender news.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>London white sugar futures were reluctant to stir into life on Thursday with little activity expected despite the emergence of fresh physical news, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a bit of buying around but it's quiet,&quot; said one trader, noting the Ascension Day holiday in Europe and the start of the Moslem New Year.</p>
<p>The bulk of the light volume in London came from a trade of the October/December spread at $2.00. At 1155 GMT nearby positions were tightly mixed, with August up 30 cents at $312.00 and October unchanged at $303.20.</p>
<p>Overall volume reached a light 403 lots.</p>
<p>Technical analysts placed critical support for August at $308.00 with resistance points at $315.00 and $317.50. London largely ignored news that Pakistan had scrapped its tender to buy 50,000 tonnes of crystal whites as this had already been rumoured in the market.</p>
<p>Traders said Iran's tender to buy another cargo of whites was not expected to result in a sale as Iran's domestic demand was thought to be well covered.</p>
<p>Tunisia has tendered to buy a cargo of raw sugar but results are not expected for some time on account of the Moslem holiday.</p>
<p>The Paris market is market is closed on Thursday.</p>
