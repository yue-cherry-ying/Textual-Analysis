<p>Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali said on Saturday his government wanted to speed up privatisation.</p>
<p>&quot;We are concerned with going forward with the privatisation programme,&quot; he said in a message read on his behalf by Prime Minister Hamed Karoui at a meeting of chief executives of state firms.</p>
<p>&quot;Regarding the sectors where there is competition, we will act to speed up the rhythm of privatisations during the coming period,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;The opening up of the capital of public firms will continue,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ben Ali reiterated his government's long standing privatisation policy, saying that &quot;strategic firms&quot; supplying public services were to remain public, while those called &quot;non-strategic&quot; and in sectors where there is competition were to be privatised.</p>
<p>He called on public firms to enter into a &quot;contract of programme&quot; with the government and to improve their management.</p>
<p>A tender was opened last month to sell a Hilton -managed hotel in Tunis as part of a push to sell the last three hotels still owned by the state by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The government also plans to launch a tender this year to sell one cement factory, part of plans to sell the country's six cement firms.</p>
<p>Officials earlier this year said Tunisia wanted  to privatise 63 public firms by the end on 1997.</p>
<p>In 1996, there were 32 privatisation operations carried out, with the sale of 19 state-owned firms.</p>
