<title>AUSTRALIA: Scientist fails to silence creationist over Noah's Ark.</title>

<p>An Australian scientist on Monday failed in a legal bid to silence a creationist over claims about Noah's Ark in a battle over rival theories of human origins.</p>
<p>Geology professor Ian Plimer failed to convince a judge that creationist and church elder Allen Roberts had breached fair trade laws by making false claims during a lecture tour in 1992.</p>
<p>Federal Court judge Ronald Sackville dismissed the case after ruling the legislation did not apply because Roberts was not involved in a commercial venture aimed at profit.</p>
<p>But despite ruling in Roberts' favour, the judge found the creationist did make false representations in describing his explorations of what some believe is the resting place of Noah's Ark at a site near Mount Ararat in Turkey.</p>
<p>The case, which began on April 7, had at its centre two opposing theories over the earth's and man origins.</p>
<p>Creationists believe the world was created over seven days, 6,000 to 10,000 years ago, a view generally dismissed by science which almost universally accepts Darwin's theory of evolution.</p>
<p>Much of the debate has centred around the existence, or not, of Noah's Ark.</p>
<p>Roberts, a church elder, described the outcome as a victory for free speech.</p>
<p>&quot;The judgment that was handed down has in fact preserved the free speech of anyone who has something to say publicly,&quot; he told reporters outside the court.</p>
<p>&quot;I trust in future they will not be harassed and pursued in courts by someone who disagrees with them on ideological grounds,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In a separate claim, Roberts was found to have breached copyright by claiming the written work of American marine salvage expert David Fasold on the site in Turkey as his own.</p>
<p>The judge awarded Fasold damages of A$2,500 ($1,900), saying the author, who contained his work in a 1988 book &quot;The Ark of Noah&quot;, had not suffered a significant financial loss.</p>
<p>Plimer, who said the case had ruined him financially, said his stance against the conduct of creationists had been vindicated.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very happy that the judge found that there had been misleading conduct,&quot; Plimer, who has a long history of challenging creationist theories, said outside the court.</p>
<p>&quot;That is what binds creationist theory -- it is not science, it is misleading and deceptive,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>(A$=US$0.76)</p>
