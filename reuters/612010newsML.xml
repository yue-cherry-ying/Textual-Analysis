<p>Several leaders from Germany's Free Democrats (FDP) said on Friday the party would remain firmly opposed to tax increases to fill holes in the government's budget.</p>
<p>Speaking ahead of the FDP's party congress in Wiesbaden this weekend, deputy FDP chairman Rainer Bruederle and former justice minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger said tax increases would be harmful for the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not yield on our concept of tax reduction, even if we run the danger of annoying our coalition partners,&quot; Bruederle said in an interview with ZDF television.</p>
<p>He said there could be no retreat on the government's earlier promise to lower the so-called &quot;solidarity&quot; income tax surcharge by two points to 5.5 percent in 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;We will only be able to break the logjam on the necessary reforms with a reduction in the tax burden,&quot; Bruederle said in another interview with German radio.</p>
<p>The party, which provides Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right alliance with its 12-seat parliamentary majority, has styled itself as the champion of lower taxes but now faces pressure to agree to a tax hike to fill a projected budget shortfall of 18 billion marks ($10.5 billion).</p>
<p>FDP leader Wolfgang Gerhardt has repeatedly opposed a rise in fuel tax or value-added tax -- two options Finance Minister Theo Waigel has not ruled out as he battles to meet the entry criteria for Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to do everything we can to consolidate the budget without always resorting to raising taxes,&quot; said Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger in an interview with NDR radio.</p>
