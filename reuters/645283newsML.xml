<p>Israel denied on Saturday a meeting had been set between Israeli and Palestinian representatives for Sunday in Cairo.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman issued the denial hours after Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa announced the two sides would meet to discuss the impasse in peacemaking prompted by Israel's settlement building.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of a meeting tomorrow between Israeli and Palestinian respresentatives was raised but no meeting has been set,&quot; said Shai Bazak.</p>
<p>&quot;The contacts aimed at reviving peace talks continue,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Moussa spoke to reporters after Palestinian President Yasser Arafat briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo on his latest contacts with the Israelis. He said Arafat had met on Friday with an adviser to Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Arafat returned to Gaza after his meeting with Mubarak. His aides said he would travel to Amman on Sunday.</p>
<p>Egypt has stepped up mediation efforts since a summit between Mubarak and Netanyahu last month.</p>
<p>The Sunday meeting would centre on &quot;important points connected with the peace process, including settlements&quot;, Moussa said, adding that Netanyau's adviser gave Arafat new Israeli ideas to break the deadlock in talks.</p>
<p>He did not identify the Israeli adviser or the experts who would take part in the Cairo meeting but said an Egyptian representative would attend as an observer.</p>
<p>A PLO official named the Israeli adviser who met Arafat on Friday as Yitzhak Molkho and said the two men agreed on the Sunday meeting in Cairo.</p>
<p>He said Arafat turned down an Israeli proposal for a summit with Netanyahu but Palestinian representatives agreed to the Egyptian suggestion that &quot;experts&quot; from both sides hold talks.</p>
<p>Israel-PLO peace talks plunged into crisis in March when Netanyahu launched a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources said on Friday Egypt and the Palestinians were working on a five-point plan which included a freeze on any change in the status of Jerusalem and a ban on Jewish settlement of the West Bank for &quot;a sufficient period&quot;.</p>
<p>In return the Palestinians would give a firm commitment to address Israel's security demands, they added.</p>
<p>PLO officials said they would agree to return to the negotiating table if Israel accepted a freeze on settlement activities until both sides concluded talks on the final status of the West Bank, including Arab East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Palestinians said they were briefed in Cairo on the Egyptian plan and that the Israeli position had not changed.</p>
<p>&quot;Until now there is nothing new from the Israelis, they still refuse to freeze settlement activities,&quot; said Arafat's adviser, Nabil Abu Rdainah.</p>
<p>Bazak denied reports Israel was willing to halt construction at the East Jerusalem settlement site which Israel calls Har Homa and Arabs refer to as Jabal Abu Ghneim.</p>
