<headline>INSIGHT -FTSE to plod along up to about 4,675.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>The FTSE 100 index will lack sufficient pace to take it above 4,675 on the upside, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>Aggressive strides to higher levels, expected earlier in the week have now developed into a plod after a restrained performance by the gilts market, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;With Wall Street being similarly held back as well as a long weekend to follow, the envoronment is not one in which the FTSE can easily romp ahead,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>By 0731 GMT, the FTSE was up 1.7 at 4,653.5.  </p>
<p>Turnover in UK equities is likely to tail off later in the day as investor attention focuses more on the forthcoming three day holiday weekend.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, the fact that the FTSE has managed to make higher intra-day lows over the past three days offers hope to market bulls that at least 4,620 is a reasonably secure support area for the short-term.</p>
<p>&quot;It may have difficulty going too far above its 10 day moving average and the market could fall back a little if this is not successfully overcome,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the FTSE's 10 day moving average was at 4,660.  </p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 32.56 at 7,258.13 on Thursday.</p>
