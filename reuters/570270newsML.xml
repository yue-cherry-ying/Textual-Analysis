<p>Cosmetics retailer Body Shop International Plc reported a three percent drop in annual profits on Thursday after making a 6.5 million pound ($10.5 million) provision for its struggling franchise business in France.</p>
<p>The company, best known for its high profile campaigns on &quot;green&quot; issues, said profits before tax and exceptional provisions rose 17 percent to 38.2 million pounds ($62 million), but were 31.7 million after the provision, lower than 1996's pretax profit of 32.7 million.</p>
<p>Total retail sales rose eight percent to 622.5 million, but comparable store sales were flat.</p>
<p>Managing director Stuart Rose said Body Shop was in talks with a number of major French retailers to take over the head franchise for the struggling stores in France.</p>
<p>Rose told Reuters the business needed a French retailer to run it rather than the existing British franchisee.</p>
<p>He said sales in France had suffered from a bombing campaign in the country in 1995 and had never recovered. Rose said Body Shop had looked at taking the French franchise over itself.</p>
<p>&quot;We looked at taking it over but decided against it because it really does need a major French retailer to run it.&quot;</p>
<p>Rose said they would make a decision in the next three months. He said total retail sales in France in the past year were 8.9 million stg, down six percent on the previous year.</p>
<p>The company, brainchild of outspoken businesswoman Anita Roddick, has found life increasingly tough as competitors have copied its natural cosmetics, made from ingredients like seaweed and banana.</p>
<p>The business has grown from a single store in England, which opened 21 years ago, into an international franchising group, with nearly 1,500 outlets in 47 countries.</p>
<p>But growing profits has become increasingly challenging.</p>
<p>Sales in Europe as a whole last year were down one percent based on comparable stores.</p>
<p>Its key growth market remained Asia, where total turnover rose to 35.7 million pounds from 28 million.</p>
<p>Rose said sales in Japan alone were up 50 percent last year. Body Shop has 87 stores in Japan and plans to open another 25 this year.</p>
<p>Comparable store sales in Asia overall were up two percent, against an increase of 15 percent in the previous year. Rose said this reflected new stores taking some business from existing stores as well as changes in the retail economy.</p>
<p>This year there are plans to open about 120 new stores worldwide, over half of which will be in Asia.</p>
<p>In Britain, Body Shop is trying to revive flat sales and profits, which have not benefited from relatively upbeat consumer spending.</p>
<p>Rose said the group was testing out a new store format, launching new products and starting its first ever advertising campaign.</p>
<p>This will use bill-boards and other media but not television and will be linked to the launch of a new range of aromatherapy products.</p>
<p>In the United States, where the group has struggled to make its mark, Body Shop managed to reduce a like-for-like sales decline of six percent in 1995/96 to three percent. But operating losses increased to three million pounds from 1.3 million.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very difficult market, of course, very competitive and it just takes a very long time to get yourself established which we believe we are now doing,&quot; Rose said.</p>
<p>Body Shop's shares stood two pence lower at 188.5 pence. ($ = 0.616 British Pounds)</p>
