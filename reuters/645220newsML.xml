<p>Russia is dying, its doctors said on Saturday, warning that the population was shrinking at a rate never before seen in peacetime and accusing the government of failing in its legal duty to provide health care.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia is losing its main state asset -- its citizens,&quot; the Russian Pirogov Congress of Physicians said in a resolution after a three-day meeting of over 1,700 leading doctors.</p>
<p>The resolution, quoted by Interfax news agency, decried the &quot;unprecedented peacetime decline in the Russian population.&quot;</p>
<p>State statistics show the country is losing about a million of its 150 million people every year, as the death rate outstrips the birth rate by 1.6 times. A third of those dying are still of working age, the doctors noted.</p>
<p>Economic hardships since the collapse of the Soviet Union have damaged Russians' health and state medical care for ordinary people has declined.</p>
<p>Men in particular, who also suffer from high levels of alcoholism, have seen their average life expectancy sink to 58, at least 15 years less than men in west Europe.</p>
<p>The doctors sent a letter to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin arguing that the government was in breach of its constitutional obligation to provide free health care.</p>
<p>They resolved to take the issue to the state prosecutor and Constitutional Court.</p>
