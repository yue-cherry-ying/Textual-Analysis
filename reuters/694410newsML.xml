<p>Tens of thousands of Taiwanese braved Saturday downpours to join a massive &quot;Say No to China&quot; rally, demanding their island not be swallowed up like Hong Kong but granted a U.N. seat as a new Republic of Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;Taiwan is Taiwan, China is China!&quot; rain-drenched protesters thundered in a huge square outside Taipei City Hall.</p>
<p>&quot;Taiwan independence! Say no to China! Say yes to Taiwan!&quot;</p>
<p>The festive throng estimated by police at well over 70,000 -- one of the biggest in Taiwan history -- came out to denounce communist China's longtime claim to their island and assail the 1984 Sino-British pact by which Hong Kong, without its people's consent, will be handed to Beijing at midnight on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not oppose China, but if they want to swallow us up, that's different,&quot; said retiree Hwu Han-Min, 70, who lamented what he regarded a light turnout. &quot;There should be 500,000.&quot;</p>
<p>Organisers spoke of a defining moment for Taiwan democracy.</p>
<p>&quot;In this important moment we must tell the world that Taiwan is not Hong Kong, that Taiwan is not part of China,&quot; said Peng Min-ming, a Democratic Progressive Party leader who lost to Nationalist Lee Teng-hui in the 1996 presidential election.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the same. People are not the same. Taiwan is a sovereign, independent democratic country. ... We want to use this moment to tell the world not to trust China.&quot;</p>
<p>Though the rain began to let up after dark, many people were drenched in their &quot;Say No to China, Say Yes to Taiwan&quot; T-shirts after a rain-soaked afternoon march on the president's office.</p>
<p>&quot;Republic of Taiwan&quot; flags fluttered everywhere.</p>
<p>Reflecting the political complexity of Taiwan's boisterous decade-old democracy, rival groups were staging a counter-rally on Sunday to hail the end of colonial rule in Hong Kong and advocate Taiwan's eventual reunification with China.</p>
<p>Whatever their stand on independence, Taiwan political groups universally reject what Beijing regards as a generous offer -- reunion under the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; model of local autonomy that underlies Hong Kong's handback.</p>
<p>Beijing, which has viewed Nationalist-ruled Taiwan as a rebel province since a 1949 civil war split, vows to attack if Taipei stops advocating reunion and pursues independence.</p>
<p>Yet independence was Saturday's battle cry, symbolised by a score of Taiwan aborigines doing a war dance in loincloths.</p>
<p>&quot;The Hong Kong people had no choice and are being forced to reunite with China,&quot; said protest organiser Hsu Ching-hsiung.</p>
<p>&quot;As for Taiwan's people, we still have a choice. We came today to prove to people that we differ from Hong Kong.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. ex-congressman Stephen Solarz, invoking President John Kennedy's famous 1963 &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot; address in a divided Cold War Berlin, drew cheers by using local dialect to declaim &quot;Wa see Daiwan lan&quot; -- I am a Taiwanese.</p>
<p>&quot;I am here to say yes to the democracy of Taiwan and no to China for the use of force against Taiwan,&quot; he said, noting that such a protest would have been illegal when he visited 20 years ago, as Taiwan was still under martial law.</p>
<p>A U.N. charter member, the Republic of China was expelled in 1972 and replaced by Beijing as the sole Chinese member.</p>
<p>Taipei has applied for a separate Republic of China seat, saying Taiwan's 21 million people deserve representation, but Beijing has shot down the annual efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;It's only a matter of hours now before Hong Kong becomes a part of China. And under China's plan, they would like to make Taiwan another Hong Kong,&quot; said protest leader Lin Shan-Tien.</p>
<p>&quot;This is very dangerous and that's why we've come out today to unify under the name 'Republic of Taiwan' to join the United Nations. Once we are in the U.N., we will have the international security system to safeguard us.&quot;</p>
