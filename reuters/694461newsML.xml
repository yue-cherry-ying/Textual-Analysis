<title>HONG KONG: Britain and China agree on HK archive transfer.</title>
<headline>Britain and China agree on HK archive transfer.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-06-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain and China on Saturday solved a lingering diplomatic wrangle of Hong Kong's transfer when they agreed what archives, from sensitive military files to local intelligence information, should be handed over.</p>
<p>Two days before the transition, only the very broadest details were announced in a carefully-worded memo of understanding on a matter under negotiation for eight months.</p>
<p>There was no mention of issues like files on dissidents who fled China either to live in Hong Kong or passed on their way to other countries like the United States.</p>
<p>The South China Morning Post said on Saturday personal files on about 13 mainland dissidents who chose to stay on in Hong Kong have been shipped to London.</p>
<p>The group arrived as illegal immigrants. &quot;The immigration records will show no tradce of their identities,&quot; said a source close to the colonial government.</p>
<p>The so-called &quot;Sino-British Agreed Minute on the Transfer of the Hong Kong Archives&quot; said Britain would give up to China local archives &quot;needed for the normal administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in future.&quot;</p>
<p>The use of the words &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;future&quot; appeared to give Britain a diplomatic way out of turning over historical files that might have been useful to China in tracking down anti-Beijing elements in Hong Kong and abroad.</p>
<p>The memo said Britain agreed to consult China three months in advance, and consider its views, if London decided to make any of the archives available to the public.</p>
<p>&quot;From now if there are cases where archives which should have been transferred by the British side have not been transferred, the two sides will seek to resolve the matter through consultation,&quot; the memo said.</p>
