<p>German prosecutors dealt injured tennis star Steffi Graf a new blow on Tuesday when they said her father would go to jail in the next two months for at least a year for millions of marks of tax evasion.</p>
<p>Prosecutors and defence lawyers both said they had withdrawn their appeals challenging the verdict against Peter Graf, 58, handed down by a court in Mannheim in January, meaning the sentence is now legally binding.</p>
<p>The court sentenced Graf to three years and nine months after convicting him of evading and trying to evade 12 million marks ($6.9 million) in taxes on Steffi's earnings, but he was freed pending the result of the appeals.</p>
<p>Prosecutors, who originally deemed the sentence too lenient, said they had dropped an appeal because they had found no legal errors in the court's written verdict.</p>
<p>&quot;Peter Graf has prepared himself to complete the remaining part of his sentence. Because the taxes were already paid long ago, the matter will soon be laid to rest,&quot; Graf's lawyer Franz Salditt said in a statement.</p>
<p>The decision provides another setback to the former world number one player, who is at the moment out of action because of a serious knee injury.</p>
<p>Her father has been the most important figure in the life of the 28-year-old Graf, who first started playing the game when she was hardly bigger than a tennis racket.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Horst Kuehner said it would be six to eight weeks before Peter Graf would have to go to prison because of legal formalities and he would remain free until then as long as he did not break any of the terms of his bail.</p>
<p>Kuehner said Graf would probably have to serve two thirds of his sentence in total, meaning he may be in prison for around 15 months because he has already served 15 months in investigative custody.</p>
<p>Legal experts said the amount of time Graf will be behind bars could be even less than if the sentence were reduced for good behaviour.</p>
<p>Prosecutors also said they had dropped their appeal against the verdict on former family tax adviser Joachim Eckardt, who received two and a half years for complicity.</p>
<p>Eckhardt, 49, has already served 14 months investigative custody and will probably not have to return to jail.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in March dropped investigations against Steffi Graf herself, now recovering in a Vienna clinic after a knee operation, after she agreed to make a donation to charity. Media reports put the sum at 1.3 million marks.</p>
<p>She will not be able to defend her Wimbledon or U.S. Open titles in the next few months and last weekend said she was considering retiring because of persistent injury.</p>
