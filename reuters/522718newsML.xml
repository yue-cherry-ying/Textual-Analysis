<title>CAMBODIA: Cambodian royalist dissidents to hold congress.</title>
<headline>Cambodian royalist dissidents to hold congress.</headline>

<p>Dissidents in Cambodia's royalist party FUNCINPEC, part of the country's ailing coalition government, plan a congress to challenge the leadership of co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh, a dissident leader said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The split adds to political tensions in Cambodia where relations between coalition partners FUNCINPEC and the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of co-Premier Hun Sen have sunk to a new low.</p>
<p>Toan Chhay, a veteran of the royalist party, said the dissidents had established an interim committee headed by himself to contact and coordinate with FUNCINPEC members.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be ready to hold a congress very soon to strengthen internal issues of the party and adopt its political position to take part in peace, stability and develop the country,&quot; said Toan Chhay, governor of the key northwest province of Siem Reap.</p>
<p>Toan Chhay urged Cambodian authorities and parliamentarians to ignore the decisions of the &quot;brutal leader&quot; Ranariddh.</p>
<p>Analysts said the congress was a clear bid to challenge the leadership of Ranariddh.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Hun Sen's CPP denied charges of interfering in the internal affairs of FUNCINPEC by promoting the split in the royalist party, a statement aired on pro-CPP radio stations on Saturday said.</p>
<p>&quot;The accusation that Hun Sen intended to destroy FUNCINPEC is unreasonable and this accusation is unjust,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Prince Ranariddh has virtually accused his coalition partner Hun Sen of engineering defections from FUNCINPEC.</p>
<p>Ranariddh met on Saturday with the CPP president, Chea Sim, a FUNCINPEC spokesman said, without giving details of their talks.</p>
<p>The prince told reporters on Friday he would complain to Chea Sim about Hun Sen's interference and said he would stress that the two parties, which formed an uneasy coalition after U.N.-run elections in 1993, must avoid violence.</p>
<p>The FUNCINPEC steering committee on Friday expelled five senior party officials, including Toan Chhay and Minister of State Ung Phan, who announced the split on April 15.</p>
<p>Ung Phan, a former senior CPP official and comrade-in-arms of Hun Sen, said he and other top FUNCINPEC members did not recognise Ranariddh's leadership and said his policy &quot;blunders&quot; were to blame for the dismal relations between FUNCINPEC and the CPP.</p>
<p>CPP fuelled the tension with FUNCINPEC by supporting the dissidents, while stressing that the affair must be settled internally.</p>
<p>Tension has also been heightened by the unsuccessful attempt by former FUNCINPEC secretary general Prince Norodom Sirivudh to return home from exile to fight his 1996 conviction on charges linked to an alleged plot to assassinate Hun Sen.</p>
