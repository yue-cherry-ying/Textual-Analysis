<title>USA: Florida neighborhood warned of &quot;bear necessities&quot;.</title>
<headline>Florida neighborhood warned of &quot;bear necessities&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>ORLANDO, Fla. 1997-05-28</dateline>

<p>Orlando suburbanites were deliberately banging their trash can lids and whistling more loudly than usual Wednesday to scare off a wandering bear.</p>
<p>Central Florida wildlife officials said they have had many reports of a 300-pound black bear roaming a section of Orange County just outside Orlando this week.</p>
<p>Mark Byrd said he nearly had his wits scared out of him when he brushed up against the animal inside his darkened greenhouse. &quot;It just grumbled a little,&quot; he said, adding that he slowly inched his way outside and telephoned authorities.</p>
<p>Wildlife officials said Florida black bears are not an endangered species and guessed that the animal had come from the woods about five miles away. &quot;A nice day's travel for a bear,&quot; Lieut. Joy Hill, a state wildlife officer, said.</p>
<p>She said there was no indication the bear planned to leave the suburbs, which was why wildlife officers were giving residents &quot;technical assistance&quot; including this advice: &quot;Make a lot of noise. Try not to bump into it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We've never had a documented case of a bear attacking a human in Florida,&quot; she said, adding that if the bear does not wander off on its own wildlife officers would try to capture it and ship it away from the area.</p>
