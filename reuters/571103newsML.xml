<title>MALAYSIA: Malaysia money, futures markets closed for holiday.</title>
<headline>Malaysia money, futures markets closed for holiday.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Malaysian interbank money market and interest rates futures market, the Malaysia Monetary Exchange, are closed on Thursday for a national holiday.</p>
<p>They reopen on Friday, May 9.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the interbank market closed generally steady due to continued shortage of lenders in the market and bids by finance companies seeking fresh funds.</p>
<p>Dealers said a maturity of Bank Negara bills worth 500 million ringgit on Friday will have little impact as the market was supported at the current levels, partly due to reduced activity.</p>
<p>One-week money was unchanged at 6.8/7.0 percent, two-week at 7.10/20 percent against 7.00/10 on Tuesday and three-week at 7.20/25 percent from 7.10/20.</p>
<p>One-month money at 7.25/30 percent, three-month at 7.30/35 and six-month at 7.35/40, were all unchanged.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange fell back after gains on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The benchmark three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract ended down one point to 92.68, or an implied yield of 7.32 percent.</p>
<p>December and March 1998 were also down one each to 92.67 and 92.60, or 7.33 and 7.40 percent respectively. .</p>
