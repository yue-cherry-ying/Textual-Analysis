<p>Singapore's trade recovery is trundling along but its weak electronics industry remains fearful of being hurt by Seagate's problems with its high-end disk drive production, economists said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A Reuter survey of 12 financial institutions produced an average forecast of 6.3 percent in June nominal non-oil exports year-on-year, up from an actual one percent drop in May.</p>
<p>But economists sounded a note of caution, saying June's bullish figure was due largely to a low base of comparison against June 1996.  </p>
<p>Most forecast total non-oil exports would be around the same level as May in value, around Singapore $7.4 billion.</p>
<p>They said uncertainty over Seagate's weaker earnings, which could hurt local output, still-sluggish personal computer sales worldwide and lower costs of computer chips were bearish factors.</p>
<p>Electronics account for nearly 60 percent of Singapore's non-oil exports and Seagate Technology, the world's largest disk drive manufacturer, reported weak fourth-quarter profits earlier this month, reflecting lower demand for high-end disk drives.  </p>
<p>ABN-Amro Hoare Govett's regional economist Song Seng Wun projected a rise of 5.7 percent year-on-year, a 2.5 percent month-on-month decline.</p>
<p>The monthly comparative drop was attributed to prevailing softness in most export sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;We're seeing more positive numbers in the electronics sector on a year-to-year basis, not because they are showing a sharp rebound but because the base was so much lower,&quot; Song said.</p>
<p>&quot;If it doesn't come into positive territory (June exports) then GDP ought to be shot to pieces,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Wong Keng Siong, an economist with Yamaichi Securities, predicted a nine percent rise in exports, based on assumption that trade in absolute terms would be roughly the same as in May.</p>
<p>&quot;If we get something in the region of five to 10 percent, I would think the market would largely discount that number,&quot; Wong said, noting this span factored in the low base in 1996.</p>
<p>But others said the recovery was patchy, with both domestic export figures and U.S. electronic orders not yet showing consistent monthly increases.  </p>
<p>&quot;It would have to be considerably above 10 percent, closer to 12-12.5 percent, for the market to respond positively,&quot; said Prasenjit Basu of UBS Securities.</p>
<p>Basu said he felt the economy was on track for a year-end recovery as leading indicators pointed to strengthening. The question was when the upturn would be reflected in domestic exports.</p>
<p>Despite the slide in May non-oil exports, the decline was seen as less severe than the 4.1 percent contraction in the first quarter of 1997. April and May data taken together showed non-oil exports increased by 2.4 percent compared to the  </p>
<p>corresponding two months last year.</p>
<p>Leading the bears, however, was MMS/Standard &amp; Poors forecast of minus 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Sales have picked up a little bit but prices have been going down so that would upset some of the benefits from higher sales,&quot; said economist Andy Tan, noting regional exporters were concerned at the decline in prices for higher-end computer chips.</p>
<p>Tan said his forecast was not bleak, merely tempering overly optimistic projections for an early recovery.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's not bleak at all. Since the beginning of this year expectations were for a second-half recovery. Some people were optimistic and thought it could happen in the second quarter.&quot;</p>
