<p>Anti-smoking activists from around the world signed a joint letter on Tuesday urging that any settlement in U.S. talks on lawsuits against tobacco companies take other countries into consideration.</p>
<p>They said they were afraid that talks aimed at settling a raft of U.S. state government litigation against tobacco companies would leave the firms free and eager to recoup any losses in other countries.</p>
<p>&quot;An American settlement that excludes the rest of the world or attempts to give the tobacco companies global immunity is unethical and will be ineffective from the public health perspective,&quot; said Dr Judith Mackay, director of the Hong Kong-based Asian Consultancy on Tobacco Control.</p>
<p>&quot;If sales fall in the United States, or the U.S. companies are forced to pay a substantial settlement award, the tobacco multinationals can be expected to intensify their invasion of the Third World and Eastern Europe,&quot; the campaigners, from 19 countries, said in an open letter.</p>
<p>The U.S. states are trying to recoup medical costs for treating smokers, and similar moves are afoot in the Canadian province of British Columbia.</p>
<p>The campaigners said any settlement should apply controls to all cigarettes made in the United States, including those for export, and should include a global code of conduct on issues such as advertising aimed at children.</p>
<p>It should also ensure that non-Americans get the same levels of compensation as American victims.</p>
<p>Non-U.S. markets were already big, the campaigners said.</p>
<p>&quot;Only four percent of the world's smokers are in the United States,&quot; they wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;Approximately 85 percent of the annual three million tobacco-related deaths occur outside of the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>They urged that any U.S. agreement take global markets into consideration.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. tobacco companies are looking to markets in the Third World and Eastern Europe for future growth. And in many countries they are using slick and deceptive advertising and marketing techniques that target children, especially girls, in ways that would never be tolerated in the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>David Simpson of the London-based International Agency on Tobacco and Health said he did not expect much cooperation from the tobacco companies.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in an impossible situation because it would be naive to expect the industry to settle with agreeing to absolutely no promotion anywhere in the world,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But conversely it is naive to expect that anything short of that would do any good.&quot;</p>
<p>A key negotiator in the U.S. tobacco talks said he was hopeful a settlement would be reached this week.</p>
<p>Sources say both sides have already agreed to a number of health care provisions, with the tobacco industry agreeing to cut advertising and stop using cartoon characters, pay penalties if youth smoking is not reduced, and fund programmes to help smokers quit.</p>
