<p>A federal judge Monday ordered American Home Products Corp.'s American Cyanamid to pay the University of Colorado and others more than $45 million for defrauding them of a patent for a prenatal multivitamin.</p>
<p>The university, its non-profit foundation and two of its professors sued Cyanamid in 1993, saying the company took the professors' formula and patented it as its own.</p>
<p>The amount represents Cyanamid's actual and projected net sales of the vitamin Materna from 1981, when the fraud began, until 2001, when the patent expires, and includes $1 million for punitive damages, U.S. District Judge John Kane wrote in his decision.</p>
<p>Cyanimid, which merged several years ago with Home Products, had denied the allegations and argued its employees invented the formula.</p>
<p>The company had hired the two professors to reformulate the vitamin supplement because a competitor was claiming that Materna was an inferior product because the iron in the supplement could not be absorbed in patients as well as the competitor's product, Kane wrote in his decision.</p>
<p>Kane concluded, &quot;Cyanamid's fraud and concealment robbed plaintiffs of their valuable idea and allowed Cyanamid to obtain profits and market advantages (that) justice precludes it from retaining.&quot;</p>
<p>Home Products' attorney Roger Thomasch said neither he nor the company had read the judge's decision. He said he expected the company to comment on the case Tuesday.</p>
