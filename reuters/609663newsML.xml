<p>India's food industry will double in size by 2005 and could become the world's largest if investments grew and the processing and production sectors were integrated, according to a study released on Friday.</p>
<p>A summary of the study, jointly conducted by the Confederation of Indian Industry and management consultancy firm McKinsey and Co, was made available to Reuters.</p>
<p>The study said India's food industry, currently a $70-billion-market, was expected to double by 2005.</p>
<p>The size of the Indian food industry was currently equal to that of the United States and second to China's. It did not estimate the exact size of China's food sector.</p>
<p>&quot;But India can be the world's largest food factory.&quot; the study said. &quot;In order to do this, business will have to make very large investments of the order of $40 billion in technologies, skills and capital equipment.</p>
<p>R. Gopalakrishnan, chairman of the National Committee on Food Processing, told the seminar that India must integrate its agriculture, food processing and food packaging sectors to help the overall food industry to grow.</p>
<p>&quot;All these industries should be seen as a food chain,&quot; Gopalakrishnan said.</p>
<p>Information and Broadcasting Minister Jaipal Reddy, who released the study, said there was a need to consider the food sector as a &quot;strategic industry&quot; and that farmers needed to be guaranteed a certain price.</p>
<p>&quot;No food industry can prosper unless there is a firm guarantee of prices for the produce of farmers,&quot; Reddy said. &quot;We also need a second green revolution to increase productivity.&quot;</p>
<p>India, a net foodgrains importer until the early 1980s, has become almost self-sufficient in agriculture since the &quot;Green Revolution&quot; of the 1960s.</p>
<p>The study said Indian food habits were changing and the demand was gradually shifting to packaged food.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the next 10 years, some 200 million people will move from the subsistence foods like cereals and pulses, to the basic products that demand more processing, like packaged wheat and packaged homogenised milk,&quot; the study said.</p>
