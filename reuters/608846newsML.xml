<title>RUSSIA: Russian, Belarus leaders sign union charter.</title>
<headline>Russian, Belarus leaders sign union charter.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko on Friday signed a charter formalising a loose union between the two former Soviet republics.</p>
<p>The final text of the charter, agreed by Yeltsin and Lukashenko on Thursday, has not been made public. But Lukashenko said earlier on Friday that Russia and Belarus, which signed the basic treaty declaring the creation of the union on April 2, would remain fully independent states.  </p>
<p>Lukashenko told Ekho Moskvy radio earlier on Friday that a disputed clause committing the two Slav states to move towards a single federative state had been withdrawn.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said in his speech before the signing that the union charter, which along with the Union Treaty is still to be ratified by both parliaments, was aimed at promoting closer cooperation between the two countries and peoples.</p>
<p>Opinion polls show that a majority of people in both countries favours integration of the two nations.</p>
<p>But nationalist groups in Belarus have condemned the union as an imperialist plot hatched by Moscow, while liberal groups in Russia have warned that a deal with the hardline Lukashenko could harm Russia's democracy and market reforms.</p>
