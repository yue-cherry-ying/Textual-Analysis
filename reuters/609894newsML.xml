<p>Shares in Britain's last remaining independent regional electricity company (Rec) Southern gained on Friday as reported remarks from generator PowerGen were seen as indicating it could again be a bid target.</p>
<p>Newspapers reported Ed Wallis, chairman of PowerGen -- which was blocked from buying Midlands Electricity last year -- as saying that the company was considering a big acquisition.</p>
<p>Wallis was quoted as saying, &quot;As for buying Southern Electric, well, we have a new government and who knows if their view is the same as the past government or what?&quot;</p>
<p>Southern said it was not up for sale, adding that it had a strong independent growth strategy. PowerGen was not immediately available for further comment on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We plough our own furrow,&quot; a Southern spokesman said.</p>
<p>Shares in Southern were up four pence to 415 pence by 1220 GMT, off a high set earlier at 420 pence, while PowerGen gained 4.5 pence to 698.5 pence.</p>
<p>The muted share price reaction reflected market uncertainty over the new government's stance on takeovers.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some speculation Labour may be more friendly but PowerGen would have to try that out with a bid move,&quot; said one analyst who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>PowerGen's ambitions to own a Rec were blocked by the previous Conservative government, and its target Midlands Electricity was eventually sold to U.S. group Avon Energy for 1.73 billion stg.</p>
<p>At the same time, Southern's own hopes of vertical integration were dashed when National Power was stopped from making an agreed bid for it.</p>
<p>The government's move effectively ruled out vertical integration between generators and Recs.</p>
<p>But opinion is divided over whether the new centre left Labour government, which swept to power in a landslide victory on May 1, would retain that stance.</p>
<p>Labour has been fiercely critical of privatised utilities and has vowed to introduce a one-off tax on what it regards as excess profits to fund a three billion pound programme to cut unemployment.</p>
<p>Nigel Hawkins at Yamaichi added that &quot;the referral yesterday does not suggest this government is just going to rubber stamp takeovers.&quot;</p>
<p>On Thursday, the government surprised transport operator National Express by deciding to refer its planned purchase of regional ScotRail and Central Trains networks to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC), the first such move by new Trade and Industry Secretary Margaret Beckett.</p>
<p>Labour has slammed the previous government's policy on takeovers, which saw all other bids nodded through to leave all but one of the original twelve Recs set up at privatisation in 1989 sold off.</p>
<p>PowerGen itself hit out at last year's decision to block its bid, with Wallis claiming it went against a market-driven policy and could weaken the company abroad.</p>
<p>Despite Labour's previous objections to takeovers of Recs, some analysts said it could be persuaded that integration would help to strengthen a British company to be competitive abroad.</p>
<p>But at the same time, PowerGen would probably have to provide a trade-off for any possible deal, such as discounts for customers or secure contracts for coal companies aimed at ensuring jobs, analysts said.</p>
<p>Analysts said an integration downstream by PowerGen would make strategic sense as the domestic electricity market heads for full liberalisation in 1998, along with the gas market.</p>
<p>But they warned that in addition to likely hostility from the government, Southern also represented a large chunk to swallow, with a price tag of over two billion pounds suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;Southern is a pretty big mouthful. PowerGen could probably afford it but focusing so much on just one of its three aims would be a bit of a surprise,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>PowerGen, which has a relatively strong debt position, said on Thursday that it had a three-pronged strategy of domestic generation, domestic gas and electricity supply and overseas development.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps its acquisition strategy is aimed more at buying supply businesses and maybe those could come from some of the Recs which have already been sold,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>PowerGen had also announced on Thursday that annual pretax profits were within expectations at 575 million pounds ($934.3 million), up from 566 million, and paid out a dividend of 25.2 pence per share compared with 21 pence.</p>
