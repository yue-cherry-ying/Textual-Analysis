<p>Mad cow disease can be transmitted to humans, but just barely, an international team of researchers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tests done with the prion proteins linked with mad cow disease showed the proteins could transmit the disease, James Hope of the Institute for Animal Health and colleagues in Britain, the Netherlands and the United States said.</p>
<p>Hope said they purified proteins from the brains of cows infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease), sheep infected with its cousin scrapie and humans who died of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) that has been linked with BSE.</p>
<p>They mixed them with a purified version of normal prion proteins from human brains.</p>
<p>&quot;What we found is you can get conversion...but it was of a low efficiency,&quot; Hope said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>The normal proteins, when exposed to the abnormal ones, became abnormal themselves. They resisted protease, an enzyme that usually breaks down protein.</p>
<p>The findings shed a little more light on how people and animals catch such diseases, which remain mysterious. Victims have large numbers of the abnormal prion proteins in their brains, which take on a spongelike appearance and deteriorate until death.</p>
<p>Most scientists think the proteins themselves affect other proteins, although some maintain a &quot;slow virus&quot; or other agent must be to blame.</p>
<p>Hope said he believed the proteins were infectious, although his group's findings could support either hypothesis.</p>
<p>&quot;Our material is biochemically something like 95 percent pure,&quot; he said. &quot;It is infectious either because you have a lot of the infective form of prion protein there or it is sequestering an as-yet unidentified molecular agent.&quot;</p>
<p>Because the proteins were so pure, they would probably be more infectious than a real-life exposure, Hope added.</p>
<p>&quot;The material we were using in this conversion was highly infectious,&quot; he said. &quot;If you were to inject it into a human or animal, they would get the disease.&quot;</p>
<p>But with humans, they would be exposed through eating meat or other animal parts. The infectious agent would have to pass through the body, and the dose would vary.</p>
<p>&quot;One would not say that a small test tube is of the same complexity as a human being,&quot; Hope said. &quot;So the likelihood is that it is even less infectious than these tests show.&quot;</p>
<p>Hope noted that scrapie had been reported in sheep for more than 100 years, but there was no link with CJD.</p>
<p>&quot;We conclude that BSE is no more transmissible to humans than is sheep scrapie,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But, he added: &quot;We can't absolutely say that because there is no risk of people getting sheep scrapie there will be no risk of people getting BSE. All we can say is that there is no absolute molecular barrier.&quot;</p>
<p>Hope said his group's techniques offered a useful way to test any possible drugs for treating CJD or BSE without using animals.</p>
<p>&quot;You can look for drugs which prevent this conversion reaction,&quot; he said. &quot;It's an ideal system to prove or disprove the prion hypothesis.&quot;</p>
<p>Nineteen people in Britain and one in France have succumbed to the new version of CJD, identified last year and linked with BSE. Doctors say it is far too early to know if a human CJD epidemic will mirror the BSE epidemic that decimated British herds in the 1980s.</p>
