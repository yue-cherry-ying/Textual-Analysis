<p>A Singapore-based investment holding company held by firms associated with Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-Shing is seeking a US$712 million loan, coordinating arranger and bookrunner CIBC CEF Singapore said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The company, Japura PLC, is 52 percent owned by Li Ka-shing, 24 percent owned by Cheung Kong (Holdings) and 24 percent owned by Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.</p>
<p>Li is chairman of both Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa.</p>
<p>Proceeds of the facility, Japura's first borrowing, will be used for general working capital, the arranger said.</p>
<p>The US$712 million dual facility loan is divided into two tranches.</p>
<p>Tranche A of US$341.76 million is severally guaranteed by Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa.</p>
<p>Tranche B of US$370.24 million is guaranteed by Li Ka-shing.</p>
<p>Tranche A will be syndicated, while tranche B will be underwritten on a take and hold basis by CIBC CEF Singapore.</p>
<p>Both Tranche A and tranche B are further split into two parts.</p>
<p>Tranche A1 is a US$240 term loan. A2 is a US$101.76 million revolving credit. Tranche B1 is a US$260 million term loan and B2 is a US$110.24 million revolving credit.  </p>
<p>A1 and B1, the term loan portions of the facility, are available for drawdown for one month. A2 and B2, the revolving credits, are available for drawdown for 45 months.</p>
<p>All tranches have a final maturity of four years with bullet repayment and pay a margin of 43 basis points over the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate.</p>
<p>Arrangers committing US$45 million receive a commitment fee of 32 basis points and an underwriting fee of seven basis points, while co-arrangers committing US$30 million receive a commitment fee of 32 basis points and an underwriting fee of five basis points.</p>
<p>Fees are 32 basis points for lead managers committing US$15-20 million, 27 basis points for co-lead managers committing US$10-14.9 million and 24 basis points for managers committing US$5-9.9 million.</p>
