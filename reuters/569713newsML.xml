<p>NYCE cotton futures maintained their recent trading range in thin dealings as prices crept barely higher by the close.</p>
<p>Floor sources cited light trade buying in volume estimated at only 6,000 lots. Wednesday's official volume came in at 3,984 lots, NYCE said.</p>
<p>Most-active July ended 0.20 cent higher at 72.12 cents a lb after trading from 72.45 to 71.85 cents. December finished 0.10 cent firmer at 74.56 cents.</p>
<p>Support remained at the contract low of 71.00 cents for July, followed by 70.00 cents.</p>
<p>Players await a key USDA report which will be released Monday at 0830 EDT. It will give the market final supply and demand estimates for the old crop, and the first offical estimates for the 1997/98 crop.</p>
<p>Players anticipate a bearish report but said the numbers may already be filtered into the market.</p>
<p>&quot;It should be quiet in front of Monday's numbers,&quot; Sharon Johnson, an analyst with Frank Schneider and Co Inc, said.</p>
<p>A preliminary survey indicated that estimates for U.S. output ranged from 17.96 million bales to 18.8 million bales.</p>
<p>Analysts said that forecasting output was particularly difficult this year, as the USDA estimate for planted area is thought to be inflated.</p>
<p>Since the USDA put cotton area at 14.5 million acres in March, unfavorable weather, high competing crop prices and low cotton futures prices, have enticed some growers to abandon cotton in favor of other crops, they said.</p>
<p>The recent low prices brought U.S. cotton in line with world cotton, however, prompting the USDA to shut off its weekly import quota following 80 consecutive ten-week periods.</p>
<p>The quotas are triggered when U.S. prices exceed the average price quotation of the world's five cheapest growths by more than 1.25 cents per lb, for ten consecutive weeks.</p>
<p>For the week ended May 8, U.S. price quotations averaged 79.81 cents, compared with the average of the five cheapest growths at 78.85 cents, USDA said.</p>
