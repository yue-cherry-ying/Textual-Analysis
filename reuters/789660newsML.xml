<p>Substitute Ingo Anderbruegge fired UEFA Cup champions Schalke to a 1-0 victory over European Cup winners Borussia Dortmund with a late goal in Saturday's Rhine Valley derby.</p>
<p>Midfielder Anderbruegge scored in the 86th minute, just eight minutes after coming off the bench, in a clash played in sweltering conditions in Gelsenkirchen.</p>
<p>Schalke, with two wins and one loss in their first three matches, climbed into third place in the early-season Bundesliga table behind Karlsruhe and Kaiserslautern. Borussia Dortmund are fifth behind Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>&quot;That we beat the (European) Champions isn't as interesting to me as picking up three points with the win,&quot; said Schalke trainer Huub Stevens. &quot;It was not possible to play attractive soccer in this weather.&quot;</p>
<p>Dortmund trainer Nevio Scale said his team, who have one win, one draw and one defeat after three matches, had played poorly.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not at all satisfied with my team,&quot; Scala said. &quot;They played poorly and Schalke deserved to win. We were unable to play fluidly after the match on Wednesday against Cologne. But we have to accept this defeat without making a drama out of it.&quot;</p>
