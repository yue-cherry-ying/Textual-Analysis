<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates mixed, spots mostly down.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mixed on Thursday but trading was active mainly due to the new issue of Gezhouba Co Ltd on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, traders said.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the most actively traded seven-day contract rose to 15.30 percent from 13.80 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Total turnover of the six-contract market rose to 9.8 million lots from 6.1 million.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.</p>
<p>Gezhouba Co Ltd is issuing 190 million shares on the Shanghai stock market.  </p>
<p>Traders said the huge volume of the new issue led to a short-term increase in fund demand, which boosted the repurchase market.</p>
<p>&quot;The new issue made some big institutions borrow heavily on the repurchase market, supporting especially the early-maturing contracts,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;The repo rates have moved at high levels for several days,&quot; he said. &quot;This was mainly due to the number of new issues and the active A share markets.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said they expect most of the rates to stick around current levels on Friday.  </p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mostly down on Thursday mainly due to the issue of Gezhouba which attracted large funds from the spot market, traders said.</p>
<p>The most actively traded 10-year bond that matures in June 2006 closed unchanged at 120.08 yuan.</p>
<p>Combined volume of the seven-contract market fell to 751,782 lots from 938,418 lots.</p>
<p>Some investors were seen liquidating their positions to purchase the new issue of Gezhouba, traders said, adding that they expect the rates to move in a narrow range in the short-term.</p>
