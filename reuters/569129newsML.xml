<p>European envoy Franz Vranitzky met leaders of Albanian President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party on Thursday to try to resolve a deadlock over a law for early elections in the troubled Balkan state.</p>
<p>The dispute between the Democrats and the rest of the nine-party National Reconciliation government over how many seats should be chosen by proportional representation is holding up a final decision on a date for the elections, agreed after riots in March and expected on June 29.</p>
<p>Democratic Party leader Tritan Shehu, a former foreign minister, said after meeting Vranitzky that he had suggested holding the vote two weeks earlier, on June 15.</p>
<p>Vranitzky, a former Austrian chancellor now acting as envoy of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), was due to meet Berisha later in the day.</p>
<p>It is the European envoy's third visit since widespread rioting over failed pyramid savings schemes pushed Albania to the brink of anarchy in March.</p>
<p>Vranitzky said he would convey to all Albanian political leaders &quot;the expectation of the international community that they find political consensus as far as the election is concerned&quot;.</p>
<p>Interim Prime Minister Bashkim Fino met Vranitzky on Wednesday, shortly after the European envoy arrived on his three-day visit. Fino said he was optimistic an agreement could be reached on the electoral law.</p>
<p>Democratic Party leaders, who want to keep the current law in which fewer seats are decided by proportional representation, played down the importance of the new legislation.</p>
<p>&quot;The electoral law is not such an essential item as the present electoral law is very democratic and it is already in force,&quot; Genc Pollo, secretary general of the Democratic Party, told reporters.</p>
<p>Fino, frustrated over a failure to reach a consensus on the issue after five all-party meetings, has said the government will now adopt the new law by majority and pass it to parliament for approval.</p>
<p>He has sought a vote of confidence from the Democratic-dominated parliament and has said the government will resign if the legislature does not pass the new law.</p>
<p>Shehu stressed the importance of disbanding so-called salvation committees, citizens' groups set up to restore order after the riots, that are another stumbling block to the elections.</p>
<p>Berisha maintains the salvation committees are working for Fino's socialists and will obstruct free and fair elections.</p>
<p>Fino denies his party is involved with the committees and says they should be disbanded after a date for the election is fixed. Residents of the south, where most of the committees were formed, say their influence has waned.</p>
