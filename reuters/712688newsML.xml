<p>Ghana's non-traditional exports rose by over 75 percent in 1996 and state incentives are in place to further cut dependency on gold and cocoa revenues, a Ghanaian export council official said.</p>
<p>Non-traditional export earnings from products as diverse as shark fins and veneer rose to $276.2 million in 1996 from $155.6 million in 1995, spearheaded by processed and semi-processed products, Ghana's Export Promotion Council (GEPC) Deputy-Director, Kwabena Boateng, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;(Ghana's) government has allocated a sizeable amount of money with the financial sector (for 1997) to promote genuine exporters of non-traditional products,&quot; Boateng said. He expected that to produce even better results this year.</p>
<p>&quot;If the performance during the first quarter of the year is anything to go by, then we expect nothing less than a 50 percent increase in (non-traditional) earnings this year over 1996.&quot;</p>
<p>Ghana's Cocoa Board said last week that cocoa export earnings in 1996 totalled $568.2 million, against $589.2 million for the country's main export, gold.</p>
<p>Ghana has said it will encourage more local processing of cocoa beans in future to raise value-added exports.</p>
<p>The latest GEPC data showed processed and semi-processed products, led by wood, earned $233 million in 1996 against $130.2 million in 1995, Boateng said.</p>
<p>Wood product earnings totalled $66.89 million, against $37.54 in 1995, and came mainly from furniture, plywood, veneer and builders' materials. Handicrafts earned $2.9 million against $2 million, he added.</p>
<p>Agricultural products earnings rose to $50.27 million from $27.38 million, led by horticulture and seafood exports.</p>
<p>Horticultural earnings grew by almost 80 percent to $20.7 million from $11.5 million, with pineapples earning $11 million from 27,602 tonnes exported. That compared with $5.6 million from 15,763 tonnes in the previous year.</p>
<p>Fish and other seafoods -- including shark fins, tuna and shrimp -- earned $12.3 million against $7.3 million over the same periods, Boateng said.</p>
