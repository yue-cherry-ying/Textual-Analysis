<p>The Baltimore Orioles, owners of Major League Baseball's best record, acquired outfielder Geronimo Berroa from the Oakland Athletics Friday for minor-league pitcher Jimmy Haynes and a player to be named later.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old Berroa adds another powerful bat to an Oriole lineup that is sixth in the American League in runs scored and fifth in home runs. He is hitting .316 with 16 home runs and 42 runs RBI in 73 games.</p>
<p>The righty-hitting Dominican enjoyed a career season in 1996, batting .290 with 36 homers and 106 RBI in 153 games.</p>
<p>Haynes, a 24-year-old right-hander, was 5-4 with a 3.44 ERA in 16 starts with Triple-A Rochester. He led the International League with 113 strikeouts in 102 innings and was assigned to the Athletics' top minor-league affiliate in Edmonton.</p>
<p>Haynes split the 1996 season between Baltimore and Rochester. With the Orioles, he was 3-6 with one save and an 8.29 ERA in 26 appearances, including 11 starts.</p>
