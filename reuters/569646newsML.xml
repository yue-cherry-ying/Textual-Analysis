<headline>U.S. urges Kabila to be responsible.</headline>

<p>With a rebel victory in Zaire all but certain, the United States on Thursday urged rebel leader Laurent Kabila to be a &quot;responsible&quot; leader.</p>
<p>Washington also renewed its call for Kabila and Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko to work out a transitional government so as to avoid a bloodbath when rebel forces enter the capital of Kinshasa and to put the country on the path to democracy.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Kabila understands what's at stake for him and his reputation&quot; in the way he handles the transfer of power in mineral-rich Zaire, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.</p>
<p>&quot;He now needs to think about being a responsible person who can lead the government. And in anticipation of that, he needs to think about ways to preserve life,&quot; BUrns said.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than a continued military march on the capital city with the attendant loss of life and bloodshed, we would like to see a transition period worked out by meetings between either President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila, or their advisers,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Despite the recent Central African mission of Ambassador Bill Richardson, Burns was unable to say that the United States obtained a comitment from Kabila to avoid bloodshed.</p>
<p>&quot;We ... understand from our conversations with Mr. Kabila that he would very much like to avoid that (bloodshed). He, however, says also that he is determined to take the capital. Our view is that he and others need to be mindful of their own actions, which are a test of their credibility,&quot; Burns said.</p>
<p>Burns refused to say how the United States might react if Kabila and his forces storm the city with attendant loss of life. But he said U.S. officials have informed Kabila in private what it might do.</p>
<p>The spokesman was also unable to point to any commitments from African leaders in neighbouring countries that they would use their sometimes considerable influence with Kabila to persuade him to avoid bloodshed and pursue democracy as the United States has insisted.</p>
<p>Burns noted that some countries, which he did not name, have been accused of &quot;running guns to one side or another&quot; in the Zaire civil war.</p>
<p>These governments &quot;will have to live with what they are doing. We will judge them, obviously, and I think others will, as well, the United Nations, on how they comport themselves. We don't think it is a time to stimulate further fighting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mobutu left Zaire on Wednesday for a mini-summit in Gabon on the Zaire civil war amid speculation he would not return. Burns said the United States did not know what Mobutu's plans were.</p>
<p>As for the reported billions of dollars in assets Mobutu is alleged to have accumulated in three decades of power, Burns said he did not know if any of those assets were in the United States and at any rate the issue is &quot;not something I think that the United States would publicly want to position itself on right now.&quot;</p>
