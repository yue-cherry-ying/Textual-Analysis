<p>Peruvians marked the one month anniversary on Thursday of the bloody end to a 126-day hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador's home with church services, remembering the 17 victims of the military's rescue strike.</p>
<p>The two Peruvian commandos and a captive local judge, who all died in the lightning assault, were honoured with official ceremonies and Roman Catholic Masses.</p>
<p>Relatives of some of the 14 slain Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels visited their poor graves in Lima shantytowns.</p>
<p>The street on which the remains of Col. Juan Valer are housed was renamed after the commando, officially honoured as a national hero since he died April 22 rescuing Peru's key hostage, Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela.</p>
<p>Most of the dead rebels' families do not know where the security forces buried them.</p>
<p>Despite the vigilance of intelligence service agents, the sister of the hostage-takers' second-in-command, Rolly Rojas, Adilia, visited her brother's humble grave -- an above-ground niche near the prison where the rebel was once jailed.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though they have wiped out his soul, he is still with us,&quot; Adilia Rojas said.</p>
<p>The national radio station CPN also marked the month anniversary by repeating the gentle Japanese &quot;taisa&quot; music, which became a feature of the crisis.</p>
<p>Each day, the music -- normally played at Japanese factories to help workers exercise -- was dedicated to the 72 hostages, including a score of Tokyo diplomats and businessmen.</p>
<p>And in a reminder of the frequent demonstrations during the siege that called for a bloodless solution, children in several Lima suburbs marched carrying white balloons and placards which read &quot;Long live peace!.&quot;</p>
