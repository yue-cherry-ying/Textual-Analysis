<title>USA: CBOT corn ends flat/down on fund sales, soy losses.</title>
<headline>CBOT corn ends flat/down on fund sales, soy losses.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Most CBOT corn contracts ended with modest losses Thursday on pressure stemming from fund selling and spillover from soybeans, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Corn stayed really quiet most of the session,&quot; said one floor trader. &quot;It was just chopping around with soybeans,&quot; said a floor trader.</p>
<p>Weak weekly exports sales data pushed CBOT July soybeans down more than half the trading limit early in the session, and those losses helped offset good corn exports, traders said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture put weekly corn export sales at 593,200 tonnes.</p>
<p>That figure came in at the high end of trade expectations for 450,000 to 600,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Reactions to long-term Midwest weather forecasts for corn growing areas were mixed. The National Weather Service 6- to 10-day forecast showed below-normal temperatures and above-normal rains for most of the Midwest.</p>
<p>Some traders said rain will be good for corn plants that are now emerging, while others say cool temperatures will slow growth in newly planted crops.</p>
<p>CBOT corn futures closed steady to 1-1/2 cents lower, with July down 3/4 cent at $2.84-1/2.  </p>
<p>On the day featured players included Merrill Lynch selling eight million bushels July, Refco selling two million July and Dean Witter selling four million July, pit sources said.</p>
<p>In options trading, Continental Grain bought 600 December $2.80 calls and sold 600 December $3.40 calls. FIMAT sold 300 December $2.60 puts and ADM bought 400 December $2.70 calls and 800 December $3.00 calls, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 80,000 contracts. That figure is higher than Wednesday's final volume of 64,891 contracts, according to CBOT data.</p>
