<headline>Weddings are year-round affairs for collectors.</headline>

<p>Bridal collectibles are peeking out from under the veil, drawing a small but growing host of admirers to nuptial thrills all year round.</p>
<p>Antique wedding dresses already have enough of a following to spawn a small number of speciality stores. Now cake toppers -- figures of the bride and groom -- are in the limelight, with antique specimens fetching up to $200.</p>
<p>&quot;There's an interest from a fashion and aesthetic point of view,&quot; said wedding consultant Carolyn Fostel of items associated with the occasion. And of course, nostalgia.</p>
<p>&quot;They're more in demand now. Now dealers are telling me they've already sold out, people were here before you. They're becoming more collectible.&quot;</p>
<p>Even now, it is not to easy to buy used wedding items because families cherish them. And few people think of keeping wedding invitations, cake toppers and other perishable ephemera.</p>
<p>But societal trends have fuelled a growing demand even as baby boomers are cleaning out their attics and basements.</p>
<p>&quot;The more sophisticated and complex our society has become, the more sentimental it is,&quot; said Phyllis Magidson, curator of costumes and textiles at the Museum of the City of New York (212-534-1672), which will hold an exhibition on the history of weddings from May 21 through Sept. 21.</p>
<p>&quot;People who might have scoffed at wearing a family wedding garment 20 years ago are more open to that prospect now, especially with return of the grand wedding,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>At Jean Hoffman Antiques in New York (212-535-6930), vintage wedding dresses go for $500 to a few thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Hoffman, who made actress Brooke Shield's wedding veil from three antique veils, said her clients want nontraditional wedding dresses that they can wear on other occasions.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike a new dress that you can spend anywhere from $1,000 up, most dresses people buy don't have any resale value. But my dresses, which are antique and limited, often increase in value because they have handmade details that cannot be duplicated,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>So if you're cleaning out your trunk, grandma's wedding dress does have some value to specialist dealers -- even if museums may turn down your donation.</p>
<p>Creative brides can realise the intrinsic value in the antique lace and pearls, said Magidson. &quot;Some people may incorporate the lace into a contemporary garment, which would put it into another category. Handmade lace is more ostentatious&quot; than machine-made lace, she said.</p>
<p>Cake toppers, which crown lavish wedding confections, are also undervalued collectibles that are starting to find a market. These often attract fans of kewpie dolls and porcelain figurines, but wedding cake figures have their own class of admirers.</p>
<p>According to the latest issue of &quot;Collectibles&quot; magazine, figures on a gum-paste base standing under an elaborate arbor or other type of enclosure that are in good condition go for $40 and up. Pre-1940s ornaments can fetch $75 to $150 or more.</p>
<p>Rare turn-of-the-century German toppers made of marzipan or gum paste are worth $125 to $200. Pre-1940s mint-in-box figures go for more than $100.</p>
<p>A 1920s Japanese-made celluloid couple in mint condition -- with wool hair and elaborate crepe-paper clothing -- is worth $60 to $85.</p>
<p>Most cake toppers made after 1950s are plastic. New figures that may become collectible include those made by Lladro, Madam Alexander, Wilton and Wee Forest Folk, said Ann Bergin, a wedding coordinator who collects them.</p>
<p>Other wedding collectibles are knives and spades, which come in sterling silver or lead crystal, for $150 to $200; keepsake books to record the occasion, for $10 to $200; antique photos for a few dollars; and handkerchiefs made of lace and linen for the emotional bride, for $25 and up.</p>
<p>The cost of engaging yourself to the hobby is still low because it is &quot;virgin territory,&quot; Bergin said.</p>
<p>For example, mechanical Christmas postcards with moving parts sell for $200 to $300, she said. But similar wedding postcards cost only $10 to $50 -- for now.</p>
<p>A rare Victorian cake topper made of wax -- with the groom's hand offering a flower to the bride's hand -- cost Fostel &quot;well over $100.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most families don't part with them as easily. That's what makes them more rare,&quot; said Fostel. &quot;They're affordable until the first person writes a book on wedding collectibles. That will start to get people thinking about them.&quot;</p>
