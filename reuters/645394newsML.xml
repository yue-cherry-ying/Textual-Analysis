<p>The House of Representatives could vote to overturn China's trade status with the United States, the leading House Democrat said on Saturday.</p>
<p>House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri told CNN's &quot;Evans and Novak&quot; program that he thought China's Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status would survive a challenge in the Senate.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there's a chance in the House MFN may be defeated,&quot; Gephardt said. &quot;I'm less optimistic about the Senate.&quot;</p>
<p>Gephardt, the leading potential challenger to Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic party's nomination for president in the year 2000, opposes normal U.S. trade relations with China because of concerns about human rights abuses.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to send a loud, clear message to the rulers in Beijing that business as usual with their people will not be accepted by the world community,&quot; Gephardt said.</p>
<p>&quot;And we need to lead the world community to send that message,&quot; he added. &quot;This is a matter of conscience. It's a matter of morality. It's a matter of what's right.&quot;</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton has decided to renew China's MFN trade privileges for another year. Only a handful of countries do not enjoy MFN and revoking the trade status would send import tariffs on Chinese goods soaring to 1930s levels and effectively price Chinese goods out of U.S. markets.</p>
<p>Some members of Congress oppose it because of concerns about Chinese human rights practices, allegations that Beijing was contributing to the spread of weapons of mass destruction and worry about the future of Hong Kong. A growing trade deficit with China was also contributing to their unease.</p>
<p>But administration officials argue that severing trade ties with China would be the same as declaring economic war with the most populous country in the world. They argue that it would do nothing to advance those issues, but serve to isolate the United States and undermine its security and economic interests in Asia.</p>
<p>They have said they expect a tough battle in Congress over China's MFN and a closer vote than the solid majority that supported Beijing's trade status last year. The House may take up the issue in late June.</p>
<p>Last year the Senate never voted on China's MFN status after the House voted to uphold its renewal.</p>
