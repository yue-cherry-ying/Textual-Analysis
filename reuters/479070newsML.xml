<title>USA: Cronkite undergoes heart bypass surgery.</title>
<headline>Cronkite undergoes heart bypass surgery.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>Walter Cronkite, the CBS anchorman who set the tone for the dominance of network television news, underwent successful quadruple bypass heart surgery on Tuesday, his assistant said.</p>
<p>&quot;The surgery is complete, it was very successful and he is recovering,&quot; said Julie Sukman, Cronkite's assistant at CBS.</p>
<p>The surgery at New York Hospital Cornell Medical Centre was recommended after Cronkite, 80, had a check-up last week, she said. He did not have a heart attack, she said.</p>
<p>He is expected to stay in the hospital for four or five days, which is normal for surgery of this type, she said.</p>
<p>Cronkite started the first national half-hour nightly news for CBS in 1963 and presided over it until he retired at age 65 in 1981, developing a reputation as the &quot;most trusted man in America.&quot;</p>
<p>In his memoir, &quot;A Reporter's Life,&quot; published at the end of last year, Cronkite wrote that the medium he helped create, which weaned many Americans off newspapers and led them to depend first on TV for news, was seriously flawed. He also said his greatest disappointment was not having had a chance to go to the moon.</p>
