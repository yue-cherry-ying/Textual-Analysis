<headline>Martin Luther King estate halts talks over mementos.</headline>
<dateline>ATLANTA 1997-07-16</dateline>

<p>The estate of Martin Luther King Jr. has angrily suspended talks with two universities that were each seeking permission to house the private papers of the slain civil rights leader, a King spokesman said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Stanford University in California and Atlanta's Emory University had been vying with each other for access to thousands of documents and artifacts dating from the last six years of King's life.</p>
<p>Phillip Jones, who heads the company that manages the King estate, said the family's first choice as a new archival site was Stanford, which has managed a publishing project for the Atlanta-based King Centre since 1985.</p>
<p>Then, King officials said, Emory tried to gain a hometown advantage by claiming the collection should stay in the South.</p>
<p>&quot;The point of the matter is that the talks have been suspended,&quot; Jones told Reuters. &quot;We did not appreciate Emory trying to gain the advantage by fanning those flames. Dr. King's legacy is national and global, and we thought any American university would be a fine choice.&quot;</p>
<p>The documents, located at the King Centre where they are open only to scholars with longstanding requests, are said to chronicle the social, cultural and economic impact of the civil rights movement King helped lead in 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p>Some press accounts suggested the talks were driven by King Centre financial troubles.</p>
<p>But Jones said money was not the point, and added that negotiations could be restarted if Emory University agreed not to press the Southern issue.</p>
<p>&quot;In my view this is the same type of childish and immature behaviour that we criticise these kids -- East vs. West rappers -- for doing,&quot; Jones said.</p>
<p>&quot;The family respects the Southern legacy and the birth of the civil rights movement. But 80,000 documents have been at Boston University for a years, and a good portion of the collection has been at Stanford University for years.&quot;</p>
<p>Emory and Stanford officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
