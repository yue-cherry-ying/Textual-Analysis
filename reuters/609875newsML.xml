<p>GKN Plc said Friday that a U.S. court had reduced the amount of damages that its Meineke Discount Muffler Shops unit must pay to some 2,500 Meineke franchises in the United States.</p>
<p>GKN added, however, that it still intended to appeal the decision by a federal court jury in Charlotte, N.C., that the auto-muffler retailer had mishandled and misappropriated millions of dollars charged to the franchises for advertising.</p>
<p>The company said the court reduced the amount of the damages to $390 million from $600 million, the largest commercial damages ever awarded against a British company in the United States.</p>
<p>The franchisees had brought the case against GKN in December 1993.</p>
<p>GKN said in a statement that it had &quot;very strong substantive and procedural grounds for appeal.&quot; The appeal process is expected to take about 18 months, it added.</p>
<p>News of the damages award had sent GKN shares down sharply when first announced in December and the stock suffered a setback last week on renewed concerns about legal action from Meineke franchisees.</p>
<p>At last week's annual meeting one franchisee said a group of franchisees excluded from GKN's legal settlement were preparing to file a lawsuit to be re-included in the class action.</p>
<p>The federal judge in Charlotte, where Meineke is based, in March tripled compensatory damages of $197 million awarded by the jury in December. The jury found that Meineke had committed breach of contract, negligence and fraud.</p>
