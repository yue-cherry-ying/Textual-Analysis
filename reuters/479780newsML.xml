<p>The former managing director of failed hotels group Resort Hotels was on Tuesday sentenced to eight years in prison, after being found guilty on 12 charges of fraud relating to a rights issue in 1992. (Corrects day of sentencing from Monday to Tuesday.)</p>
<p>Robert Feld, who was also disqualified from acting as a company director for 10 years, presented a false picture of the company's financial position ahead of the 20.6 million pounds ($33.8 million) rights issue.  </p>
<p>In a statement, the Serious Fraud Office said Feld had used forged documents to mislead accountants and bankers about the expected level of Resort's profit and its level of debt.</p>
<p>One year after the successful rights issue, the company's shares were suspended and receivers were finally appointed in June 1994, with its debts standing at 140 million pounds.</p>
<p>The SFO said that a search of Resort's offices had found forged documents in various stages of production as well as documents showing invented sources of income by Feld who owned four properties, including one in the south of France, and a yacht.</p>
<p>Those Resort shareholders who took up their rights and retained their shares lost the whole of their investment. Their only compensation has been a voucher for 250 pounds to spend at Jarvis Hotels, the company that bought Resort's assets.</p>
