<p>Gremio added the Copa Brasil to their list of titles on Thursday, scoring the decisive goal ten minutes from time as they beat Flamengo in a dramatic final.</p>
<p>Midfielder Carlos Miguel flicked the ball in from close range in the 80th minute to give Gremio a 2-2 draw away to Flamengo in the second leg of the final in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>Gremio won the tie on away goals after a 0-0 draw in Tuesday's first leg.</p>
<p>It was the third time Gremio have won the competition since it started in 1989 and the fourth year in a row they have won a major title.</p>
<p>Gremio also won the Copa Brasil in 1994, the South American Libertadores Cup in 1995 and the Brazilian championship last year, when they scored the final's decisive goal just five minutes from time.</p>
<p>Flamengo, backed by a 95,000 crowd at the Maracana stadium, had started favourites after Tuesday's result but fell behind to a goal by midfielder Joao Antonio in the sixth minute.</p>
<p>The home team turned the game around in a seven-minute spell before halftime with Lucio equalising and Brazil international Romario heading Flamengo in front with a header.</p>
<p>Romario missed an excellent chance for a third goal early in the second half when he just failed to connect with a cross with the goal empty. But Gremio, showing their usual grit and determination, were well worth their draw on the night.</p>
<p>The win guaranteed them a place in next year's South American Libertadores Cup along with the winners of the Brazilian championship, which will be played in the second half of the year.</p>
