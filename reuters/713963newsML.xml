<p>The European Commission will recommend next week that the European Union reforms its costly Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) before enlarging the bloc into eastern Europe, according to a document obtained by Reuters.</p>
<p>The document says reforms would improve the competitiveness of EU agriculture, allow it to participate in the expansion of world markets and prepare it for the next world trade liberalising round and for the EU's eastward enlargement.</p>
<p>&quot;In view of the challenges (of enlargement)...the Commission considers it indispensable to proceed with further reforms of the CAP,&quot; the draft document says.</p>
<p>The document is to be discussed by the 20 EU commissioners next Tuesday in Strasbourg where the EU executive is to meet on the sidelines of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>It is widely accepted the EU cannot afford to bring in a raft of new, poorer countries seeking membership of the bloc without some reform of its huge farm support programme.</p>
<p>Ten countries from eastern and central Europe have been told they can eventually become EU members.</p>
<p>EU sources said on Monday that the Commission will call next week for talks to begin with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia, as well as Cyprus.</p>
<p>Among the measures expected to be proposed are fixing the cereals intervention price at a safety net level of 95.35 Ecus per tonne (from 119.19 Ecus) from the year 2000.</p>
<p>A non-crop-specific area payment would be set at 68 Ecus per tonne and the reference rate for compulsory set-aside would be fixed at zero percent.</p>
<p>According to the document, silage cereals -- mainly silage maize -- would be excluded from the regime. For protein crops extra aid would be set at 13 Ecus per tonne to preserve their competitiveness with cereals, and current supplements would be kept for durum wheat.</p>
<p>The document also sees income payments for beef and dairy products rising under enlargement.</p>
<p>It foresees new yearly payments of 145 Ecus for dairy cows and the dairy quota regime extended at current levels until the year 2005.</p>
