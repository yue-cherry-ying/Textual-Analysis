<p>Italy told Britain's Labour government on Thursday it had much to learn about European Union affairs and said it had not been impressed by the new administration's opening moves on the EU stage.</p>
<p>The Labour government promised to improve Britain's often icy relations with the EU after it won a landslide general election victory over the Conservative party last week.</p>
<p>But new Foreign Minister Robin Cook got off to a bad start with Rome by saying on Wednesday that Britain wanted to be one of the three leading players in Europe alongside France and Germany, making no mention of Italy.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps Minister Cook doesn't yet fully understand the rules of the European Union, where, fortunately, there are no leading countries and no countries which are led,&quot; a diplomatic source close to the Italian foreign ministry said.</p>
<p>In a terse comment, the diplomat said that in terms of weighting inside the various EU councils, Italy, Germany, France and Britain were seen as equals.</p>
<p>&quot;There are four major countries and all of them are in a position of absolute parity,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Italy is highly sensitive about how it is viewed within the 15-nation bloc in the face of widespread speculation that Germany might be seeking to freeze it out of the start of the planned single European currency.</p>
<p>Sources close to the government said Prime Minister Romano Prodi was furious last month when the European Commission released data suggesting that only Greece and Italy would fail to make the grade for the launch of the euro currency in 1999.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said he hoped Labour's election victory would mark an improvement in Anglo-EU relations and condemned the attitude of the old Conservative government.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't but hope that the new British government will confirm a negotiating approach less tainted by ideological prejudices and preconceived ideas,&quot; Dini told a meeting of Italian members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>However, he said he was worried by the stance taken by the new British Minister for Europe, Doug Henderson, at a meeting of the inter-governmental conference (IGC) on the EU's workings held in Brussels on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The first intervention of the new British representative at the inter-governmental conference certainly did not reassure us,&quot; Dini said.</p>
<p>&quot;The closed approach on some points, which are important for us, like common defence and security policy, the European justice system and internal affairs of the union are not very encouraging,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Henderson told colleagues that London would end its opt-out on various social clauses included in EU treaties, but the Labour party has confirmed its opposition to other policies close to Italian hearts.</p>
<p>Among these is Italy's desire to see the Western European Union (WEU) defence group gradually incorporated into the EU to give the 15-nation bloc a common defence policy.</p>
<p>The IGC is scheduled to agree a new treaty by June which could be the EU's last chance for real reform before its planned eastward expansion.</p>
<p>&quot;In the context of continued divergences (with European policy), the British confirmation it will respect the June (EU treaty) deadline is not enough to soften our fears,&quot; Dini said.</p>
