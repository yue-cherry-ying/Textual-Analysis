<p>Hilton Hotels Corp. Chief Executive Officer Stephen Bollenbach, frustrated at being rebuffed in his efforts to acquire ITT Corp., Thursday vowed to pursue the rival until Hilton's bid is put to an ITT shareholder vote.</p>
<p>Beverly Hills-based Hilton launched a $6.5 billion hostile takeover for ITT in January, but ITT rejected the price as inadequate. Hilton then nominated a slate of directors to unseat ITT's board at ITT's next annual meeting.</p>
<p>ITT, based in New York, has not set a meeting date, however, and it has until as late as mid-November to hold the shareholder gathering.</p>
<p>&quot;We're really looking at a transaction that will be taken up sometime in October, but we will maintain our course,&quot; Bollenbach said at Hilton's annual meeting here. &quot;It creates great value for us, so we will continue.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the current $55-per-share, cash-and-stock offer could change depending on what ITT owns when it completes a plan to sell assets and focus on its core hotel and gambling operations.</p>
<p>ITT owns Sheraton hotels and Caesars casinos. Since Hilton's offer, it has sold its stake in a French telecommunications company and announced the sale of its stake in an entertainment company. The two deals will raise over $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>Absent any new developments on the $55-per-share ITT acquisition front, Bollenbach said Beverly Hills-based Hilton continues to operate its business as usual.</p>
<p>The company generally has two or three people working on the ITT bid at any time with the number increasing to as many as six depending on the activity. Hilton has employed outside help for many of its merger activities, Bollenbach said.</p>
<p>At the height of acquisition activity, in February and March, the chief executive spent about half his time on the offer performing tasks like lobbying ITT's largest shareholders for support. That amount has fallen to about one-third of his time recently, Bollenbach said.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the keys in doing a transaction like this is to be sure you don't disrupt your own business,&quot; Bollenbach said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hilton will continue seeking large, full service hotels to buy. Hilton also will remain an acquiror of gambling companies as opportunities arise, but Bollenbach said many of the smaller companies are currently overpriced.</p>
<p>The company's plans to open a new western-themed resort casino in Atlantic City, called Bally's Wild Wild West, remain on track for opening in July. Also, a 300-room expansion of the Atlantic City Hilton is set for opening this summer.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, the company recently broke ground on its casino themed after the city of Paris, and a casino expansion of the Las Vegas Hilton, called the &quot;Star Trek Experience&quot; remains on plan to open in late July or early August.</p>
<p>Hilton's stock closed Thursday off 25 cents at $28.75 and ITT shares lost 12.5 cents to $59.75, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
