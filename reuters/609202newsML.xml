<p>Voting in Iran's presidential election was extended twice on Friday due to a high turnout in the sharpest political battle between conservatives and moderates since the Islamic revolution.</p>
<p>Voting ended after four extra hours of balloting. More than 33,000 polling stations which opened at 8.00 a.m. (0330 GMT) and were due to close 10 hours later were twice instructed by the Interior Ministry to remain open and eventually closed at 10.00 p.m. (1730 GMT).</p>
<p>After a fiercely fought campaign and talk about fears of vote-rigging, the result seemed likely to be a close contest between two middle-ranking Shi'ite Moslem clergymen, Mohammad Khatami and Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.</p>
<p>Khatami, a former culture minister who has attracted a rainbow coalition of women, youths and intellectuals seeking change after 18 years of revolution, was expected to sweep Tehran and other big cities.</p>
<p>Many of his supporters see him as a moderate compared with the conservatives who control parliament and some of Iran's state institutions.</p>
<p>Nateq-Nouri is speaker of parliament and enjoys the backing of influential groups of conservative clergy and merchants. He is stronger in rural areas.</p>
<p>Both men and two others rated outsiders were approved by a conservative group of senior clergy and lawyers called the Guardian Council before being allowed to run in the election.</p>
<p>The council rejected 234 other candidates who it said were not committed to Islamic revolutionary ideals.</p>
<p>Either Khatami or Nateq-Nouri will replace President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani when he steps down in August after the maximum two consecutive terms of office permitted by law.</p>
<p>Many people leaving polling stations in Tehran said they had voted for Khatami, but Iranian analysts and Western diplomats said the result was too close to call.</p>
<p>&quot;I voted for Khatami because he's more enlightened,&quot; said Saeed Jalal, a civil engineer, as he left a mosque after casting his ballot in a north Tehran middle class district.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't enjoy any kind of freedoms at all...We have no entertainment or lifestyle,&quot; said Laleh, a 17-year-old student who said she had voted for Khatami.</p>
<p>Khatami's main opponent is considered the establishment candidate -- a powerful factor in more traditional areas.</p>
<p>In a small hamlet in the snow-capped Alborz mountains overlooking the capital, student Masoumeh, 16, said the election was about continuing the path of Iran's martyrs.</p>
<p>&quot;The president should fight and suppress anti-revolutionary forces and make the chador (the most conservative form of traditional Islamic dress for women) obligatory throughout Iran,&quot; she said after voting in a mosque.</p>
<p>First voting tallies could emerge on Saturday and the final result is expected to be announced by Monday.</p>
<p>Thirty-three million Iranians aged 15 and over were eligible to vote at 33,180 mosques, schools and clinics turned into polling stations and guarded by 200,000 police.</p>
<p>Revolutionary Iran's enmity towards the United States, a recurrent theme during the election campaign, was repeated in calls for all those eligible to use their vote.</p>
<p>&quot;If one candidate shows the slightest tolerance to America and the Western countries' interference and cultural onslaught the people will not vote for him,&quot; supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in remarks broadcast by Tehran radio.</p>
<p>&quot;They will vote for someone who can stand against America and those who want to impose their will on our nation.&quot;</p>
<p>Nateq-Nouri said that, if elected, he would not change Iran's policy towards the United States and European Union.</p>
<p>Tehran has had no diplomatic relations with Washington since 1980 and its ties with the 15-nation EU are severely strained over a German court verdict implicating top Iranian leaders in political killings in Berlin. Iran has denied the accusations.</p>
<p>State television showed footage of the seizure of hostages at the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979, nine months after the clergy-led revolution which toppled the shah.</p>
