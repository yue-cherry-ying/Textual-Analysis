<title>KENYA: Moi warns on ethnic dangers and impact of drought.</title>

<p>Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi opened the last parliamentary session before elections by warning the opposition on Tuesday not to stir up ethnic trouble.</p>
<p>The president and his ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) are clear favourites to win the presidential and parliamentary elections due to be held by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>In his speech to parliament, Moi condemned opposition members who criticised Kenya abroad and told them not to use debates to spark ethnic hostilities.</p>
<p>&quot;My government will continue to uphold the maintenance of law and order, by dealing firmly with those who seek to promote ethnicity and senseless disregard for the rule of law,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kenya's politics are highly tribalised, contributing to the opposition's inability to unite behind sole candidates.</p>
<p>Moi repeated earlier warnings from his central bank governor that several months of drought in most of the country has jeopardised the government's growth and inflation targets.</p>
<p>&quot;Our country may register a decline in economic growth and a possible increase in the rate of inflation this year,&quot; he said, because money was being diverted to cope with the crisis.</p>
<p>The worst drought for a decade has slashed Kenya's food output and decimated livestock in arid areas. The government is importing maize, the staple, for free distribution in worst-hit areas. A steady rise in the market price of maize is certain to increase inflation from the 8.4 percent rate at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>There are signs that the long rains due in April are beginning.</p>
<p>Also blaming the drought, the central bank has adjusted its earlier projected rise in gross domestic product from seven percent in 1997 to 4.5 percent, compared with 4.8 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Moi described as &quot;completely unfounded&quot; opposition claims the government was using food aid as an election weapon and that by declaring a national disaster Moi was also curbing public freedoms.</p>
<p>He gave no details of the government's legislative programme, but privatisation of Kenya's inefficient posts and telecommunications utility (KPTC) is likely to be on the agenda, diplomats say.</p>
<p>The slow pace of KPTC's reform is irritating donors and the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>The opposition, backed by some donors including the United States, is pressing Moi to accept constitutional reforms, partly to make a more level playing field for the elections.</p>
<p>&quot;The president clearly avoided touching on major political issues,&quot; prominent opposition parliamentarian Raila Odinga told Reuters after Moi's silence on the subject in his speech.</p>
