<p>Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius said on Thursday that 30 percent of the country's working population was paying no income taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;The statistics are very sad, only 1.25 million people pay income taxes compared to 1.9 million people a few years ago,&quot; Vagnorius told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;If such a tempo remains, at the end of this year or at the beginning of 1998 the number of working people (paying taxes) would be the same as those on pension,&quot; Vagnorius added.</p>
<p>There are around 900,000 pensioners in the country.</p>
<p>Vagnorius said that the government intends to ram a fresh batch of laws through parliament in the next few days which will tighten the noose around tax evaders and force them to pay up.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no other choice but to force the 30 percent who pay no income taxes to pay like the rest of the population,&quot; Vagnorius said.</p>
<p>Revenue collection has improved since the government launched a campaign early in the year against companies who dodged their tax obligations.</p>
<p>The state budget posted a surplus for the first four months of 1997, the first time it was in the black in this period since 1992.</p>
