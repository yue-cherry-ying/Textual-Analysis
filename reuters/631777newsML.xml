<p>&quot;Titanic,&quot; the musical based on one of the great sea diasters of all time, took an early lead in the Tony awards Sunday night, picking up four of the first five awards.</p>
<p>The $10 million musical that many critics predicted might sink without a trace on Broadway, won awards for best orchestration, best original score, best book and best scenic design.</p>
<p>Peter Stone won for best book and Jonathan Tunick won for orchestration, the first time the Tonys -- Broadway's version of the Oscars -- has given such an award.</p>
<p>Maury Yeston, who did the music and lyrics for Titanic, won for best original score -- a sign that many saw as an indication that his musical could take the top before the evening ends. It was only nmoniated for five awards.</p>
<p>Stewart Laing won for best scenic design for his work on Titanic.</p>
<p>Ann Reinking, the choreographer of the hit revival of &quot;Chicago,&quot; was best named choreographer and she tearfully accepted the award. She choked back tears at the end and proclaimed, &quot;This one is for you Bobby.&quot; It was a referewnce to her mentor, Bob Fosse, who created the original production of Chicago.</p>
