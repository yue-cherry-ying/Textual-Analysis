<p>Blue-chip stocks rebounded sharply from the previous session's sell-off Thursday on the possibility of a capital gains tax cut.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 106.36 points at 7,192.01, racing back after Wednesday's 140-point plunge that stemmed from an upturn in long-term interest rates in the bond market.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues beat declines 2-1 on active volume of 288 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's rally is as perplexing as yesterday's sell-off,&quot; said Joseph Batapaglia, chief investment officer at Gruntal &amp; Co. &quot;We are in a bullish environment for stocks based on good news in the economy and the availability of money for investment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;All in all, investors are buoyed by what they see and whenever there are dips in the market, as was the case yesterday, there is money to throw at it the next day,&quot; Batapaglia said. &quot;Nothing in this environment has dampened investor confidence or consumer habit.&quot;</p>
<p>The market soared in early trading after an expected wave of tax-related selling on a proposed capital gains tax cut did not materialise.</p>
<p>Some analysts were predicting a sell-off following news after the close Wednesday that the proposed capital gains tax, as part of a proposed federal budget agreement, would be effective May 7.</p>
<p>Republican chairmen of the congressional tax-writing committees said they would propose setting that date as the effective date for a lower capital gains tax.</p>
<p>The tax cut is expected to be part of a tax package this year and was included in a broad outline of a budget agreement to balance the budget by 2002 reached Friday between congressional leaders and the White House.</p>
<p>Analysts expect the current top capital gains tax rate of 28 percent will end up anywhere from the 19.8 percent that Senate Republicans proposed early this year to 21 percent.</p>
<p>A jump in bonds also boosted stocks.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up nearly half a point, lowering its yield to 6.93 percent from 6.96 percent on Wednesday, when the yield jumped after a disappointing auction of 10-year Treasury notes. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>High technology stocks, including Dow component International Business Machines Corp., led the market higher.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in a secular bull market for high techs. The percentage of this economy driven by technology will expand from 12 to 13 percent now to 25 percent in the next five years,&quot; Batapaglia said.</p>
<p>&quot;Gowth in the economy is met by growth in the high tech industry, and then some,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>IBM stock was up 6-3/8 at 168-1/2 after what analysts described as an optimistic meeting with the company late Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index, laden with technology stocks, was up 14.11 points to 1,337.02.</p>
