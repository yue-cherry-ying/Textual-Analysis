<p>Polish steel trader Stalexport SA wants to increase the number of steel mills it controls from three to five and is considering bidding in more government tenders to build motorways, the firm's president said.</p>
<p>&quot;Taking over additional steel mills...would give us 25 percent of the steel market in Poland,&quot; Ryszard Harhala told a news conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said the company hoped to buy from the treasury a controlling stake in the small Huta 1 Maja steel mill, in southern Poland, by mid-1997.</p>
<p>Harhala said Stalexport is also considering taking either Huta Jednosc or Huta Andrzej, both small mills in southern Poland.</p>
<p>He also said if Stalexport's programme to modernise and operate a short motorway link in southern Poland proved successful the company would bid in two tenders to construct sections of two other motorways.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the transport ministry awarded Stalexport a licence to upgrade and operate a 60 km section of toll highway between the cities of Katowice and Krakow.</p>
<p>&quot;If this project proves successful, we will bid for successive licences concerning the A4 and A1 motorways,&quot; Harhala said.</p>
<p>He said Stalexport would invest about $25 million in upgrading the Krakow-Katowice motorway section and collect a toll of between six and eight zlotys.</p>
<p>Under the government programme, companies and consortia are invited by a government agency to build sections of 2,500 km of motorways on which they will be allowed to collect tolls.</p>
<p>Harhala aslo confirmed that Stalexport's $50 million convertible bond issue, maturing April 3, 2002, had enjoyed a 79-percent oversubscription.</p>
<p>He confirmed that the issue, to be listed on the London bourse as of April 3, was bought by 106 investors, 40 percent of which came from Switzerland, 40 percent from other western European countries, 14 percent from the United States and four percent from mid-east countries.</p>
