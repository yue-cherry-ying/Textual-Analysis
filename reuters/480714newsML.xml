<p>British shares were braced for heavy early losses on Tuesday as two successive sessions of sharp decline on Wall Street take their toll on European equity markets, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Dow tumbled 157 points on Monday after an 140-point dive on Thursday, for an aggregate 4.3 percent decline. Since London closed on Thursday, the Dow has shed around 250 points.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally you'd say the market would go along with 50 percent of what Wall Street does,&quot; one British strategist said. &quot;But as we've all been waiting for a correction of some sort we could easily see the FTSE 100 lose three percent.&quot;</p>
