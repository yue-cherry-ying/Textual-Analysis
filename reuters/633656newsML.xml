<title>ARGENTINA: Maradona debuts as silent chat show host.</title>
<headline>Maradona debuts as silent chat show host.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1997-06-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Soccer star Diego Maradona made his debut as host of a prime time Argentine television chat show Monday but provided little chat.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old former Argentina captain did little more than smile nervously for much of the show, forcing its other host Mauro Viale to rush to his aid and do the talking.</p>
<p>Attempts to get Maradona to converse with guests including his friend pop star Charly Garcia failed to get far and Garcia began to argue with Viale, telling him &quot;television sucks&quot;.</p>
<p>Other guests on the programme included a 65-year-old Italian woman with a three-year-old son and a young Colombian man able to repeat what people said to him backwards.</p>
<p>Viale also publicly presented the family of a man who disappeared during Argentina's 1976-1983 military dictatorship with the military document ordering his execution.</p>
<p>Maradona has often expressed a desire to work as a journalist, and nurtures an ambition to interview Cuban leader Fidel Castro.</p>
<p>But his relations with the press have not always been idyllic. In 1994, after returning in disgrace from the World Cup where he was suspended for failing a dope test, he locked himself up at home and fired with an air rifle at reporters who were hounding him.</p>
<p>Maradona said he will co-host the show with Viale three times a week.</p>
