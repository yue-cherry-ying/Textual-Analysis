<p>TOP STORIES</p>
<p>- Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh has ordered authorities to obtain all crucial information from key heroin trafficking suspect Li Yun-chung before he is extradited to the United States. Chavalit's order comes amid a looming conflict between the police and the Thai judiciary over the latter's refusal to play plaintiff in connection with Li's controversial bail jumping in February.

<p>- Deputy Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej plans to give city traffic police some respite by reducing their daily duty hours and reining in their provincial colleagues to share the workload. Samak, who has already broached the idea with Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, wants the 4,000-strong city traffic police to work only four hours daily instead of the minimum 10 hours they are required to put in manning key crossings to prevent snarlups.

<p>- Women's groups in the Northeast have delivered a letter of regret to the Lao consul-general in Khon Kaen province for the rape of four young Lao women in police cells in Rayong province. The women, who also express regret to the victims, vow to push for prosecution of the rapists and the police accused of subjecting the girls to four days of sexual abuse. (BANGKOK POST)</p>

<p>- Bank of Thailand (BOT) Governor Rerngchai Marakanond says he expects commercial bank interest rates to drop next month. Rerngchai says that in order to enhance money market stability, the BOT will restructure the Minimum Lending Rate and the Minimum Retail Rate, currently set by commercial banks. (BUSINESS DAY)</p>
<p>- Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh has defended the government's decision to increase the excise tax on luxury goods and says that more are in the pipeline. Since the tax hike on luxury items announced Wednesday will not affect the general public, it should not be used as a pretext by traders of other goods to increase prices. (BANGKOK POST)</p>
<p>- While Bank of Thailand officials continue to maintain the mega merger between Finance One Plc and Thai Danu Bank is on track, analysts say failure is likely and are bracing for a shock wave hitting the stock market. Boards of directors for both Finance One and Thai Danu Bank will meet today to discuss the planned merger, which has reportedly been snagged over disagreements on share pricing. (BANGKOK POST)</p>
