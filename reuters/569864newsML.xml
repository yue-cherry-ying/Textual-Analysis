<p>Former Socialist prime minister Laurent Fabius indicated on Thursday that France's main opposition party remained divided over the issue of a partial privatisation of France Telecom.</p>
<p>Fabius said that while public services such as the EDF electricity company and the mail service had to remain in state hands, companies that operate in competitive markets there can be partially sold.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a few questions concerning whether or not to open the capital of (state) companies. Let's say that in the competitive sector it is totally normal that one can open the capital,&quot; Fabius said on TF1 television.</p>
<p>&quot;Public sector companies (EDF, the post) play an essential role and one should not sell them out,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He did not mention France Telecom directly but suggested that the state-owned operator, which will face full competition in a completely liberalised market from January 1, 1998, should be partially privatised.</p>
<p>The French term &quot;ouverture du capital&quot;, which Fabius used in his TF1 appearance, is often translated into English as a partial privatisation because it involves the sale of a minority stake in a state-owned company to the private sector.</p>
<p>Unlike Fabius, Socialist Party leader Lionel Jospin and party spokesman Francois Hollande have stressed that the party, if it gains power in the May 25 and June 1 parliamentary elections, would keep &quot;100 percent&quot; of France Telecom.</p>
<p>Fabius joined other party heavyweights such as Martine Aubry, daughter of ex-European Commission president Jacques Delors and favoured as Socialist Prime Minister in opinion polls, in leaving options open on a France Telecom sale.</p>
<p>France's centre-right government has suspended the sale of a 30-35 percent stake in France Telecom, worth between 160 and 210 billion francs ($27.6 and $36.3 billion), by four weeks to avoid it clashing with the election campaign.</p>
<p>The France Telecom sale would be the biggest French share market operation ever and create a group with the biggest market valuation in France ahead of oil group Elf-Aquitaine.</p>
<p>It is a key element in France's efforts to cut its national debt and budget deficit on the way to meeting the Maastricht criteria for European monetary union.</p>
<p>The privatisation receipts of France Telecom cannot be used under the European rules to cut the deficit. But the money would serve to recapitalise a number of loss-making state firms whose costs would otherwise weigh on the budget.</p>
<p>The main declared future rival to France Telecom is Cegetel, a unit of Generale des Eaux which also counts British Telecom Plc, Germany's Mannesmann AG and SBC Communications Inc among its backers.</p>
<p>Fabius reaffirmed that the Socialist Party would not re-nationalise any companies.</p>
<p>He did not address the Maastricht Treaty in the brief interview. He said that fighting unemployment had to be the main focus for a government and reduction of the working week could be one of the policy elements.</p>
