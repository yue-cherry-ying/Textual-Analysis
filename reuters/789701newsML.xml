<p>The old crew on the Mir space station on Saturday resumed briefing the newly-arrived relief team which will try to fix the damaged craft, Mission Control said.</p>
<p>A spokesman at Korolyov Mission Control outside Moscow said two of old crew, which was involved in a collision on June 25 which damaged the station's power supply, were also continuing preparations to fly home next Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The handover is being continued. The old crew is sharing its experiences with the new crew and is also preparing for the descent,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Commander Vasily Tsibliyev, who developed heart problems during his mission, and flight engineer Alexander Lazutkin are scheduled to return to Earth on August 14.</p>
<p>The third man on board during the accident on June 25, in which the Spektr module attached to Mir was punctured, was British-born NASA astrophysicist Michael Foale. He will remain on Mir until September.</p>
<p>The relief crew of commander Anatoly Solovyov and flight engineer Pavel Vinogradov docked with Mir on Thursday.</p>
<p>They are due to start work on August 20 to restore power on Mir, which has run on partial energy since June. The repairs will include going outside Spektr to inspect the puncture.</p>
<p>The collision was the worst accident in Mir's 11 years in orbit. Other problems since then have included Tsibliyev's irregular heartbeat, brought on by stress, and the leak of an unidentified liquid into space.</p>
