<p>Mexico's left-wing Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), triumphant after weekend polls in Mexico City, on Monday threatened protests against the result of elections in southeastern Campeche state.</p>
<p>Layda Sansores, PRD candidate for governor in the oil-rich state where old-style political bosses dominate, said numerous irregularities had occurred in Sunday's poll and vowed to begin a protest campaign.</p>
<p>She said the PRD had video and audio evidence of groups from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) pressuring voters arriving at polling centres, and said they also had attempted to buy votes.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever happens we are going to begin an immediate political mobilisation,&quot; she told a news conference in the state capital Campeche.</p>
<p>&quot;We will take the legal route, the route of civil passive resistance, but we want the authorities to deal with this case with full impartiality,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>PRI officials in the state were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Partial preliminary official results from Campeche gave the PRI 47.76 percent of the vote against 40.83 for the PRD, a count that also was disputed by Sansores.</p>
<p>The elections in other parts of the country were considered cleaner than usual in Mexico, and the PRD handily won the first race in decades for mayor of Mexico City. The PRI has ruled the country for 68 years.</p>
