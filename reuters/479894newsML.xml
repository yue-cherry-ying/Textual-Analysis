<headline>Palestinians say Israel behind Gaza blast.</headline>
<dateline>GAZA 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>An aide to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said on Tuesday that an Arab killed in Gaza in what Israel called a suicide bombing had died from an explosive charge thrown at him from an Israeli army jeep.</p>
<p>&quot;In Kfar Darom area, an Israeli military jeep hurled a grenade or a bomb at (Palestinian) passersby killing one and wounding others. This is information that we have collected from passersby and victims,&quot; Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, secretary-general of the Palestinian cabinet, told Reuters.</p>
<p>A Palestinian dressed in military uniform was ripped apart by an explosion on the main Gaza-Rafah road and seven taxi passengers were wounded in the Tuesday morning blast.</p>
<p>Israeli military authorities said the dead man was a suicide bomber who prematurely blew himself up while trying to attack Jewish targets.</p>
<p>In a separate incident, a second Palestinian was killed when he blew himself up near the Jewish settlement of Netzarim. No one was wounded in the blast.</p>
<p>Abdel-Rahman said local media recently reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had authorised the Israeli secret service to resume activities in areas under PLO control.</p>
<p>Asked if he was accusing Israel of responsibility for the bombing, he said: &quot;It is premature to say that Mr. Netanyahu has given a green light for operations of this kind. But if such an evidence comes up, I will say that.&quot;</p>
<p>A Palestinian witness said he saw an Israeli jeep pointing a gun fitted with some sort of shell bomb driving in front of him moments before the blast.</p>
<p>The Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas denied it was behind the explosions and accused Israel of ordering the blasts to sour relations between Hamas and Arafat's Palestinian Authority.</p>
