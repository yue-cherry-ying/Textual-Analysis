<p>The world leader in hearing implants, Australia's Cochlear Ltd, on Thursday unveiled a new device designed to give deaf babies and infants the power of hearing.</p>
<p>Launching the latest version of its Nucleus bionic ears, Cochlear said the smaller and &quot;smarter&quot; Nucleus 24 model was already selling in Europe, Asia and Australia and was undergoing clinical trials in the United States.</p>
<p>Cochlear's general manager for research and development, Jim Patrick, said the Nucleus 24 could be fitted to infants younger than 12 months.  </p>
<p>The existing Nucleus 22 model can comfortably be fitted surgically to infants aged as young as about 16 months, though it has been fitted by some clinics to infants younger than this.</p>
<p>The Nucleus 24 model aims to bring hearing to profoundly and severely deaf children at a much younger and more formative age, perhaps as young as six months.</p>
<p>The new model is in its early days as a commercial product, though over 100 children have been fitted with the Nucleus 24 world wide, Patrick said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The younger the person is when they get a bionic ear, the greater the benefit,&quot; said Professor Graeme Clark, who heads the research team which helped develop the Cochlear implant.</p>
<p>Clark cited Australian research showing children performed much better with their education, and were more likely to attend a mainstream school, if they received an implant earlier.</p>
<p>With one in every 2,000 babies born severely or profoundly deaf, Cochlear hopes the new hearing implant will help to grow the entire market for bionic ears.  </p>
<p>It has 70 to 75 percent of the world market for hearing implants, but faces growing competition from U.S.-based Advance Bionics, with an estimated 15 percent of the market, and Austria's Med-El with 10 percent.</p>
<p>Despite such a dominant market share, Cochlear aims to maintain its annual revenue growth of around 12 percent through new products such as Nucleus 24, Patrick said.</p>
<p>&quot;To maintain that (growth) we will need to hold market share and grow the market as well,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
