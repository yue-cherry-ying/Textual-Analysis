<p>The Polish bourse tumbled along with major European exchanges on Tuesday and analysts said the performance of Polish shares would likely be linked to European and especially U.S. price movements later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently all eyes are on foreign bourses, especially that in New York -- if the situation turns around there the falls in Europe and Poland should slow,&quot; said Dariusz Piszczatowski, a trader at Polish Development Bank (PBR) brokerage.</p>
<p>But analysts said more big falls in the Unites States and Western Europe could lead to panic selling in Warsaw.</p>
<p>&quot;If we fall up to one percent tomorrow the falls should slow...but if there's a fall like today it's hard to say where the bottom will be,&quot; said Roman Sosnowski, an analyst at Bank Staropolski brokerage.</p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index fell 3.5 percent to 16,130.0 points and turnover eased 4.4 percent to 223.9 million zlotys ($72.9 million) on all three markets. Gainers led losers by 81 to six with six stocks flat.</p>
<p>Analysts said top gainer Espebepe, which rose 9.5 percent, extended last week's 41.9-percent surge after the previous week's steep fall as speculators played on the debt-ridden builder's uncertain future.</p>
<p>Eight main market stocks fell over nine percent, most of them small-cap stocks which gained significantly last week.</p>
<p>Mass privatisation NFI units tumbled 9.4 percent but analysts said the relatively light trade suggested that another deep fall was unlikely.</p>
<p>The units were flat in continuous trade, where the WIG 20 index dropped 2.8 percent.</p>
