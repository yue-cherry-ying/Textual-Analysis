<p>US Diagnostic Inc's new managers said on Tuesday that few, if any, financial and regulatory surprises awaited investors after the departure of top executives and a rewriting of past accounts.</p>
<p>New chief executive Joseph Paul also said in a telephone conference call that the highly acquisitive U S Diagnostic intended to keep buying up radiology groups, but that most deals would be for cash, rather than shares, because the company's stock price is now so low.  </p>
<p>&quot;In order to really drive the acquisitions the way we want and to not dilute (the company's equity), we will need to put together a new financing package,&quot; Paul said.</p>
<p>US Diagnostic's shares were down 1-1/4 to 6-3/4, or less than half their 52-week high of 14-3/4 after announcing it would restate 1996 results and take $20.6 million in charges.</p>
<p>The company in 1996 acquired more than 100 medical imaging businesses, mostly in rural areas. Two months ago the company put its chief executive and general counsel on administrative leave amid an inquiry into the company's ties to a former consultant who admitted to securities law violations.  </p>
<p>Paul, who was named permanent chief executive late Monday, said US Diagnostic had an existing, unused credit line of about $20 million.</p>
<p>&quot;My guess is we have $240 million to $250 million in the pipeline,&quot; Paul said about pending deals.</p>
<p>He added that few big deals were imminent and many were unlikely to be completed in 1997.</p>
<p>Paul said the tone of business was strong at US Diagnostic clinics, which provide X-rays and other medical imaging services.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend lines are up in volume and revenues, especially for the first two months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He and chairman, Laurans Mendelson, declined to discuss specific financial forecasts.</p>
<p>Mendelson said Securities and Exchange Commission officials were investigating at the company the affairs of former chief executive Jeffrey Goffman and that the investigators could, if they chose, widen their queries.</p>
<p>&quot;Should they expand it we don't believe there is a smoking gun or anything else like that,&quot; Mendelson said.</p>
