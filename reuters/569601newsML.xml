<p>An attorney representing flight attendants in a secondhand smoking lawsuit on Thursday said a judge's ruling would allow jurors to see &quot;the whole picture&quot; during the first stage of the massive class-action against the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>Stanley Rosenblatt, who represents an estimated 60,000 U.S. flight attendants who may have been sickened by cigarette smoke on the job, said he was pleased with a ruling released Thursday by Dade County Judge Robert Kaye.  </p>
<p>The ruling effectively split the case into two parts with common issues to be heard in the first stage and the individual claims of flight attendants to be tried separately.</p>
<p>Although the plaintiffs had argued for a unified trial, Kaye provided a measure of victory for them by ruling that the causation of alleged secondhand smoke ailments and the past behavior of tobacco companies were common issues and should be heard together during the first stage.</p>
<p>The industry had argued at a hearing Monday that those two issues should be separated. Rosenblatt said they were intertwined and should be heard together.  </p>
<p>Rosenblatt said the ruling would allow jurors to hear medical evidence on the alleged health effects of secondhand smoke and evidence on the behavior of tobacco companies at the same time, giving them &quot;the whole picture.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We think it would have been wrong to separate the science of causation from the behavior of the tobacco company over the years,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>Rosenblatt said the issue of punitive damages would be dealt with in the first stage of the trial with compensatory damages decided in the second phase, when the plaintiffs would have to prove that the ailments of individual flight attendants were caused by secondhand smoke.</p>
<p>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co spokeswoman Peggy Carter said the ruling indicated that Kaye was having difficulty attempting &quot;to try what are really individual cases as a class action.&quot; Reynolds is a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.  </p>
<p>The tobacco companies have argued in the past that the lawsuit should not have been certified as a class-action because the illnesses of individuals and the causes of those illnesses should be proved individually.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to believe this case cannot and should not proceed as a class action,&quot; Carter said.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, known as Broin v. Philip Morris et al, was filed by a group of flight attendants who claim they were made ill by cigarette smoke on U.S. passenger flights. The trial is scheduled to begin June 2.</p>
