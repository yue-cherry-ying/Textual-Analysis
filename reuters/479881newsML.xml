<title>EGYPT: Flaws, modifications behind Nile cruiser capsize.</title>
<headline>Flaws, modifications behind Nile cruiser capsize.</headline>

<p>Egyptian investigators have concluded that a Nile cruiser which capsized in November had serious design and structural flaws and had been modified to carry more passengers, official sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>About 20 tourists and Egyptians died when the Princess Jihan capsized in a freak storm in southern Egypt on November 14 in one of the worst accidents on a Nile cruiser for many years.</p>
<p>The mostly Czech and Slovak tourists were making the popular trip from Aswan to Luxor, passing by the Pharaonic temples of Kom Ombo, Edfu and Esna, when the boat tipped over in the Nile about 580 km (360 miles) south of Cairo.</p>
<p>A report on the accident by the Public Monies Investigation Department said the same boat had capsized a few years ago when it was then named Bardees.</p>
<p>The report said the renovated boat's width was out of proportion to its height and that its owner had increased the number of cabins and passengers it could carry without approval.</p>
<p>&quot;This had a negative and direct effect on the balance of the boat at the time of its capsize,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It also said that officials at the River Transport Authority had overlooked these flaws when they issued a license to the owner of the boat.</p>
