<p>Action movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger, who underwent heart surgery last week to replace a heart valve, is recovering and expects to leave the hospital this week, his publicist said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;He is up and walking, making a rapid recovery and they expect to discharge him early this week,&quot; Catherine Olim said, adding there was no firm date for his discharge from an undisclosed hospital.</p>
<p>Schwarzenegger, 49, who is married to television newscaster Maria Shriver, niece of the late President John Kennedy, chose to have the surgery to replace an aortic valve, even though the congenital condition had caused him no health problems.</p>
<p>In a statement last week, the Austrian-born actor and former &quot;Mr Universe&quot; bodybuilder said: &quot;I've never felt sick or had any symptoms at all, but I knew I'd have to take care of this condition sooner or later.</p>
<p>&quot;I said to the doctors: 'Let's do it now, while I'm young and healthy,'&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Schwarzenegger is expected to rest until the end of May, when he will begin promoting the new movie &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; in which he plays the villan, Mr. Freeze.</p>
