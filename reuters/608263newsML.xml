<headline>U.S. CORPORATE BONDS -- Strong CLEC deal closes wk.</headline>

<p>U.S. high-yield corporate bond issues reflected still strong investor demand and dominated an otherwise stagnant shortened session on Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>Topping action was competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) Brooks Fiber Properties Inc's $250 million 10 percent par 10-year senior note deal. The issue, which was increased in size by $50 million, closed higher in a 101-1/8 bid, 101-3/8 offered market.</p>
<p>The issue priced on the wide side of price talk with a spread of 327 basis points over Treasuries, ensuring the positive aftermarket performance, traders said.  </p>
<p>Analysts and buysiders alike noted the Brooks deal would fare best among the new telecom-related paper, due to its positive past operating performance and better than expected first quarter results in the CLEC sector.</p>
<p>The deal was priced via joint lead managers Goldman Sachs &amp; Co and Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>Demand for Brooks outpaced that for Magnum Hunter Resources Inc's $140 million 10 percent 10-year debt, traders said. Lead manager BT Securities Corp was able to upsize the Magnum deal from $125 million, however, following the lead of most other junk bond issues of late this week.  </p>
<p>The Magnum deal, priced at par, was quoted in a 100-3/8 bid, 100-7/8 offered market near the close. One trader said inactivity of the market prevented further gains.</p>
<p>Separately, mutual fund information firm AMG Data Services reported net inflows of $85.4 million in the week ended May 21, significantly lower than the $374.8 million and $1.34 billion in inflows for the two weeks prior. Net cash inflows from weekly-only reporting junk bond funds totaled $3.12 billion the past one and a half months, AMG said.  </p>
<p>Investment grade bonds posted minor fluctuations with U.S. Treasury securities, meanwhile, with particular strength seen in some media and cable credits, according to traders there. Spreads were flat but firm after taking in ground against Treasuries on the week, they added.</p>
<p>Treasury security prices were little changed amid the early close and a dearth of economic data. The 10-year note and 30-year bond both gained 1/32 to yields of 6.75 percent and 6.99 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>U.S. fixed-income markets closed early at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT on Friday in observance of Monday's Memorial Day holiday by recommendation of PSA The Bond Market Trade Association. The markets will honor a full close on Monday.</p>
