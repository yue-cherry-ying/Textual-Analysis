<headline>Third Taiwan cabinet member offers to resign - TV.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Tjiu Mau-ying, chairman of Taiwan's Council of Agriculture, offered to resign on Thursday, becoming the third cabinet member to tender his resignation, state television reported.</p>
<p>&quot;Tjiu Mau-ying has told vice premier Hsu Li-teh this evening that he would resign,&quot; state television said.  </p>
<p>Tjiu has been under fire since March for his council's failure to prevent the outbreak of a deadly hog epidemic that forced Taiwan to launch an all-out ban on pork exports, jeopardising the island's economic recovery.</p>
<p>His resignation followed that of Ma Ying-jeou, minister without portfolio, and Interior Minister Lin Feng-cheng on the same day.</p>
<p>Their resignations came at a time of growing public fury over the government's handling of a series of violent crimes that have hit Taiwan since 1996.</p>
<p>The anger intensified after police on April 28 discovered the body of renowned actress Pai Ping-ping's teenage daughter floating naked in a river on April 28. More than 50,000 people marched in Taipei on Sunday to protest against Pai's murder and demand a cabinet reshuffle.</p>
