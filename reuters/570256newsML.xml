<p>German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe said on Thursday that the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania would definitely be admitted to NATO at some point, even if not in the first wave of new members.</p>
<p>Speaking at a news conference ending a three-day meeting in Denmark with his Danish and Polish counterparts, Ruehe cited Poland as a country that had worked hard in recent years to build relations with the Western defence alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;I can only advise the Balts to co-operate closely so that they do not lose time. One day they will be members of NATO, there is no doubt,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Baltic defence ministers attended the last day of the talks, routinely held every six months, in the northern Danish port of Skaggen.</p>
<p>A NATO summit in Madrid in July is expected to invite Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to be the first former east bloc states tg join their erstwhile foe.</p>
<p>The change is likely to be grudgingly accepted by Russia, which argues that eastward NATO expansion threatens its own security.</p>
<p>But Russian diplomats say that Moscow's opposition to membership for the Baltic states, once part of the Soviet Union itself as opposed to Warsaw Pact allies, will be intense.</p>
<p>At the Skaggen talks Ruehe, Denmark's Hans Haekkerup and Poland's Stanislaw Dobrzanski agreed to invite their Baltic colleagues to annual informal talks, the next to be held in German9 in February 1998.</p>
<p>They also decided to invite Baltic forces to join Danish, German and Polish joint military excercises.</p>
<p>Denmark last October hosted troops from Poland and the Baltic states to train under Nordic and German instructors fgr theoretical future joint peacekeeeping missions. REUTER  081431 GMT may 97</p>
