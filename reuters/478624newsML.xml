<p>Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov, who has worked hard to increase the country's diplomatic contacts, announced on Tuesday that the government would appoint an ambassador to the lost city of Atlantis.</p>
<p>The April Fool's joke was matched by a radio station in Bulgaria's second city of Plovdiv which announced the closure of all the country's banks.</p>
<p>The joke was taken seriously by many people who spent the last year trying to salvage their deposits after a chain of bankruptcies.</p>
<p>&quot;These people should realise that reality in this country is absurd enough and there is no need to play jokes with it,&quot; said one angry listener, who called the Reuters office in Sofia to check radio TNN's announcement.</p>
<p>In a decree issued by the president's office, Stoyanov announced a competition for the ambassadorial post.</p>
<p>On Monday, the government announced a list of serious ambassadorial appointments, including a post in the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator for Edvin Sugarev, former vice-chairman of the parliamentary committee on corruption and an outspoken opponent of the former Socialist government.</p>
<p>Former prime minister Filip Dimitrov, another member of the Union of Democratic Forces who is not close to its current leadership, was appointed ambassador to the United Nations.</p>
<p>In Plovdiv, the private TNN station repeatedly broadcast an announcement that the interim cabinet, which is cracking down on corruption, had decided to close all banks for checks.</p>
<p>&quot;Under an operation codenamed Chameleon, a massive investigation of all banks aiming to determine the origin of their funds was carried out...the cabinet has decided to close all financial institutions for indefinite period with their capital being withdrawn by the central bank,&quot; it said.</p>
