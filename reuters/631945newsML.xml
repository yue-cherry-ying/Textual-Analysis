<title>GERMANY: Berlin opera sacks musician for Hitler &quot;joke&quot;.</title>
<headline>Berlin opera sacks musician for Hitler &quot;joke&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>BERLIN 1997-06-02</dateline>

<p>A leading German opera company said on Monday it had sacked one of its musicians who signed a hotel bill with the name of Adolf Hitler while on a tour of Israel.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Berlin Opera said the 54-year-old double bass player, who had been ordered to return to Berlin, would receive immediate notice of his dismissal.</p>
<p>The incident, in the bar of a Tel Aviv hotel in the early hours of Saturday, provoked a storm of protest in Israel and a demonstration by Holocaust survivors outside the Tel Aviv opera house during the company's performance later that day.</p>
<p>Opera officials, issuing hurried apologies for what they called an isolated incident, said the musician had been drinking heavily before he signed the bill in Hitler's name.</p>
<p>But Germany's mass-circulation daily Bild newspaper, carrying the story as a front-page item, said research by Israeli journalists had shown he had only had two beers in the hotel bar.</p>
<p>Other German newspapers were equally unwilling to pass the affair off as a joke, with some suggesting it showed just how deeply anti-Semitism ran in Germany and that it added fire to the debate over the role of ordinary Germans in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>&quot;One musician has shown us that doubts about our freedom from blame are not entirely unjustified,&quot; the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper said in an editorial.</p>
