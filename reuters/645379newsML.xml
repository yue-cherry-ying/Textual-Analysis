<title>REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: Move over TV pundits; Ireland has its tallymen.</title>
<headline>Move over TV pundits; Ireland has its tallymen.</headline>

<p>DUBLIN, June 7, Reuter - Move over computers. Stand down the television pundits. When Ireland votes, it's people with pencil and paper who identify electoral trends.</p>
<p>All over Ireland on Saturday, people called tallymen stood behind the rows of ballot boxes from Friday's general election and monitored the count, consigning their estimates to notebooks.</p>
<p>All votes are counted by hand on the day after the election and the first indication of who has won comes from the tallymen, who are hired by each competing party to scrutinise counting.</p>
<p>Not for Ireland the computer-driven count with elaborate television graphics displaying graphs of electoral swings and roundabouts.</p>
<p>All electronic media gets its information from the tallymen, not just in general elections but in referenda on issues ranging from abortion to the bail laws.</p>
<p>Traditionally it is the tallymen -- there are tallywomen too -- who break the news of how Ireland has voted, although this time the Irish Times carried out the nation's first exit poll.</p>
<p>On Saturday the tallymen were confirming what the newspaper predicted -- the opposition Fianna Fail is heading for a narrow win over the coalition government of Prime Minister John Bruton, who leads the Fine Gael party.</p>
<p>By their account, support for Bruton's main coalition ally, the Labour party of Dick Spring, has collapsed and seems almost certain to torpedo Bruton's chance of being the first prime minister to be returned at an election in almost 30 years.</p>
<p>Ireland's 2.7 million voters cast their ballots at 5,000 polling stations around the country on Friday. Then ballot boxes were sealed and taken to 41 constituency centres where counting started at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Saturday.</p>
<p>That's when the tallymen get to work, standing behind barriers as ballot boxes are emptied.</p>
<p>Ireland prides itself on the tallymen system. Those who suggest the Irish should adopt 20th century computer technology before the 21st century arrives are scoffed at.</p>
<p>Billy McDonald, a 31-year-old caterer, is the third member of his family to ply the unpaid trade.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a member of Fine Gael. My father was in it as a tallyman and his father was in it as well and I hope my kids will do it too. I think Fianna Fail are corrupt and I like to be here to keep an eye on things,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>All tallymen say that they are there to make sure Ireland's complex proportional transfer voting system works to the benefit of their candidates.</p>
<p>Votes are transferred to second, third and even fourth-choice candidates if no one gets a clear majority on the first count.</p>
<p>Sharon Brady, a 19-year-old whose father is Fianna Fail candidate Martin Brady, said she had been a &quot;tallygirl&quot; three times, twice at local elections.</p>
<p>&quot;It's to give you an idea as to who is coming out in the first preference. It's a good indication of the first preferences so you can judge where you are,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Most tallymen confirmed that support for Spring's Labour party, which has been in government for 10 of the last 15 years, was waning. &quot;The Spring tide is out,&quot; quipped one.</p>
