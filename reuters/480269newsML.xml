<headline>Shell says Nigeria oil output returning to normal.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>Royal/Dutch Shell expects output from its Nigerian operations to return to normal during the course of this week after community unrest cut production by more than 20 percent last week, a senior company official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;During the course of this week we expect to resume normal levels of production,&quot; the Lagos-based official said.  </p>
<p>&quot;These things take time, you have to check the integrity of systems and suchlike,&quot; said the official.</p>
<p>A Shell spokesman said operations at flow stations brought to a halt by local political protests were being resumed.</p>
<p>Five stations at Nembe Creek and Odeama, part of the Bonny export system in the eastern Niger delta, are already back onstream.</p>
<p>Jones Creek and Batan flow stations, part of the Forcados export system in the vicinity of Warri, also were brought back on line at the weekend, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Four flow stations at the Forcados systems Egwa and Odidi were resuming operations on Tuesday, he said.</p>
<p>Shell's Nigerian output on Monday was running at 790,000 barrels per day (bpd) or about 150,000 bpd below normal capacity.</p>
<p>The Shell spokesman said output on Tuesday was running &quot;at least 50,000 bpd&quot; below normal.</p>
<p>Shell last week said shipments of Bonny Light and Bonny Medium in the first 20 days of April would be delayed by about three days. Some nine cargoes will be affected.</p>
<p>Forcados shipments have not yet been hit.</p>
<p>The Shell official said that currently there were still no plans to cancel cargoes.  </p>
<p>Militant villagers protesting against a merger of two communities and relocation of the capital of another council area last week disrupted Shell's operations, shutting in a combined 210,000 bpd east and west of the Niger delta.</p>
