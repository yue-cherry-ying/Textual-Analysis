<p>Taiwan share prices remained slightly higher in late Thursday trade as recent bellwether electronics sector continued to attract buyers despite a heavy overnight slump on Wall Street, brokers said.</p>
<p>At 0305 GMT, with 55 minutes left, the index was up 24.55 points or 0.29 percent at 8,451.62. Turnover was T$68 billion.</p>
<p>Electronics led the gains, rising 1.3 percent, with notebook computer maker Inventec rose by the daily seven percent limit to T$353 on expected sound outlook.</p>
<p>Paper and electricals shares were also strong, but financials fell slightly.  </p>
<p>Brokers said they expected a firming trend after President Lee Teng-hui on Wednesday called for a cabinet reshuffle, showing the government's determination to crack down on crime.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the government will not release any bearish news to hit the stock market at a time when it is going to reshuffle the cabinet,&quot; said Michael Hung, an independent senior analyst.</p>
<p>Hung said he expected support at 8,400. &quot;The index will likely move firmer to test 8,700 in the near term,&quot; he said.</p>
