<p>Bulgarians are voting on Saturday in parliamentary elections brought forward after 30 days of mass protests in January and February forced the former Socialist government to stand down two years early.</p>
<p>Here are some facts and figures on the election:</p>
<p>Polling stations close at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT) on Saturday. Votes will be counted in 12,600 polling stations then collated by regional offices of the Central Electoral Committee.</p>
<p>Results of exit polls may be announced before polls close. Preliminary official results are expected early on Sunday.</p>
<p>The electoral commission says 6.2 million Bulgarians aged 18 and over are eligible to vote.</p>
<p>Under Bulgaria's system of proportional representation, the parties and coalitions put up lists of candidates in each of the country's 31 districts.</p>
<p>A total of 4,448 candidates are contesting the polls, representing 35 parties and coalitions, which must poll a minimum of four percent nationwide to enter parliament.</p>
<p>Opinion polls give five parties and coalitions a chance of gaining seats in the new parliament:</p>
<p>The Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), which led 30 days of mass protests in January and February that toppled the former Socialist government, is projected to win a majority.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), which agreed to give up attempts to form a new cabinet in February after mediation by President Petar Stoyanov, is expected to be the biggest opposition party.</p>
<p>Other groups likely to enter parliament are:</p>
<p>-- The Union for National Salvation, a coalition including the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) and monarchist parties.</p>
<p>-- The Euro-Left, a new coalition of leftist parties and Socialist defectors.</p>
<p>-- The Bulgarian Business Bloc (BBB), which in November's presidential election styled itself as the third force in Bulgarian politics but has less support now.</p>
<p>In the last parliamentary elections in December 1994, the BSP won 125 seats, the UDF 69, the People's Union coalition 18, the MRF 15 and the BBB 13.</p>
