<p>A third British teenager has died overnight from injuries suffered on Monday when a bus carrying children on a school trip in eastern France veered off a road, British and French officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The child, identified by the British Consulate as Keith Ridding, 14, died early on Tuesday in hospital in the Alpine city of Grenoble, the officials said.</p>
<p>His mother was at his side at the time of his death,  a British Consulate official said.</p>
<p>The bus had driven off the road on Monday near the town of Moutiers, falling 20 metres (60 feet) into a ravine before eventually coming to rest on its side against a tree. It was carrying 23 passengers from a nearby holiday camp to a rock-climbing site.</p>
<p>The victims were all from the northern British town of Bolton.</p>
<p>Schoolgirl Nicola Moore, 16, died almost immediately after the accident and Robert Boardman,14, died in hospital later.</p>
