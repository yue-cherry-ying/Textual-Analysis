<title>REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: Irish bonds firm up on calmer currency.</title>
<headline>Irish bonds firm up on calmer currency.</headline>
<dateline>DUBLIN 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Irish bonds firmed in steady trade on Friday, tracking a global improvement in bonds and helped by a stabilisation of the domestic currency market, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yields have shifted down by about 10 basis points across the Irish curve today,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;We're following a global trend but Irish bonds have also been helped by a more stable currency market and by supportive comments from the finance minister.&quot;</p>
<p>By 1510 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was up 35 pence at 102.20 to yield 5.91 percent while the key benchmark eight percent bond due 2006 was up 45 pence at 108.95 to yield 6.66 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said Irish bonds were outperforming Germany by about seven basis points.</p>
<p>The selling pressure which hit the Irish pound on Wednesday, denting investor confidence, had eased by early Friday cooled by weaker sterling, dealers said.</p>
<p>The punt came under selling pressure amid concerns that its high exchange rate in the ERM was unsustainable.</p>
<p>However, Finance Minister Ruiari Quinn said on Friday that the punt &quot;won't necessarily&quot; enter EMU at the central ERM rate -- a comment that had been helpful to the front end of the bond market, dealers said.</p>
<p>The spreads on yields of Irish bonds over Germany were 135 basis points above in the five-year area, and 74 above in the 10-year area, a dealer said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, while markets relaxed a little due to the U.S. Federal Reserve decision not to push up its key short-term funds rate this week, most market participants believe higher rates are inevitable in both the U.S. and the UK in order to prevent an inflationary spike.</p>
