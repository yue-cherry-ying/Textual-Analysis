<p>A new study indicates that special paint used to protect the airship Hindenburg from sunlight led to its spectacular destruction in 1937, German ARD television said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Panorama magazine programme said it would air new evidence on Thursday to counter the long-held assumption that ignition of inflammable hydrogen in the airship caused the fireball that was captured in one of the world's most famous newsreel films.</p>
<p>U.S. researchers used archive film, models and computer simulation to study the explosion of the Hindenburg on May 6, 1937, over its transatlantic terminus at Lakehurst, New Jersey.</p>
<p>NASA space agency scientist Addison Bain said the paint, designed to protect the Hindenburg from sunlight on its trips from Europe, had never been tested or used on other Zeppelins.</p>
<p>Bain said the yellow-red colour of the flames showed that the painted external surface of the airship had caught fire first. &quot;That is no hydrogen fire,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Thirty-five passengers and one of the ground crew died in the explosion, ending the golden age of the airborne cruise liners that had become a defining image of the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
<p>The highly public disaster was a propaganda blow for Nazi Germany, which had hoped to impress the world with the 245-metre ship, and ARD said investigations into the cause were systematically suppressed at the time.</p>
