<title>ISRAEL: Israeli unlinked bonds and Makams end higher.</title>
<headline>Israeli unlinked bonds and Makams end higher.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Israeli bonds closed higher on Tuesday led by a rise in unlinked bonds and Makams, traders said.</p>
<p>Indices:</p>
<p>* Government bonds general: +0.03 pct to 104.62</p>
<p>* CPI-linked government bonds: +0.04 pct to 104.77</p>
<p>* Unlinked government bonds (Gilon -- issued for four years): +0.11 pct to 104.55</p>
<p>* Dollar-linked government bonds: -0.17 to 103.6</p>
<p>* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: +0.14 to 103.66</p>
<p>Volume was a moderate 170 million shekels with most of it concentrated in the Makam.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a consensus among investors that the market has reached an equilibriun and that it will remain at the current level in the near term,&quot; said Danniella Finn, head of sales at Batucha Seucrities and Investments.</p>
<p>&quot;CPI-linked bonds were very stable and mixed. These bonds made a big move and now they rest,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the activity was concentrated in unlinked bonds and Makams. Now that the yields on CPI-linked bonds have fallen, investors prefer to invest in unlinked bonds which offer a relatively high yield of 14.5 percent,&quot; said a trader at Sahar Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Volume at the Makams was high at 86 million shekels. The Makam offers yields of around 13.9 percent which makes it very attractive if the 1997 inflation remains below nine percent,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Dollar-linked bonds fell sharply following the rise of the shekel against the U.S. dollar. In local trading the representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.3570 shekels against 3.3610 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity.</p>
<p>($1 = 3.36 shekels)</p>
