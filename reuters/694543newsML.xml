<p>A federal court jury has awarded $11.7 million in damages to a sales manager at American pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson after finding the company retaliated against her for complaining of discrimination, her attorneys said on Friday.</p>
<p>A jury of six men and two women awarded the damages to Jennifer Passantino after a three-week trial in Tacoma, Washington, a Seattle law firm representing Passantino said.</p>
<p>The verdict was returned on June 19, but has only now been publicised by the law firm.</p>
<p>Passantino, 43, who lives in Lakewood, Washington, has worked for Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Products Inc. since 1979, the last seven years as a national account manager.</p>
<p>The damages were for past and future economic losses of $2.1 million, emotional distress of $1 million and $8.6 million in punitive damages.</p>
<p>Federal law, however, places a ceiling on punitive damages of $300,000. U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan has yet to rule on whether the cap on punitive damages applies to this case, Passantino's attorney Victoria Vreeland said.</p>
<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson, one of the world's leading drug manufacturers, said it was &quot;an absolutely preposterous judgment, with no basis in fact, and we are confident it will be overturned on appeal.&quot;</p>
<p>Passantino's lawsuit against the company alleged gender discrimination and retaliation.</p>
<p>Her attorneys alleged she was passed over for promotions, despite high performance evaluations. Passantino took her grievance to the company's human resources department and later filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p>After this, Passantino was offered lower level jobs, criticised in memos and classified internally as not qualified for upper management, Passantino's attorneys said.</p>
<p>The jury did not find that Passantino had been discriminated against but did find there was retaliation, according to Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>
<p>&quot;We are grateful the jury found no discrimination in this case but vigorously disagree with their finding of retaliation,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
