<p>China, the defending champions, clinched a place in the Sudirman Cup mixed team badminton final on Friday, edging home 3-2 against big rivals Indonesia.</p>
<p>With Susi Susanti scoring a surprise win over world champion Ye Zhaoying the outcome eventually rested on the final women's doubles tie.</p>
<p>But, this time, there was never any hint of an upset as the Olympic champions Ge Fei and Gu Jun cruised to a 15-3 15-3 victory over Eliza and Rosiana Zelin.</p>
<p>In the final, China will meet South Korea who took a winning 3-1 lead over Denmark late on Friday. All England champions Kang Kyung-jin and Ha Tae-kwon ended Denmark's hopes of becoming the first European side to reach the final by repeating their All England final victory over Jon Holst-Christensen and Michael Sogaard.</p>
<p>South Korea, who won the cup in 1991 and 1993, foiled a gamble by Danish coach Henrik Lyngby who omitted Olympic champion Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen in favour of Peter Rasmussen, a player who has a fine record against Koreans.</p>
<p>But a three game defeat for Rasmussen all but sunk Danish hopes. Rasmussen, the world no 12, took the opening game 15-6 against Park Sung-woo, but the world silver medallist hit back to win the next two games, 15-11 15-4.</p>
<p>Camilla Martin gave Denmark a much-needed win in the singles. The 23 year-old European champion was in great form, winning 11-7 11-0 in under 15 minutes. But Martin's victory just delayed the inevitable. Kang and Ha always held the upper-hand against Holst-Christensen and Sogaard, and ran out 15-11 18-16 winners.</p>
<p>Saturday's  final is a repeat of the group one match on Thursday, which China won 3-2, the Koreans only narrowing the gap by taking the two dead rubbers.</p>
<p>In the top group play-off, Sweden relegated England to division two with a surprisingly decisive 4-1 win. Thomas Johansson clinched victory in the third rubber with a fighting 15-7 15-18 15-10 win over former European champion Darren Hall.</p>
<p>In the earlier semi, China gained a swift advantage with Liu Yong and Ge taking the mixed doubles in straight games, 18-15 15-13, against Limpele Flandy and Minarti Timur.</p>
<p>But the ever popular Susanti, one of the most successful ever woman players, set the match alight when she staged a thrilling fightback against Ye. The Chinese player comfortably took the opening game 11-6, but Susanti, the former world champion who has now dropped to number five in the world, sent the tie into a third end by taking the second 11-6.</p>
<p>The decider was totally one-sided with Susanti, who recently married the former Olympic Champion, Allan Budi Kusuma, in totally dominant form, while Ye crumbled dramatically under the pressure and failed to win a point in going down 11-6 6-11 11-0.</p>
<p>It was a win that raised Indonesia's hopes of reclaiming the title that had eluded them since the inaugural year of 1989 in Jakarta and helped set the stage for a dramatic climax.</p>
<p>China regained the advantage in the men's singles with All-England Champion Dong Jiong crushing veteran Ardy Wiranata 15-2 15-8, but Budiarto Sigit and Chandra Wijaya set-up the final tie decider with a 15-8 15-6 win over Liu and Sun Jun in the men's doubles.</p>
<p>&quot;We all played our best, but China are stronger overall and deserved the win,&quot; said Susanti. &quot;I was delighted with my own form and it gives me confidence for next week's individual championships.&quot;</p>
