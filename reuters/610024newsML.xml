<p>The Bank of Lebanon wants the government to balance current expenditures in the budget and interest rates will remain steady at present levels until this is achieved, Governor Riad Salameh said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;All we are hoping is that a surplus or balance is achieved in current expenditures and that the current 60 percent deficit falls to 44-45 percent. Meanwhile, interest rates will remain stable around current levels,&quot; Salameh told a news conference at the end of an Arab Capital Markets conference in Beirut.  </p>
<p>He said the central bank had planned its policy on the basis of the 1997 budget whose target is a 37 percent deficit of income against expenditure.</p>
<p>However, year-to-date spending reached 2,402.9 billion Lebanese pounds in May against revenues of 954.1 billion pounds, according to finance ministry statistics -- a 60.2 percent deficit.</p>
<p>Yields on the government's Lebanese pound-denominated treasury bills range from 13.66 percent for three-month bills to 16.8 on 24-month bills.</p>
<p>Rates dropped sharply between November and February and since then shorter-term bill yields have fallen slowly while longer term yields have been steady.</p>
<p>Salameh said on Wednesday interest rates were at acceptable levels but would fall slightly in the next few months.</p>
