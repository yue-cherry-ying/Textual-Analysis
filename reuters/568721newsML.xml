<title>SPAIN: SOCCER SHOWCASE-BRAZILIAN FRIENDS MEET IN BARCA-REAL CLASH.</title>
<headline>SOCCER SHOWCASE-BRAZILIAN FRIENDS MEET IN BARCA-REAL CLASH.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>In a season in which Brazilians have grabbed centre-stage in the cosmpolitan Spanish league, no stars have shone greater than those of Barcelona striker Ronaldo and Real Madrid defender Roberto Carlos.</p>
<p>But even the close friendship that has grown up between the two players looks likely to be stretched by the tension surrounding Saturday's eagerly-awaited top of the table clash.</p>
<p>&quot;Real Madrid, you shouldn't feel champions yet,&quot; said a defiant Ronaldo.</p>
<p>&quot;I really want to win the game because we have still got many possibilities of taking the championship.&quot;</p>
<p>Ronaldo's 31 goals already this season have made him a firm candidate to win the Golden Boot for scorers in European leagues, and he still has a good chance of equalling Hugo Sanchez's record 38 goals in the Spanish league.</p>
<p>The 107 goals scored by Sanchez and his Real teammates in 1989-90 are also a record within Barcelona's reach.</p>
<p>But neither record would be much compensation for a Barcelona team that has lacked the consistency of their arch-rivals.</p>
<p>For much of the early part of the season the individual brilliance of Ronaldo papered over the cracks in the Barcelona system.</p>
<p>In one case he wriggled through the Valencia defence for a brilliant hat-trick, and Bobby Robson's side grabbed a 3-2 victory in a game in which they deserved no more than a point.</p>
<p>And it hasn't just been Ronaldo's goals that have impressed Spanish fans.</p>
<p>Ronaldo's refusal to go down when challenged -- which has contrasted with the widely-criticised 'swimming pool' style of Real striker Predrag Mijatovic -- has won plaudits from all sides.</p>
<p>Ronaldo's ever-smiling friend Roberto Carlos is just as admired for his good temparament.</p>
<p>Roberto Carlos' arrival in Spain was not as dramatic as that of his Brazilian international teammate, but within three games he was a well-known figure after crashing home a superb 30-metre equaliser against Real Betis.</p>
<p>The swirling free-kicks quickly became an integral part of Real's offensive armoury, leaving international set-piece specialists like Fernando Hierro, Predrag Mijatovic and Davor Suker without a significant share of Real's goal tally.</p>
<p>And an exceptional turn-of-speed have made Roberto Carlos a constant menace down the wing,</p>
<p>The arrival of fellow full-back Christian Panucci has also given Roberto Carlos an ideal target man at corners and free-kicks from the wings.</p>
<p>But even an enviably well-rounded player like Roberto Carlos may find the pressure in the Camp Nou difficult.</p>
<p>Earlier in the season he called the Barcelona fans the &quot;most racist in Spain&quot;.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards a racial insult was scratched onto his car, leading Roberto Carlos to suggest that he may leave Spain.</p>
<p>The incident seems to have been forgotten, and Roberto Carlos promises to ignore the traditionally vociferous Barcelona fans.</p>
<p>&quot;I will turn a deaf ear to what they say to me from the stands,&quot; he said &quot;We must be relaxed and concentrated.&quot;</p>
<p>But Ronaldo is sure that the pressure is bound to play in favour of the home side.</p>
<p>&quot;The fans always help and the Camp Nou should be tougher than ever,&quot; he said.</p>
