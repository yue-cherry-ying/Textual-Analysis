<p>U.S. spot residual fuel prices mostly gained Wednesday in lackluster trade, boosted by another sharp rally in natural gas values and still-stable crude, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a little life in resid. People are starting to think we'll see low sulphur demand building because of high gas prices, but there's still no real load,&quot; said one cash trader, noting relatively mild East Coast temperatures.</p>
<p>In New York Harbor, physical one percent jumped 50 cents to $14.75-15.00 a barrel. May paper also was done 50 cents higher at $15.25, with bidders still left at that number.  </p>
<p>NYH June one percent paper sold between $15.85 and $16, also up more than 50 cents on the day.</p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour notionally firmed more than a quarter to $15.50-75, boosted more by the one percent rally than any unfilled utility demand, traders said.</p>
<p>New York high sulphurs were up only slightly, capped by talk some European high sulphur may be heading to the harbor.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Gulf, a planned refinery maintenance outage and good bunker interest helped firm three percent by about 50 cents to $13.75-14.00.</p>
<p>USG one percent was unchanged at $14.50-75, still underpinned by prospects for more utility interest in Florida.</p>
<p>A Florida utility awarded the one percent portion of its tender at $15.68 (delivered, May 12-June 3).</p>
<p>New York city gate swing gas prices firmed almost a dime Wednesday to the low-$2.60s/mmBtu, or about $16.50 a barrel equivalent. Gas at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point, gained a similar amount to the mid-$2.30s/mmBtu, or $14.81 a barrel.</p>
