<text>
<p>A military helicopter crashed into a field near a southeast Dallas school on Friday and it appeared there were no survivors, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it was some kind of Marine helicopter,&quot; Dallas firefighter Raymond Sweeney told Reuters. &quot;We don't know how many people were on board.&quot; There was no indication that anyone on the ground was killed or injured in the crash.  </p>
<p>Fire teams raced to the scene and put out the blaze as police sealed off the area less than a mile from the intersection of two major highways in the southeast Dallas suburb of Hutchins.</p>
<p>The helicopter came down in a field behind Hutchins High School and rescue teams searched the area for possible survivors.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the helicopter narrowly missed slamming into a house as it came down.</p>
<p>&quot;It was right over the house so whoever was piloting it is a hero in my books because he could have killed us all,&quot; local resident Velva Washburn said.</p>
