<p>Russian tea consumption could fall seven to 12 percent as a result of import duty increases on packaged tea due to come into force on June 1, Russian tea industry officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Russia, the world's second largest tea consuming nation after Britain, could also face increased imports of low-quality tea and more smuggling across its borders, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Russian Tea Association experts analysed the possible consequences of the increase on imports of packaged tea...(including) overall tea demand in Russia falling by seven to 12 percent,&quot; a Russian Tea Association statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase in tea duties means that tea prices have already started to rise, and will rise further,&quot; said Igor Lisinenko, head of the association.</p>
<p>Lisinenko, who is also head of Russia's largest tea importer, Mai, said Mai and other major tea buyers had succeeded in stabilising the Russian market and improving quality overall during the last six years.</p>
<p>&quot;Now the tea market in Russia is in danger of being destabilised,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>According to figures from the association, prices of low-value tea in Russia could rise between 30 and 50 percent, while higher-priced brands would increase by 20-30 percent as a result of the hike in duties.</p>
<p>&quot;In other words, every packet of tea will appreciate by a few thousand roubles,&quot; the association statement said.</p>
<p>Lisinenko said 95 percent of Russians drank tea, and their interests should be protected by the government.</p>
<p>He added that the duty hike would favour Russian companies importing tea in bulk and packaging it in plants in Russia. These firms would not be liable to the duty.</p>
<p>&quot;The duty increase plays into the hands of these kind of companies, and represents discrimination,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The move to support companies packaging tea in Russia would also lower the overall quality of tea, because mixing high-quality blends with cheaper blends would continue and probably increase, said Alexander Borisov of the Grand trading company.</p>
<p>&quot;The consumers must know what they are drinking,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I am concerned that more consumers in Russia will be forced to buy cheaper brands of tea,&quot; said Sergei Kasyanenko of Orimi Trade.</p>
<p>Kasyanenko said tea smuggling was likely to increase after the new taxes came into force, and there had already been a sharp increase in smuggling across the Azerbaijan border in the last month.</p>
<p>The State Customs Committee said earlier in May that duties on green and black tea arriving in Russia in packages of less than three kilos would be raised to 20 percent from 10 percent as of June 1.</p>
<p>Last year Russia officially imported around 150,000 tonnes of tea, of which around 70,000 tonnes came from India and 40,000 tonnes from Sri Lanka, the association said.</p>
