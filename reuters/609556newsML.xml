<p>Three weeks before European Union leaders are to sign a new treaty at a summit in Amsterdam, a power struggle over who is to run the bloc in the next century has finally burst into the open.</p>
<p>France and Germany floated a plan at an informal summit in the Dutch seaside town of Noordwijk that would greatly boost the voting power of the bloc's larger countries at the expense of the smaller ones.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac, meanwhile, urged his EU counterparts to halve the number of European commissioners, whose existence is seen by many small countries as the guarantor of their voice in the expanding Union.</p>
<p>Chirac's idea was dismissed by Ireland, among the bloc's most vociferous defenders of small countries' rights.</p>
<p>EU officials have long said that the hardest issue facing the bloc as it negotiates a new treaty would be to agree a new balance of power as the EU expands into eastern Europe and faces a future with 25 or more members.</p>
<p>Each member country is allotted a number of votes, initially decided largely according to population size, which are cast when the EU's Council of Ministers decide laws.</p>
<p>The bloc's larger countries have seen their voting clout whittled down as the EU has expanded. The big five -- Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Spain -- currently have 79 percent of the population but only 55 percent of the votes.</p>
<p>Under the plan suggested by Bonn and Paris, the big countries would see their clout in ministerial meetings more than double -- from 10 to 25 votes in most cases.</p>
<p>The smaller countries would also get more votes, but the increase would be far less. Portugal, for example, would move from five to nine, while Denmark would go from three to five.</p>
<p>Most small countries accept that they will have to give up some voting power to the bigger countries. The Dutch EU presidency has already reflected this by proposing a reweighting of votes.</p>
<p>Significantly, however, the Franco-German suggestion trims votes from the smaller countries in the Dutch plan and leaves the larger countries' numbers the same.</p>
<p>As for the EU executive, Chirac repeated his country's desire to cut the number of commissioners to make it more efficient when the bloc expands.</p>
<p>There are currently 20 commisioners -- one for each country and two each for the big five. Chirac said he wanted a Commission of &quot;10 or 12&quot;.</p>
<p>Delegation sources also said German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had called for a ceiling to be placed on the number of commissioners as the bloc expanded. He said there were already too many.</p>
<p>Although France has said it was willing to give up both of its commissioners on a rotational basis, smaller countries have said they will not countenance any plan that threatens to take away their commissioner, no matter how big the Union gets.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a commissioner for every member state. That will always be so,&quot; Irish Prime Minister John Bruton said.</p>
<p>A final decision is expected to be taken at the Amsterdam summit on June 16-17 in what German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has described as a &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot;.</p>
