<p>The Colombian government is preparing a new law that would outlaw the forced disappearance of detainees, Interior Minister Horacio Serpa said on Monday.</p>
<p>The victims of forced disappearances are seized without official arrest warrants by frequently unidentified assailants. The remains of some of the disappeared may turn up in unmarked mass graves while others are never heard of again.</p>
<p>Until now, Colombia has had no specific law against the practice and has typically swept such crimes under the carpet for lack of firm evidence about either the criminals or their victims.</p>
<p>Human rights activists say that even most politically motivated murders and kidnaps, for which legislation already exists, often go unpunished. A handful of such cases have been punished under kidnap laws.</p>
<p>The government-sponsored bill, which Serpa said would soon be submitted to Congress, came amid a chorus of international criticism of Colombia's human rights record.</p>
<p>More than 135 forced disappearances were reported between October 1995 and September 1996, according to Carlos Rodriguez, of the Colombian Commission of Jurists, which specialises in human rights cases.</p>
<p>Just over half the disappearances were attributed to illegal right-wing paramilitary groups and the remainder were blamed on the military or police.</p>
<p>Since 1988 there have been more than 2,000 reported disappearances -- mostly of suspected political dissidents and leftist activists.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost 100 percent of the cases of forced disappearances go unpunished at present. It is good that this law will establish this as a crime and hopefully once the draft legislation is published it will give judges the tools to investigate thoroughly,&quot; Rodriguez said.</p>
<p>Serpa did not go into details of the proposed bill but said it would be in line with &quot;international standards on the defence of human rights.&quot;</p>
