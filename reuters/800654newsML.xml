<p>British-based drugs group SmithKline Beecham Plc said on Thursday its cancer treatment Hycamtin worked as well as the existing standard treatment in small-cell lung cancer patients who have not responded to earlier drugs.</p>
<p>And in a presentation at the eighth world cancer conference, scientists said initial analysis of a Phase III trial of Hycamtin used on its own indicated it was much better at treating symptoms of the condition, such as shortness of breath, hoarseness and fatigue.</p>
<p>Hycamtin, which is already used in ovarian cancer, was compared in a 44-centre international trial with CAV, a triple drug combination made up of cyclophosphamide, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Inc's Adriamycin and vincristine.</p>
<p>&quot;There are currently few standard treatments for patients with small cell lung cancer who have failed first-line therapy,&quot; Dr Giuseppe Giaccone of the Free University hospital in Amsterdam said at the conference.</p>
<p>SmithKline said that of 188 patients available to be analysed, Hycamtin showed comparable response rates and survival rates to CAV.</p>
<p>However, Giaccone said, &quot;The improvement in certain symptoms observed with (Hycamtin) is an important finding because the goal of treatment in advanced stage disease is palliation, including enhancing patients' quality of life and allowing them the opportunity to go about their daily routine.&quot;</p>
<p>He said long-term survival rates for small cell lung cancer were very low, with most patients experiencing a recurrence of the disease after first-stage drug treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;It is critical that we identify effective second-line therapies,&quot; he said, adding &quot;there has not been a breakthrough in the treatment of small cell lung cancer for several years.&quot;</p>
<p>Small-cell lung cancer is the most aggressive form of lung cancer, accounting for up to a quarter of all cases. Nearly all patients with this form are smokers or former smokers.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, SmithKline said a small, intermediate stage trial of Hycamtin in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb Co's cancer drug Taxol had shown &quot;impressive&quot; results as a first-stage treatment for the condition.</p>
