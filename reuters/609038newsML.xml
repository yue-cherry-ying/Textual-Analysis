<p>Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa on Friday pledged fair and open elections for the territory's legislature, but said the formula for filling legislative seats after China regains control had not been set.</p>
<p>&quot;They (elections) will be open and based on the principle of fairness,&quot; Tung told a news conference in Beijing.</p>
<p>The man who will lead Hong Kong after the British colony reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 said he would study recommendations of a Beijing-appointed group known as the Preparatory Committee that has been designing the framework of the future government.</p>
<p>&quot;I welcome the opportunity to make this difficult decision,&quot; Tung said.</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee wound up a meeting in Beijing on Friday, handing Tung and the future regional government recommendations on how to fill the seats by both direct and indirect methods.</p>
<p>China has already made clear it will scrap the territory's existing directly elected legislature and replace it with an appointed provisional body.</p>
<p>Tung said he expected to see new legislative elections in the second quarter of 1998.</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee recommended elected seats be filled either by a form of proportional representation or a multi-candidate race with several top vote-getters winning office.</p>
<p>Whatever formula Tung accepts, many of the territory's democratic activists will not be happy as they say it will make it harder for them to win a seat than under the current system.</p>
<p>Under a formula that China has endorsed, only 20 of the legislature's 60 seats will be elected directly, with the others filled by indirect vote or appointment.</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee also made recommendations for 15 so-called &quot;functional constituencies&quot; or groups that will fill seats in indirect elections.</p>
<p>Tung will choose nine of those groups which will join 21 others.</p>
<p>One group on the recommended list, the Chinese enterprise association, has aroused controversy as it would appear to give further powers to China.</p>
<p>A senior Chinese official pronounced the work of the Preparatory Committee as largely completed but said the group would not yet disband.</p>
<p>&quot;We can say the (Preparatory Committee's) task is basically over,&quot; Chen Ziying, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under the State Council, or cabinet, told reporters.</p>
<p>Chen said, however, a decision on when the Preparatory Committee will be disbanded was up to the National People's Congress, China's parliament.</p>
