<dateline>NEW DELHI 1997-04-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>India's United Front coalition on Saturday named Inder Kumar Gujral as its leader to head a new centre-left government, caretaker prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda said.  </p>
<p>Deve Gowda told reporters that the United Front's decision-making Steering Committee unanimously chose Gujral, foreign minister in the outgoing government, to lead the 15-party alliance and become the next prime minister.</p>
<p>&quot;The United Front Steering Committee has taken a decision to elect Mr I.K. Gujral as leader of the party,&quot; said Deve Gowda, whose 10-month-old government was defeated in a vote of confidence in parliament on April 11.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda said a delegation of United Front leaders would go to the presidential palace on Sunday to convey the alliance's decision to President Shankar Dayal Sharma.</p>
<p>Gujral, 77, served as foreign minister from 1989 to 1990 under former prime minister V.P. Singh, and was again named to the post when Deve Gowda took office last June.</p>
