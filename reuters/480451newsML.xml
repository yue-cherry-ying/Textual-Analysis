<p>Paging firm Sunpage launched its messaging operations on Tuesday with low prices aimed at taking a third of the deregulated Singapore market.</p>
<p>Sunpage, part of state-owned Singapore Technologies, was one of three new paging firms which began services on Tuesday as the island's mobile phone and paging market opened to competition.</p>
<p>The three -- Sunpage, Hutchison Paging and MobileOne -- are competing with Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (SingTel), which until Monday had a monopoly of virtually all telecommunications services in the city-state.  </p>
<p>Sunpage general manager Yong Lum Sung told Reuters the firm was offering the cheapest pager rates yet to be announced in order to attract a large market share as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Sunpage's pager rates start at Singapore $9.80 (US$6.81) a month, against S$9.90 for Hutchison and S$15 for SingTel.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very aggressive. We aim to get about 30 percent of the market in three to five years,&quot; Yong said in an interview.</p>
<p>Officiating at the launch of Sunpage's new service, Singapore Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan said Singapore had some of the highest market penetration rates for pagers anywhere in the world with around 34 pagers for every 100 people.  </p>
<p>Mah said the market was growing 12 percent a year and that some forecasts predicted penetration rates could rise to 50 percent.</p>
<p>Yong said he expected the Singapore market to reach around 1.5 million pagers by around the turn of the century.</p>
<p>&quot;If the market grows to 1.5 million, a 30 percent (market share) could mean 400,000 to 500,000 subscribers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Yong said Sunpage would break even if it reached 150,000 or 200,000 subscribers, but only if prices kept at current levels. &quot;If we get our target subscribers at the current prices the breakeven period is still good, about two or three years maybe.&quot;  </p>
<p>Sunpage said in a statement it had spent Singapore $15 million so far and expected to spend up to S$50 million by the end of 1998.</p>
<p>But Yong said the intense price competition signalled by the opening up of the market, could mean the market declined in value from around Singapore $200 million at present.</p>
<p>&quot;If SingTel responds to all this lower pricing, they will probably lower their rates somewhat. So it won't be S$200 million, there would be negative growth immediately,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;In terms of numbers pagers the market should grow 10 to 15 percent a year. It all depends on how the consumers receive all these low pricing packages now available in the market place.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the pager players would suffer if competition was too intense and that some of his rivals were at risk of initiating a price war.</p>
<p>&quot;People have to be careful. We have actually gone out to the market place and indicated our rough pricing but nobody seems to respect that and Hutchison came along and dropped everything.  </p>
<p>&quot;I hope they don't keep (prices) going down. I hope everyone gets the message that we shouldn't compete on price after a certain level,&quot; he said. &quot;I would like to see the market stabilise and everybody competing on services.&quot;</p>
<p>Hutchison is a joint venture of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, Intraco Ltd and Teledata.</p>
<p>MobileOne is a joint venture of Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless, Hong Kong Telecommunications, Keppel Telecom and Singapore Press Holdings.</p>
