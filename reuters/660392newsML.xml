<p>Turkey's unstable political environment has begun to trouble the economy and spread concern through the country's business community, leading businessmen say.</p>
<p>The loss of business confidence, scaring foreign investors away, has accelerated as the Islamist-led coalition edges closer to the point of collapse under pressure from the secularist establishment.</p>
<p>&quot;The chaos in the state has spread to the private sector and investments have been halted,&quot; Mehmet Yildirim, president of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is impossible to say that the political environment does not effect the economy any more,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Yildirim said foreign investors in particular had postponed their investments because of political uncertainity engulfing Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's government.</p>
<p>&quot;The total amount of investment incentives given by the State Planning Office last year was $3.5 billion and only $500 to $600 million of it was realised,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But this year investment realisation has totally stopped,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Yildirim blamed the Islamist-led government for increasing the political tension. The resignation of a further cabinet minister on Friday dealt a fresh blow to the 11-month-old alliance.</p>
<p>The government has called for early elections to resolve a fierce row with secularists over Islamist activism, but the erosion of the coalition's majority in parliament has put this plan in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Turkey's export performance has also suffered.</p>
<p>&quot;The business world can no longer endure the unstability caused by politicians quarrelling over seats,&quot; Okan Oguz, president of Turkish Exporters Assembly, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Turan Sarigulle, head of the Turkey Readywear Industrialists Association, was also pessimistic about the outlook for the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The political chaos is effecting the economy more and more every day,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The politicians are talking about stability in the markets but it is not true and if there are no positive changes in the political situation everything will get worse,&quot; Sarigulle added.</p>
<p>Sarigulle said many foreign investors had given up plans to invest in Turkey in favour of other countries, frustrating hopes that its 1996 customs union accord with the European Union would stimulate fresh investment.</p>
<p>&quot;They (politicians) are practically trying to drive the foreign investors away from the country by creating political turmoil,&quot; he said.</p>
