<title>RUSSIA: Roubles inflow pushes up Russian T-bill prices.</title>
<headline>Roubles inflow pushes up Russian T-bill prices.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Russian operators buying ahead of the long weekend pushed up prices of short- and medium-term GKO discount Treasury bills and OFZ interest-bearing bonds, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Russian markets are closed May 9-11.</p>
<p>The rouble was barely changed against the dollar compared to Wednesday's close, while overnight credits fell significantly.</p>
<p>Dealers said the fall in overnight rates was due to an inflow of roubles after heavy dollar sales to fulfil central bank reserve requirements and ahead of this week's government paper auctions on Wednesday.  roubles/dollar	May 8 midday   May 8 early    May 7 close</p>

<p>&quot;Roubles are cheap today, and many people bought hard currency with today and tomorrow settlement ahead of the holidays,&quot; said ABN-Amro bank dealer Dmitry Piskulov.</p>
<p>&quot;If there are roubles on the market at an overnight rate less than 10 percent, it is better to buy hard currency as we are still near the lower band of the central bank's quotes and dollar growth potential is sigificant.&quot;</p>
<p>Renaissance Capital dealer Alexei Orekhov said there was profit-taking on long-term T-bills and new interest for short and long-term paper.</p>
<p>Dealers forecast a slight fall in prices after the holidays, as short and medium-term prices were high enough. They also forecast a three-day correction in yields.</p>
<p>CS First Boston dealer Sergei Koshelenko said the rouble was unlikely to remain cheap after the holidays.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday the rouble was relatively cheap because we needed a lot of roubles to comply with the central bank's obligatory reserves and to buy government securities,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But despite the fact that roubles appeared today, the shortage of roubles on the interbank market and on the rouble/dollar market continues. We do not need roubles today, but I doubt the situation will continue on Monday or Tuesday.&quot;</p>
