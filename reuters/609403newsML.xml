<p>After four months away from Earth, NASA astronaut Jerry Linenger said on Friday he was determined to walk off the shuttle after its planned Saturday landing.</p>
<p>Linenger, homeward-bound after a troubled tour of duty aboard Russia's space station Mir, said that objective helped him through a tough exercise regime designed to ward off the debilitating effects of space travel.</p>
<p>&quot;To have a goal to walk off the shuttle gave me something to shoot for,&quot; he told NBC television in an interview broadcast from the orbiting shuttle's flight deck.</p>
<p>NASA's doctors prefer astronauts returning from long stays in space to be carried off the shuttle, but of the three who lived on Mir, all but one insisted on walking off.</p>
<p>&quot;If it looks like Jerry has a strong desire to attempt to walk off and it appears to be safe for him to do so we will support him in doing that,&quot; said Roger Billica, chief of medical operations at NASA's Johnson Space Centre in Houston. &quot;Our preference would be for him to be assisted off.&quot;</p>
<p>During his stay on Mir, Linenger, who lists marathon running and ocean swimming among his hobbies, was supposed to run daily for two hours on a treadmill to keep up his strength.</p>
<p>Although that exercise programme was disrupted because of the fire that struck Mir in February, the urgent repair work that followed and problems with life support systems, Billica did not expect any complications after Linenger's return to earth.</p>
<p>&quot;He looks like he is going to do just fine,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Long periods in space, away from the pull of Earth's gravity, cause muscles to waste away and bones to weaken.</p>
<p>It will probably take Linenger a few days to get back his &quot;earth legs&quot; and up to four months to make a full recovery, Billica said.</p>
<p>Atlantis and its crew of seven was scheduled to touch down at Florida's Kennedy Space Centre at 7:52 a.m. EDT (1152 GMT) on Saturday.</p>
<p>Forecasters were predicting generally favourable weather, although there was a chance of rain showers in the vicinity of the runway, flight director Wayne Hale told a news conference Friday.</p>
<p>If the shuttle lands as planned, Linenger will have spent 132 days in space, the second longest mission for an American astronaut. Shannon Lucid set the current U.S. record with a 188-day stay on Mir last year.</p>
<p>Linenger said it would be &quot;pure elation&quot; to be reunited with his 18-month old son, John, and his wife, Kathryn, who is expecting their second child in June.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be a fantastic moment,&quot; he said.</p>
