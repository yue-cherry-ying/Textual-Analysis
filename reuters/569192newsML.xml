<dateline>SANTIAGO 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Chilean stocks rallied to close at their highest point this year with the bolsa driven by Wall Street's rise and speculation that the Central Bank may soon cut interest rates again, said traders.</p>
<p>The bolsa is expected to open higher, with attention focused on supermarket chain Unimarc's debut Friday on Wall Street, they said.</p>
<p>The 40-share  .IPSA index closed unofficially up 0.66 percent at 120.07 points. The general  .IGPA index gained 0.31 percent at 5,369.79 points.  </p>
<p>Turnover was modest at nine billion pesos.</p>
<p>Comments by Central Bank president Carlos Massad Wednesday that the economic slowdown is reaching its lowest point sparked a flurry of rumors that the bank could be planning to trim rates again, said traders.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has interpreted his remarks as a clear signal that another rates cut on the way,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>Interest rate cut rumors, usually groundless, often swirl around the Santiago bolsa towards the end of the week.</p>
<p>Electricity stocks, the most liquid shares in the market, were driven sharply higher by hopes of lower rates.  </p>
<p>Enersis climbed 1.17 percent at 259 pesos, while Chilgener gained 1.16 percent at 174 pesos.</p>
<p>Investors will be paying close attention Friday to supermarket chain Unimarc's issue of shares on the international and local markets.</p>
<p>The company plans to sell 4.5 million American Depositary Receipts for $16-18 each.</p>
<p>Losers included forestry firm Masisa, down 3.81 percent at 3.81 percent at 227 pesos and brewery CCU which shed 1.39 percent at 1,775. ((-- Margaret Orgill, Santiago newsroom, 562-699-5595x212))</p>
