<p>Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said on Saturday public employees would get higher salaries under new pay scales effective from July 1, but asked them to accept longer working hours introduced recently.</p>
<p>&quot;The new national pay scales will be effective from July 1 next. I have directed the pay commission to place its report (about new salary structure) to me by middle of June,&quot; Hasina told a delegation of Bangladesh government employees.</p>
<p>&quot;But you have to accept the new office timings,&quot; the prime minister said.</p>
<p>&quot;If I can work 16 hours a day (then) why can't you work for seven and half hours for the betterment of the country,&quot; the official BSS news agency quoted Hasina as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a lot of things to do in the next few years. Time is running out,&quot; said Hasina, who took office following an election in June last year.</p>
<p>The government last week introduced changes requiring employees to work longer hours from Sunday to Thursday, which prompted workers to start daily demonstrations in Dhaka's main government secretariat. The protesters clashed with police and threatened tougher action.</p>
<p>The change in working hours also shifted the weekend to Friday and Saturday from the previous half-day on Thursday and full holiday on Friday. The government said this would give employees more time to take care of family matters and cut fuel costs for government transport.</p>
<p>Hasina said the pay commission report would include proposals for a daily meal allowance and improved transportation between office and home.</p>
<p>The government was also planning to build low-cost flats for hire-purchase by the low-income employees, the BSS said.</p>
<p>Officials said increased salaries for about one million government employees might cost the exchequer an additional 15 billion taka ($345 million) a year.</p>
<p>Hasina said: &quot;Without foreign investment the growth rate (of gross domestic product) will not increase. (So) maintain peace and harmony for attracting more investment.&quot;</p>
<p>She urged the workers to give up demonstrations, saying that &quot;my door is open to everybody for talks on any issues.&quot;</p>
<p>Hasina later addressed a public rally in Dhaka's Tejgaon industrial district, and renewed her plea for peace and political stability. ($ = 43.55 Bangladesh Taka)</p>
