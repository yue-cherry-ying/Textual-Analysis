<p>Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said on Friday the outlook for the Singapore economy in 1997 was generally optimistic with growth momentum picking up.</p>
<p>Goh told an industry function that weak growth in the first quarter of the year, in which the economy grew by 3.8 percent year-on-year, was partly due to a sluggish manufacturing sector and slower trading activities.</p>
<p>&quot;The outlook for the remainder of 1997 is generally optimistic,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic growth in our major export markets is expected to remain robust.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Domestically, while year-on-year growth in the first quarter was weak, growth momentum is picking up,&quot; Goh said.</p>
<p>He said quarter-to-quarter growth figures had turned positive since the last quarter of 1996 and industrialists were generally more optimistic about business conditions for the next six months.</p>
<p>&quot;The manufacturing sector is expected to recover in line with the pick up in global electronics demand while the chemicals industry (should) benefit from additional capacity coming on stream,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Goh repeated the government's previously stated growth forecast for 1997 of five to seven percent.</p>
<p>Singapore is heavily dependent on the electronics sector, which accounts for about half of industrial output and almost 60 percent of its non-oil exports.</p>
<p>The economy was hit hard last year by a slowdown in the global electronics industry, with overall growth slipping to seven percent from 8.8 percent in 1995 and double digit growth the preceeding two years.</p>
<p>Goh said Singapore faced keener competition from developing countries and that the economy had to be increasingly innovative to stay ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;To keep abreast of the competition, we must be prepared to innovate ahead of others and create new market niches for ourselves where we can add more value and command a premium,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Goh said he had asked the Ministry of Trade and Industry to convene an economic committee to study Singapore's competitiveness.</p>
<p>The committee would assess strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats facing the economy and recommend strategies and policies to ensure it stays competitive.</p>
<p>&quot;My concern is not over our current competitiveness. It is whether we can compete for the long term,&quot; he said.</p>
