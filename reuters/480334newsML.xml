<p>Asian crude prices were lower on Tuesday with differentials under pressure as late month sales struggled to find buyers.</p>
<p>Qatar Marine crude traded twice at QGPC -50 cents, five cents weaker than a deal done late last week. A Japanese refiner bought two parcels of 300,000 barrels and 200,000 barrels to make up a full cargo.</p>
<p>Traders said the lack of buying of Dubai and Oman by India and Bangchak Petroleum in their respective May buying tenders left the crudes overhanging the market and reflected the generally ample supply.  </p>
<p>Dubai backwardation has fallen to almost flat for May/June and June/July, while trades said they expected potential buyers of Oman to bid from -10 cents after the last deal for a full cargo was done at -5 cents.</p>
<p>May/June Dubai was assessed at -3/-5 cents in London from flat/-5 cents in Singapore earlier. June/July was quoted at -3/-5 cents from +5/+11 earlier in Singapore.</p>
<p>Traders said there were several MidEast cargoes available to the spot market, but that few buyers were showing their hand.</p>
<p>In addition, some sellers would wait for the release of March official selling prices.  </p>
<p>The OSPs are expected to show a narrowing differential to Dubai and so help improve selling sentiment, they said.</p>
<p>Bangchak, which awarded 750,000 barrels of Al Shaheem crude in its May tender, said it was still negotiating to buy regional grades. As of 0900 GMT, the refinery had not concluded any deals, refinery sources said.</p>
