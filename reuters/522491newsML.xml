<p>Arsenal's slim title hopes all but disappeared on Saturday when they conceded a late equaliser to draw 1-1 at Highbury with 1995 champions Blackburn.</p>
<p>Arsenal took an early lead through former England captain David Platt but midfielder Garry Flitcroft equalised in the 89th minute of a tense tie to deny the Gunners a crucial three points.</p>
<p>Arsene Wenger's side go second, level on points with Liverpool, but both teams are five points adrift of leaders and champions Manchester United who have a game in hand on both of them.</p>
<p>United, who face Borussia Dortmund in a European Cup semifinal on Wednesday, took a giant leap toward their fourth league title in five years when they beat Liverpool 3-1 at Anfield earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Newcastle stay fourth after they overturned a 1-0 deficit to beat Derby 3-1.</p>
<p>At the bottom, League Cup beaten finalists Middlesbrough lost 1-0 at home to neighbours Sunderland while fellow strugglers Coventry, Southampton, Nottingham Forest, West Ham and Everton all drew.</p>
<p>Arsenal, who had won five of their previous six matches to rekindle their trophy hopes, desperately needed another victory to keep in touch with an imperious Manchester United.</p>
<p>After 18 minutes defender Martin Keown met a Dennis Bergkamp cross with a firm downward header which struck the post.</p>
<p>The rebound fell kindly for Platt, who stroked the ball past Blackburn keeper Tim Flowers for his third goal in three games.</p>
<p>But Arsenal failed to increase their lead to the obvious annoyance of the home fans on a cold, blustery afternoon in north London.</p>
<p>Blackburn, still not guaranteed a place in the premier league next season, got better as the match went on and finally grabbed their equaliser with less than two minutes of normal time remaining.</p>
<p>Flitcroft met a Kevin Gallacher corner with a crisp volley from 15 metres which flew into the roof of David Seaman's net.</p>
<p>Despite eight minutes of extra time at the end of a bad-tempered match in which nine players were booked, Arsenal failed to find a winner which would have taken them to within three points of United.</p>
<p>United now look certain to clinch their 11th league title while Liverpool and Arsenal face a fierce battle for England's second European Champions' League place.</p>
<p>At the bottom, Middlesbrough ended a miserable, energy-sapping week with what could prove a significant defeat.</p>
<p>Darren Williams, who grew up supporting Middlesbrough, scored the only goal of a scrappy game at the Riverside stadium to give Sunderland a 1-0 victory which lifts them out of the relegation zone.</p>
<p>Middlesbrough conceded a last minute goal to draw 3-3 with second division Chesterfield in the F.A. Cup semifinal last weekend and lost the League Cup final to Leicester in extra-time on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They now face a replay against Chesterfield on Tuesday night before resuming their fight for premier league survival.</p>
<p>In the other relegation battles, bottom club Nottingham Forest were held 1-1 by Leeds, while Southampton and West Ham both squandered 2-0 leads to draw 2-2 with Coventry and Everton respectively.</p>
