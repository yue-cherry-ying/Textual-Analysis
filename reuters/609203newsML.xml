<p>Zaire's ousted president Mobutu Sese Seko arrived in Morocco on Friday from Lome on board the presidential jet of Togolese leader Gnassingbe Eyadema, an airport official said.</p>
<p>Mobutu, who is stricken by cancer, was supported by aides as he walked slowly to a black limousine after disembarking from the Boeing 707.</p>
<p>The official said Mobutu was accompanied by members of his family. He gave no other details.</p>
<p>Reporters were barred from approaching the airport.</p>
<p>Mobutu and his entourage left the airport in a motorcade of a dozen cars along a route lined by security forces bound for the seaside resort of Skhirat</p>
<p>&quot;Mobutu and his family will stay in principle at the Amphitrite hotel at the seaside,&quot; the official added.</p>
<p>A cancer clinc was recently opened in Rabat where the ailing president could be treated, a medical source said.</p>
<p>With 30 rooms, the three-star Amphitrite hotel is 20 km (12 miles) south of Rabat on an Atlantic beach next door to a palace used by King Hassan in summer.</p>
<p>The hotel was surrounded by security forces who barred reporters.</p>
<p>A staunch friend of King Hassan, Mobutu visited Morocco last February.</p>
<p>The official MAP news agency said in a brief statement: &quot;President Mobutu had asked permission to spend a few days in Morocco for health reasons before going to his permanent place of residence.&quot;</p>
<p>Sources close to Togo President Eyadema said Mobutu would go on to France, where he has a Riviera villa, after the French elections which end on June 1.</p>
<p>Mobutu arrived in Lome from his jungle palace at Gbadolite in northern Zaire on Sunday night, a day after Laurent Kabila's rebels marched into Kinshasa.</p>
<p>He initially landed in Togo for a technical stopover but Togolese sources said the government had reluctantly agreed to let him stay longer because of his state of health.</p>
