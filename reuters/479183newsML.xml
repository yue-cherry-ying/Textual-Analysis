<headline>Scores hospitalized by mystery Fort Worth gas leak.</headline>
<dateline>FORT WORTH 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>About 180 people were taken to a hospital on Tuesday after suffering breathing problems in an apparent gas leak at an office building in Fort Worth.</p>
<p>Hazardous materials experts said they had no idea what was causing the health problems but sent 180 people to a hospital and were preparing to examine several hundred more for possible problems.  </p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, it is a mystery to us,&quot; said Kent Worley, spokesman for the Fort Worth Fire Department. &quot;The hazardous materials team has gone through the building but they can't find anything out of the ordinary.&quot;</p>
<p>He said office workers at the Overton Center in southwest Fort Worth began complaining of breathing problems, nausea, headaches and sore throats early on Tuesday afternoon, and emergency teams rushed to the site.</p>
<p>Most of the affected asked for some oxygen but said they felt okay. They were sent to a hospital as a precaution.</p>
<p>Worley said he did not know if anyone was in serious condition. He said most of the workers at the nine-storey office tower are customer service employees of United Parcel Service.</p>
