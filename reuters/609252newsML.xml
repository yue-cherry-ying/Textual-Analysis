<headline>Stocks rise led by small caps, steady bond market.</headline>

<p>Stocks rose on Friday as small stocks continued to rebound and bond interest rates stayed below 7 percent, but the market lost steam as the three-day U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend approached.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 39.98 points at 7,298.11. Earlier, a 50-point bounce prompted the New York Stock Exchange to set index-arbitrage curbs 10 minutes after the market opened.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues outpaced declines by 15 to seven on volume of 242 million shares on the NYSE.</p>
<p>But trading lacked momentum before the bond market's early close and the Memorial Day holiday on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;People are going to take off for the long weekend and things are really going to quiet down,&quot; said John Gardner, chief equiety strategist for Van Lieu Capital Corp.</p>
<p>The bond market, which has recently provided direction to stocks, will close at 2 p.m. EDT 1800 GMT and traders said people were squaring up equity positions early in the day.</p>
<p>This might have contributed to the stock market's early rise, traders said.</p>
<p>The stock market also took comfort as bond interest rates stayed below the critical 7 percent mark, which typically prompts money managers to shift funds from stocks to bonds and cash.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/32, reducing its yield to 6.98 percent from 6.99 percent at Thursday's close. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Recent and enduring strength in shares of smaller-capitalised companies lent some optimism to broader equity markets, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalisation issues traded up 1.85 points to 373.31 and the Nasdaq composite index rose 5.83 points to 1,378.43. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 5.33 points to 840.99.</p>
<p>Graham Tanaka, president of Tanaka Capital Management, said he also saw interest in cyclical and technology stocks.</p>
<p>&quot;Blue chips are coming back refreshed, after a pause,&quot; said Tanaka, who forecast the bull stock market continuing. &quot;We're seeing interest in drug stocks and defensive shares. Technology and smaller-cap stocks are also doing well.&quot;</p>
<p>But other analysts were hesitant to read too much good news into Friday's gains.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just a dead day,&quot; said John Cleland, chief investment strategist at Security Benefit Group of Cos.</p>
<p>Among individual issues, Westinghouse Electric Corp. led the list of actives after its CBS unit said Peter Lund, president of its CBS television and cable group, resigned. Its shares were up two points at 19.</p>
<p>Tobacco stocks were also active, following a report that indicated tobacco talks were making progress on several key regulatory and legal issues, even though many issues remained to be settled.</p>
<p>Philip Morris Cos Inc. was up 1/4 point at 45, while RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. was up 1-1/4 to 33-1/8.</p>
<p>Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore told Reuters a settlement of litigation against the tobacco industry was not imminent. But he said he hoped to know within two weeks whether a settlement could be reached.</p>
