<p>The Mexican bourse closed sharply hgiher Thursday as favourable economic data drew bargain hunters into the market.</p>
<p>The leading IPC share index ended up 47.90 points, or 1.27 percent, at 3,821.92.</p>
<p>&quot;It was time stocks recovered a little after the recent slump on the Dow and company earnings,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 50.97 points at 7,136.62, after rising as high as 7,236.96.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry announced in early trade it had revised Mexico's trade surplus for March up to $636 million from a preliminary figure of $565 million.</p>
<p>In the closing minutes, Banco de Mexico announced the consumer price index increased 1.08 percent, or slightly below an average rise of 1.11 precent forecast in a Reuters survey.</p>
<p>&quot;The market reacted to a favourable macroeconomic backdrop, trade balance and inflation data were good. Furthermore, several blue chips had lagged far behind the market, and that also triggered buying,&quot; an equity analyst said.</p>
<p>Trading volume was moderate at 77.9 million shares. Dealers said dealing was not brisk for the day as a whole, but did pick up in late trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Volume wasn't great, but we were rushed off our feet after midday,&quot; a desk trader said.</p>
<p>Bancomer, one of Mexico's biggest financial groups, was the most actively trade stock of the day and ended up five centavos (less than 1 cent) at 2.85 pesos (36 cents).</p>
<p>Dealers noted that Banacci, another major financial group, ended down 16 centavos (2 cents) at 16.64 pesos ($2.10).</p>
<p>&quot;Banacci is less volatile, and less subject to day-to-day changes, but seemed to suffer from expectations domestic rates will rise from their current floor level,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Telmex also weighed heavily on the upside, dealers said. The telecomms firm ended up 16 centavos (2 cents) at 16.50 pesos ($2.09) after tracking its ADRs, which gained 3/8 to 41-5/8 on Wall Street.</p>
<p>On the broad market, 115 stocks changed hands, of which 63 gained while 26 declined.</p>
<p>Debt stricken conglomerate Grupo Sidek led the prominent gainers, followed by its tourist arm Situr.</p>
<p>Sidek gained six centavos (less than 1 cent) to 42 centavos (5 cents), while Situr gained nine centavos (1 cent) to 34 centavos (4 cents).</p>
