<p>New Zealander Greg Turner opened a one-stroke early lead but veteran Christy O'Connor Jnr stole the show as the Benson and Hedges International got underway on Thursday.</p>
<p>Turner defied the cold wind and intermittent showers at the Oxfordshire, his only dropped shot coming on his final hole, the ninth, as he hit a five-under-par 67 which contained an eagle and four birdies.</p>
<p>With half the players in the clubhouse, Turner was one ahead of O'Connor with Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke and Jonathan Lomas of England joint third on 69.</p>
<p>Starting at the 10th, Turner gained two strokes on the par five 11th when he holed out from 15 feet after chipping on to the green with his second shot.</p>
<p>But it was on the front nine that Turner charged ahead of the field with birdies at the third, fourth, seventh and eighth to go six under before making his only mistake on his final hole.</p>
<p>O'Connor had a completely unblemished round with two birdies in each half. Afterwards the 48-year-old Irishman gave a sigh of relief as he unwrapped strapping from his left elbow.</p>
<p>Last year O'Connor feared his playing career was over after suffering a painful tennis elbow. &quot;For a long time I couldn't even lift a cup of coffee let alone a golf club,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Between last June and February O'Connor underwent laser treatment. &quot;It was very painful. It burns you, so you're black from burns.&quot;</p>
<p>But he said he had never considered not returning to the golf course. &quot;I missed it too much, I missed the crack,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>O'Connor pitched to within three feet to birdie the third hole and picked up another stroke on the par five seventh despite two-putting from 20 feet. He pitched to within two feet on both the 11th and 12th for successive birdies on the back nine.</p>
<p>Colin Montgomerie, one of the tournament favourites, had a switchback kind of round which included only five holes in par as he ended with a 70.</p>
<p>Starting at the 10th, he turned in two under after three birdies and one bogey but on his second nine his five birdies, four of them in succession, were offset by dropped shots on three successive holes plus a double bogey six at the eighth when his second shot went into the water.</p>
