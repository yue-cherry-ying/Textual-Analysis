<p>Brothers  Michael and Ralf Schumacher and fellow German Heinz- Harald Frentzen made motor racing history on Saturday by securing the first three grid places for Sunday's French Grand Prix.</p>
<p>World championship leader Schumacher senior grabbed his second successive pole spot of the season in his Ferrari, and the 16th of his career, to qualify ahead of Williams driver Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher in a Jordan.</p>
<p>It was the first time in Formula One history that three German drivers had filled the top three places after qualifying.</p>
<p>Frentzen's Williams team mate Jacques Villeneuve of Canada was fourth, after recovering from a high-speed crash during morning practice which forced him, initially, to use his spare car.</p>
<p>Schumacher secured pole position with a strong performance in the early stages of the German-dominated qualifying hour by clocking a best time after only 13 minutes of frantic activity at the Magny-Cours circuit in central France.</p>
<p>Then, he relaxed as his rivals attempted to improve on his time without any luck before later declaring that he still felt his car would struggle to win Sunday's 72-lap race.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not expect us to be in this position and I honestly think we will find it difficult tomorrow (Sunday),&quot; he said, to the mirth of both fellow-Germans alongside him at a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We struggled here in the tests and I cannot explain what has happened. I really don't know what to say.&quot;</p>
<p>Schumacher made two further runs without trimming his time, but was challenged strongly by both his younger brother Ralf and Frentzen.</p>
<p>Schumacher senior's pole was proof, it is was needed, that he and Ferrari are on a surge that has made them not only leaders of the two championships, but strong contenders to win them despite all his protests.</p>
<p>Ralf Schumacher's qualifying position of third was the best of his fledgling Formula One career and he said he now hopes to finish a race for the second time. He previously went the distance in Argentina and was third at the end of the race.</p>
<p>Villeneuve, who is second in the drivers' championship standings, had a heavy accident during the morning's free practice session when he spun backwards off the track into a tyre barrier. It meant he had to use his spare car but he switched to his repaired race car midway through.</p>
<p>Briton Eddie Irvine was fifth fastest in the second Ferrari ahead of Italian Jarno Trulli, making his debut for the Prost team as replacement for injured Frenchman Olivier Panis who suffered a double fracture of both legs at the Canadian Grand Prix two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The two Benettons of Alexander Wurz, continuing to deputise for fellow-Austrian Gerhard Berger, and Frenchman Jean Alesi were seventh and eighth ahead of the two McLarens.</p>
<p>World champion Damon Hill was further back, in 17th place, in his Arrows as the warm, dry weather reduced his chances.</p>
