<headline>European veg oils end mixed in pre-holiday trade.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European vegetable oil market was in holiday mood on Wednesday afternoon with most of Europe closed on Thursday for the Ascension Day holiday.</p>
<p>Malaysian private forecaster Ivan Wong's latest estimate of local palm oil output and stocks for April was the only major factor in the market.</p>
<p>Wong estimated local palm oil output at 723,000 tonnes during April, up six percent.</p>
<p>Stocks were projected at 695,000 tonnes against 689,633 tonnes at end-March.</p>
<p>European traders said the report was friendly in the short term.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment the Wong report looks friendly with output rising by only six percent, but it may not look that good if demand does not pick up,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>However, traders said the rest of the market was slow ahead of various holidays on Thursday and lacked any fresh leads which was creating a neglected atmosphere.</p>
<p>Crude palm oil cif Europe closed unchanged to $2.50 up and products were $2.50 up to $2.50 down for RBD palm oil. Olein was unchanged to $2.50 higher.</p>
<p>Coconut oil finished with sellers $10 up to $2.50 lower after May/Jun traded at $672.50 and Jun/Jul at $660 a tonne cif.</p>
<p>Palmkernel oil closed unchanged to $2.50 lower with no buyers in sight.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't even see any buyers with a telescope,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Dutch soy oil closed 0.50 guilders down to unchanged after May/Jul traded at 106.75 guilders a 100 kilos fob ex-mill.</p>
<p>Rape oil closed mixed at 0.50 guilders up to 0.50 guilders down after Aug/Oct traded at 107.50 guilders.</p>
