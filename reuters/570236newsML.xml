<p>New York City, which has been relying on Wall Street's record profits to help balance its books, again raised its estimate of how big its surplus will be, by adding $56 million, city sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani last week projected that the 1997 fiscal surplus would be a little over $800 million, but it now is estimated at $856 million, said the sources, who declined to be named.  </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Republican mayor was not immediately available to comment. Giuliani is scheduled to unveil his budget on Thursday morning at a news conference.</p>
<p>Despite the big lift from Wall Street's profitable banks and brokerage houses, Giuliani is not relying solely on rising tax revenues to close the budget gap for fiscal 1998, which at first was estimated at nearly $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>The mayor, who in January proposed that city agencies make $558 million in cuts, raised this amount to $660 million, said the sources, who added it was not clear where the additional reductions would be made. The Health and Hospitals Corp was expected to slice $114 million from its budget in the mayor's preliminary plan, which was released in January.</p>
<p>Giuliani's approximately $250 million tax cut package includes an earned income tax credit to help the working poor, said the city sources, adding that the mayor only made slight changes to his plan to cut unincorporated business and commercial rent taxes. Giuliani left unchanged his plans to start eliminating in December the city's retail clothing sales taxes on items that cost less than $500, a step that would require Albany's approval.</p>
