<p>A China Southern Airlines Boeing 737 crash-landed during a thunderstorm in the southern city of Shenzhen on Thursday, killing at least 10 people and injuring 20, local officials said.</p>
<p>The airliner crashed and burned at the end of a scheduled flight from the southwestern city of Chongqing to Shenzhen, a booming city on China's border with Hong Kong, aviation officials said.</p>
<p>The cause of the crash -- the first major civil aviation disaster reported in China for almost three years -- was unclear, local officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The attitude of the plane during landing was wrong,&quot; one airline official said by telephone after the crash, which happened as Shenzhen was being pelted with rain from a severe thunderstorm.</p>
<p>The airliner's co-pilot was among at least 10 people killed by the impact or by the blaze that tore threw the airliner immediately afterwards, said another official.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known if foreigners were among the dead. Staff at one Shenzhen hospital said two middle-aged Thai men had been injured but that their condition was not serious.</p>
<p>The airport had been closed and other flights diverted after the accident, officials said. Residents waiting to welcome arriving passengers were turned away.</p>
<p>&quot;The plane is burning,&quot; one city official said shortly after the crash. &quot;The whole place is chaotic.&quot;</p>
<p>Ambulances and rescue workers ferried dead and injured passengers from the airport to hospital, while at least five fire engines rushed to extinguish the blaze.</p>
<p>The disaster was the first to hit China Southern since another of the airline's Boeing 737s slammed into one of the scenic hills around they southern city of Guilin in November, 1992. That accident killed all 141 people aboard.</p>
<p>Witnesses said they saw paramilitary police equipped with riot gear rush to Shenzhen's airport after Thursday's crash. &quot;The situation is very serious out there,&quot; said one city resident.</p>
<p>Chinese aviation officials had been celebrating almost three years without a serious accident, a record credited to improved precautions taken after a Russian-made Tupolev-154 exploded in mid-air after takeoff on a domestic flight in June, 1994.</p>
<p>That disaster killed 160 people, making it the worst reported accident in China's aviation history.</p>
<p>It occurred just months after the International Airline Passengers Association cited China as one of the most dangerous places in the world to fly after five aircraft crashed in 1993 and 10 airliners were hijacked to Taiwan.</p>
<p>In 1992, a series of accidents over a four-month period killed 276 passengers, including many foreigners.</p>
