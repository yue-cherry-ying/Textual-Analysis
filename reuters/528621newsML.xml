<headline>Kohl sues Penthouse over naked cartoon of wife.</headline>

<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl is suing the German edition of the men's magazine Penthouse for damages for printing a cartoon of his wife wearing nothing but gloves and a pearl necklace, the German government said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The drawing depicts Hannelore Kohl as the figurine on the radiator grille of a government limousine with a &quot;D&quot;, Germany's international automobile symbol, hanging from her necklace and an obviously approving chancellor at the wheel behind her.</p>
<p>&quot;We just thought there hadn't been enough recognition for Mrs Kohl as the show girl of the nation,&quot; said Penthouse editor Peter Herzfeld.</p>
<p>&quot;It was just meant as a humorous comment on her role as the chancellor's accompaniment for the last 14 years. We couldn't know Mrs Kohl would find it offensive.&quot;</p>
<p>The portly, folksy chancellor has himself been the butt of thousands of irreverent cartoons. But the couple felt the caricature of his wife was going too far.</p>
<p>In response to an inquiry, a government spokesman confirmed the Kohls had filed a civil suit for &quot;infringement of personal rights&quot;, and had also filed a criminal suit for defamation.</p>
<p>Press reports said the Kohls were seeking damages of 100,000 marks ($58,000).</p>
<p>Curious readers wanting to see the cartoon face problems. The Kohls secured a court injunction in January which forced Penthouse to stop distributing that month's edition and even prevents the editor sending out copies by fax.</p>
