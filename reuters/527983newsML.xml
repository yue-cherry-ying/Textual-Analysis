<p>China on Tuesday warned the United States to act cautiously during a visit by the Dalai Lama this week, saying the exiled Tibetan leader should not be allowed to meet senior U.S. leaders.</p>
<p>White House spokesmen have said they welcome the Dalai Lama, Beijing's greatest rival for the loyalties of its restive Himalayan region, but have given no details of which U.S. officials he is likely to meet.</p>
<p>If U.S. leaders met the Dalai Lama it would mean Washington backed the Tibetan god-king's attempts to split the Chinese motherland and would be an interference in China's affairs, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai said.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the U.S. side can deal cautiously with the Dalai Lama's visit to the United States, in line with the long-term and essential interests of two countries,&quot; Cui told a news briefing in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;We resolutely oppose any meetings between U.S. leaders and the Dalai Lama.&quot;</p>
<p>Beijing and Washington should cherish their newly improved ties and try to create the conditions for exchanges by senior leaders, including state visits by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton, he said.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen would visit the United States later this month and would meet Clinton, Cui said.</p>
<p>He declined to say if the visit, part of a series aimed at boosting Sino-U.S. ties long battered by diplomatic disputes, could be affected by the Dalai Lama's trip.</p>
<p>Beijing routinely accuses the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule, of seeking independence for the remote and mountainous Himalayan region.</p>
<p>The exiled spiritual leader, who lives in India, has been the target of a string of virulent state media condemnations in recent days. His visits to other Western nations have often prompted angry Chinese responses.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama's Washington visit is expected to pose a diplomatic dilemma for Clinton, with some analysts predicting he will risk China's wrath by arranging a high-profile meeting with the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.</p>
<p>However, when the Dalai Lama visited Washington in 1995, Clinton avoided a meeting, arranging only to &quot;drop in&quot; on a meeting between him and Vice President Al Gore.</p>
<p>Cui said the Dalai Lama should not be considered a purely religious figure and added that China already felt it was difficult to boost the cross-Pacific relationship.</p>
<p>&quot;We think improving Sino-U.S. relations is not easy,&quot; he said, adding that efforts were needed from both sides.</p>
<p>Sino-U.S. relations have improved in recent months, culminating in a visit by Gore last month. It was the highest level trip to China by a U.S. official since the 1989 army crackdown on student-led pro-democracy demonstrations centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>Gore's visit was seen as setting the stage for an exchange of presidential visits later this year and in 1998.</p>
