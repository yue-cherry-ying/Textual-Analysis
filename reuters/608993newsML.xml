<title>MEXICO: Mexico Cetes rate flat on inflation data.</title>
<headline>Mexico Cetes rate flat on inflation data.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates opened at 17.75 percent, up 55 basis points from what traders said was an unrepresentatively low prior closing rate.</p>
<p>Overnight rates quickly eased in early dealing to stand unchanged at 17.20 percent in the wake of lower-then-expected inflation data published late Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The inflation figures were very good. I think most market makers will modify their inflation forecasts downward, which will strengthen the market and fuel a downward trend in interest rates,&quot; a fixed-income analyst said.  </p>
<p>Banco de Mexico announced the Consumer Price Index had gained 0.48 percent in the first half of May. This compared with an average forecast of 0.53 percent from financial firms previously surveyed by Reuters MEX22.</p>
<p>Dealers predicted the market would be calm over the coming weeks, with a slight downward trend in rates.</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing that could hurt the market in the future would be the (mid-term) elections, but the market is already digesting the possibility of an opposition victory so that has not led to jitters,' he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Federal Open Market Committee meeting in July will hit the market more,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Mexico will go to the polls on July 6 to replace the entire lower house of Congress, one quarter of the Senate and several state governors. Mexico City residents will also choose their mayor for the first time. The Congress has been dominated by the Institutional Revolutionary Party since 1929.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper meanwhile opened down 30 basis points to 18.65 percent.</p>
<p>A liquidity shortfall of 201 million pesos was forecast for the session due to previous central bank participation falling due.</p>
