<title>GREECE: GREEK SHIPOWNERS ASK GOVERNMENT TO AID GREEK FLAG.</title>

<p>Greek shipowners said chronic delays by the government in taking measures to help the international competitiveness of Greek-registered vessels could deal a major blow to the country's shipping industry.</p>
<p>&quot;We point out the need for the government to proceed with no further delay in introducing necessary measures...to avoid the collapse of the country's shipping industry,&quot; the Union of Greek Shipowners said in a statement.</p>
<p>Greek shipowners pointed out that despite a clear trend away from Greece's shipping registry and towards flags of other countries, the Greek government has been dragging its feet in adjusting its shipping legislation in line with other members of the European Union.</p>
<p>The lack of incentives to shipowners for raising the Greek flag goes hand in hand with a drop in the quality of the entire fleet, as no newly built or recently purchased units are added to it, the statement said.</p>
<p>The union said Greek shipowners presented the problems of Greek shipping, a major contributor to the country's balance of payments, during recent meetings with Prime Minister Costas Simitis, President Costis Stefanopoulos and Merchant Marine Minister Stavros Soumakis.</p>
<p>Mounting problems associated with the use of the Greek flag by ships of Greek interests were also discussed by the Greek Shipping Co-operation Committee, which represents the London-based lobby of Greek shipowners and the Piraeus-based union in London on March 24, the statement said.</p>
<p>The next meeting between the two groups is scheduled for September 1997 in Piraeus. --Angelos Kiosklis, Athens Newsroom +301-3311812-4</p>
