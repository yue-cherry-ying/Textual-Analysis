<p>Turkey has called on Kurdish separatist rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan to return to the country to do his military service or face losing his citizenship.</p>
<p>Ocalan who has led a violent campaign by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) for Kurdish self-rule from Turkey since 1984 was among those listed in a government warning published in the official gazette on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The following people who do not reside in Turkey...and have not to this date completed their military service will be subject to the following ruling:</p>
<p>&quot;It is announced that if they do not come to Turkey and...apply to do their military service in three months, procedings will be started to be remove their Turkish citizenship,&quot; the announcement said.</p>
<p>Ocalan who has been missing since 1980 ordered the PKK's first violent action 13 years ago on Friday, with an attack on two gendarmerie posts in the mainly Kurdish southeast.</p>
<p>Since then more than 26,000 people have been killed in the ensuing conflict with the Turkish security services.</p>
<p>Friday's anniversary is usually a time of hightened tension and increased security alerts throughout the country in fear of further attacks marking the day.</p>
<p>Ocalan is alleged to reside in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. He has not known to have personally taken part in any of the PKK's attacks.</p>
