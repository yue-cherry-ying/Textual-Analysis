<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Monday called on Arabs and Israelis to give up &quot;old thinking and old habits&quot;, stick to principles and oppose terror, in order to forge a Middle East peace.</p>
<p>Albright made her comments in remarks prepared for a dinner in New York honouring King Hussein of Jordan with a prize for his peace efforts.</p>
<p>They came as the peace process lurched into a new crisis as Arab states voted to stop normal relations with Israel and Palestinians staged a 12th straight day of street protests at Israel's decision to start a Jewish housing project in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Without referring directly to latest events, Albright said that although Israel, the Arab states and the Palestinians had accomplished much, the &quot;future is not yet at hand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There remain those who cannot bring themselves to accept peace, and those who cannot or will not free themselves from old thinking and old habits,&quot; she said in a speech whose text was released in advance by the State Department.</p>
<p>&quot;The process of creating confidence, forging agreements and meeting commitments can be painstaking and painful,&quot; she said. &quot;It requires a steadfast adherence to principle and steadfast opposition to terror. And it deserves the support of governments and citizens from around the globe.&quot;</p>
<p>Albright did not identify the targets of her criticisms.</p>
<p>She hailed Hussein, who unexpectedly made peace with Israel in 1994, as a man who understood peace and had taught others that reconciliation among peoples begins at the individual level.</p>
<p>&quot;King Hussein has played a major role in the history of this half century,&quot; she said. &quot;But his vision is fixed, not on the past but on the future. Where others see no escape from conflict, he sees no acceptable alternative to peace. And he has laboured courageously and relentlessly to build peace.&quot;</p>
<p>Hussein was awarded the Ruth Ratner Miller Seeds of Peace Prize, named for the mother of Aaron Miller, deputy to U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross.</p>
