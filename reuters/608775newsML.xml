<title>RUSSIA: Russia companies seen restructuring tax arrears.</title>

<p>Russia's bankruptcy chief, charged with getting top tax debtors to pay up, said on Friday a number of major companies would probably restructure debts soon.</p>
<p>&quot;The probability of a favourable decision (by the government on debt restructuring) is high,&quot; Pyotr Mostovoi, head of the Federal Bankruptcy Service, told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said his offices had sent 20 large tax and pension fund debtors notices on May 5 requiring them in a week's time to pay their tax debts or make debt restructuring proposals.</p>
<p>&quot;About half the organisations took steps as advised -- either they paid debts, confirming that with necessary documents, or they made restructuring proposals.&quot;</p>
<p>The bankruptcy service will forward proposals to the government.</p>
<p>A government plan allows companies to restructure tax debts if they issue new equity comprising a controlling stake to be held as collateral by the state or company debt that can also be held by the government.</p>
<p>The Russian economy is struggling with massive non-payments and the government has proposed cutting 1997 expenditure by one fifth. The government has threatened to sue companies which do not pay or restructure with bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Mostovoi declined to name companies to which letters had been sent on May 5, but the State Tax Service recently named the following companies as the top tax debtors as of April 1. Figures in billions of roubles</p>
