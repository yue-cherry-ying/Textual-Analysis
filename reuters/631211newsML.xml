<p>A high level Indian delegation will visit Australia next week to discuss the presence of weeds in its wheat exports to India and new specifications for further imports, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;A delegation is going to Australia on June 10 comprising agriculture ministry, State Trading Corp (STC), research and plant quarantine officials,&quot; a senior STC official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Officials said Australia, which has export contracts with India totalling 2.325 million tonnes, had so far shipped 1.3 million with the rest due for shipment after July.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not renege on the contract but we will insist on new quarantine standards specifically relating to weeds,&quot; an STC official said.</p>
<p>&quot;If they can match the standards we hope shipments will start from August,&quot; he said. &quot;We need the wheat.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the issue related to weeds and not and not the quality of wheat supplied. &quot;It is a quarantine problem, not of quality.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday an AWB spokesman said Indian Agriculture Ministry officials would visit Australia for discussions this week. On Friday Australian high commissioner to India Darren Gribble told Reuters the ministry officials will discuss the issue of alleged contamination of wheat with exotic seeds.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue is going to be discussed with the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) and the Australian Plant Quarantine Inspection Service,&quot; Gribble said.</p>
<p>The STC official said Australia would need to explain the presence of weeds in the wheat to the delegation, which will meet members of the Australian Wheat Board and the government's quarantine authorities.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Chaturanan Mishra said last week weeds were detected in wheat import shipments from Australia, but they were common and not harmful.</p>
<p>Analysts said the weed-infected wheat was not harmful if consumed, but would yield a smaller crop if used for sowing.</p>
<p>India's state-run State Trading Corp (STC) contracted to import 1.75 million tonnes, mainly from Australia, Argentina and Canada after India authorised the import of two million tonnes of wheat in 1996/97 (April-March) to build stocks and check rising prices.</p>
<p>The government announced fresh imports of two million tonnes of wheat in 1997/98, of which the STC has contracted for one million tonnes, mainly from Australia.</p>
<p>Reports from Australia last week quoted AWB officials as saying Australia had abided by all requirements in its wheat sales to India and had not received any official complaints about quality. --New Delhi Newsroom +91 11 301 2024</p>
