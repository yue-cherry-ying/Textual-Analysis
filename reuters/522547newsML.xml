<p>Fernando Vina belted his first career grand slam and Ben McDonald pitched seven scorless innings to lead the Milwauke Brewers to a 10-2 rout of the struggling Cleveland Indians on Friday.</p>
<p>Vina's grand slam in the fourth inning off starter Jack McDowell (0-2) extended Milwaukee's lead to 7-0. He added a sacrifice fly for his fifth RBI of the game in the seventh.</p>
<p>McDonald (2-1) limited Cleveland to two hits with a walk and five strikeouts. He retired 12 straight and 19 of the final 20 batters he faced despite difficult near freezing playing conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that was one of the coldest games I've ever pitched in, the cold just bites right through you,&quot; McDonald said. &quot;The guys went out early and scored some runs for me and that's always a plus.&quot;</p>
<p>The Brewers have won three in a row and eight of their last 10 games. They lead the league with a 2.72 ERA.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Bernie Williams doubled and drove in four and Tino Martinez added a home run and two RBI as the New York Yankees snapped a five-game losing streak with a 10-4 rout of the White Sox.</p>
<p>The Yankees opened the game with four straight singles against White Sox starter Jamie Navarro (1-1) to spark a five-run first inning.</p>
<p>The Yankees tacked on two more in the second on an RBI single by Williams and a sacrifice fly by Martinez. Williams added a two-run double in the third for a 9-0 lead.</p>
<p>Chicago scored all of its runs in the fifth against Yankee starter Ramiro Mendoza (1-1), who allowed four runs and seven hits over five innings.</p>
<p>At Texas, Roger Pavlik tied an American League record by walking the first four batters of the game and Ed Sprague followed with a two-run double as the Toronto Blue Jays raced to an early 5-0 lead and held off the Texas Rangers, 6-5.</p>
<p>AL Cy Young Award winner Pat Hentgen (1-1) allowed four runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings, walking one and striking out five for the win.</p>
<p>Orlando Merced's solo homer in the seventh to extended Toronto's lead to 6-2. The Blue Jays needed the cushion after Mike Simms led off the seventh with a homer, Benji Gil added an RBI single and Dean Palmer homered in the eighth for Texas.</p>
<p>In Detroit, pinch-hitter Dave Magadan's RBI single sparked a six-run eighth-inning as the Oakland Athletics ended a four-game losing streak with a 9-5 win over the Tigers.</p>
<p>Oakland starter Dave Telgheder gave up five runs and eight hits over 5 1/3 innings. But reliever Buddy Groom (1-1) pitched a scoreless inning for the win.</p>
<p>Mike Myers (0-1) put two runners on base before Magadan singled to centre field, scoring Scott Brosius and cutting the deficit to 5-4. Todd Jones relieved Myers and walked three straight batters as the A's scored five more runs in the inning.</p>
<p>In Seattle, Roberto Kelly's three-run double highlighted a five-run fifth inning as the Minnesota Twins pounded the Mariners, 10-3.</p>
<p>With the game tied 1-1, Seattle starter Scott Sanders (0-4) surrendered a two run homer to Rich Becker, sparking a five-run fifth as Sanders became baseball's first four-game loser this season.</p>
<p>Greg Colbrunn added a three-run homer in the sixth as Minnesota built a 10-1 lead after six innings.</p>
<p>Frankie Rodriguez (1-2) got the win despite giving up solo home runs to Jay Buhner and Paul Sorrento in the seventh.</p>
