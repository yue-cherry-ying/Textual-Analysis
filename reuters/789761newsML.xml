<p>The Teamsters Union and U.S. package carrier giant United Parcel Service agreed to resume negotiations at noon on Saturday after failing to end the nationwide strike during lengthy meetings on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, we have no progress to report,&quot; UPS Chairman James Kelly said after Friday's nine-hour session.</p>
<p>&quot;The mediator has asked that we return tomorrow at noon (1600 GMT) and we are willing to do that,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Teamsters President Ron Carey sounded an even more pessimistic note when asked if there had been any progress.</p>
<p>&quot;No, none whatsoever ... it seems like this is a waste,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Carey expressed frustration with the talks which began on Thursday with a 10 1/2 hour session.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not going to spend anymore time here if we're not about to start making some progress,&quot; he said. Asked if that meant the Teamsters were ready to walk out of negotiations, Carey told reporters: &quot;I'm always willing to find a solution.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After the meeting tomorrow we will move into the next step which is to get out there, get into the picket lines to start talking to our members and travelling around the country,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The company and the union continued to battle in court over picketing of UPS facilities by Teamsters. A Miami judge on Friday granted UPS an injunction limiting picket lines to no more than five people and barring the Teamsters from blocking entrances and exits.</p>
<p>But a Boston judge adjourned until Monday a hearing in which UPS was seeking a similar restraining order for five of its Massachusetts facilities.</p>
<p>With the strike entering its fifth day, President Bill Clinton and Labour Secretary Alexis Herman continued to put pressure on the two sides to reach a compromise.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said: &quot;The president urges them to redouble their efforts and work hard to try and settle their dispute.&quot;</p>
<p>Herman said in a statement she had talked to Carey and Kelly on Friday and urged them keep talking and &quot;finish the job.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite pressure from some lawmakers, there was little indication Clinton would intervene directly to end the strike. The president said on Wednesday there would have to be &quot;severe damage&quot; to the country before he could halt the strike under the rarely used Taft-Hartley industrial relations law.</p>
<p>McCurry repeated on Friday the president would not intervene.</p>
<p>The Teamsters have blamed the strike on the company's refusal to create more full-time jobs each year for the three in five union workers at UPS who are now part-time.</p>
<p>UPS said the real issue was the Teamsters' refusal to let the company withdraw from a union pension plan that includes 30 other companies. UPS says running its own plan would save money.</p>
<p>The walkout has choked off the delivery of nearly 12 million packages a day across the United States, hitting the mail order catalogue business especially hard as well as the delivery of medical supplies.</p>
<p>The union estimated UPS was losing $35 million a day in profits. UPS spokeswoman Gina Ellrich said the company had no precise estimate, but that it was losing &quot;tens of millions of dollars a day.&quot;</p>
<p>Since the strike began, UPS has been handling less than 10 percent of its normal shipments, using 50,000 non-union employees to do the work of striking loaders, sorters and drivers.</p>
<p>The company has 300,000 workers of whom more than 200,000 are represented by the union.</p>
