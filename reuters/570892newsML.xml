<title>JAPAN: TIFFE Euroyen ends easier on late fall in JGBs.</title>

<p>Key December three-month Euroyen interest rate futures settled easier on Thursday in line with late falls in Japanese government bond (JGB) futures.</p>
<p>Poor results of Thursday's six-year JGB auction dampened JGB futures in the afternoon, triggering profit-taking from those who had bought the December below 98.90 on Wednesday, traders said. It hit a six-week low on Wednesday of 98.85.</p>
<p>&quot;The market followed falls in JGBs,&quot; said a bank dealer.  </p>
<p>The December was down 0.02 at 98.92 after moving between 98.90 and 98.97.</p>
<p>A view spread after Wednesday's quick recovery from 98.85 that the December may stay at and above 98.90 unless the market factors in a further rise in interest rates, traders said.</p>
<p>There was widespread talk in the afternoon that a major foreign newspaper had carried an article on a Japanese rate rise, but traders said most ignored the talk and it was later found to be groundless.</p>
<p>&quot;The market tried the topside this morning. But rises were capped by resilience in Tokyo stocks,&quot; said a city bank dealer.  </p>
<p>The key 225-share Nikkei average hovered around the 20,000 level despite steep losses on Wall Street overnight. The index ended 12.91 points or 0.06 percent higher at 20,061.81.</p>
<p>The key overnight call rate was mainly traded at 0.49 percent on Thursday, unchanged from Wednesday.</p>
<p>Given a decline in banks' fund demand, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) let the money market hold a fund surplus of 180 billion yen on Thursday, down from around 300 billion yen on previous days. The key overnight rate briefly fell to 0.45 percent due to steady progress in banks' fund-raising before the current bank reserves reporting period ends on May 15.  </p>
<p>Two-month certificates of deposit (CD) were issued at 0.55 percent, the first issue since April 21. The benchmark three-month CDs were issued at an unchanged 0.57 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The buyers of the two-momth CDs did not expect a change in Japan's low interest rate policy in two months. But an increasing number of people now expect a change after the BOJ's 'tankan' survey in early July,&quot; another city bank dealer said.</p>
<p>A fourth dealer said: &quot;It seems that the BOJ is watching if Tokyo stocks manage to keep the current level amid increasing anticipation of higher rates.&quot;</p>
