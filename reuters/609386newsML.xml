<p>The Senate on Friday approved the long-delayed appointment of three federal judges, even as Democrats charged Republicans were continuing to block a host of other White House judicial nominees.</p>
<p>&quot;It's zero population growth in the federal judiciary,&quot; said Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, complaining that the Senate had approved just five judges this year, including Friday's action.</p>
<p>Democrats have said majority Republicans were purposely slowing the process to prevent &quot;activist&quot; candidates from sitting on the federal bench.</p>
<p>Republicans denied they were out to get President Clinton's nominees.</p>
<p>They said the 100 vacancies on the federal bench were due in part to a record number of retirements. They also griped that the White House had not sent up nominees to fill most of the empty slots.</p>
<p>&quot;Federal judges should not be confirmed as part of a numbers game or to reduce a vacancy rate,&quot; said Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican.</p>
<p>&quot;The record of activism demonstrated by so many of the Clinton judges and nominess shows (the need for) more vigilance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>By voice vote the Senate approved the nominations of Donald Middlebrooks as U.S. district judge for the Southern District of Florida; Jeffrey Miller as U.S. district judge for the Southern District of California and Robert Pratt as U.S. district judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>
<p>The large number of vacancies gave Clinton the opportunity to reshape the federal court system, which has a high number of Republican appointees.</p>
<p>In response, conservative groups organised to challenge what they termed a trend toward activist appointments by the White House.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans last month rejected proposals that would have given individual senators more authority to halt nominations.</p>
<p>Republicans did approve a policy statement that the Senate should turn away judicial nominees that were considered to have activist philosophies.</p>
