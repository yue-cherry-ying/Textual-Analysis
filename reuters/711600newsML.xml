<p>Relatives of Dutch Holocaust victims will start legal action next month to recover the savings of their relatives who died during World War Two, a Jewish leader said on Monday.</p>
<p>Herman Loonstein, president of the Federation of Jews in the Netherlands, said heirs of four Jewish children would take action in an Amsterdam court against Postbank and the Dutch state seeking the return of their funds.</p>
<p>He said Postbank, now owned by ING Groep, was a descendant of the Rijkspostspaarbank, the state-owned bank where the funds were deposited.</p>
<p>&quot;There are only very small amounts involved but we are fighting about the principle,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Loonstein said heirs of the victims had found their account pass-books but Postbank had refused requests to repay the money as it no longer had information on the accounts.</p>
<p>A Postbank spokesman said the bank could not yet respond to the planned legal claim.</p>
<p>&quot;At this moment we have no official notification of the (case),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Loonstein said 110,000 Dutch Jews died during World War Two and he expected many more descendants, including those of adults, to come forward with account books to try to reclaim the savings of their relatives.</p>
<p>He said the Dutch state should have taken action to ensure the savings were recovered by descendants of those who died.</p>
