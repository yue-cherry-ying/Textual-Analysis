<p>Fresh firefights broke out in the capital of Congo Brazzaville on Saturday, the third day of a standoff between supporters of ex-president Denis Sassou Nguesso and troops loyal to President Pascal Lissouba, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Witnesses and a Western diplomatic source spoke of isolated clashes and widespread looting in some parts of the city, which was divided into no-go areas for the rival forces.</p>
<p>The clashes began after Lissouba's government ordered a crackdown on private militias and unauthorised possession of weapons ahead of a presidential election planned for July 27. Troops surrounded Sassou Nguesso's home on Thursday.</p>
<p>The diplomatic source said supporters of Sassou Nguesso were targeting political and ethnic allies of Lissouba for looting while soldiers were targeting political and ethnic allies of Sassou Nguesso plus former military associates.</p>
<p>Sassou Nguesso has accused Lissouba of fomenting violence to postpone the election.</p>
<p>His supporters, who were more lightly armed but more mobile than the army, appeared to be trying to take control of Maya Maya international airport, the diplomatic source added.</p>
<p>Witnesses reported the occasional boom of cannon fire.</p>
<p>One unconfirmed report said that a house belonging to the wife of President Omar Bongo of Gabon had been looted.</p>
<p>Political parties armed their supporters after 1993 parliamentary elections. At that time, ethnic and political clashes killed 2,000 people in the capital. The militias were supposed to have been disbanded.</p>
<p>Witnesses had reported shots and explosions near the presidency after the start of the curfew on Friday night.</p>
<p>On Saturday, they said these appeared to have been from mortars, rocket-propelled grenades or heavy weapons fired from near the presidency in the direction of Sassou Nguesso's northern stronghold.</p>
<p>One report said that supporters of Sassou Nguesso, a former military leader named president in 1979 but voted out of office with the advent of democratic reform in 1992, had taken control of a military camp in the north.</p>
<p>Fighting between supporters of Sassou Nguesso and of Lissouba's campaign manager in the north has killed at least 16 people in under a month.</p>
<p>The latest standoff began on Thursday when troops surrounded Sassou Nguesso's home. Officials said that they had gone there to arrest members of his entourage on murder charges in connection with the incidents in the north.</p>
<p>Lissouba, Sassou Nguesso and Brazzaville mayor and 1992 presidential runner-up Bernard Kolelas are likely to be the front-runners among about a dozen hopefuls on July 27, if the polls take place.</p>
<p>Kolelas's supporters control southern suburbs on the Congo River. Witnesses said they had closed off their area. Troops from the French Foreign Legion guarded the French ambassador's residence there.</p>
<p>International telephone links with Congo Brazzaville, which is dwarfed by Laurent Kabila's Democratic Republic of Congo to the south, have been down since Friday. Telephone contacts remained possible through residents or visitors plugged into the mobile telephone network in Kabila's Congo.</p>
