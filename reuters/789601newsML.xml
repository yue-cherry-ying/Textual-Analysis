<p>World number one Martina Hingis, playing so well she joked about joining the men's circuit, raced past sixth-seeded Anke Huber 6-3 6-0 Friday night to gain the semifinals of the $450,000 Acura Classic Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt if I closed my eyes and hit the ball, maybe it would still be in,&quot; Hingis said of her blinding 54-minute victory over the ninth-ranked Huber. &quot;I hit some unbelievable shots.&quot;</p>
<p>The Swiss 16-year-old will meet defending champion Lindsay Davenport of the United States in the semis. Davenport, the fourth seed, beat unseeded Nathalie Tauziat of France 6-1 3-6 6-3.</p>
<p>Amy Frazier, meanwhile, surprised fifth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain 3-6 6-1 6-3, setting up a clash with second-seeded Monica Seles.</p>
<p>Hingis is playing with so much confidence she speculated about her chances playing against the world's top men.</p>
<p>&quot;Men's tennis is slower than women's tennis, they just have better serves,&quot; she jibed. &quot;If they only played with one serve and I played the way I played today, I think I'd have a little chance.&quot;</p>
<p>When asked if she could rally against the likes of Thomas Muster and Michael Chang, she replied: &quot;They would kill me. They play with so much power. I would rather play someone like Boris Becker. Someone who likes to have short rallies. But he would have to have one serve.&quot;</p>
<p>Hingis stretched her career mark to 6-1 against Huber but not before engaging in some sparkling rallies, until Huber began to unravel in the second set, falling behind 0-3.</p>
<p>&quot;There were three games I didn't put the ball back in,&quot; Huber said of her collapse. &quot;I got a little crazy and stopped playing. I wasn't on the court anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>Huber has seen a boost in Hingins's confidence since the teen became world number one on March 31.</p>
<p>&quot;She's even more confident than in March. When she's hitting the ball, it's like she's closing her eyes and it's going in. She doesn't play especially fast and doesn't move great. She's just there when it's important.</p>
<p>&quot;You always think the important points you have to do something special but she doesn't miss.&quot;</p>
<p>Davenport allowed Tauziat just 11 points in the 20-minute opening set. But the seventh-ranked American was unable to keep up the torrid pace as Tauziat evened the match.</p>
<p>&quot;I played unbelievable in the first set, but stopped returning well and missed a ton of serves,&quot; said Davenport of the second-set lapse. &quot;I was so frustrated because I couldn't break or return her serve.&quot;</p>
<p>The 1996 Olympic gold medalist regained her form in the deciding set, breaking twice for a 4-0 lead before holding on to nail down the one-hour, 24-minute win.</p>
<p>&quot;It's always nice to be able to start over again once you lose it, especially in the third,&quot; she said. &quot;I was able to regroup, hold my serve easily, and break right away to pull it out. It's a big win -- the semifinals.&quot;</p>
<p>Davenport knows it won't be easy against Hingis.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to have to go for it and keep my concentration throughout,&quot; Davenport said. &quot;She's got great hands and you always have to be prepared that when you hit a good shot, she's going to hit a good shot back.&quot;</p>
<p>Sanchez Vicario has had difficulty closing out matches recently, and has slipped to eighth in the rankings as a consequence. Frazier's punishing groundstrokes, which produced 25 winners and 31 unforced errors, contributed to her departure.</p>
