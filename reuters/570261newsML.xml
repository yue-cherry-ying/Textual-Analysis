<p>Britain's new Labour government has called on the rail watchdog to come up with ways of boosting his powers in clamping down on errant train operators on the day that much-criticised South West Trains won a last-ditch reprieve.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf) told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that the government had decided to act swiftly partly in response to the poor performance of SW Trains, a unit of Stagecoach Holdings Plc.</p>
<p>SW Trains, the company  which cancelled over 2,500 trains earlier this year, won a reprieve from the Opraf earlier on Thursday, escaping the ultimatum of a one million pounds ($1.6 million) fine and possible loss of its franchise.</p>
<p>The train operator was forced to cancel trains after axing too many drivers in its post privatisation restructuring.</p>
<p>SW Trains is still on probation and the rough ride for privatised rail operators is far from over with news that the government is looking at putting more bite into regulation.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour asked the franchising director to look at ways of beefing up his powers,&quot; a spokesman for the Opraf, responsible for selling off and monitoring the 25 passenger rail operators, told Reuters</p>
<p>In the election run-up Labour had expressed anger at the SW Trains debacle and warned of tougher rail regulation if it got into power.</p>
<p>That process is now underway, with Opraf boss John O'Brien due to report on ways to strengthen and speed up his actions against errant operators.</p>
<p>Labour is understood to be willing to introduce primary legislation to improve rail regulation, the Opraf spokesman said.</p>
<p>Transport minister Gavin Strang hinted at a tougher new regime in a statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The SW Trains episode supports our belief that the weapons currently available to the regulators are inadequate. Let me assure passengers that this government will use all the tools at its disposal to ensure that the public interest always comes first,&quot; Strang said.</p>
<p>O'Brien met with the new deputy prime minister and head of the transport and environment super ministry John Prescott and his junior ministers Strang and Glenda Jackson this week.</p>
<p>He told the ministers he planned to give South West Trains a reprieve after an improvement in services to meet the minimum service requirement, but he warned he would keep the company under review.</p>
<p>Strang said he was assured that the director is satisfied and that there will be no repetition of the cancellations in February and March.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope these assurance will be justified by events,&quot; Strang said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile South West Trains must keep delivering on its promises. Stagecoach shares, which had been hit hard after the ultimatum from Opraf, were boosted by the reprieve. By 1400 GMT, its shares were up 19 1/2 pence at 618 1/2.</p>
<p>Brian Cox, SW Trains chairman and managing director, said it had operated nearly 100 percent of its scheduled trains in April, against a minimum Opraf target of 98.5 percent.</p>
<p>Opraf said SW Trains had been called in twice for failures -- once last year and once in the spring 1997 but another failure meant Opraf would adopt the &quot;three strikes and you're out&quot; approach.</p>
<p>&quot;They are now on notice. If they are called in again, it will be a breach,&quot; Opraf told Reuters.</p>
<p>Stagecoach may have avoided the one million fine, but it will still lose 900,000 pounds in scheduled subsidy payments as a penalty, said Opraf which sees the episode as a warning shot to the entire industry.</p>
<p>&quot;It offers a clear message to other operators that they will be clamped down on very hard indeed,&quot; said an Opraf spokesman.</p>
<p>But rail pressure group Save Our Railways, was unimpressed with the tough talk. Jonathan Bray said in a statement that Stagecoach &quot;will be laughing all the way to the bank.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that Stagecoach was one of the most profitable rail franchises in the country.</p>
<p>&quot;The franchise director has shown himself to be a cheerleader for rail privatisation rather than a guardian of the passengers' interest,&quot; Bray said.</p>
<p>&quot;...you can always be sure he will give priority to the profits of the new rail fat cats.&quot; ($ = 0.616 British Pounds)</p>
