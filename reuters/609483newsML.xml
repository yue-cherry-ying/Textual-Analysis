<p>German shares edged up in early trade on Friday and held onto the gains to end bourse trade higher as the DAX index hurdled an important level.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index ended the bourse up 22.77 points at 3,602.19 points and finished above 3,600-point level.</p>
<p>The blue-chip index, underpinned by Wall Street gains, remained buoyant in post-bourse IBIS electronic dealings and ended the day up 46.28 points at 3,621.72 points.</p>
<p>The market got a boost from two German state inflation reports that showed higher prices in May on a monthly basis but failed to ignite fears about inflation growth.</p>
<p>Firmer German debt prices and a higher dollar also helped to underpin the market, which held an eye on Wall Street in afternoon post-bourse IBIS electronic dealings.</p>
<p>Traders said the DAX's ability to retain earlier gains and finish above 3,600 points could keep up the advance in pursuit of the DAX record during bourse trade of 3,618.24 points.</p>
<p>Among specific shares, carmaker Volkswagen AG ended bourse trade up 13 marks at 1,140 marks after briefly pushing through technical resistance at 1,150 marks.</p>
<p>Daimler-Benz AG, maker of Mercedes vehicles, rose 1.55 marks to 133.50 marks. Dealers cited buy recommendations in the sector.</p>
<p>Dresdner Bank, Germany's second largest bank, gained 1.02 marks to 62.82 marks after saying it was optimistic for higher full-year results and dividend payout after a 10 percent rise in first quarter profits.</p>
<p>The bank also denied media reports that it was interested in taking a stake in Postbank, the state-owned bank currently tied to the postal system.</p>
<p>Software firm SAP ended trade steady at 316.50 marks amid what dealers said was continued concern over allegations of insider trading despite a statement from state prosecutors Thursday clearing 71 SAP staff of suspicion.</p>
<p>Frankfurt prosecutors later said their probe would now focus on banks and non-employees of SAP who have ties to the firm.</p>
