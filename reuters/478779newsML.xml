<p>Brazil scrambled Tuesday to douse a potentially explosive dispute over its new import financing rules, which have drawn fire from trade partners in South America's Mercosur customs union.</p>
<p>President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic team was busy laying the groundwork for high-level talks later this week aimed at finding a speedy solution to the dispute, a Finance Ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources said Brazil was considering exempting Mercosur nations Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay from the rules, which raise the cost of short-term import financing.</p>
<p>The three countries and associate Mercosur member Chile have said the new restrictions are protectionist and violate Mercosur rules.</p>
<p>&quot;Brazil is looking for an honourable way out of this but they are not quite sure how to do it,&quot; a Latin American diplomat said.</p>
<p>The dispute erupted last week when Brazil announced it would impose tougher rules for importers who use financing of less than 360 days.</p>
<p>The measure, expected to affect 65 percent of Brazil's imports, is partly aimed at ending the interest rate arbitrage importers have enjoyed.</p>
<p>But the decision also followed months of increasingly ugly trade numbers and was seen as the first significant step in curbing Brazil's burgeoning trade gap, which hit $5.5 billion last year.</p>
<p>Mercosur partners, who were not consulted about the measure in advance, were further frustrated when attempts to clarify the rules proved fruitless because Brazilian officials could not be reached over the long Easter holiday.</p>
<p>Brazil's import rules have dominated headlines for the past week in Argentina, Mercosur's second largest partner after Brazil. Argentina exports some $6.5 billion in goods to Brazil.</p>
<p>Businessmen in Argentina are outraged by the rules, which they say will affect $2.4 billion in exports to Brazil.</p>
<p>Argentine Economy Minister Roque Fernandez planned to fly to Brazil Tuesday to discuss the matter, but cancelled his trip late Monday, saying not enough progress had been made in preliminary talks.</p>
<p>Deputy Argentine ministers, however, were meeting in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia on Tuesday to remove obstacles blocking higher-level talks. Fernandez said he might travel to Brazil on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The import financing wrangle is the latest in a series of Mercosur disputes that usually originate from Brazilian policy moves.</p>
<p>Brazil -- with an annual gross domestic product of $700 billion, compared to just $290 billion in Argentina -- is the anchor economy in the budding customs union formed in 1995. Trade among Mercosur nations has grown to about $15 billion a year from just $4 billion in 1990.</p>
<p>As Mercosur's giant partner, Brazil is often accused of being insensitive to the tremendous impact slight changes in its economic policies can have on fellow members.</p>
<p>Brazilians are also much less aware of the customs union than their neighbours. Just a day before the import rules were announced, a poll was released showing that half of Brazil's 160 million people did not know what Mercosur was.</p>
