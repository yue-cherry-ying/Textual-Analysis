<p>West Australian Newspapers Holdings Ltd said on Thursday that net profit in the latest nine months ending March 31 fell 1.5 percent to A$36.69 million.  </p>
<p>The company, which publishes the Perth-based West Australian newspaper, said operating profit in the latest period rose slightly to A$58.29 million from A$58.10 million.</p>
<p>Sales fell to A$221.38 million from A$223.05 million.</p>
<p>The company said the net advertising revenue on the West Australian newspaper fell by 1.9 percent to A$133.41 million and net circulation revenue fell 0.5 percent to A$40.27 million.</p>
<p>It did not release third quarter results but said there had been some improvement in the display sector of the advertising market in the latest three months but no recovery in the classified real estate and employment sectors.  </p>
<p>&quot;Masking the modest overall improvement in trading conditions was the Easter long weekend falling into the third quarter this year, whereas Easter has been in the fourth quarter since the company was listed in 1992,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading conditions generally remain patchy and the outlook is for a gradual improvement in advertising volumes. As stated at the half-year, the cost of newsprint has receded from the high levels of the last 18 months.&quot;</p>
<p>Newsprint costs fell 3.8 percent to A$38.26 million in the latest nine months.  </p>
<p>The company achieved net earnings of A$47.85 million in 1995/96 (July-June) and A$25.31 million in the latest six months ended December 1996.</p>
