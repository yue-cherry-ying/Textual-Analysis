<title>CANADA: Union predicts lengthy Fletcher strike.</title>
<headline>Union predicts lengthy Fletcher strike.</headline>
<dateline>VANCOUVER 1997-07-08</dateline>

<p>A strike due to begin next Monday at Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd's three British Columbia pulp and paper mills will likely last months and be very costly to the company, a union official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it could be a long time, much longer than normal. By that I mean months, not weeks...and run into millions and millions of dollars,&quot; said Brian Payne of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers (CEP) union.</p>
<p>The CEP and Fletcher's other union, the Pulp, Paper and Woodworkers of Canada, have said they will go on strike July 14 after contract talks collapsed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The strike would be the second in 2-1/2 years for Fletcher, whose mills were shut by a six-week strike in late 1994 and early 1995.</p>
<p>Payne said the strike would hurt the company because it comes amid a time of rising pulp and paper prices and would hurt the continuity of supply to Fletcher customers.</p>
<p>Fletcher negotiator Howard Burleigh was unable to estimate immediately how much the strike could cost the company.</p>
<p>The three mills have capacity to produce 930,000 tonnes of newsprint, 730,000 tonnes of market pulp and 90,000 tonnes of containerboard a year.</p>
<p>The 2,400 unionized workers have been without a contract since April.</p>
<p>For the unions, the &quot;deal breaker&quot; in this round of negotiations was Fletcher's insistence on so-called full flexibility, Payne said.</p>
<p>That would allow the company to assign employees work outside their normal job classifications, he said. Maintenence workers would be the most affected.</p>
<p>Fletcher is also seeking to operate 365 days a year instead of the current 362 days, and concessions on contract language that protects workers from layoffs if outside contractors are used, Payne said.</p>
<p>He said the union was prepared to bargain a longer than normal contract in return for concessions from Fletcher in other areas.</p>
<p>The last proposal from the union was for a three-year agreement, while Fletcher sought a six-year deal. Fletcher said the union wanted a five percent a year wage hike, while the company was offering a one percent a year raise.</p>
<p>Fletcher is majority owned by New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge Ltd.</p>
