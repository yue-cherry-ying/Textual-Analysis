<p>Kraft Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos Inc, said Thursday it agreed to sell its Log Cabin maple-flavored syrup retail and food service businesses and other syrup products to MBW Foods.</p>
<p>MBW, based in Columbus, Ohio, is the manufacturer of Mrs. Butterworth's syrup and pancake mix products.</p>
<p>The agreement also includes Country Kitchen syrup marketed at retail in the United States, export syrup products and foodservice products with the exception of syrup marketed in foodservice channels under the Kraft trademark. Revenues for products in the deal totaled more than $100 million in 1996.  </p>
<p>The sale does not include any manufacturing facilities, although most manufacturing equipment will be transferred. Other terms of the agreement were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Kraft said the sale is expected to be completed by early July pending approval of the Philip Morris board of directors and regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;Our decision to sell our syrups business is part of our ongoing effort to manage our business to add shareholder value,&quot; Robert Morrison, chairman of Kraft Foods, said in a statement. &quot;This is a strong portfolio of syrup brands with high consumer awareness, but syrup is not a core category for Kraft.</p>
<p>&quot;The maple-flavored heritage of Log Cabin complements our butter-flavored syrup business and expands our presence in breakfast food products,&quot; Ian Wilson, chairman of MBW Foods, added. &quot;We will also realize benefits in manufacturing and distribution and expand our position in the foodservice distribution channel.&quot;</p>
