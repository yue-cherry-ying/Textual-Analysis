<p>Spanish bonds ended higher ahead of Sunday's political election in France, as dealers said the market was pricing in a victory of the centre-right government.</p>
<p>&quot;Our market is dependent on foreign events,&quot; said Francisco Castanera, dealer at BNP in Madrid.</p>
<p>He added that unless there was a surprise result inthe French election, the Spanish market should remain in a tight trading range ext week, with the long future moving between 115.4 and 116.15 and the 10-year cash spread locked in the 65-72 range.</p>
<p>Others added that the underlying tone remains very strong given positive economic fundamentals.</p>
<p>One of them added that with the bull run going on, people were scared to be left out.</p>
<p>&quot;People do not trust chartists anymore. They had predicted a market fall so many times, but we haven't seen it,&quot; said Jose Ramon Arechederra, trader at ABN Amro in Madrid.</p>
<p>Despite that, he added &quot;more and more money is going to the shorter end of the yield curve, in the area of three- to five-years, which is supposed to gain when it inflation data for May are announced.&quot;</p>
<p>May CPI is scheduled on June 13, and market consensus is for another drop in the level from April's 1.7 percent year-on-year.</p>
