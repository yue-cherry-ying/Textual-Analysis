<p>Greg Norman shot a second-round 65 Friday to take the clubhouse lead at nine under par while Gene Sauers was at 10 under after 17 holes as thunderstorms again disrupted the St. Jude Classic.</p>
<p>After several rain delays during the afternoon, play at the par-71 TPC at Southwind was suspended in the early evening with 103 players still to complete their second round on Saturday morning -- 36 of them yet to begin the round.</p>
<p>Heavy rain and thunder on the first day had meant the loss of just over three hours of play forcing 78 players, including Norman, to conclude their first round early Friday before beginning the second round.</p>
<p>In his first round, Norman, making his first visit to Memphis in 12 years, was lying at three under after 14 holes but parred the final four to finish with 68, three behind American Robert Damron.</p>
<p>Looking relaxed but focused, Norman said he hardly touched a club in the week since missing the cut in the U.S. Open. In fact, the Australian resident of Florida spent the majority of his time jetting on business to Tucson, Arizona; San Francisco; and Vail, Colorado.</p>
<p>&quot;I came in here, didn't see David (Leadbetter, his coach), didn't do much practice because I knew there wasn't much wrong with my game,&quot; said the former world number one.</p>
<p>&quot;Today I just did a lot of the right things. I drove the ball well, hit a lot of greens and though I didn't make a lot of putts, I made enough putts to make a good score.&quot;</p>
<p>Norman also said he was suffering no ill effects of a muscle strain in his back, an injury that forced him to withdraw from Wednesday's pro-am event.</p>
<p>&quot;I had a session in the fitness trailer on Wednesday night so I knew I would be fine come Thursday,&quot; Norman said.</p>
<p>Tommy Armour and Jay Don Blake were a stroke behind Norman at eight under after finishing their rounds. Charlie Rymer also was at eight under through 14 holes.</p>
<p>Peter Jordan, Michael Bradley and Skip Kendall were at seven under in the clubhouse.</p>
<p>Damron was unable to start his second round and remained at six under, part of a seven-way tie that also included Fuzzy Zoeller, in the clubhouse, and Zimbabwe's Nick Price, after two holes of the second round.</p>
