<p>The U.S. manufacturing sector grew at a faster rate in March than in February, as the overall economy continued to grow for the 71st consecutive month, the nation's purchasing executives said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The National Association of Purchasing Management, whose members buy raw materials for the nation's factories, said its index of maufacturing activity rose to 55.0 in March from 53.1 in February.</p>
<p>However, the group's price index fell to 50.9 percent from 55.1 percent, reflecting a slower rate of inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;The manufacturing sector grew more rapidly in March than in February with new orders indicating an increase in growth and production continuing to grow, but at a slower rate,&quot; said Norbert Ore, chair of the group's business survey committee.</p>
<p>&quot;The majority of purchasing executives' comments on business conditions in March were more optimistic than in February, with many members indicating strength in the markets,&quot; said Ore, who is a director of purchasing at Sonoco Products Co.</p>
<p>A reading above 50 percent indicates growth in a particular category, while one below 50 percent reflects contraction.</p>
<p>The trade group said its production index fell to 56.8 percent in March from 59.5 percent in February. Its new orders index grew to 60.3 percent from 57.7 percent. The backlog of orders index showed a greater volume of unfilled orders for the second time in nine months, with the index rising to 51.5 percent.</p>
<p>NAPM said its supplier deliveries index rose to 53.6 percent, as deliveries slowed from February's 51.3 percent rate. Its employment index grew for the first time after 24 consecutive months of cuts in manufacturing jobs, rising to 51.6 percent in March from 45.4 percent in February.</p>
<p>The inventories index rose to 43.7 percent from 41.2 percent in February. As for customers' inventories of products bought from the purchasers' organisations, 13 percent of respondents felt they were too high, unchanged from February. However, 20 percent felt they were too low, down from 24 percent in February; and 67 percent thought they were about right, vs. 63 percent in February.</p>
<p>NAPM's new export orders index surged to 57.3 percent and has remained above 50 percent for the past 13 months, it said. Imports of materials by manufacturers declined as the imports index fell below 50 percent to 48.8 percent in March.</p>
<p>Fourteen of the 20 manufacturing industries reported an improvement in March, including petroleum; textiles; leather; rubber and plastics; industrial and commercial equipment and computers; jewelry, toys, sporting goods and musical instruments. The rest were fabricated metals; chemicals; food; primary metals; transportation and equipment; glass, stone and aggregate; electronic components and equipment; and wood and wood products.</p>
