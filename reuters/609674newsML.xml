<p>The Indian rupee was steady against the dollar in both the forward and spot markets in late morning trade Friday, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the rupee opened marginally down against the forward dollar but was steady at the lower level.</p>
<p>November-delivery dollars were quoted at a premium of 87/90 paise against the previous clsoe of 86/89, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Forward premiums were marginally up in anticipation of higher call money rates,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>He said the announcement of a 30 billion rupee three-year federal government bond auction for May 28 had led to fears liquidity will tighten and pushed premiums up slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;But call money looks fairly stable and forward premiums have stabilised at levels marginally higher from the last close,&quot; the dealer said. &quot;The market is quite steady with demand and supply evenly matched.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said the rupee was steady in the spot market with most of the trade between 35.7750 and 35.7775 per dollar.</p>
<p>The rupee opened Thursday at 35.77/78, up from Wednesday's close of 35.790/795.</p>
<p>The forex market was largely inactive on Thursday as banks in the commercial capital of Bombay and some other centres were closed for a local holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;So far the Reserve Bank of India has not come to the market,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;In their absence the rupee will drift up gently on strong dollar supply and light demand.&quot;</p>
<p>In latest deals, the dollar was quoted 35.775/785 rupees.</p>
