<p>Yields on Kazakh three- and six-month Treasury bills could edge down further at auctions next week due to active buying by foreigners, despite recent falls in yields, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan's finance ministry is offering 700 million tenge of six-month MKM discount T-bills on Monday and 550 million tenge of three-month paper on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The yield on three-month T-bills fell to 18.02 percent annual at their last auction on May 6 from 20.04 percent on April 29. Demand was around 2.22 billion tenge against 600 million on offer.</p>
<p>The yield on six-month paper fell to 22.97 percent at the last auction on April 28 from 24.52 percent on April 15. Demand was 2.97 billion against 650 million on offer.</p>
<p>Foreign investors are entitled to buy just 15 percent of three-month T-bill issues and 30 percent of six-month paper but dealers said their aggressive participation in auctions was one of the main reasons behind steadily falling yields.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation on the T-bill market is such that T-bill yields are programmed to continue falling. The tenge rate is stable, and yields of 18-19 percent annual suit foreign investors,&quot; an Agroprombank dealer said.</p>
<p>The tenge has been fluctuating at around 75 per dollar since January.</p>
<p>Economy Minister Umirzak Shukeyev told a recent cabinet meeting the government was planning further falls of T-bill yields to stimulate investment credits to the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;It (lower yields) is very good for the government which wants local banks to finance the economy and not speculate on T-bill yields... But on the other hand, the percentage of overdue debts to banks on such (investment) loans is too high,&quot; the Agroprombank dealer said.</p>
<p>But the strong foreign buying is upsetting some locals.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreigners are too aggressively slashing down yields,&quot; said Denis Fedosenko of Kazkommertsbank.</p>
<p>Another dealer said several large Kazakh banks, facing tough foreign competition, were planning to transfer their operations to other T-bill markets within the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Yet some dealers gave other reasons for lower yields.</p>
<p>&quot;I think, too many tenge on the market is the reason,&quot; said Lyudmila Pogulyayeva of ABN AMRO Bank Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Last week the National Bank repaid several note and T-bills totalling around 2.5 billion tenge but held no auctions of its short-term notes issued to sterilise the money supply and support the tenge.</p>
<p>And dealers said the falling yield trend could be stopped and even reversed if the National Bank announced a new series of note auctions early next week.</p>
<p>&quot;Yields could even edge up, if the National Bank announced a large note issue next week,&quot; Fedosenko said.</p>
