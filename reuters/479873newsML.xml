<p>Israel's business community voiced dismay on Tuesday at an Arab call for an economic boycott against the Jewish state but said Arab countries had just as much to lose if they carried it out.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not happy about this boycott because I prefer to have normal relations with my neighbours,&quot; Mandy Barak, director of international affairs at Israel's Federation of Chambers of Commerce, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Arab foreign ministers, angry at the building of a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, urged suspending normalisation with Israel while &quot;maintaining&quot; and &quot;reactivating&quot; the primary Arab boycott at a meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>The recommendation covers Mauritania, Morocco, Oman and Tunisia -- states which have swapped low-level offices with Israel amid burgeoning Middle East peace moves since 1994 -- as well as Qatar, which hosts an Israeli trade office.</p>
<p>&quot;If they close, it will be very bad for us. It will be very bad for them as well because they didn't open these interest offices just to be nice to Israel...It brought investors not just to Israel but also to them,&quot; Barak said.</p>
<p>The decision does not affect Egypt and Jordan -- the only Arab states to sign peace treaties with Israel -- or the Palestinians whose 1993 peace deal with Israel fostered official hopes for a new Middle East.</p>
<p>Experts said direct trade betweeen Israel and Arab states was in any event limited -- and the Arab ministers had not revived boycotts on foreign companies doing business with Israel or on companies doing business with those companies.</p>
<p>But they said the Arab call would sour the atmosphere, recalling the nearly half-century-long economic boycott that began against Jews in Palestine even before Israel's 1948 creation. They said it could have a psychological effect on some potential foreign investors.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of people out there who don't know or may be hesitant when they hear the boycott is back on. That could send a message to a lot of middle-sized companies,&quot; said Harry Wall, director of Israel's Anti-Defamation League office which for years fought the boycott.</p>
<p>&quot;The reality is the Arab world did not punish American companies all throughout the boycott. If you are big enough, you don't worry about these things -- it's the middle-sized company. I am looking at it more from a psychological aspect, not the economic aspect,&quot; Wall said.</p>
<p>Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu, the right-wing prime minister elected 10 months ago whose groundbreaking last month on the Jewish settlement plunged peace talks into crisis, called it &quot;absurd&quot; for Arabs to think they could reimpose a boycott.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel is a technological power with many, many ties with many countries,&quot; Netanyahu told Israel Radio on Monday.</p>
<p>Gil Feiler, a professor of Middle East economics, said foreign companies had shown a readiness to trade and invest in Israel in the era of peace -- and Arab states also stood to benefit.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very important for the Arab countries to create a good atmosphere as well, because foreign companies when they are coming to the Middle East, they don't want to come only for one little country -- they want to sell to all of the region,&quot; Feiler told Reuters.</p>
<p>Israel's import market is larger on a per capita basis than all of the Arab world combined, even with a population 1/50th the size. Israel last year imported about $30 billion in goods compared with $140 billion for the Arab world, he said.</p>
<p>But Feiler, whose company Info-Prod Research sets up joint ventures between foreigners and Middle East countries, said: &quot;What we need in Israel is a good atmosphere to attract more investors from the West and from the Far East.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he hoped even Japanese companies, which for decades shunned Israel for fear of losing Arab markets and oil supplies, would keep on coming to Israel as they had in recent years.</p>
