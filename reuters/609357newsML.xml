<title>USA: FCOJ futures settle weaker and at lows.</title>
<headline>FCOJ futures settle weaker and at lows.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>FCOJ futures closed weaker and towards the bottom of its recent range, signaling lower near-term prices, market analysts said.</p>
<p>The failure to sustain gains made earlier in the week sent benchmark July to a low of 81.55 cents, just over support pegged at 79.80 cents.</p>
<p>The spot month closed down 1.10 at 81.60 cents per lb, having traded from 82.90 to 81.55 cents. Second-position September ended 0.90 lower at 83.75, while the rest of the board finished 1.95 to 1.00 lower.</p>
<p>Analysts said the weak fundamental picture is keeping the market under significant pressure, even amid scattered talk of a pickup in demand.</p>
<p>But the Florida Citrus Processors Association reported FCOJ movement into trade channels for the week ended May 17 at 4,911,368 gallons compared with 4,659,784 gallons last week.</p>
<p>Despite the slight increase, the overall movement remains unimpressive.</p>
<p>&quot;When one considers the build in stocks generated by this year's record harvest and combine this with an expected record 1997/98 Brazilian harvest, it is no wonder that the market continues to find difficulty sustaining rallies,&quot; Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes, said in a weekly citrus comment.</p>
<p>An estimated 1,000 lots changed hands on the day, compared with Thursday's official 3,472 lots.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its next Florida crop estimate on June 12. The last report put the crop at a record 224.2 million 90-lb boxes, and yields at 1.58 gallons per box.</p>
