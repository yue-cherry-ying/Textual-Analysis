<p>NWE high sulphur barge prices softened on Tuesday in a market that gained momentum later in the day. Other grades were very quiet.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges traded at $85 and $86 fob ARA, off slightly from last Thursday. Bunker demand picked up with enquiries for 40,000 tonnes of material reported.</p>
<p>Some majors were seen short and unable to meet demand.</p>
<p>&quot;If we see bullish API figures from the States it will give prices a kick upwards,&quot; said one trader. &quot;Right now there are more buyers than sellers.&quot;</p>
<p>Low sulphur barge markets were stagnant.</p>
<p>Big sellers were unwilling to move from offers of slightly below $98 fob ARA and buyers pegged bids at $96.</p>
<p>Cargo markets were very quiet with traders in a hesitant post-Easter mood and unsure of how far the fall in crude will go. Prices were notionally steady.</p>
<p>A large cargo of low sulphur cracked was rumoured being fixed for the Far East from northern Europe, tightening the market, but this could not be confirmed.</p>
