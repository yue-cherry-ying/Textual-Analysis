<p>British exporters, who have suffered from sterling's dramatic appreciation over the last nine months, believe the impact on overseas sales can only worsen, industry leaders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Figures for manufacturing output showing a 0.1 percent dip in month-on-month output for March may mark the beginning of a downturn in output. Output is only 1.4 percent higher than it was a year ago, but if the pound keeps climbing, that may soon look like healthy growth.</p>
<p>BTR Plc, Britain's biggest conglomerate, illustrated on Thursday the painful effects of sterling's 19 percent rise since last August.</p>
<p>BTR shares tumbled after it said sterling's strength would cut first half 1997 sales by 300 million sterling ($487 million) if the currency stayed at current high levels.</p>
<p>A swathe of leading British companies have complained  about the pound's rally over the last nine months and industry experts say it could get worse.</p>
<p>&quot;The volume effects (of an appreciation in sterling) on exports and imports do take time to come through,&quot; said Sudhir Junankar, associate director of economic analysis at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).</p>
<p>While exporters' prices are immediately pushed up by an appreciating currency, companies try to keep their market share by cutting prices in the hope that the pound's rally will not last.</p>
<p>Equally, foreign customers will not instantly cut their orders in response to a rising currency. Demand will wither only if prices rise over the medium term.</p>
<p>&quot;It could take up to one year depending on the company,&quot; Junankar said of the lag between sterling appreciation and the effect feeding into output.</p>
<p>&quot;We have evidence from our surveys that companies are cutting their export prices in overseas markets in an attempt to alleviate the downward pressure on their orders,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sweetener group Tate &amp; Lyle Plc is another British exporter to have felt the pain, reporting sharply lower first half profits on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The outturn for the second half of the year ... is likely to be affected by the continued strength of sterling.&quot; chairman Sir Neil Shaw said in a statement.</p>
<p>Tate normally exports around 50,000 tonnes of sugar a year but this had fallen to around zero, said company secretary John Hunter. &quot;The European buyer can get it cheaper elsewhere, it's as simple as that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Junankar said some industries stood to suffer more than others. He cited the chemicals and steel export industries as examples of those which could be worst hit.</p>
<p>A spokesman for British Steel said sterling fluctuations had a significant effect on the company's profits. &quot;Eighty percent of our sales are affected by the strong pound,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>For every 10 pfennigs sterling appreciates against the mark, British Steel's profits fall by 100 million sterling, he said. Since August last year, the pound has leapt by more than 50 pfennigs.</p>
<p>Not even a a dramatic plunge by the pound on Thursday, sparked by a news agency report that Britain would re-enter Europe's exchange rate mechanism at a central rate of 2.50 marks, would help Britain's beleaguered manufacturers unless the downturn proves to be sustained.</p>
<p>The pound dropped more than five pfennigs on that rumour but after hot denials from Treasury officials, it recovered its poise and clawed back up. ($ = 0.616 British Pounds)</p>
