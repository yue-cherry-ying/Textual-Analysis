<title>JAPAN: Japan MOF to support NCB reform along with BOJ.</title>
<headline>Japan MOF to support NCB reform along with BOJ.</headline>

<p>Japan's Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a news conference on Tuesday that the ministry will extend full support to Nippon Credit Bank Ltd's restructuring plan in cooperation with the Bank of Japan (BOJ).</p>
<p>He said in a statement that the Ministry of Finance on Tuesday asked the BOJ and a special body administering a fund to wind up failed finance firms for permission to use the fund to buy preferred stock to be issued by NCB.</p>
<p>MOF believes the resulting capital increase in NCB, as well as NCB's disposal of problem loans, &quot;will substantially improve NCB's business foundation and will contribute to the stability of financial systems both at home and abroad,&quot; Mitsuzuka said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The ministry believes that NCB has sufficient potential to restructure itself and has taken such a step because failure to deal with the problem could cause major financial instability both within Japan and overseas,&quot; Mitsuzuka said in his statement.</p>
<p>After reading the statement, he told a news conference that he applauds the moves by NCB, as well as a merger plan announced earlier on Tuesday by two Hokkaido-based banks, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd and Hokkaido Bank Ltd.</p>
<p>He said that the credibility of NCB in the financial markets and trust in the safety of NCB's debentures would quickly be regained as a result of the increase in capital.</p>
<p>NCB has informed the ministry that it plans to ask long-term credit banks, banks with major shareholdings in NCB and life and non-life insurers with subordinated loans to NCB to buy new shares in the bank to offset a reduction in capital resulting from bad-loan disposal, Mitsuzuka said.</p>
<p>NCB, itself one of Japan's long-term credit banks, announced earlier on Tuesday a major restructuring programme that will mean the loss of 600 jobs, the sale of prime real estate and a withdrawal from major overseas markets.</p>
<p>The troubled bank also said that it would write off 460 billion yen in bad loans for the 1996/97 financial year that ended on Monday and post a parent current loss of 350 billion yen for the period.</p>
