<title>USA: Cosby case prosecutors will not seek death penalty.</title>
<headline>Cosby case prosecutors will not seek death penalty.</headline>
<dateline>LOS ANGELES 1997-05-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prosecutors said on Friday that they would not seek the death penalty against the man accused of murdering the only son of entertainer Bill Cosby.</p>
<p>Mihkhail Markhasev, an 18-year-old Ukrainian immigrant charged with the murder of Ennis Cosby on Jan. 16, smiled as the announcement was made at a brief hearing. He also leaned over to his lawyer and appeared to say, &quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p>The Los Angeles District Attorney's office &quot;has decided not to pursue the death penalty,&quot; Assistant District Attorney Anne Ingalls told Judge John Reid.</p>
<p>California law allows for &quot;special circumstances,&quot; or capital punishment, when a murder is committed during a robbery. Police have said they believe Markhasev was trying either to steal Cosby's expensive Mercedes-Benz car or to rob him to get money for drugs.</p>
<p>Cosby was shot while changing a flat tire by the side of a Los Angeles freeway. Markhasev pleaded not guilty at an earlier arraignment.</p>
<p>Cosby's parents, Bill and Camille, said in a brief statement released by their publicist: &quot;We support the District Attorney's decision -- onward to jurisprudence.&quot;</p>
<p>At Friday's hearing, which lasted barely one minute, Judge Reid ruled that the murder trial will take place in Santa Monica. He scheduled the next hearing for June 12.</p>
<p>Outside the courtroom Markhasev's court-appointed attorney, Henry Hall, told reporters the prosecutors made &quot;absolutely the right decision.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a case that but for the publicity value would in all circumstances be a life (sentence) case,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hall said he had not yet decided whether to seek to move the trial out of Los Angeles County entirely.</p>
