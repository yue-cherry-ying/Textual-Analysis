<title>KENYA: Kenya sets voter registration ahead of election.</title>
<headline>Kenya sets voter registration ahead of election.</headline>
<dateline>NAIROBI 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Kenya's electoral commission has set May 19 to June 22 for voter registration, the first official indication of the timing of this year's general election.</p>
<p>National Electoral Commission Chairman Zacchaeus Chesoni told reporters on Wednesday registration would be followed by a one-month period of verification and lodging of any complaints.</p>
<p>The registration of voters marks the beginning in earnest of the run-up to the general election. At the end of the verification period, expected in the last week of July, Chesoni would be expected to announce the dates for the election.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometime this year, the current Seventh Parliament will be dissolved. Kenyans will then be required to vote in another parliament within 90 days of the dissolution,&quot; the independent Daily Nation newspaper noted on Thursday.</p>
<p>Under Kenyan laws, Chesoni must allow at least 21 days of campaining by all political parties for parliamentary seats and the presidency. This means the earliest date for the election would be late August.</p>
<p>But Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has said the current parliament will serve a full five-year term, suggesting that the elections will be held sometime in December. The last election, which returned Moi to power, was held on December 29, 1992.</p>
<p>Moi has already launched his campaign, touring so-called development projects around Kenya while reminding potential voters that it is an election year and he is a candidate.</p>
<p>Ideological and ethnic divisions in the opposition give Moi a clear lead in his bid to take the presidency for a final term.</p>
