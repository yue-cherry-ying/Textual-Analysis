<p>REID WON'T PREVENT COLSTON FROM ACTING AS PRESIDENT</p>
<p>The Senate President, Margaret Reid, will not move to prevent Deputy President, Mal Colston, acting in her position while she's overseas.</p>
<p>The Federal Opposition wrote to Senator Reid, requesting the position be filled by another senior Liberal Senator, because of ongoing investigations into Senator Colston's use of travel allowances.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Senator Reid, says there's no room for her to manoeuvre on the issue, and she will follow convention of the Deputy acting for the President.</p>
<p>He says Senator Colston will only fulfill statutory obligations, and the investigation into his use travel alowance will remain Senator Reid's responsibility.</p>

<p>PM HOLDS TALKS WITH CHINESE PRESIDENT</p>

<p>TIBET COUNCIL UNIMPRESSED WITH PM'S EFFORTS</p>
<p>The Australia Tibet Council says it's disapointed the Prime Minister, John Howard, didn't do more to advance Tibet's struggle for independence.</p>
<p>The Council's reaction follows Mr Howard's acknowledgement, for the first time, of China's sovereignty of Tibet.</p>
<p>National Coordinator Paul Bourke, says, the acknowledgement merely restates the status quo in respect of the Tibet question. He says it would have been more useful for the Prime Minister to have brought up the Dalai Lama's call for meaningful negotiation.</p>

<p>CONCERNS OVER AIR SAFETY</p>
<p>There are concerns that the de-regulation of air service operators could lead a reduction in air safety.</p>
<p>The calls come as the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal reviews the licencing of airline operators.</p>
<p>A submission to the Tribunal by Scone Council, in the New South Wales Upper Hunter, says increased competition could lead to cost-cutting measures by small sized operators and a subsequent decrease in safety.</p>
<p>The Council's General Manager John Gaudry says there's also the fear that competition could jeopardize the viability of existing services.</p>

<p>CABINET HOLDS OFF VIDEOS DECISION</p>
<p>Federal Cabinet has put off making a decision about changing the availability of x-rated videos.</p>
<p>Before the last election, the Coalition promised to ban x-rated videos, which show non-violent sexual material.</p>
<p>Cabinet has discussed the issue today, but has deferred a decision until it has more information.</p>
<p>No date has been set for Cabinet to reconsider the issue.</p>

<p>PENSIONER APPEARS OVER SEX CHARGES</p>
<p>An aged pensioner has appeared in a Sydney Court charged with more than 700 sex offences, allegedly involving his children and step children.</p>
<p>The 69-year-old man from the New South Wales Central West has been refused bail on charges of buggery, rape, indecent assault and carnal knowledge, with the matter adjourned until May.</p>
<p>The Court heard that the allegations date back 40 years, with the most recent allegation arising from 1971.</p>

<p>AUSSIE RULES UMPIRE REALLY ENFORCES THE &quot;RULES&quot;</p>
<p>An Australian Rules umpire in the Northern Territory has guaranteed he'll be treated with even greater respect by players in future.</p>
<p>The umpire, an off-duty police officer, was in charge of a football game in a local Aussie Rules carnival in Central Australia, when he recognised a youth playing in the match as an alleged escapee.</p>
<p>The 14-year-old allegedly escaped from custody last month while being transported to the Alice Springs Law Courts for a hearing.</p>
<p>After recognising him, Acting Sergeant Dave Price arrested the youth at half-time, and held him until other officers arrived.</p>
<p>The Sergeant missed the rest of the game, but returned to umpire in later matches, apparently with much increased respect. - - - -</p>
<p>CALL FOR NATIONAL KOALA ACT</p>
<p>The Australian Koala Foundation says a national koala act is needed to provide protection for the koala and its habitat.</p>
<p>Executive Director, Deborah Tabart, says a draft national koala conservation strategy released last year is inadequate and vague in its aims to secure koala habitats.</p>
<p>Ms Tabart claims the strategy supports land clearing and expects community groups to undo the damage from urbanisation.</p>
<p>She says National Koala legislation would prevent development in the first place.</p>
