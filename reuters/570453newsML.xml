<p>Yemen is doing all it can to limit the smuggling of African rhinoceros horn, a Yemeni official said on Thursday in response to renewed claims that the poor Arab country plays a key role in the illicit trade.</p>
<p>The horn is prized in Yemen for use in the handles of traditional daggers known as jambiyas.</p>
<p>Yemen &quot;has exerted all possible efforts to limit the smuggling of rhino horns into Yemen within the framework of our commitment to carry out the ban,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said Yemen had &quot;asked the international community to cooperate in an effective way to prevent the export of this from countries where this rare animal lives&quot;.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the wildlife trade monitoring organisation TRAFFIC said Yemen played a central role in illicit rhino horn trade, worsening the endangered species' perilous status in Africa.</p>
<p>TRAFFIC estimated at least 75 kg (165 lb) of rhino horn had been smuggled into Yemen every year between 1994 and 1996. &quot;This amount could originate from up to 25 rhinoceroses,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The Yemeni official said the government &quot;is ready to cooperate with any internatioal body or country to help preserve the lives of the remaining animals&quot;.</p>
<p>Yemen has not joined CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, according to TRAFFIC -- the wildlife trade monitoring programme of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the World Conservation Union (IUCN), both based in Gland, Switzerland.</p>
<p>International commercial trade in rhinos and rhino products has been banned under CITES since 1977, but member countries will meet next month to examine the state of rhineroceros species and problems of continued illegal trade.</p>
<p>There are fewer than 10,000 rhinos remaining in the wild in Africa, compared to 70,000 in 1970, TRAFFIC said.</p>
