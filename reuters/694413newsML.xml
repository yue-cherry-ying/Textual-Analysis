<p>Future Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa on Saturday sought to calm fears that Chinese troops would be used against the local population after the British handover, and he brushed aside sniping from London.</p>
<p>A row with the outgoing colonial power over Beijing's decision to send in 4,000 troops backed by armour, helicopters and warships just hours after the handover at midnight (1600 GMT) next Monday soured the mood for an end-of-empire party.</p>
<p>But Washington stayed well clear of the argument, and Singapore elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew urged the United States not to clash with China over Hong Kong.</p>
<p>As British heir to the throne Prince Charles arrived for handover festivities, and the colonial legislature closed its doors for the last time with the cry &quot;the King is dead, long live the King&quot;, Tung defended China's decision.</p>
<p>He said Beijing had every right to assert its new sovereignty by posting People's Liberation Army forces to Hong Kong, and was adamant the troops could not move against the local population without his order.</p>
<p>&quot;They will not, they cannot,&quot; he said in an interview with the U.S. television network NBC.</p>
<p>Tung praised the PLA as &quot;a very well disciplined people, a very well disciplined army&quot; and added that once Hong Kong people got to know them &quot;they will be part of our community&quot;.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, arriving with Charles on a chartered British Airways Boeing 747, scolded China on the deployment, which is likely to ignite painful memories of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;We regret the scale at which the initial deployment is being made and in particular we regard the provision of armoured personnel carriers as unecessary and inappropriate,&quot; Cook told reporters.</p>
<p>Cook later told Hong Kong Radio before meeting Tung that China must live up to its pledges, made under a U.N.-registered treaty, to preserve Hong Kong's freedoms and way of life. Any violations would be referred to the world body.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's last British Governor Chris Patten on Friday described the troop decision as &quot;appalling&quot;.</p>
<p>In an unusual gesture of friendship, the Union Jack and Chinese flags were flown side-by-side over the cockpit of the prince's aircraft after it landed.</p>
<p>Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong are particularly outraged at the prospect of a column of 21 armoured vehicles rumbling across the border. Also arriving will be six helicopters and a number of warships. Margaret Thatcher, who signed the 1984 Sino-British agreement to hand back Britain's last major colonial outpost to China and has returned for handover festivities, indicated she shared the concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;The 4,000 seem to be coming in with armoured personnel carriers and that is very unwise. After all it was that kind of carrier that was, I believe, used in Tiananmen Square,&quot; she told local television station TVB.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived in the territory on Saturday night to attend the handover celebrations. Earlier, meeting reporters in Vietnam, she had refrained from all criticism of the troops decision.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to make some judgements as we watch this,&quot; was her only comment.</p>
<p>The United States has made clear that China's handling of Hong Kong will be a bellwether for ties between the world's most powerful and most populous nations.</p>
<p>But Singapore's Lee, addressing a conference in his city state, warned that by locking horns with Beijing over Hong Kong, Washington risked cutting short a presence in the Asia-Pacific region that had underpinned stability and growth.</p>
<p>Analysts in Beijing explained the troop deployments as a crowning symbol of China's victory in erasing a century and a half of foreign humilitation. One Asian diplomat dismissed British carping as sour grapes.</p>
<p>&quot;They have acted like spoilt schoolboys who have just thrown down their bats and walked off the field,&quot; the diplomat said.</p>
<p>Prince Charles was greeted at Victoria Harbour by a 21-gun salute for his mother Queen Elizabeth's birthday before boarding the royal yacht Britannia, on which he and Patten will sail away after a night of pageantry and partying on Monday.</p>
<p>The formal midnight handover ceremony will be attended by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and a host of other dignitaries.</p>
<p>While pro-democracy leaders condemned what they saw as PLA bullying, Hong Kong villagers along the border were planning to welcome the troops with flowers and a metal plaque saying &quot;an army with power and civilization&quot;.</p>
<p>At the end of a marathon 23-hour session of the Legislative Council, to be replaced by a Beijing-picked body, its president Andrew Wong declared: &quot;The King is dead, long live the King.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Life must go on in Hong Kong and it will,&quot; he said later.</p>
<p>In his NBC interview, Tung took a swipe at pro-democracy figures who plan to disrupt the investiture of the new legislature with protests. Nobody could spoil the party.</p>
<p>&quot;If anybody feels they can achieve martyrdom they will be very disappointed,&quot; he said, without mentioning Martin Lee, the head of the Democratic Party planning the protest who is often accused by critics of having a martyr complex.</p>
<p>He told Cable News Network (CNN) there would be limits to freedom of expression.</p>
<p>&quot;Constructive criticism is always very helpful,&quot; he said. &quot;But if there is a very active involvement in pushing for the independence of Taiwan or Tibet its not acceptable.&quot;</p>
<p>Tung's office said he may miss Britain's sunset farewell party on the Victoria Harbour waterfront, complete with dragon dances, massed choirs and bagpipes -- and a farewell speech by Patten -- to greet arriving Chinese president Jiang and Prime Minister Li Peng.</p>
<p>Tung's advisers denied any snub was intended.</p>
<p>The Royal Navy, which claimed Hong Kong for Britain in the Opium Wars, won the right to pull down the flag on the colony after a tussle with other branches of the armed forces.</p>
