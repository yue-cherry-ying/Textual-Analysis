<p>International Business Machines Corp. shares rose in heavy trading Thursday as some Wall Street firms raised their price targets on the stock a day after an upbeat meeting with the computer giant's chairman.</p>
<p>IBM rose $6.875 to $169 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was among the most active issues at mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse First Boston raised its 12-month target price for IBM to $195 from $165.</p>
<p>&quot;I think management is coming out swinging for a very conservative company,&quot; said Ahmet Chopra, analyst at First Boston. &quot;They are showing a lot of confidence in their ability to deliver on a business model they have been touting for years.&quot;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner said the company has many opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a very different company today,&quot; Gerstner told analysts. &quot;We have very specific programmes to go after our competitiors' business. This was not something IBM did in the past because the consent decree made it very difficult for IBM to behave that way.&quot;</p>
<p>Gerstner reiterated that the computer giant's goal was for revenues to rise in the high single digits, unlike some high-tech companies, adding that he he called fast-growing tech companies &quot;meteors&quot; because some eventually burn up.</p>
<p>&quot;We are focused on growing shareholder value,&quot; Gerstner said. &quot;We have a model that is not the model of the meteors.&quot;</p>
<p>Prudential Securities said it expects IBM stock to hit $225, up from $190 previously, and continued to recommend buying the stock. The brokerage also raised its 1997 earnings estimates on IBM to $12.50 a share, from $12.35 a share, citing increased expense controls.</p>
<p>IBM had operating income of $1.2 billion, or $2.37 a share on revenues of $17.3 billion in the first quarter. The results surpassed most Wall Street estimates, as IBM's fastest-growing businesses offset a decline in mainframes, minicomputers and workstations.</p>
<p>IBM's revenues grew 9 percent in the first quarter, on a constant currency basis. The company had stellar growth in its services business, which rose 28 percent, amid a drop in revenue for some hardware, such as mainframe computers, minicomputers and workstations.</p>
<p>Analysts said they were impressed by IBM's focus on speed in getting its products out to market and Gerstner's aggressive attitude.</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting solidified our view that there is significant long term revenue and earnings growth opportunities which should lead to a huge stock price over the next two to three years,&quot; said John Jones, Salomon Brothers analyst, in a note to clients.</p>
<p>Jones said IBM shares should be worth $180 as the company's earnings grows by a projected 15 percent over the next few quarters.</p>
<p>IBM led a rally in blue-chip stocks as well as the high-technology sector.</p>
<p>At mid-afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average, which tumbled 140 points Wednesday, was up 124.42 points at 7,210.07.</p>
