<text>
<p>Nippon Credit Bank Ltd (NCB) said on Tuesday that it believes that its restructuring plan will restore the market's trust in the troubled Japanese bank.</p>
<p>NCB president Hiroshi Kubota told a news conference that he would remain at his post for a while in order to promote the restructuring plan.  </p>
<p>&quot;It will be necessary to take management responsibility, and I will remain at the post for the time being to promote the restructuring,&quot; Kubota told a news conference.</p>
<p>Kubota said it would be irresponsible for him to quit the post at a time when the bank is set to ask other financial firms for financial support. But he added that he wants to resign from his post after becoming confident about the implementation of the restructuring plan.</p>
<p>&quot;The restructuring plan includes what had been suggested by credit rating agencies and experts. We believe the steps will restore market confidence in the bank,&quot; he said.</p>
