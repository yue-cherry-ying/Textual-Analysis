<p>Canadian bonds opened little changed in quiet trade on Friday with a planned early close for the U.S. bond market helping to keep activity quiet, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are heading into a long weekend in the U.S. and Europe is off as well on Monday,&quot; said Rich Wylie, a fixed-income economist with TD Securities Inc. &quot;We are kind of winding things up for the weekend, probably on the earlier side today. Flows are a little bit more modest.&quot;</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond rose C$0.10 to C$111.55 to yield 7.027 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond rose 6/32 to yield 6.98 percent. The spread between the bonds was five basis points, unchanged from the close of trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;You can expect that we'll likely just track the U.S. for most what's left of the day,&quot; said Wylie. &quot;People are going to try to square up as best they can heading into the weekend and just sort of leave things until next week.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. bond market is expected to close early at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT. Monday is the Memorial Day in the U.S. and several European markets will also be closed for holidays on Monday.  </p>
<p>An official with the Toronto Bond Traders' Association said there was no early close planned for the Canadian market on Friday</p>
<p>There is no major Canadian economic data scheduled for release for the remainder of the session on Friday, though Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen will be speaking in Calgary beginning at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT.</p>
<p>In other prices, Canada's 10-year benchmark bond rose C$0.02 to C$103.50 to yield 6.495 percent. The U.S. 10-year bond rose 2/32 to yield 6.74 percent.  </p>
<p>The negative spread between the two bonds was 25 basis points, unchanged from the close of trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>The three-month cash T-bill traded with a yield of 2.91 percent against its U.S. equivalent which yielded 5.18 percent.</p>
