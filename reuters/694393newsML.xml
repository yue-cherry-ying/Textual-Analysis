<title>CROATIA: Israel central banker says shekel fall was natural.</title>
<headline>Israel central banker says shekel fall was natural.</headline>
<dateline>DUBROVNIK, Croatia 1997-06-28</dateline>

<p>Bank of Israel governor Jacob Frenkel said this week's depreciation of the shekel was a natural expression of market forces and that the bank, while monitoring the situation, would not rush to intervene.</p>
<p>Speaking after a conference on transition economies in the Croatian resort of Dubrovnik, Frenkel told Reuters late on Friday it should not be assumed the fall would continue.</p>
<p>&quot;What we have seen in the last few days has been a depreciation of the shekel and I view this as a natural expression of market forces.</p>
<p>&quot;One should not extrapolate and assume that the patterns that were in the markets last week are necessarily to continue into the foreseeable or unforeseeable future.&quot;</p>
<p>Frenkel said the Bank of Israel was determined to see the foreign exchange market develop and that this was the motivation for recent liberalisation steps.</p>
<p>Last week the central bank cut its key lending rate 1.2 percentage points to an annual 12.7 percent after the cabinet approved exchange rate reforms which widened the diagonal band in which the shekel may trade, creating more room for the currency to depreciate.</p>
<p>&quot;The very purpose of widening the exchange rate bands has not been to generate an appreciation or depreciation but rather to generate the framework within which exchange rates can find their own values and risk premia are appropriately accounted for,&quot; Frenkel said.</p>
<p>He said the main objectives of monetary policy were to achieve the inflation targets set by the government.</p>
<p>Frenkel said the bank would monitor the inflationary consequences of the shekel depreciation but said a market-induced depreciation had a different effect on prices from an administrative devaluation.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to announce a ministerial shake-up next week, in which ex-general Ariel Sharon is tipped to become finance minister.</p>
<p>Financial markets have been concerned that Sharon will not stick to budget targets, though Netanyahu said on Thursday he would ensure the government maintained fiscal restraint.</p>
<p>Frenkel said the bank would cooperate with the finance ministry, whoever was appointed minister, to meet government targets.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the new minister of finance will have his hands full in making sure that the budgetary stance will continue to be responsible and that the budget targets set by the government will be met,&quot; Frenkel said.</p>
<p>The budget deficit should not exceed 2.8 percent of GDP in 1997 and be reduced further in subsequent years.</p>
<p>&quot;This issue goes much beyond the personalities involved,&quot; Frenkel said.</p>
