<title>FRANCE: Hunger strike French ex-mayor taken to hospital.</title>
<headline>Hunger strike French ex-mayor taken to hospital.</headline>

<p>The ex-mayor of the French Riviera resort of Cannes was taken to hospital on Friday as he continued a six-day-old hunger strike to press for his release from 10 months in pre-trial custody, medical sources said.</p>
<p>Michel Mouillot, of the centre-right Union for French Democracy party, was detained last July after being placed under investigation over accusations he solicited bribes in exchange for permits to install one-arm bandits in a hotel casino.</p>
<p>Hospital sources said he refused to eat and drink and rejected any medical test.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no other example of such long pre-trial custody in political corruption cases,&quot; Mouillot's lawyer Francois Saint-Pierre said earlier this week when it became known his client had gone on a hunger strike for several days.</p>
<p>Mouillot resigned as mayor in February after the Supreme Court upheld an 18-month prison sentence he was given in a separate case for receiving a fictitious salary from a Lyon businessman. He was also barred from holding public office for five years.</p>
