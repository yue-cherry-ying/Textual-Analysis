<p>Qatar has named an ambassador to Bahrain after an agreement between the two Gulf Arab neighbours to open embassies to improve ties strained by their row over a cluster of potentially oil and gas-rich islands.</p>
<p>It was Qatar's first nomination of an ambassador to Bahrain since their independence from Britain in 1971.</p>
<p>&quot;Saad Mohammad al-Romeihi's name has been sent to the Bahraini authorities for approval to head the first Qatari diplomatic mission in Manama&quot;, a Qatari official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The nomination of Romeihi, director of Qatar's state-run television, was delivered to the foreign ministry through Bahrain's embassy in Saudi Arabia a few days ago, he said.</p>
<p>Both countries agreed last month to open embassies in a bid to improve ties strained over a row over the Gulf islands.</p>
<p>Their relations worsened last year after Bahrain arrested, tried and released two Qataris on spy charges.</p>
<p>Qatar has also accused Bahrain of masterminding a failed coup attempt in Doha last year.</p>
<p>Doha has taken the islands row to the International Court of Justice at The Hague, a move that angered Manama which prefers a regional solution through Gulf Arab or Saudi mediation.</p>
<p>Bahrain boycotted a Gulf Cooperation Council summit in Doha last December but urged its other partners in the six-nation alliance, which includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman, to try and improve bilateral tensions.</p>
