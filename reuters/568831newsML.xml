<headline>IPE says time not right for elecricity contract.</headline>

<p>International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) said Thursday the right market conditions for the launch of an electricity futures contract were not yet in place in the U.K.</p>
<p>This conclusion was reached at a meeting hosted by the Exchange on Thursday with representatives from regional electricity companies (RECs), power generators, traders and the industry regulator, the IPE said in a statement.</p>
<p>Those present at the meeting felt that while the U.K. electricity market is characterised by high price volatility and risk, a number of other preconditions for a successful futures contract --including a stable political and regulatory environment -- were yet to be met.</p>
<p>&quot;Far reaching reforms are being made in the electricity market next year, and the future development of the industry is unclear, particularly given the recent change of government,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The current pricing mechanism of the electricity Pool and its lack of demand side bidding was also cited as an obstacle to the development of the market, the IPE said.</p>
<p>&quot;The IPE would like to launch an electricity futures contract as soon as the time is right,&quot; said IPE chief executive Lynton Jones.</p>
<p>&quot;But we do not want to jeopardise the success of such a contract by premature action...when conditions allow and the industry feels the time is right, we will be prepared and ready to take the initiative.&quot;</p>
