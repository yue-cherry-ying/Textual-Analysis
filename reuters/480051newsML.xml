<p>Belgian linear bonds ended depressed on Tuesday in line with other markets, although short-dated paper found some support from the money market where yields were steady to lower, dealers said.</p>
<p>The benchmark March 2007 OLO yield rose to 6.12 percent from 6.05 percent as the Belgian market was pulled lower by other European markets in reaction to losses in U.S. Treasuries last week, when most markets closed early for the Easter break.</p>
<p>The spread over equivalent Bunds also widened to 13 basis points from nine in what one trader described as &quot;panic selling&quot; by domestic players.  </p>
<p>However, dealers said the selling pressure was mostly limited to the 10-year area and the curve actually steepened rather than the flattening that would normally be expected at the start of a rate tightening cycle.</p>
<p>Five year paper remained in demand with the yield on the March 2001 bond ending at 4.72 percent compared with 4.71 percent mid Friday's session. The 10-to-five year OLO spread widened to 140 basis points from 133 basis points on Friday.</p>
<p>Very short dated paper also weathered the U.S. inspired jitters. One trader said cash from coupon payments last week had gone to the money market for now and this was helping yields.  </p>
<p>Three month Treasury bills were sold at an average yield of 3.36 percent on Tuesday, down from 3.41 percent a week earlier. The yield on OLO 15 maturing in May 1997 ended at a little changed 3.52 percent.</p>
<p>One trader said he expected the market to take heart from U.S. NAPM data released late on Monday that showed prices in U.S. industry were under control, allowing the benchmark OLO yield move back to last week's 6.05 percent level.</p>
<p>But he did not expect any near-time recovery in the yield spread to Bunds. &quot;Last week's move to eight basis points was exaggerated...I think nine to 12 is about right,&quot; he said.</p>
