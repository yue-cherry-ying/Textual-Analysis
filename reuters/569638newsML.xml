<title>USA: Sears to keep seeking repayment pacts from customers.</title>

<p>Sears, Roebuck and Co., whose debt collection efforts in bankruptcy cases are being probed by several states, said Thursday it will keep seeking agreements for repayment from bankrupt credit-card holders.</p>
<p>Sears' practices are being reviewed by attorneys general of 25 states, the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. Three class-action suits have been filed by debtors, and four shareholder suits have been lodged against the company.</p>
<p>Sears Chairman Arthur Martinez said the retailer is scouring records from 1992 to 1997 involving 500,000 repayment agreements with credit card customers to find out how much a settlement might cost.</p>
<p>During the company's annual meeting with shareholders, Martinez said Sears still has not put a pricetag on the cost of reimbursing customers who signed the agreements that Sears has admitted improperly handling.</p>
<p>&quot;While our internal fact finding is well underway, I cannot at this point report on the ultimate outcome -- how much this might eventually affect 1997 earnings,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Hoffman Estates, Ill.,-based company has blamed &quot;flawed&quot; advice from internal legal counsel for its failure to file the pacts in bankruptcy court as required by law.</p>
<p>Sears said it is reviewing agreements with customers who bought $400 million in merchandise between 1992 and 1997.</p>
<p>The company decided to limit its review to those years because it had doubts about the quality of its records before 1991 when it consolidated its credit operations. But the company said it could be required to dig back even further before a settlement is reached.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the company will continue to seek the so-called &quot;reaffirmation agreements&quot; for payment of credit card debt from consumers who file for bankruptcy, although it will handle them properly in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;I have an old-fashioned view,&quot; Martinez said. &quot;If you take the goods, you really should pay for them.&quot;</p>
<p>Sears still expects this year to be a strong one, Martinez added. For the first quarter, earnings at the retailer rose 20 percent. &quot;We are optimistic about the balance of the year as well,&quot; Martinez told shareholders.</p>
