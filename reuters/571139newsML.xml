<p>An Asian OPEC? Well, not exactly.</p>
<p>But an influential Japanese business group is pushing for an Asian oil cartel that would oversee negotiations with Middle Eastern oil producing countries.</p>
<p>Among other things, such a cartel would use the collective buying power of Asia's booming economies to secure better oil price terms and supply security guarantees from the world's biggest producers.</p>
<p>&quot;In essence, the cartel would serve as a counter-measure to big producers, an organisation in the image of OPEC which would serve Asia's oil-consuming countries,&quot; said an official from the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai).</p>
<p>The business group has proposed the idea in a report which it submitted to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs early last month. It is awaiting a response.</p>
<p>According to the study, the body should operate under the auspices of the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and be based in Tokyo.</p>
<p>It said huge growth in oil demand in Asia meant regional players should hold talks aimed at avoiding conflicts of interests in oil purchases.</p>
<p>At the underbelly of the argument lies a changing balance of power among Asia's major oil importers, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot more competition on the demand side in Asia than there was ten years ago,&quot; said Paul Horsnell, head of studies in Asia/Middle East relations at Britain's Oxford Institute of Energy Economics.</p>
<p>He said some APEC members, like the United States, would be against such a cartel, but it would benefit Asia's tiger economies, and especially Japan, the region's largest importer.</p>
<p>&quot;(South) Korean demand has quadrupled to more than two million barrels per day, and China is on the verge of huge growth in imports,&quot; Horsnell said.</p>
<p>&quot;Together with Japan, that represents a lot of new competition which would spur prices higher,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Some industry participants consider the cartel's chances unfavourable at best.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not something Middle East producers are going to take seriously at this point,&quot; said an official from Iran's state National Iranian Oil Company.</p>
<p>But the cartel's Japanese proponents are more optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;We are eager to hear the response of the government ministries, but obviously the final approval of such a process would have to come from the member countries of APEC,&quot; the Keizai Doyukai official said.</p>
<p>He emphasised that the cartel would focus on negotiations with strictly Middle Eastern oil producers, not all of OPEC.</p>
<p>In addition to Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, the eleven-member Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) includes Indonesia, Venezuela, Algeria, Nigeria.</p>
<p>APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.</p>
