<headline>US's Summers - IMF, World Bank should aid Russia more.</headline>

<p>A senior U.S. official on Tuesday urged both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to step up their efforts to help Russia.</p>
<p>In a speech to the U.S.-Russia Business Council, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers also argued that Moscow had to do more to help itself, including fixing its tax system and fighting crime and corruption.</p>
<p>The IMF, which last year agreed to a $10 billion, three-year credit with Russia, has held up loan disbursements in recent months as Moscow has failed to live up to economic conditions agreed with the Fund.</p>
<p>IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus is in Moscow this week meeting with a new team of Russian ministers led by reformer Anatoly Chubais.</p>
<p>&quot;The IMF should use the oppurtunity of a new economic team and new Fund program to make a fresh start in defining a program strategy for Russia,&quot; Summers said. &quot;Camdessus' visit to Russia this week represents an important signal that the Fund intends to seize the oppurtunity.&quot;</p>
<p>The Treasury official was even more pointed in his call on the World Bank to do more to help Russia.  </p>
<p>&quot;I call on the World Bank to now take the lead and greatly increase its role in Russian reforms,&quot; Summers told the group.</p>
<p>He said the bank was clearly ready to do so and should now &quot;greatly expand&quot; the scope of its activities to provide $2 billion in additional loans this year.</p>
<p>He said the bank should examine areas of fiscal management, social protection and programs in areas such as agriculture and power.</p>
<p>But he made clear that Russia must also act to solve its own problems including passing an array of legal, regulatory and investment policy reforms where property rights are clear and enforced and risk-taking is rewarded.  </p>
<p>Summers also called upon Russia to further develop its capital markets, saying that Russians still invest far more abroad than they bring in at home, estimating capital flight at $10 billion per year.</p>
<p>Summers also said that it was further necessary to integrate Russia into the world market including efforts to bring the country into the World Trade Organization next year.</p>
<p>&quot;This is important for us and for Russia because trade liberalization is fundamental to achieving sustained growth in Russia,&quot; Summers said.  </p>
<p>Speaking to reporters following his remarks to the business group, Summers said he did not believe that investor confidence in Russia had been hurt by the delay in an agreement with the IMF.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you have to look at what's happened in the Russian stockmarket and in Russian markets to say that I don't think at this point we have a problem with damaged investor confidence,&quot; Summers said.</p>
<p>He said that when the time is right and suitable conditions are in place, the IMF program with Russia should resume, but he gave no indication when he thought this might occur.</p>
