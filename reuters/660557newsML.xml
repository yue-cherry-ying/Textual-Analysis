<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned consumers Thursday not to buy and eat hummus and other foods produced by Cedar's Mediterranean Foods, Inc., of New Hampshire.</p>
<p>The FDA said the products may be contaminated with listeria monocytogenes, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in infants, frail or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>Even healthy individuals could suffer short-term symptoms including high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, the FDA said. Listeria infection could also cause miscarriages and stillbirths.</p>
<p>Hummus is a Middle Eastern paste made from crushed chickpeas, seasoned with garlic.</p>
<p>The agency said Cedar's Mediterranean was recalling all of its hummus dips and salad products, which were distributed to retail stores across the country.</p>
<p>The FDA said it learned of several unconfirmed reports of serious illness associated with these products and was working with local and state authorities to investigate and assess the scope of the problem.</p>
<p>The problem was discovered after laboratory sampling by New York state authorities detected the presence of listeria monocytogenes in several varieties of Cedar's hummus dips.</p>
<p>An inspection of the firm's production facilities indicated a number of sanitation problems, the FDA said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>The firm has agreed to stop food production until the problems can be fully corrected.</p>
<p>Most of Cedar's line consists of a variety of hummus and salad sold in eight ounce and 16 ounce clear plastic packages under the Cedar's brand label. Other hummus and salad dips marketed under the &quot;Vita&quot; and &quot;Mr. Hummus&quot; label were also produced by Cedar's and may have been exposed to contamination.</p>
<p>No comment was immediately available from the company.</p>
<p>Consumers should avoid eating any Cedar's products and should return these products to the place of purchase for a full refund, the FDA said.</p>
