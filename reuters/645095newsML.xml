<p>British Lions centre Scott Gibbs has been cited for an alleged punch in the British Lions' 35-30 defeat to Northern Transvaal on Saturday.</p>
<p>Gibbs, who came on as a replacement centre in the second half, is alleged to have punched winger Grant Esterhuizen in a tackle.</p>
<p>A three-man committee appointed by the South African Rugby Football Union will view a video of the match and decide if Gibbs has a case to answer.</p>
<p>The defeat ended the Lions' run of four successive victories in South Africa and coach Ian McGeechan blamed errors for the loss.</p>
<p>&quot;We made far too many mistakes and we had a very casual first half. You can't give a side like Northerns an 11-point start,&quot; said McGeechan, who saw his side 11-0 down after 22 minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;We gave away the ball too easily and didn't make them win it. Just when we were getting our momentum in the second half, building our confidence and applying pressure by not giving the ball away, they scored the interception try. It came at a vital time.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lions had clawed their way back to 25-20 after trailing 25-7 before Northerns centre Danie van Schalkwyk picked off a pass from Gregor Townsend to score under the posts.</p>
<p>&quot;We never had the ball for any length of time in their half and we made too many mistakes so we never created any attacking opportunities,&quot; said captain Martin Johnson.</p>
<p>The Lions next meet Gauteng Lions in Johannesburg on Wednesday.</p>
