<title>UK: ZINC ZOOMS, FULFILLS BULLISH EXPECTATIONS.</title>

<p>Zinc prices rumbled to 4-1/2 year highs on Thursday, spurred on by fresh investment fund buying on the back of good demand and shrinking stocks.</p>
<p>The price of three months zinc futures rocketed to a high of $1,328 per tonne by midday on the London Metal Exchange (LME), from $1,287 when business ended on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Metals analysts said the price leap was no surprise, considering zinc's bullish fundamental background, and forecast further gains in future.</p>
<p>&quot;The zinc story is truly fundamentally based. This isn't hocus-pocus. It's a genuinely tight market,&quot; said Nick Moore, a London-based metals analyst for Flemings Global Mining Group.</p>
<p>&quot;We think zinc prices could peak out this time next year at 85 cents/lb ($1,873/tonne).&quot;</p>
<p>Prices charts show a steep uphill curve indicating a gain of nearly $300, or 26 percent, since the start of the year.</p>
<p>LME floor traders said the zinc's move above the psychological $1,300 level had triggered technical &quot;buy-stops&quot;, causing speculators to pile in and drive prices still higher.</p>
<p>But industrial consumers may hold off on buying physical metal until they are more certain prices will stay at current high levels, traders added.</p>
<p>The metal, used primarily in galvanising steel and manufacturing brass, became the darling of funds and speculators in recent months after world demand overtook production and started eating into big inventories.</p>
<p>&quot;The general expectation is that much of the previously huge inventory overhang will have been eroded by the latter part of 1997,&quot; brokers Billiton said in a report issued on Thursday.</p>
