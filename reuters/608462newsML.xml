<p>Romania's centrist government said on Friday it would seek parliamentary support next week to reaffirm its commitment to tough economic reform.</p>
<p>Spokesman Eugen Serbanescu said the move amounted to &quot;a vote of confidence&quot; in the six-month old administration which replaced ex-communists.</p>
<p>The coalition had pledged to cement reform within 200 days of its election last November. It is also confronting opposition claims that it has failed to improve living standards for Romanians whose average earnings have slipped about 30 percent to around $70 per month over the past year.</p>
<p>&quot;The Prime Minister will address parliament next week stating his cabinet is determined to assume responsibility for the reform package, which includes the accords with the World Bank and the IMF,&quot; Serbanescu told journalists.</p>
<p>Premier Victor Ciorbea launched a stabilisation programme in February, introducing tough monetary policies and market reforms, freeing prices on staples and utilities and allowing the leu currency to depreciate sharply.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first time in post-communist Romania that a cabinet asks for what we could call a vote of confidence,&quot; Serbanescu said of Ciorbea's report to parlianment which will not in fact require a formal vote by the two houses.</p>
<p>The opposition Party of Social Democracy (PDSR),  which inherited power from communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu after the 1989 revolution, has threatened to seek a motion of non-confidence in the government over the reform package.</p>
<p>The coalition reform package has won widespread support, however, from international lenders who had held up loans and support during the last months of the former PDSR-led government, accusing it of dragging its feet on genuine reform.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Romania got credits worth $625 million from the World Bank, which praised the Ciorbea government for its progress in introducing reforms. The credits followed a standby loan from the International Monetary Fund, worth $430 million intended to boost the economic reform.</p>
<p>Ciorbea's main targets this year are to slash monthly inflation to about two percent in the second half from six percent now, cut the current account deficit to $1.4 billion from $2.3 billion last year and increase foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>It has set a budget deficit target of 4.5 percent of gross domestic product, down from 5.8 percent in 1996. -- Luli Popescu, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264</p>
