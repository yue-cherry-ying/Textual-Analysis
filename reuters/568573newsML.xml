<p>CoreStates Financial Corp said Thursday that it has asked the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia for &quot;Section 20&quot; Tier 1 powers that would allow it to underwrite and deal in a range of bank-ineligible securities through CoreStates Securities Corp (CSC), its broker-dealer subsidiary.</p>
<p>The company said its current retail securities business will expand to include most of CoreStates Bank's existing capital markets businesses.  </p>
<p>As a bank holding company subsidiary with Tier 1 powers, the company said CSC will be able to underwrite and deal in investment grade municipal revenue bonds, prime commercial paper, 1-4 family residential mortgages and other consumer receivable-backed securities, while continuing to offer full service retail brokerage services.</p>
<p>CSC will also offer securities sales and trading, corporate and public finance, asset securitization and risk management advisory services associated with its ongoing underwriting and dealing activities.</p>
<p>In the near term, the company said CSC plans to apply for Tier 2 powers, which would allow it to underwrite new and secondary issues of corporate debt and equity securities.</p>
<p>The company said the recent easing and proposed changes in Federal Reserve restrictions governing bank holding company securities firms were factors in CoreStates' decision to apply for Section 20 powers at this time.</p>
<p>Assuming timely regulatory approval, CSC, said the company, will begin underwriting bank- ineligible securities in late 1997.</p>
<p>CoreStates Financial Corp is a Philadelphia-based bank holding company with assets of $45.1 billion.</p>
