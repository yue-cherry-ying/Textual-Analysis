<title>INDIA: India rulers want budget passed before floor test.</title>

<p>India's embattled ruling coalition said on Tuesday that it wants parliament to approve the budget for 1997/98 (April-March) before a vote of confidence in the government due by April 11.</p>
<p>Jaipal Reddy, a spokesman for Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's 15-party United Front alliance, said the coalition was exploring ways of ensuring passage of the budget before the test vote. &quot;We are making an effort,&quot; Reddy told Reuters.</p>
<p>For the budget to be passed, the government would have to work out an agreement with either the Congress party, which suddenly withdrew its vital support on Sunday, or the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>
<p>On Monday President Shankar Dayal Sharma asked Deve Gowda to seek a vote of confidence in the lower house of parliament by April 11.</p>
<p>Reddy's remarks sparked a recovery in share prices on the Bombay Stock Exchange, where the benchmark 30-share index was up 22.24 points, or 0.66 percent, at 3,383.13 at 0553 GMT.</p>
<p>The index had opened down 1.3 percent after dropping more than eight percent on Monday.</p>
<p>Monday's selloff partly reflected fears that the government's proposed budget might fall victim to the political crisis in New Delhi.</p>
<p>The budget, presented to parliament by Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on February 28, would slash corporate and personal income tax rates. The tax and spending blueprint spurred a surge in share prices after Chidambaram unveiled it on February 28.</p>
<p>Parliament had been scheduled to take up the budget after reconvening on April 21, but the vote of confidence cast doubts over the fate of the budget.</p>
<p>Reddy said the United Front's decision-making Steering Committee discussed the proposed budget at a meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>He said it was considering asking the speaker of the lower house, P.A. Sangma, to determine if Congress and the BJP would agree to pass the budget before the test vote.</p>
<p>Minor amendments would be allowed, Reddy said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is not going to be a crisis about the budget,&quot; Sitaram Yechuri, senior leader of the Communist Pary of India-Marxist (CPI-M), told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The United Front has decided to find a way of getting the budget passed before a vote of confidence due by April 11,&quot; said Yechuri, who is a member of the United Front steering panel.</p>
<p>&quot;If that does not work out, President Shankar Dayal Sharma will ask the Lok Sabha (lower house) to meet and debate the bill after the trust vote.&quot;</p>
<p>Under parliamentary convention, Deve Gowda would be expected to resign if the lower house rejected his government's budget.</p>
<p>The United Front's 15 parties control 178 votes in the 545-seat lower house of parliament, and claim support of another dozen deputies outside the coalition.</p>
<p>Congress has 140 members and the BJP and its direct allies command 193 deputies in the lower house, which currently has 543 sitting members.</p>
