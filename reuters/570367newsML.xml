<p>Tanker rates should reach a cyclical peak during 1998-1999 around 50 percent higher than their averages last year, Drewry Shipping Consultants said in a report on Thursday.</p>
<p>But the London-based shipping consultants cautioned &quot;Whilst the recent surge in tanker demand has effectively removed any uncertainty from the 1997 forecast, the level of tonnage now scheduled for delivery in 1998 means that further orders may bring some downside risks to our forecast.&quot;</p>
<p>The report pointed out that more orders were placed in the first four months of 1997 than in the whole of 1995, while VLCC orders in the first third of this year have outstripped those for all of 1996.</p>
<p>However, it said &quot;We retain an optimistic view that demand and demolition levels will absorb most newbuilding activity.&quot;</p>
<p>Drewry also forecast that although rate weakness would be seen in the years following 1999, it believed &quot;rates will settle at a higher plateau than has historically been the case in the 1990s.&quot;</p>
<p>The survey also concluded that rapid growth in output from the Atlantic Basin would continue to shut Middle East supplies out of the market, with newer trades such as North Sea crude moving into North America and West African crude to South East Asia developing.</p>
<p>Drewry said: &quot;It is unlikely that much more erosion in long haul trade will be seen.&quot;</p>
<p>The report said Panamax tanker rates could gain up to 20 percent in time charter equivalent (tce) terms in 1997 for Arabian Gulf-East(clean) and Caribbean-US Gulf, but added further rises are likely to be tied to the freight market.</p>
<p>Aframax rates were thought likely to weaken in mid-1997 but recover and remain buoyant to the end of the decade.</p>
<p>Some Suezmax demand was expected to be absorbed by VLCCs and Aframaxes, but the outlook was said to remain favourable. Even with 20 Suezmaxes likely to be delivered in 1997, the fleet's age profile meant replacement demand would continue.</p>
<p>With Drewry predicting that 10 VLCC deliveries in 1997 would be matched by the same number of demolitions, it said rising demand should push tce rates for Arabian Gulf-North West Europe up to average $28,800 per day and peak at $40,000 pd.</p>
