<title>RUSSIA: Economics of Russian oil production worsen - report.</title>
<headline>Economics of Russian oil production worsen - report.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Producing oil in Russia has become far less profitable over the last four years as transport and production costs climbed, according to a report on the economics of the Russian oil industry.</p>
<p>The report, by the Association of Enterprises with Foreign Investment in Oil Production and Refining (AssoSPneft), also said that joint ventures were taking a growing slice of Russia's declining crude oil production.</p>
<p>&quot;As for all oil producing companies (in Russia), an aggregated proportion of taxes, transportation tariffs and other charges in JV revenues increases consistently from year to year,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>It cost $28.80 last year to transport a tonne of oil from the Tarasov field, in the heart of the West Siberian oil production base, to Russia's main export outlet of Novorossiisk in the Black Sea, according to AssoSPneft estimates.</p>
<p>On average, the cost of transporting one tonne of Russian crude from the field to the Russia frontier was $25.55 last year, nearly twice the average cost in 1993, AssoSPneft said.</p>
<p>Although export duties have been scrapped, rises in other cost elements more than compensated.</p>
<p>The net profit on a tonne of oil exported from Russia based on a sale price fob frontier of $120/tonne fell to $16.8/tonne in 1996 from $31.1 in 1993, the association said.</p>
<p>Joint ventures, the term used to describe companies or partnerships with mixed Russia/foreign capital, produced a total of 22 million tonnes of oil in Russia last year, around 7.5 percent of total production of 293 million tonnes.</p>
<p>In 1992, joint ventures produced 10.3 million tonnes of oil, or less than three percent of total crude oil output of 390 million tonnes, AssoSPneft said.</p>
<p>Their share of exports also increased, hitting 12 million tonnes in 1996, or over 11 percent of total exports outside the Commonwealth of Independent States of 105 million tonnes.</p>
<p>AssoSPneft, an non-governmental organisation grouping nearly 30 joint ventures in Russia, urged the government to make oil output from marginal Russian fields easier and more profitable.</p>
<p>&quot;Under existing economic and tax conditions, there are many reserves in Russia that will never be recovered,&quot; said AssoSPneft project manager Alexei Kocheshkov.</p>
<p>He said that joint ventures were the ideal outfits to develop smaller, harder-to-recover fields.</p>
<p>&quot;The government could reduce the tax burden on marginal fields. This does not only mean the excise tax, but also a reduction in royalties and resource base taxes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Higher production from marginal fields could play a key part in reversing the steady decline in oil production seen during the last decade in Russia, Kocheshkov said.</p>
<p>He said output had roughly halved over the period -- not only because of maturing fields, but also because of harsh economic terms adopted for oil producers in Russia.</p>
