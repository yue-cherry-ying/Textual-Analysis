<p>Movie stars Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow have broken off their engagement, Pitt's publicist said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pitt, who starred in the recently released &quot;The Devil's Own&quot; and received an Oscar nomination for &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;, and Paltrow, who made a splash in last year's &quot;Emma,&quot; had been expected to marry shortly.</p>
<p>But in a terse statement publicist Cindy Guagenti said, &quot;Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow have mutually agreed to end their two-and-a-half-year relationship.&quot;</p>
<p>Pitt, 32, and Paltrow, 24, met on the set of &quot;Seven&quot; two years ago and were engaged in November. They are scheduled to appear together in the comedy &quot;Duet,&quot; directed by Paltrow's father, Bruce, with filming to start in September.</p>
<p>Guagenti declined to elaborate on her statement, but she was quoted by the New York Post as saying, &quot;They have been broken up for a couple of weeks now. It's not because of any specific event.&quot;</p>
<p>A source told the Post that the party-loving Pitt seemed to feel hemmed in by Paltrow's preference for quieter fun.</p>
