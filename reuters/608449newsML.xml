<title>SOUTH AFRICA: LONRHO, JCI CAUTIONS FURTHER.</title>
<headline>LONRHO, JCI CAUTIONS FURTHER.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Lonrho Plc and JCI Ltd said on Friday they were still in preliminary talks to indentify any benefits from combining the two groups.</p>
<p>The two companies warned their shareholders and that of Tweefontein United Collieries Ltd and Duiker Mining Ltd to exercise caution in their share dealings.</p>
<p>&quot;Shareholders are advised that preliminary talks with representatives of JCI Ltd are bEing held in order to identify the scope for any benefits from combining the Lonrho and JCI groups,&quot; Lonrho said in a statement.</p>
<p>But the statement said no proposal for the terms of any such transaction has been tabled or considered by Lonrho's Board.  </p>
<p>JCI and Lonrho confirmed on Monday that they were in talks on a possible merger which could create a mining company with market capitalisation of more than $3 billion.</p>
<p>The Financial Times reported on Thursday that JCI chairman Mzi Khumalo, who heads South Africa's first black-controlled mining firm, was confident and optimistic that a deal can be reached for a merger with Lonrho.</p>
<p>&quot;JCI wants a broad agreement pretty soon. After that, we can handle the detailed, technical work,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Business Day newspaper reported on Tuesday that Avmin Ltd and Gencor Ltd were also interested in tying up with Lonrho.</p>
<p>Both companies have said they will not comment on the report.</p>
<p>Last month the European Commission forced Anglo American of South Africa Ltd to cut its 27.5 percent stake in Lonrho to 9.99 percent over the next two years.</p>
<p>The Commission said Anglo platinum interests combined with that of Lonrho would put control of the world's platinum industry in the hands of Anglo and Gencor.</p>
<p>Khumalo, who made the initial approach to the conglomerate, added that he would return to London on Monday for what he hoped would be final talks.</p>
<p>&quot;When it became clear that the European Union would not allow Anglo American to maintain its 27 percent take in Lonrho, I knew it was open season and that JCI had to make its move,&quot; he told the Financial Times.</p>
