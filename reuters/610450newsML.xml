<p>British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said on Friday there would be no extension of qualified majority voting (QMV) after the Amsterdam summit in June.</p>
<p>In an interview with BBC radio, he said Britain would agree to extending QMV in some areas such as combating fraud, adding that amendments to EU treaties at Amsterdam would be made with one eye to enlargement.</p>
<p>&quot;If we end up with a Europe of 25, 26 countries, we can't proceed on the basis of every new country coming in with a veto in all the areas currently decided by unanimity. But there will be no further extension of majority voting after Amsterdam in anticipation of enlargement,&quot; Cook said.</p>
<p>At present most major decisions in the EU are made by consensus, which means each member country has a veto.</p>
<p>The previous British government, ousted in a May 1 election, frequently wielded its veto to block EU business but the new Labour government has promised a more constructive approach.</p>
<p>EU leaders meet in Amsterdam next month, when membership for the new democracies of Europe will be high on the agenda. Cook said the matter could not be of higher importance.</p>
<p>&quot;Amsterdam is about making the institutions of Europe ready for enlargement,&quot; said Cook &quot;I don't think there is a bigger historic mission facing Europe than opening our doors to the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe.&quot;</p>
<p>Labour has promised closer cooperation with its European partners on matters such as the environment and fraud but has pledged a tough line on border controls. Cook said Britain would only extend QMV to new areas if it was in Britain's interest.</p>
