<title>MALAYSIA: Mahathir confirms leave, Anwar in charge.</title>
<headline>Mahathir confirms leave, Anwar in charge.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad confirmed on Thursday he was going on a two-month trip from the middle of this month, and said his deputy would be fully in charge while he was away.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes I am going on leave. I have never taken my off days in between (work) and I hope I will be allowed to go on leave without much objection,&quot; he told reporters on his return from a working visit of African countries.</p>
<p>Malaysian officials said on Wednesday the premier would visit Britain and eastern Europe on a work-and-vacation mission starting on May 19.</p>
<p>News of his leave -- his longest since becoming prime minister in 1981 -- led to much speculation in financial markets on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the speculation, centred on the prime minister's health, among other things, led to some weakness in the ringgit. Mahathir had a heart operation eight years ago.</p>
<p>But the 71-year old premier dismissed worries about his health, saying he felt fine, and said he would temporarily hand over his full powers to Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.</p>
<p>He said there was no need to take any precautionary measures to safeguard the country during his absence, as he had full confidence in Anwar.</p>
<p>Mahathir's decision to go on extended leave has prompted speculation that he might be testing the governing abilities of Anwar, widely regarded as his most natural successor.</p>
