<p>NYMEX electricity futures were trading mostly steady to lower Friday in thin pre-holiday weekend trade, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;With the holiday weekend coming up, lots of traders came into the day flat and are looking to leave the day flat,&quot; said one New York-based futures trader.</p>
<p>NYMEX will be closed Monday for the U.S. Memorial Day holdiay.</p>
<p>As of 1220 EDT, NYMEX Palo Verde (PV) June futures were down 49 cents at $23.85 from trade in a range of $23.80-24.30, while July PV was down 11 cents at the day's high of $27.25 from trade as low as $27.05 per megawatt hour (MWh).</p>
<p>June California Oregon Border (COB) was up five cents at $18.70 from exchanges in a range of $18.40-18.75, while July was steady at the day's low of $19.65 from the day's high of $19.90 per MWh.</p>
<p>Trade volumes were not immediately available from NYMEX, but floor traders said an estimated 236 PV and 49 COB contracts had traded as of 1200 EDT.</p>
<p>As of 1215 EDT, June NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were trading up 4.9 cents at $2.245 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>The power complex surged early this week on shortcovering, generation tightness and hot weather in the interior section of the Southwest.</p>
<p>Although at least 7,000 megawatts (MW) of power remained off line in the West for either planned or unplanned maintenance, much of the capacity was expected to return to operation over the next several weeks.</p>
<p>The 1,087 MW Diablo Canyon 1 nuclear unit was expected to begin production May 29 from a scheduled refueling and maintenance outage which began April 19.</p>
<p>Separately, Bonneville Power Administration said the DC lines on the Pacific Intertie will be reduced by as much as 414 MW this week for scheduled maintenance.</p>
<p>Forecasters expect temperatures in the Northwest would average near to above normal into next week with chance of thunderstorms Sunday. Main cities like Portland and Seattle would continue to see temperatures in the 60s degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>In the Southwest, temperatures were forecast to average near normal in the eastern section and above normal in the western area. The California coast is forecast to see temperatures in the 70s, while interior cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas would experience temperatures in the 90s.</p>
