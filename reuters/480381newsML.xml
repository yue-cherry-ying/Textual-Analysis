<p>The Australian stock exchange on Tuesday used the China visit of Prime Minister John Howard to make a high profile sales pitch for Chinese companies to list shares on Australia's stock market.</p>
<p>The Australian prime minister, before meeting China's President Jiang Zemin, found time to open a seminar for China's market regulators and top-level managers of its state-run companies designed to show them why they should look to Australia to raise capital.</p>
<p>Senior officials from the Australian Stock Exchange as well as brokerages and legal firms delivered the message that Australia had much to offer.</p>
<p>&quot;Cross-border equities trading now amounts to around $4 trillion a year, which no stock market can afford to ignore,&quot; Australian Stock Exchange chairman Maurice Newman told the seminar.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that one day we may be able to welcome you to our market.&quot;</p>
<p>Most Chinese companies that have listed their shares abroad have chosen Hong Kong where investors have been snapping up China-related stocks.</p>
<p>One recent listing of a China-linked company was nearly 900 times oversubscribed, and Australia may find it difficult to generate that kind of interest.</p>
<p>Newman later told reporters that 19 of 31 Asian-owned companies on the Australian exchange already had a China connection. These companies have often used a corporation not based in China to make the listing, in effect sidestepping regulatory curbs in their home country.</p>
<p>Trading in some of those issues has not been active.</p>
<p>&quot;The liquidity of those companies is mixed,&quot; said Newman. &quot;As a group we would prefer that it were greater.&quot;</p>
<p>Australia may soon get its first direct Chinese listing.</p>
<p>Taihang Cement, a cement producer based in the northern province of Hebei, has already gained approval from Chinese regulatory authorities for a foreign listing.</p>
<p>Company officials told reporters they hoped to list their shares in Australia by the year-end.</p>
<p>&quot;We chose Australia because we have a foundation there,&quot; said Zhang Zhixian, Taihang's manager of investment development, noting that the company exports cement to Australia.</p>
<p>Company officials said the exact size of the offer had not been set but would range between 100 and 200 million yuan ($12-24 million).</p>
<p>Other participants at the seminar said Australia might target its efforts at sectors where Australia is already strong, such as in natural resources.</p>
<p>&quot;Australia would have a natural advantage in infrastructure and resource-based companies,&quot; said Tony Greenwood, of law firm Blake Dawson Waldron, noting the heavy weighting of such stocks in Australia.</p>
<p>One area of concern for Chinese companies will be financial transparency, which has posed a problem for them in the past.</p>
<p>Some Chinese companies have had trouble complying with domestic regulations and others have come under criticism in Hong Kong for lack of transparency.</p>
<p>&quot;Our concern must also be the integrity of our market,&quot; said Newman.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important that companies are familiar with our listing requirements and they observe them faithfully.&quot;</p>
