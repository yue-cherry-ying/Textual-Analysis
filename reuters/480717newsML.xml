<headline>Singapore deregulates, cuts mobile phone fees.</headline>
<text>
<p>SINGAPORE, April 1, Reuter - Singapore marked the deregulation of its mobile phone and paging markets on Tuesday by scrapping licence fees for all cellular telephones and hand-held radio transmitters.</p>
<p>Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan told a ceremony to launch one of the island's three new paging services that the move would save portable phone users between Singapore $50 and S$100 a year in licence fees.</p>
<p>Total savings would be around S$23 million a year, he said. &quot;This move, together with the new competition regime, will make mobile telecommunication services even more accessible to users,&quot; Mah said.</p>
<p>He said the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore (TAS) was striving to cut the cost of telecommunications services in Singapore.</p>
<p>TAS said in a statement the move would affect around 440,000 mobile phone users, 1,100 mobile data system users and 12,000 trunked radio users.</p>
<p>Singapore's mobile phone and paging markets were opened to competition for the first time on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The island's majority state-owned Singapore Telecommunications Ltc (SingTel) lost its complete monopoly and faced one competitor, MobileOne, in the mobile phone market and three new rival pager services.</p>
<p>Mah was officiating at the launch of Sunpage, a unit of state-owned conglomerate Singapore Technologies Group. MORE Sunpage revealed the cheapest rates yet to be announced for basic paging services and a range of more sophisticated services to attack the growing messaging and secretarial paging services.</p>
<p>Sunpage is competing with two other newcomers, Hutchison Paging and MobileOne.</p>
<p>Hutchison is a joint venture of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, Intraco Ltd and Teledata. The other new paging firms are MobileOne and ST Messaging.</p>
<p>MobileOne is a joint venture of Britain's Cable &amp; Wireless, Hong Kong Telecommunications, Keppel Telecom and Singapore Press Holdings.</p>
<p>Tan Guong Ching, the chairman of Singapore Technologies Telemedia (STT), said his company hoped to be successful in its bid for a full basic telecommunications licence in Singapore when that market is opened in April 2000.</p>
<p>STT has joined with state-owned utility Singapore Power, British Telecommunications plc and Nippon Telephone and Telegraph (NTT) to bid for a licence.</p>
<p>Mah has said the government will award one or two basic telecommunications licences to compete with SingTel. A decision is scheduled for next year.</p>
