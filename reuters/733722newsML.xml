<p>Police and FBI agents scoured south Florida on Wednesday in a huge manhunt for the alleged serial killer and homosexual prostitute accused of murdering Italian fashion king Gianni Versace at his Miami Beach mansion.</p>
<p>FBI Special Agent in Charge Paul Philip said alleged killer Andrew Cunanan, one of America's most wanted men even before the Versace slaying, could still be hiding in the Miami area.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to concentrate our search right here,&quot; Philip said. &quot;He might not be able to (flee) because this was on the news right away. It's quite possible he might be holed up some place.&quot;</p>
<p>Cunanan was wanted in connection with four previous murders, including that of his former male lover, during a two-week, cross-country killing spree that began in Minneapolis in April.</p>
<p>A police hotline had received more than 100 calls already and 400 FBI agents in south Florida, as well as Miami and state police, were taking part in the hunt for Cunanan, he said.</p>
<p>Philip said he did not know if Versace, who was homosexual, had any relationship with Cunanan.</p>
<p>Versace, who dressed the world's most beautiful people, was shot twice in the head on the steps of his Miami Beach mansion by a lone gunman on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Miami Beach Police Chief Richard Barreto said on Wednesday that Cunanan, who had been spotted in the Miami area as long as two weeks before, &quot;was laying in wait for him ... it appears to me that this was a planned event ... an execution-type incident.&quot;</p>
<p>As morning broke over Miami Beach, usually a pulsating playground for models, fun-seekers and tourists, groups of sombre onlookers kept vigil outside the wrought-iron gates of Versace's luxury Mediterranean-style mansion on Ocean Drive.</p>
<p>They built a shrine of flowers and candles on the steps where he had slumped dead, blood pouring from two head wounds, after the killer struck.</p>
<p>Shock and disbelief reverberated from the cafes and model agencies of Miami Beach, an area he had helped revitalise, to the capitals of the fashion world over which he reigned.</p>
<p>&quot;My reaction is one of revolt against such an unnatural and violent death, and one of profound grief,&quot; Giorgio Armani, along with Versace one of Italy's top stylists, said in Rome.</p>
<p>Diana, Princess of Wales, said she was devastated.</p>
<p>Versace, 50, symbolised Italian fashion to the world and dressed the likes of Diana, singers Madonna, Sting and Elton John, and actresses Demi Moore and Liz Hurley. He had built a multimillion-dollar empire after learning the basics of fashion from his mother.</p>
<p>He was killed as he walked home after buying magazines at the News Cafe on Ocean Drive, a beach-front street of renovated art deco hotels and trendy restaurants.</p>
<p>The killer ran away and several hours later police named Cunanan as the sole suspect. Police said he was armed and dangerous and they warned gays and lesbians in particular to be on guard.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears that on occasion he frequents places where gay folks hang out,&quot; Philip said. But he added: &quot;Nobody's safe in this. Everybody's at risk. Everybody's got to help us put this guy in jail.&quot;</p>
<p>Barreto said a red truck found by police in Miami after Versace's killing belonged to Cunanan's last alleged victim, a New Jersey cemetery caretaker shot dead in May.</p>
<p>Celebrity Miami residents such as singer Gloria Estefan and movie star Sylvester Stallone also lamented the tragedy. &quot;He will never be duplicated,&quot; Stallone said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no words to describe how I feel right now,&quot; said top designer Gianfrance Ferre. &quot;What happened is absurd, unexplainable, terrible ... I feel only infinite pain.&quot;</p>
<p>But ordinary people who could probably not afford his lavish designs also mourned.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very sad. Versace was to the fashion world what John Lennon was to music,&quot; said John Winarski, 35, a South Beach resident.</p>
