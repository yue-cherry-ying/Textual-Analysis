<headline>OPTIONS - U.S. debt vols slip as futures bounce.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>Interest rate options implied volatilities eased as the underlying futures staged a rebound, causing some traders to conclude that prices had found a floor for the time being.</p>
<p>&quot;The market did feel like it put in a bottom today,&quot; said a floor broker in Eurodollars.</p>
<p>Although interest rate futures recently have traded as though the market were expecting another rate tightening in May, more participants have begun to suspect last month's hike was a one-time pre-emptive shot, the broker said.  </p>
<p>Eurodollar traders suspecting the market had bottomed were buying May 94.25 calls and paying a one-basis-point premium as a &quot;cheap way to get long,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The shifting sentiment helped subdue volatilities. May bond volatility fell to 9.35 percent at the close from 9.60 percent on the opening. June was also pegged at 9.35 percent, down from 9.50 percent.</p>
<p>June Eurodollar volatility was unchanged at 8.50 percent, with September slipping 0.3 point to 11.70 percent, December down 0.4 percent to 12.80 percent and March down 0.5 percent to 14.0 percent. June 1998 fell 0.6 point to 15.00 percent and September 1998 dipped 0.3 point to 16.40 percent.  </p>
<p>Mid-curve Eurodollar options volatility declined to 16.60 percent in June, from 17.00 percent, while September remained unchanged at 17.00 percent.</p>
<p>Interest rate traders said the spotlight remained on stocks, which also staged a comeback after a weak opening. Bonds appeared to track movement in the Dow Jones Industrials throughout the day, bond floor traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It looked like the stock market was whipping around, and we were sitting back watching them,&quot; said a bond options trader.  </p>
<p>Another floor trader said market participants continue to look for May bond volatility to attract a bid going into Friday's U.S. employment report, true to long-standing patterns.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not be surprised to see us go up another tenth or two,&quot; he said.</p>
