<p>Shorter-dated forex option volatilities tiptoed lower as traders tried to trim some time decay out of their books, despite a general wariness to be short options after a very volatile week, dealers said.</p>
<p>With the dollar drifting in the 115-116 yen range today, more than three yen above Tuesday's 111.98 yen low, and a long weekend coming up in the United States and Britain, traders said they were reluctantly selling gamma-rich short dates.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously, people are trying to save some time decay or earn some time decay by selling the front end of the curve,&quot; said a dealer at a U.S. bank in California.  </p>
<p>Short-dated options, which have higher time-decay rates but also have higher gamma acceleration, had become very plump during the dollar's recent tumble as many dealers were forced to cover their negative gamma positions.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the front end) is very expensive, and with the long weekend you're talking about some serious time decay,&quot; a U.S. bank trader in Chicago said.</p>
<p>One-week dollar/yen volatility fell to 13.0/14.5 percent by U.S. midsession, down from 14.5/15.5 late on Thursday and around 20 on Tuesday. One-month lost about half a point to 11.8/12.2 percent and one-year was off 0.1 point at 10.4/10.6.  </p>
<p>Still, traders noted that selling was probably limited to what was necessary to control theta decay, as opposed to outright speculation of lower volatilities.</p>
<p>&quot;You're not going to get them back cheaply on Tuesday,&quot; the Chicago trader predicted. &quot;When we walk in Tuesday morning, the front end is going to be well bid.&quot;</p>
<p>Monday is a public holiday in the U.S. and Britain.</p>
<p>The California trader added that risk reversals, the cost of swapping equally out-of-the-money puts and calls, had narrowed somewhat but were still heavily favoring yen calls, reflecting lingering concerns about a further dollar slide.  </p>
<p>&quot;The market is still very much skewed toward the dollar's downside,&quot; he said. &quot;Obviously if dollar/yen was to push lower again, we'll definitely have a volatility appreciation.&quot;</p>
<p>One-month 25-delta was pegged at 0.8/1.1 point in favor of yen calls, shrinking by about 0.2 point on the day.</p>
<p>Similar nervousness about possible breakouts in the near future kept dollar/mark volatilities little changed with the curve remaining very flat, despite continued range-trading in spot around the 1.69-mark level today.</p>
<p>One-month dollar/mark volatility stood at 9.1/9.3 percent, off 0.2 point, while one-year was steady at 9.0/9.2.  </p>
<p>&quot;I tend to believe that this might be the calm before a storm,&quot; the California trader said.</p>
<p>He said the relatively small directional preference, as reflected in one-month 25-delta risk reversals at 0.1/0.3 point skewed for mark calls, showed that the market was not positioned for a sharp dollar move.</p>
<p>&quot;My feeling is that if we break 1.6750, vols are going to jump,&quot; he said. He added that the market had been tinkering with a trendline support drawn from November lows coming in at around 1.6850 marks today.</p>
