<p>Japan's exports are still rising due to the yen's weakness early this year, an official of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) told reporters on Monday.</p>
<p>He also said strong exports of cars and computers continued to contribute to Japan's trade surplus in the first 20 days of June. Exports of ships were another supporting factor during the period, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The yen's weakening a while ago is still having an effect (on exports),&quot; the offical said.</p>
<p>But the official said that in nominal terms, the effect of currency movements was becoming smaller.</p>
<p>He also said there were special factors for the period which led to the rise in exports. He said there was one more Friday during the period this year than last year, adding that that had contributed to the rise in exports.</p>
<p>A fall in domestic demand due to the rise in Japan's sales tax in April had also encouraged Japanese manufacturers to boost exports, he said.</p>
<p>The ministry said earlier on Monday that Japan posted a customs-cleared trade surplus of 453.20 billion yen in the first 20 days of June, compared with a surplus of 197.65 billion yen in the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>The figure represented a year-on-year rise of 129.3 percent.</p>
<p>Free-on-board (FOB) exports rose 19.1 percent from a year earlier to 2.69 trillion yen, while cost, insurance and freight (CIF) imports rose 8.5 percent to 2.24 trillion yen.</p>
