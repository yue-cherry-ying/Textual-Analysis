<title>MEXICO: Mexican vote count suspended as PRI creeps up.</title>
<headline>Mexican vote count suspended as PRI creeps up.</headline>

<p>Mexican authorities suspended vote counting late on Monday, with almost 15 percent of the ballots still to be tabulated as the ruling party gained some ground but was still short of holding its majority in the lower house.</p>
<p>The sudden halt to the count left a question mark over whether the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) would lose it's 68-year-old majority in Congress after Sunday's vote.</p>
<p>Mexican newspapers and officials predicted the PRI would not keep its majority and trumpeted the birth of a full multi-party system in Mexico after decades of one-party rule.</p>
<p>Even PRI president Humberto Roque Villanueva acknowledged it would be &quot;very difficult&quot; for the party to hold its majority in the Chamber of Deputies, predicting it would win 39 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>The final vote count before preliminary results were suspended gave the PRI 38.9 percent -- short of the 42 percent it needed to keep its grip on the lower house. But many of the final results were expected to come from remote rural areas where the PRI has traditionally counted on strong support.</p>
<p>The PRI's lead for the lower house has increased slightly as the vote count progressed. Early on Monday it had 37.31 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>Felipe Solis, executive secretary of the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE), said legislative results from 13,000 polling stations were not included in the preliminary count because they had not been received in time or had errors.</p>
<p>But he insisted the suspension was normal and said the outstanding results would be passed on to the IFE's permanent council that was scheduled to meet from Wednesday onwards to process final official results.</p>
<p>&quot;The mission is completed,&quot; he said, referring to the system of tabulating preliminary results. However, prior to the elections IFE officials had promised to report at least 90 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>In past elections, the PRI was often accused of resorting to computer fraud or other dirty tricks to win elections, but observers have praised the independent IFE for the apparent cleanliness of Sunday's vote.</p>
<p>The results showed the PRI remained the biggest party in the lower house even if it lost its majority. In second place was the conservative National Action Party with 27 percent, followed by the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution with 25.6 percent.</p>
