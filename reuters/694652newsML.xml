<p>A weeklong U.N. Earth Summit ended early on Saturday with its chairman delivering the verdict: &quot;Our words have not been matched by deeds.&quot;</p>
<p>Razali Ismail, the blunt Malaysian U.N. General Assembly president, called the overall results &quot;sobering&quot; and said they reflected &quot;enormous difficulties of overcoming short-term and vested interests that would enable concrete commitments.&quot;  </p>
<p>After five days of speechmaking, the conference's main committee completed its work in a lighthearted atmosphere as a blizzard of amendments were gavelled into acceptance. The paper patchwork was then stiched together and passed on to the General Assembly's plenary, which adopted it shortly after 1 a.m. EDT (0500 GMT)</p>
<p>The summit of presidents, prime ministers and environment and development experts was to review targets set at a landmark conference in Rio De Janeiro five years ago and set new goals to save the planet in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Delegates made no firm commitments on greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate changes or on providing more aid to developing countries so they would not follow the polluting paths of wealthier industrialised nations.</p>
<p>Prospects, however, were good for new agreements on protecting fresh water in separate negotiations after the conference ends. On protecting forests, the session put off until the year 2000 a decision on whether to negotiate a treaty, pushed by Europe, Canada, Malaysia and Russia but opposed by the United States and Brazil.</p>
