<title>UK: Zinc sparkles, boosts others in LME pre-market.</title>
<headline>Zinc sparkles, boosts others in LME pre-market.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Zinc prices exploded to 4-1/2 year highs on Thursday morning in a fund-related move which helped the other LME metals snap to attention.</p>
<p>Extending late Wednesday's gains, three-month zinc prices burst above the psychological $1,300 level and the early April high of $1,311 to trade as high as $1,323, the highest since October 1992.</p>
<p>Zinc was last indicated at $1,322/24, compared to Wednesday's kerb close of $1,287.</p>
<p>Traders attributed the move to a new bout of fund buying which started on Wednesday and subsequently encountered little resistance on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;It broke back up yesterday and then fuelled itself higher above $1,300, hitting stops all the way up to $1,323 today,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;This morning fresh fund buying is not finding any producer selling as most of Europe is shut for Ascension Day,&quot; said another.</p>
<p>Fund and speculative buying have propelled zinc close to $300 higher so far this year.</p>
<p>On the way up, prices were expected to encounter resistance around $1,325, the high from October 1992, and at then $1,350.</p>
<p>The other metals were generally firmer across the board, spurred in part by zinc's rally.</p>
<p>Copper was up $10 at $2,380, around the top end of the recent range. Further on, $2,400 would provide stiff resistance, traders said.</p>
<p>Cash/threes widened out by around $5 to $67/$70.</p>
<p>Aluminium also built on Wednesday's gains, reaching a fresh six-week high of $1,672, up $11. Next resistance was expected in the $1,680-$1,685 area.</p>
<p>Analysts said borrowing of nearby spreads was helping boost three month prices. Cash/threes narrowed to a $21/$23 contango, compared to near $30 mid-afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Lead, initially marked up with zinc, was also displaying an upward bias and was last trading $10 firmer at $635.</p>
<p>&quot;It hesitated at first but now lead is finding some interest,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Tin was higher at $5,830.</p>
<p>Alloy was $12 firmer at $1,500.</p>
