<p>Two people were killed in a train derailment on the outskirts of Madrid on Tuesday only hours after a devastating train crash claimed the lives of 18 passengers in northern Spain, officials said.</p>
<p>Investigators combing through the twisted wreckage at both crash sites ruled out sabotage, but the accidents -- which took place 280 km (175 km) apart -- raised new questions about the safety of Spain's national rail system.</p>
<p>Authorities continued the grim task of identifying mangled bodies pulled from the &quot;Miguel de Unamuno&quot; passenger train, which derailed Monday night in the northern town of Huarte Araquil in Spain's worst train disaster in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>&quot;Some bodies were completely destroyed, so it is very difficult to identify them,&quot; Navarre regional president Miguel Sanz told reporters.</p>
<p>On the front page of its Tuesday editions, the Spanish newspaper Diario 16 summed it up with a large, one-word headline: &quot;CATASTROFE&quot;.</p>
<p>Relatives who kept an overnight vigil were overcome with grief to learn their loved ones were among the dead. &quot;Why did this have to happen to me?&quot; wailed one mother over the loss of her young son.</p>
<p>The train was crowded with families returning home from a long Easter holiday weekend. Ninety-four of the 248 passengers were injured in the crash.</p>
<p>People trapped in the wreckage screamed for help, and rescue crews worked through the night scouring through the debris. victims. Forty-nine of the injured remained in local hospitals on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Officials of the Spanish rail company RENFE said &quot;excessive speed&quot; was the likely cause of the crash. They said the train approached the station at 137 km (85 miles) per hour when it should have slowed down to 30 km (20 miles) per hour.</p>
<p>RENFE officials refused to release any information on the whereabouts or condition of the train's crew members.</p>
<p>Less than 10 hours after the Huarte Araquil crash, a train travelling from Barcelona to Malaga with 54 passengers on board derailed before dawn while changing tracks near Azuqueca de Henares, about 30 km (20 miles) northeast of Madrid.</p>
<p>A train engineer was pronounced dead at the scene, and a French woman passenger died on the way to a local hospital, officials said. Twenty-two people were injured. The cause of the derailment was under investigation.</p>
<p>Television stations flashed back and forth between the two crash sites, and officials tried to calm the public's fears. &quot;Trains are the safest mode of transportation (despite) the dramatic events that have occurred in less than 10 hours,&quot; Deputy Prime Minister Francisco Alvarez Cascos told state radio.</p>
<p>In the first accident, three of four carriages of a train travelling from Barcelona to Irun on Spain's border with France tumbled off the track in the Navarre province about 32 km (19 miles) northwest of Pamplona.</p>
<p>There were moments of sheer terror as passengers struggled to crawl out from beneath piles of shattered glass, baggage and broken seats. &quot;The people inside were screaming. It was horrifying,&quot; one woman passenger told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;I was thrown from my seat...and luggage went flying through the air,&quot; said Maribel Burgui, who was travelling with her husband and son. She called it a &quot;great miracle&quot; that they all survived.</p>
<p>Cranes were brought in to help search for victims. Rescue workers at first had to leave many of the bodies alongside the tracks draped in blankets. They were later taken to Pamplona for identification.</p>
<p>Medical examiners had to sort through so many body parts they at first thought they had the remains of 19 dead. But a judge investigating the crash reduced the official death toll to 18 on Tuesday afternoon. The dead ranged in age from 13 to 64.</p>
<p>Outside a Pamplona hospital, a mother collapsed in the arms of relatives after being told her 23-year-old son had died in the derailment. &quot;My son! My son!&quot; she cried.</p>
<p>The Huarte Araquil derailment was Spain's deadliest train crash since 1980 when 27 people were killed in the province of Valencia.</p>
<p>Spain's King Juan Carlos expressed his condolences to the victims' families, and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar pledged to provide whatever assistance was needed.</p>
