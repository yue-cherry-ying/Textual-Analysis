<p>Big-serving Goran Ivanisevic fell victim to one of the most courageous displays in recent Wimbledon history on Saturday as tennis finally resurfaced at the rainswept All England Club after two blank days.</p>
<p>Ivanisevic, the second seed and twice a losing finalist, set a record for the number of aces in a match at Wimbledon but still sank to a remarkable 6-3 2-6 7-6 4-6 14-12 second round defeat against Sweden's Magnus Norman.</p>
<p>Norman beat world number one Pete Sampras at the recent French Open, but is also notable for forging a successful professional career despite a long-standing heart problem.</p>
<p>An extra valve which led to him suffering an irregular heartbeat has not stopped him rising to 38th in the world, confounding doctors who warned him he would require surgery if the condition resurfaced.</p>
<p>After two years with a clean bill of health, there were thus more than the usual flutterings of concern when, on game point at 6-6 in the fifth set, the 21-year-old called for medical staff and indicated a problem with palpitations.</p>
<p>After lengthy discussions and a couple of pills, he chose to continue and somehow ignored the fusillade of aces flying past him to clinch an extraordinary win in the 26th game of a fifth set which lasted almost an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Norman will now consult his doctor in Sweden to discuss how serious a risk he would be taking by continuing in the tournament, and confessed he had momentarily feared he would have to default against Ivanisevic.</p>
<p>&quot;Last time it happened to me it lasted for 40 minutes, today it was just for 30 seconds,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But it's not very funny when things like this happen. If it had continued throughout the three-minute break I took, I would have defaulted.&quot;</p>
<p>Ivanisevic's new record of 46 aces will be accompanied by a fine after he declined to attend his post-match press conference, clearly furious at his second successive early exit from a grand slam tournament.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a hectic day for the first-aid staff with defending champion Richard Krajicek and Briton's Greg Rusedski both riding their luck to reach the third round.</p>
<p>The fourth-seeded Krajicek won 3-6 6-4 6-7 6-3 6-3 against Andrei Pavel of Romania, but was trailing by a set and 3-2 when his opponent required lengthy treatment on a wrist injury.</p>
<p>Rusedski, meanwhile, had to fight back from two sets down for the first time in his career after overcoming a back injury which required him to wear a supporting corset.</p>
<p>He eventually outlasted American Jonathan Stark 4-6 6-7 6-4 6-3 11-9 in a contest which contained plenty of needle and also saw Rusedski receive a warning for time wasting.</p>
<p>&quot;My physio cancelled all his appointments to come down here and fix me up,&quot; said Rusedski, who strained a muscle in his back during morning practice.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't want to let down all the people who came to watch me today.&quot;</p>
<p>With Tim Henman easing past Frenchman Jerome Golmard and Andrew Richardson beating Spain's Juan Albert Viloca, Britain have three representatives in the third round for the first time in 20 years. Bookmakers make it just 6-1 against a British winner.</p>
<p>Before they celebrate too hard, though, they should note the familiar names still lurking in the men's draw. World number one Pete Sampras and Germany's Boris Becker both eased through in straight sets and another former champion, Michael Stich, is also safely through.</p>
<p>Tenth seed Carlos Moya was a casualty, however, falling 6-4 6-3 6-3 to American Richey Reneberg to leave South African Wayne Ferreira as the only remaining seed in the bottom quarter of the draw.</p>
<p>In the women's singles, Monica Seles faces an anxious wait after her second round match against 20-year-old American Kristina Brandi was halted with her opponent leading 7-5 1-3.</p>
<p>World number one Martina Hingis coasted into round three but 16-year-old Russian Anna Kournikova had to fight for her life against Germany's Barbara Rittner.</p>
<p>Rittner led by a set and 5-1, only for Kournikova to battle back and take a second set tiebreak 9-7 before winning the last 6-3.</p>
<p>She will have no time to reflect on her escape as she will back in action on Sunday following the All England Club's decision to squeeze in an extra day's play in mid-tournament for only the second time in history.</p>
<p>The heavy rain in the opening week caused a huge backlog of matches which even a dry day on Saturday failed to clear completely.</p>
