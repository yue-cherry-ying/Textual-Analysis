<title>HUNGARY: Hungary grains futures price decline slows.</title>
<headline>Hungary grains futures price decline slows.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Hungarian maize and wheat futures tended to continue lower on Friday although the most actively traded August maturity remained steady at 23,700 forints.</p>
<p>Traders said the weakness of the selling side slowed the pace of decline.</p>
<p>The price falls on the Budapest Commodity Exchange have been triggered by rains after weeks of hot and dry weather which was feared to harm the crop, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is raining and the prices are falling,&quot; said Robert Monostori of  Agrimpex Termenykereskedelmi Kft.</p>
<p>Traders said heavy-weight market players were buying grains futures, but at the current low price levels few producers were inclined to sell and that slowed down the pace of price falls.</p>
<p>Sellers are cautious as earlier this year a slump in prices was followed by sharp price rises and many market players believe that prices can soar again if the weather and export outlooks turn worse, traders said.</p>
<p>Most milling wheat futures dropped by 200 to 360 forints.</p>
<p>The pattern was the same with maize futures, as most of them eased, but the heavily traded July maturity finished unchanged at 20,000 forints.</p>
<p>Traders said the July maturity was near and speculators, who held a large stock of open short positions, began to close them.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who bought, were likely to liquidate,&quot; said Monostori.</p>
<p>However, there was a large buyer -- OTP Forex Rt --  on the market, too, traders added.</p>
<p>The BCE's grains futures turnover rose to 342 million forints or 673 lots from 199.3 million forints or 416 lots on Thursday.</p>
<p>($1=181.17 Hungarian forints -- Lot size 20,000 kgs)</p>
