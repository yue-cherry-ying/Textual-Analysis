<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan state fund to sell bank shares in 4 years.</title>

<p>A parliamentary sub-committee has ordered a cabinet fund to sell all its stakes in three financial institutions within four years instead of the previous planned two years, an official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The parliamentary sub-committee on Wednesday revised its April decision, demanding that the Development Fund sell all its stakes in the three institutions in four years, by June 2001,&quot; an official at the fund told Reuters.</p>
<p>The fund now holds 42 percent in International Commercial Bank of Cnina, 16.5 percent in China Bills Finance and 14 percent in Overseas Chinese Bank.  </p>
<p>On April 16, the same committee ordered the fund to sell all its stakes in the three institutions in two years.</p>
<p>The official did not give a reason for the change in the timetable. Local newspapers said a sell-down within two years would be too big a shock to the hypersensitive stock market.</p>
<p>Taiwan's lawmakers had said that because the cabinet fund was formed to help upgrade local industries, it should not invest in the financial sector.</p>
<p>The committee's resolution needs final approval from the entire parliament.</p>
<p>Local newspapers estimated on Thursday that the cabinet fund would profit around T$70 billion by selling all its bank shares based on current market prices.</p>
<p>The official declined to confirm the figures.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't made price evaluations and we don't have proposals on how to release these shares now,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the principle is to gradually release them so as not to affect the stock market.&quot;</p>
<p>The local Liberty Times newspaper reported that mainland Chinese shareholders hold 30 percent of International Commercial Bank.  </p>
<p>The newspaper said that China shareholders may control the bank's management after Taiwan's cabinet fund withdraws all its stakes.</p>
<p>The fund official said she could not confirm the report.</p>
<p>The bank moved its base from the mainland to Taiwan in 1949 after Taiwan's Nationalist government lost a civil war in China to communist troops.</p>
