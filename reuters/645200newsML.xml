<p>Sierra Leone's coupmakers called on the population of the capital Freetown to turn out in force wearing white shirts on Sunday as a sign that they oppose foreign intervention to end the crisis.</p>
<p>With regional giant Nigeria reinforcing its military presence in the city, the ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) said failure to turn out would be interpreted as a sign that the city wanted international intervention.</p>
<p>&quot;We are calling all Sierra Leonians in Freetown to take to the streets in their millions (sic), to take to the streets and demonstrate against foreign intervention,&quot; AFRC spokesman Mohamed Kamara said, reading a statement on state radio.</p>
<p>The statement linked the march to a meeting on Monday of the U.N. Security Council to discuss the crisis but it suggested that that meeting would &quot;give the go-ahead for a foreign intervention in Freetown&quot;.</p>
<p>The statement said the march would start at 2 p.m. (1400 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;If Freetown does not demonstrate against foreign intervention, the U.N. and the international community will take this as support, that the people of Sierra Leone want foreign intervention,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Junior officers toppled civilian president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah on May 25. Kabbah's 1996 election ended four years of army rule in Sierra Leone, one of the world's poorest nations despite mineral wealth including diamonds.</p>
<p>The coup has been widely condemned with Nigeria and the rest of the Organisation of African Unity demanding that Kabbah, who is in neighbouring Guinea, be reinstated. The question is whether by military or diplomatic means.</p>
<p>The coup leaders say they want a peaceful solution but do not want Kabbah back, accusing him of blocking peace with rebels, humiliating the army and promoting ethnic hatred.</p>
<p>Sierra Leone's West African neighbours have been making diplomatic contacts to decide on their next move.</p>
<p>Nigerian gunboats shelled the city on Monday in a show of force.</p>
<p>Dissident soldiers and rebels, who took up arms in 1991 and who have flooded into the city after rallying to the coup, hit back by attacking Nigerian soldiers guarding foreigners at a beach front hotel.</p>
<p>The United States, Britain, France and other nations have been evacuating their nationals.</p>
<p>About 100 Lebanese women and children left by hovercraft for neighbouring Guinea on Saturday and 1,500 more people scrambled to board a ship hoping to follow them, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The hovercraft was chartered by the Lebanese community in Guinea's capital Conakry and picked up Lebanese who had flown to the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown by helicopter from the eastern town of Bo, organisers said.</p>
<p>A mix of Lebanese and West African nationals clamoured to board the passenger ship Ocean Princess, which had been hired by the Lebanese community and Guinean officials, witnesses and organisers said. The ship left with 500 on board.</p>
<p>Those left behind began their third night in the open.</p>
<p>Freetown was calm on Saturday but police sources reported a jump in armed crime, looting and rape. Some residents blamed the rebels. Their leader Foday Sankoh, who is under virtual house arrest in Nigeria, signed a peace deal with Kabbah in Ivory Coast in November. Implementation dragged and it unravelled.</p>
