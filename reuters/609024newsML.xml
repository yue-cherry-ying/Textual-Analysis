<headline>Journalist murdered in trouble-torn Mexican state.</headline>

<p>A Mexican journalist, his body riddled with bullets, was found dead on Thursday on a road alongside his fire-damaged car, a regional branch of the National Union of Journalists (SNRP) said.</p>
<p>Jesus Bueno Leon, a director at the regional weekly Siete Dias, was found dead on a rural road close to the city of Chilpancingo some 120 miles (200 km) south of Mexico City, the Guerrero SNRP branch said in a statement.</p>
<p>Chilpancingo is the state capital of Guerrero, a trouble-torn southern state with guerrilla activity, widespread kidnappings and frequent political and social unrest.</p>
<p>The National Union of Journalists said two months ago its members asked state Gov. Angel Aguirre to protect Bueno Leon after the journalist had received death threats.</p>
<p>Guerrero state government officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Journalists plan a protest march on Friday to call for an immediate investigation into the killing.</p>
