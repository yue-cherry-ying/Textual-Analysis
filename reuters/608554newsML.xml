<p>LIFFE coffee futures were tightly mixed by the close on Friday with prices holding well below their peaks after a bout of fund buying early in the session.</p>
<p>Traders said price movements were rather restricted in the afternoon after New York arabica futures started off the day on a slightly weaker tone.</p>
<p>While there was a widespread feeling that London could have been overbought after this week's rally, there were very few sellers amid frost fears in Brazil in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Benchmark July was up $4 at $2,086 per tonne and September eased $2 to $2,098.</p>
<p>The second-month July raced to an intraday high of $2,110 but failed to match Thursday's peak of $2,145.</p>
<p>Activity remained light before a three-day holiday weekend in the U.S. and Britain, with total volume at 3,567 lots.</p>
<p>New York and London markets are closed on Monday, reopening on Tuesday.</p>
<p>While the weather forecasts point to a much colder weather moving into Brazil's coffee belt on Friday, no damaging cold was expected.</p>
<p>Traders said coffee benefitted from light fund buying. With coffee charts still looking extremely bullish in the longer-term, traders said funds were keen to buy on dips.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said even if July pulls back about another $80, robustas would still look bullish and likely head toward $2,300. They said support rests near $2,010.</p>
<p>Options activity was also signalling further gains to new highs. Traders said investors have been buying out-of-the-money calls this week at strikes above $2,000.</p>
<p>At-the-money implied September options volatility was pegged near 60 percent, up sharply from about 44 percent a week ago but in-line with historical levels.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, coffee continued to get a boost from signs the world's tight coffee supply situation in coffee was not expected to ease in the near-term.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a certain tightness in the market, especially for the period from July to September,&quot; the Association of Coffee Producing Countries' secretary general Robeiro Oliveira Silva told reporters at the International Coffee Organization's meeting here on Friday.</p>
