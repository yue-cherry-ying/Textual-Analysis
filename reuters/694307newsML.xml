<title>UK: TENNIS-TRADERS SUFFER IN WIMBLEDON WEATHER SLUMP.</title>
<headline>TENNIS-TRADERS SUFFER IN WIMBLEDON WEATHER SLUMP.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Local traders are suffering as much as long-suffering spectators at the rain-ravaged Wimbledon championships, with takings dramatically down.</p>
<p>A stall-holder outside Southfields station said he would normally expect to take 2,000 pounds ($3,330) per day from hungry and thirsty tennis fans on their way to the All England Club.</p>
<p>On Friday, the tournament's second completely washed out day, he made just 20 pounds ($33).</p>
<p>&quot;I've bought in 42,000 cans of drink for the two weeks and I would normally be expecting to order more by now,&quot; he said on Saturday. &quot;But I've only moved three and a half thousand.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders were also slashing the price of Wimbledon '97 T-shirts, fearing they would be out of date before the weather cheers up enough for anyone to want to wear them.</p>
