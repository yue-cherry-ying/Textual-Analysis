<headline>Turkish PM denies military complaint on funding.</headline>

<p>Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan denied on Saturday military complaints that his cabinet was ignoring army demands for funds for operations against rebel Kurds, Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;Any shortfall in meeting the needs of our army is out of question,&quot; the semi-official agency quoted Erbakan as saying.</p>
<p>General Erol Ozkasnak, a military spokesman, told reporters on Friday that the army had asked the government for funding of a cross-border operation against Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels, but had received no answer.</p>
<p>Erbakan said he would gather finance ministry and military officials on Saturday to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>Ozkasnak said Kurdish rebels had used sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles to shoot down two army helicopters on a mission in northern Iraq -- a Cougar troop carrier with 11 officers and soldiers on board last week and a smaller Super-Cobra attack helicopter on May 18.</p>
<p>He said the PKK had for the first time gained access to such weaponry, from countries which Turkey accuses of supporting the rebels.</p>
<p>&quot;Since 1992, the PKK has wanted to get hold of SA-7 missiles...We have informed the foreign ministry five times that primarily the governments of Iran, Syria, Armenia, Greece and Cyprus have been providing the terrorist organisation with these weapons,&quot; Ozkasnak said.</p>
<p>Erbakan said the finance ministry had released 60 percent of a 647-trillion-lira ($4.5 billion) annual budgetary fund, allocated for the defence ministry and the army, so far this year.</p>
<p>&quot;This rate is far lower for other institutions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Erbakan said parliament must pass legislation to provide the army with extra funds.</p>
<p>Thousands of Turkish troops, backed by air power, poured into northern Iraq on May 14 in a big cross-border operation against bases of the PKK, fighting for independence or autonomy in southeast Turkey.</p>
<p>Turkey said the operation would continue until the rebel presence in the region was destroyed.</p>
