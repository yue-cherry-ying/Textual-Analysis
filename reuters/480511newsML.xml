<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard presided on Tuesday at a ceremony to mark China's approval for the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZ to set up a branch in Beijing.</p>
<p>ANZ won approval for a branch licence from the central bank, the People's Bank of China, on March 21, bank officials said. The bank already has a branch in Shanghai.</p>
<p>&quot;We foresee our branch in Beijing as an important catalyst for ANZ becoming increasingly involved in providing finance to China's trade and infrastructure needs,&quot; ANZ chairman Charles Goode told reporters.</p>
<p>He said he did not expect the new branch to make a profit in its early years but said it would be an important part of the bank's financial network in Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't judge it as a profit unit standing on its own,&quot; he said. &quot;It is part of our network and commitment to southeast Asia.&quot;</p>
<p>The bank would be allowed to lend in foreign currency and to give guarantees. Its basic business would be trade finance including basic trading and structured projects, officials said.</p>
<p>ANZ opened its first branch in Shanghai in 1993, but had yet to meet the requirements to win permission to carry out domestic yuan currency business in China, bank officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's important to us that we can deal with the local currency because the range of services we can provide is increased,&quot; said executive director Alister Maitland. He gave no timetable for ANZ plans to start local currency business.</p>
<p>&quot;We can see the future when this will be quite a dynamic market where there will be less restrictions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>China has given approval to eight foreign banks to do local currency business. One requirement is that they set up their headquarters in the Pudong Development Zone in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Among the eight, the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp and the Industrial Bank of Japan formally started yuan business last Thursday.</p>
<p>China announced on Tuesday it had set the income tax rate for foreign banks doing local currency business at 33 percent.</p>
<p>Foreign banks are currently taxed at a rate of 15 percent on the foreign exchange business they conduct.</p>
<p>Howard, who visited Shanghai at the weekend and arrived in Beijing on Monday, welcomed the expanded presence of ANZ in China as a sign of developing business ties between the two countries.</p>
<p>&quot;This is yet another element of the burgeoning economic, commercial and business association between Australia and China,&quot; he said.</p>
