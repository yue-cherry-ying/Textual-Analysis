<title>USA: U.S. spot gas prices slip for weekend on weather.</title>
<headline>U.S. spot gas prices slip for weekend on weather.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. spot natural gas prices lost some ground Friday ahead of the U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend, pressured by forecasts for mostly-mild U.S. temperatures into next week, industry sources said.</p>
<p>But steady injection demand and the approach of the summer air conditioning season helped temper the bears.</p>
<p>&quot;The market keeps coming back. I think there's been some fundamental strength in the cash for storage,&quot; said one Texas trader, noting Gulf prices were down slightly today but rebounded from early lows. Gulf Coast weekend gas was talked in the $2.14-2.19 area, still almost 10 cents above index.  </p>
<p>Prices at Henry Hub on average were down by two cents from Thursday to $2.18-2.21.</p>
<p>While most regions only lost a couple of cents, west Texas prices tanked by almost a dime to the mid-to-high $1.80s on more moderate temperatures out West and news SoCalGas declared Saturday an overnomination day.</p>
<p>After requesting voluntary reductions Thursday but failing to reach the threshold target of 2.5 bcf with nominations closer to 3.6 bcf, SoCal warned shippers of costly penalties for those who do not trim nominations to no more than 110 percent of expected usage plus firm storage injection rights.</p>
<p>Prices at the southern California border notionally skidded about 10 cents to the low-$2s but some thought levels were even lower, as shippers dumped supply to avoid penalties.</p>
<p>In the Midwest, weekend gas prices slipped a few cents to the $1.95-2.00 area amid forecasts for normal to slightly below-normal temperatures for much of the region. Gas at the Chicago city gate was talked at $2.21, also down three cents.</p>
<p>South Texas prices also eased slightly to about $2.07-2.12.</p>
<p>In the East, New York city gate prices fell into the low-$2.40s, with little demand expected in the area well-into next week.</p>
