<p>An early spring blizzard buried New England and the Northeast under nearly three feet (90 cm) of heavy, wet snow that downed power lines, closed airports and schools and was blamed for causing five deaths.</p>
<p>Massachusetts Gov. William Weld declared a state of emergency that was expected to last through Wednesday afternoon and called out the National Guard to help clear roads and open shelters.</p>
<p>From Philadelphia to Concord, New Hampshire, from New York's mid-Hudson Valley to the tip of Cape Cod in Massachusetts, the wet snow combined with near hurricane winds to bring all forms of transportation to a halt.</p>
<p>Boston's Logan International Airport remained closed on Tuesday afternoon and officials there hoped to have an emergency runway open by 10 p.m. after shoveling out from under 20 inches (51 cm) of snow. Hundreds of passengers huddled on the floors of terminals, airlines cancelled flights and airport restaurants ran out of food.</p>
<p>Thousands of stranded travelers spent the night in temporary shelters in northeastern Pennsylvania and Chester County in suburban Philadelphia as snowfall totals ranged from six inches (13 cm) to as much as two feet (61 cm). By Tuesday morning, the snow was rapidly melting, although high winds were expected.</p>
<p>Abandoned vehicles cluttered roadways and a number of interstates remained closed in parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Commuter rail lines in Boston and New York said they were operating, but with up to four hour delays. Amtrak reported that one of its trains collided with a downed tree on the route between Albany and New York City.</p>
<p>In Boston, where between 18 inches (46 cm) and two-feet (61 cm) of snow fell, city bus service was halted for the first time in 20 years and the city's subways were only partially operating.</p>
<p>Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, who ordered City Hall closed, said at least two people had died while trying to shovel out.</p>
<p>The vicious blizzard spawned thunderstorms and lighting. Winds topped 65 mph (105 kph) and seas off the New England coast had 20-foot to 30-foot (6-9 metre) waves.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been wild,&quot; said Chuck Hill, who lives in Ipswich, a north Massachusetts shore town. &quot;There are more limbs down from this storm than we've had altogether in 23 years that I've lived here.&quot;</p>
<p>Boston Edison spokesman Mike Monahan said it would be &quot;at least until Friday&quot; before service could be restored to most of its 50,000 customers who were without power.</p>
<p>Northeast Utilities, which serves Connecticut and western Massachusetts, reported 100,000 customers without power, while Massachusetts Electric, a subsidiary of the New England Electric System, reported another 96,000 in the dark.</p>
<p>Eastern Utilities reported power out to 40,000 customers. At the height of the storm Public Service of New Hampshire and Central Maine Power reported scattered outages totalling 8,000 customers.</p>
<p>Orange &amp; Rockland Utilties said the blizzard that swept across the Northeast overnight left some 100,000 customers without power in the mid-Hudson Valley region.</p>
<p>In Maine, which was spared the storm's most vicious wrath, two fishermen died when their vessel capsized at Lubec near the New Brunswick border.</p>
<p>And New York State police blamed the weather for the death of a motorist in a traffic accident in the Catskills on Monday night.</p>
<p>While the storm may have delayed thousands of travelers, there was one that just would not wait.</p>
<p>A woman gave birth to a healthy baby boy in a car that was being held up on Manhattan's West Side Highway as traffic slowed to a standstill in the remnants of the snow storm.</p>
