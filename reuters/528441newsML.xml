<headline>Clinton vague on U.S. response to Iraqi defiance.</headline>

<p>President Bill Clinton told Iraq on Tuesday not to use religion to evade international sanctions, but gave no indication the United States would make it pay for defying a &quot;no-fly&quot; zone to transport pilgrims.</p>
<p>&quot;My message is that we support people in exercising their religious liberties and in living out their religious convictions everywhere in the world ... But we don't want to see religion in effect used and distorted in a way to try to avoid international obligations,&quot; Clinton told reporters.</p>
<p>Iraq announced earlier it would send helicopters to the Saudi border to pick up Iraqi Moslems returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>
<p>The area is in a United Nations-designated &quot;no-fly&quot; zone placed off limits to Iraqi aircraft after the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>In defiance of other Gulf War sanctions, Iraq flew a civilian plane to Saudi Arabia on April 9 carrying 104 elderly and sick pilgrims to Mecca for the haj pilgrimage.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council issued a statement calling on Iraq not to fly more planes without its consent, but stopped short of terming the April 9 flight a breach of the embargo.</p>
<p>&quot;We intend to continue to observe the no-fly zone and continue to support the embargo until he (Iraqi President Saddam Hussein) lives up to the conditions of United Nations resolutions,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>He commented to reporters after a White House ceremony commemorating Earth Day environmental observances.</p>
<p>On Monday, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States would &quot;respond appropriately&quot; if Iraqi aircraft entered restricted areas, but he added: &quot;We're not going to shoot down civilian helicopters.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We certainly recognise the significance of the haj, but there are other means and procedures available for the transportation of haj pilgrims,&quot; McCurry said.</p>
<p>Clinton had been asked whether he had a message for Saddam in light of Baghdad's decision to enter the no-fly zone. The Iraqi move raised a question as to whether the United States would attempt some sort of retribution for the defiance.</p>
<p>U.S. allies in the Gulf War have taken a more flexible stance on such issues recently and have been less insistent than Washington on strict enforcement of post-war sanctions.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said that if Baghdad was genuinely interested in the pilgrims, it would have sought a U.N. exemption to to travel through the no-fly zone.</p>
