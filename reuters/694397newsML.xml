<p>Five people were killed and 11 hurt in a bomb explosion on a Russian train, the Emergencies Ministry said on Saturday.</p>
<p>A ministry spokesman told Itar-Tass news agency the toll had risen from the three initially reported killed in Friday's blast on train number 24 from Moscow to St Petersburg.</p>
<p>The ministry did not confirm a report by Interfax news agency, which quoted a local official on the scene of the blast as saying six people had been killed.</p>
<p>An Emergencies Ministry official said on Friday a bomb had been hidden in the lavatory of a carriage and that it exploded at about 6:30 p.m. (1430 GMT) near Torbino station in the Novgorod region northwest of Moscow.</p>
<p>The ministry said a teenager and a man of about 70 were among the dead. The remains of three other people had not yet been identified.</p>
<p>Four of the victims died immediately and one succumbed to his or her injuries in hospital. At least two of the injured were in a serious condition, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted an emergencies ministry official as saying that, according to preliminary investigations, the blast was the work of an unidentified suicide bomber. The ministry did not confirm the report.</p>
<p>The Federal Security Service sent a team of investigators, including an expert on terrorism, but said it had found nothing to prove that the blast was a guerrilla act.</p>
<p>Railways Minister Nikolai Aksenenko was among officials and security police who headed for the site of the blast, Russian television said.</p>
<p>Tass said the train had been able to continue to St Petersburg and that trains were again running on the line.</p>
<p>Several bomb blasts have rocked the Russian transport network in recent months. Earlier this year, four people were killed in explosions at two different railway stations in southern Russia.</p>
<p>Moscow blamed those blasts on Chechen rebels but separatist leaders in the southern region, torn by a 21-month conflict with Russian troops which ended last August, denied any involvement.</p>
<p>Last year four people were killed in a bomb explosion on the Moscow subway and dozens were injured in blasts on two trolleybuses in the capital.</p>
