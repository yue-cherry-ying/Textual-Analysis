<title>MALAYSIA: KL interbank rates steady despite maturity.</title>
<headline>KL interbank rates steady despite maturity.</headline>

<p>Interbank rates were mostly steady despite the maturity of a 500-million ringgit Bank Negara bill issue, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said some of the rates had declined on Thursday in anticipation of the increase in liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;But, the liquidity shortage is too huge for rates to fall any further,&quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>One-week and two-week interbank rates were at 10-11 percent, one-month at 8.5/9.0 percent and three-month and six-month at 7.5/8.0 percent, all unchanged from previous levels.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the overnight rate to dip due to the maturity. It closed at 10/15 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>The rise in interbank rates started last Thursday after Bank Negara intervened aggressively in the foreign exchange market to stem the slide of the ringgit. The central bank was said to have sold around $1 billion worth of dollars.</p>
<p>The intervention drained liquidity from the system, causing the market to be short and interbank rates to rise to unusually high levels.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange continued rising on expectation of a further fall in interest rates and short-covering by speculators, futures dealers said.</p>
<p>The three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) contract for June 1997 was up one at 92.55, or an implied yield of 7.45 percent.</p>
<p>September 1997 contract was up two at 92.60, or 7.40 percent and December was up one at 92.60, or 7.40 percent.</p>
