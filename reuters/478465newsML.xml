<headline>NZ SPORT, RUGBY UNION-Injury hits Blues ahead of Crusaders game.</headline>
<text>
<p>AUCKLAND, April 2 - The Auckland Blues will be without prop Olo Brown and might also have hooker Sean Fitzpatrick and winger Brian Lima sidelined when they face the Canterbury Crusaders in a Super 12 rugby match on Friday night.</p>
<p>Manager Rex Davy said Fitzpatrick and Lima would be assessed tonight, NZPA reports.</p>
<p>All Black hooker Fitzpatrick has an elbow problem, while winger Lima picked up an ankle injury in the 49-26 win over the Queensland Reds on Monday.  </p>
<p>Tighthead prop Brown was also a casualty from that match, limping off Eden Park with a calf injury which has concerned All Black coach John Hart.</p>
<p>Hart said there was a lack of depth at tighthead prop in the country and was scheduling a meeting with the Blues' official today.</p>
<p>He said Brown's injury would sideline him for about a month.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know exactly how long at this stage,&quot; Davy said of Brown's return to rugby.  </p>
<p>The Blues, second on the Super 12 points table, are the only unbeaten team left in the competition and will at least draw level with the Gauteng Lions if they down the Crusaders at Pukekohe.</p>
