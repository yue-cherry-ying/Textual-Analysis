<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss stocks slump more than three percent.</title>

<p>Swiss shares ended with a slump of more than three percent on Wall Street's tumble in recent days and a shaky outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the players were obviously taken by surprise,&quot; one dealer said, adding some investors had positioned themselves for a further rise after last week's recovery of Swiss shares.</p>
<p>&quot;What's more, the dollar's recent fall added pressure on Swiss exporters,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One trader added the prospects looked dim given a weakness of the U.S. long bond and possible further Wall Street losses.</p>
<p>The blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) fell 157.5 points, or 3.38 percent, to 4,501.7, touching a low at 4,482.2 points.</p>
<p>The all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) ended down 90.02 points, or 3.06 percent, at 2,856.23.</p>
<p>One dealer said volume was relatively high, adding there was little bargain hunting despite the correction.</p>
<p>&quot;People are nervous, also because we're on daylight savings time now in Europe, so Wall Street and U.S. economic data come in later than usual,&quot; he noted.</p>
<p>Most blue chips saw marked losses. Nestle, which led the active list, gave up 64 francs to 1,621 and Roche slid to 11,925 francs.</p>
<p>Among financials, recent high-flyer CS Group was one of the bigger losers. The shares ended down 9.50 francs to 163.25.</p>
<p>Insurer Zurich slid 16.50 francs to 436.50. A rumour that Zurich was interested in German insurer Victoria had no impact, a dealer said. A Zurich spokeswoman said the compnay did not comment on rumors as a matter of principle. Victoria's major shareholder Munich Re said it will keep its stake in Victoria.</p>
<p>ABB, Sulzer, Adecco performed better than the market but also ended in negative terrain.</p>
