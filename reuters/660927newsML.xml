<title>NEW ZEALAND: NZ student makes stink to stop fierce dogs.</title>

<p>A New Zealander has developed a spray that smells so bad it scares off aggressive dogs.</p>
<p>Called Skunk Shot because the chemicals used replicate those excreted by a skunk, it works best sprayed in the dog's face.</p>
<p>It has been given the thumbs up by the local animal protection body, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).</p>
<p>Wellington's Evening Post newspaper said on Friday that physics graduate Andrew Rakich had developed the product as he made coffee in his kitchen.</p>
<p>&quot;I was feeling a little low, I'd broken up with my girlfriend and also broken my ankle on the same day... and then I had this idea,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Animal control officer Shirley Tyler said  authorities near Wellington had conducted successful trials of the spray, which is now being marketed by a retail chain.</p>
<p>&quot;The beauty of it, and the guy demonstrates it on himself, is that it doesn't hurt the animal,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Rakich is now working on a spray to fend off people, one with a smell that will linger for days.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll end up with the police saying 'have you smelt this man' and putting out scratch and sniff wanted posters,&quot; Rakich said.</p>
