<text>
<p>The halt to trading on South Africa's Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) has been caused by problems with the electricity supply, a JSE spokeswoman said,</p>
<p>Trading on the JET equities system halted around 0900 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;The trading system has not gone down. We are having trouble with the electricity. Whether it is a power failure or a power surge we don't know,&quot; the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>She added that all the phones and personal computers in the building had also been hit, but that back up generators were now providing some power.</p>
<p>There was no indication of when the trading system might come back on again, but the spokeswoman said a statement would be issued as soon as more details emerged.</p>
<p>The all-share index was last at 6,958.8, down 136.0 points, and the industrials index was off 169.4 points to 8,170.0. The golds index was off 10.7 points to 1,290.9.</p>
