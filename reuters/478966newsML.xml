<title>CAMBODIA: Ranariddh fears more violence in Cambodia.</title>
<headline>Ranariddh fears more violence in Cambodia.</headline>

<p>Cambodian co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh said on Tuesday that he feared a deadly weekend grenade attack was not an isolated incident and could mark the onset of further violence ahead of coming elections.</p>
<p>&quot;I fear it is not an isolated incident,&quot; said Ranariddh of the attack that killed at least 14 people and injured more than 100. &quot;I think that it is a real act of political crime, an act of intimidation before the next elections.&quot;  </p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters at his home, Ranariddh said opposition forces as well as his own party were no longer safe in Cambodia. He said his troubled relationship with coalition partner co-premier Hun Sen was becoming increasing tense.</p>
<p>&quot;It is more and more difficult to work with (Hun Sen). The tension is not created by me,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The attack outside the National Assembly in central Phnom Penh on Sunday morning was the worst and most blatant act of political violence to hit Cambodia's fragile democracy since the current coalition government came to power after United Nations-organised general elections in May 1993.</p>
<p>Protest leader and apparent target Sam Rainsy, who narrowly escaped injury, on Sunday blamed the attack on his bitter foe Hun Sen, but a spokesman for the Information Ministry said it was unclear who was responsible and that an investigation was underway.</p>
