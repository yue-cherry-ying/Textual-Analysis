<p>Indian cricket selectors reposed their faith in the captaincy of Sachin Tendulkar on Saturday and also named former captain Mohammad Azharuddin among the probables for the forthcoming tour of Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The Indian selectors named Tendulkar captain until September 30 in a meeting in Calcutta on Saturday, brushing aside media criticism that the country's leading batsman had been overburdened and his form had been faltering.</p>
<p>Tendulkar will lead India in the the Asia Cup limited-over tournament in Sri Lanka next month, followed by a series against the hosts which involves two tests and three one-day internationals.</p>
<p>Azharuddin's name figured in the 27 probables for the tour along with off-spinner Rajesh Chauhan, whose bowling action was suspected by the International Cricket Council (ICC).</p>
<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Tuesday lifted a selection curb imposed by it on Chauhan since the 1995 home series against New Zealand while analysts scrutinised his bowling action.</p>
<p>Chauhan's action will remain under observation but the BCCI did not want him to remain under a cloud until adequate proof against his action was submitted.</p>
<p>Azharuddin was omitted from the national squad for last month's Independence Cup one-day tournament. The elegant strokemaker was dropped following a poor run of form in the preceding tour of the West Indies.</p>
