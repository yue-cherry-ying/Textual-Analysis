<p>President Jacques Chirac will lend French support to the Czech Republic's bids for early membership of the European Union and NATO when he visits Prague from Wednesday, but may differ on the future of both institutions.</p>
<p>French officials said Chirac, who has already given similar pledges to Poland and Hungary, will tell his hosts he wants to see them in the EU in the year 2000, a symbolic date regarded by the European Commission as unrealistic.</p>
<p>They say the Czechs, and notably free-marketeering Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, seem more interested in the EU's single market and in American protection than in France's vision of the Union as an integrated social and defence alliance.</p>
<p>A senior French official said Chirac was braced for a &quot;real dialogue&quot; on the aims of the EU during the two-day visit and acknowledged that Czech leaders did not seem very interested in the development of a European defence identity within NATO.</p>
<p>Diplomats said the Czechs had been concerned when Chirac insisted that NATO must reach a new security relationship with Russia before it invited the first new members to join at a summit in Madrid in July.</p>
<p>But last month's U.S.-Russian summit appeared to have cleared the way for such a pact without compromising the security interests of central and east European states pressing to join the western alliance.</p>
<p>France's reputation in Prague has taken a long time to recover from the late president Francois Mitterrand's statement there in 1990 that it would be &quot;decades&quot; before the first former communist central European countries joined the EU.</p>
<p>Mitterrand's relations with Czech President Vaclav Havel were prickly, although the former dissident is widely admired in Paris as personifying the politically committed intellectual.</p>
<p>Chirac's tour of central and east European capitals, launched last September in Warsaw, has largely been aimed at erasing the widespread belief that France was hostile to their integration with western Europe.</p>
<p>Prague is provisionally the last stop on that tour -- Chirac has no plans to visit Slovakia this year, since Paris and its partners believe civil and minority rights are insufficient to warrant early accession to either the EU or NATO.</p>
<p>While cultural ties are strong, economic links with probably the most transformed market economy in central Europe are weak.</p>
<p>France has only a paltry three to four percent share of the Czech market, dwarfed by Germany's dominant 30 percent. And it has slipped from third to fifth place among foreign investors since 1994.</p>
<p>Chirac will encourage French companies to win a bigger share in Czech privatisations in areas of French expertise such as water distribution and nuclear power.</p>
<p>Laying the foundation stone of a French lycee in Prague, he will also seek to promote use of the French language, which has been mostly crowded out by English and German since Russian ceased to be the first foreign language.</p>
