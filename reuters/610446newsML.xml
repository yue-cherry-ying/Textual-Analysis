<title>UK: IPE gas oil seen $1 lower, Brent 5-10 cents down.</title>
<headline>IPE gas oil seen $1 lower, Brent 5-10 cents down.</headline>

<p>IPE gas oil futures should open about $1 a tonne weaker on Friday after Thursday's late NYMEX gasoline-led rally petered out amid profit-taking, dealers said.</p>
<p>IPE July Brent crude, which settled at $20.18 a barrel, is also expected to open lower, matching 5-10 cent losses on U.S. crude markets overnight, they said.</p>
<p>June gas oil settled Thursday at $179.00 a tonne, still in a 50-cent contango to July, but dealers said the spread could benefit from news of refinery run cuts in Rotterdam.</p>
<p>&quot;There's still a desire to see the (June/July) spread go level,&quot; said a broker.  </p>
<p>Traders said on Thursday that British Petroleum (BP), which controls 65 percent of the massive 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) Rotterdam Nerefco refinery, had cut runs by the equivalent of 10 percent for the month of May because of poor margins.</p>
<p>Texaco, BP's Nerefco partner, said last week it had trimmed crude throughputs by a similar amount.</p>
<p>&quot;I still feel the trend is not bearish, it's just the market has lost some shine since the start of the week,&quot; said a broker.</p>
<p>While talk of run cuts was providing mild support to European products it was having the reverse affect on spot North Sea crudes which, apart from Dated Brent, eased on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Dealers said crude's failure to move decisively higher could prompt a test of support around $20.00 a barrel, although short-covering ahead of the long weekend in Britain and the U.S. could provide a floor.</p>
<p>Brent would also be looking for a lead from NYMEX gasoline ahead of the Memorial Day holiday which traditionally marks the start of the U.S. driving season.</p>
<p>News the U.S. still needed more information on the implementation of the Iraqi-U.N. oil-for-food deal before it could agree to a rollover of the $2 billion programme was seen having little impact.</p>
