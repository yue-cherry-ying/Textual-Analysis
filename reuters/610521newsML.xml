<headline>Rate cut catches Australian markets by surprise.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Australian financial markets gave a wildly differing reception on Friday to a shock cut in interest rates from the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>Bonds were jubilant, equities encouraged and the dollar depressed in the wake of the 0.5 point reduction in official cash rates to 5.5 percent, their lowest level in 34 months.</p>
<p>The move was a surprise to much of the market which had thought policy was on hold for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>The RBA, however, said a moderation in wages growth reported in March quarter data released Thursday had been enough to permit a further easing of policy.</p>
<p>The short-dated end of the bond market romped ahead with the three-year yield diving 24 basis points to 6.50 percent, its lowest level in four months.</p>
<p>The Australian All Ordinaries share market index touched a record high of 2572.7, before easing back to 2555.1 for a 7.2-point gain by midession.</p>
<p>The dollar, however, took the news badly as the RBA's action entirely eliminated its interest rate differential over the U.S. dollar making it less attractive to offshore investors.</p>
<p>By the midsession it had dived almost a cent to US$0.7685/90 from an early US$0.7770/75. Thursday's US$0.7830/35 close was just a distant memory.</p>
<p>The government, which had been agitating for a cut since delivering its 1997/98 budget last week, welcomed the RBA's decision to cut rates.</p>
<p>Treasurer Peter Costello said the easing was good for jobs and called on commercial banks to pass on the cut in full to their customers.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Bank quickly sliced its variable mortgage rate to a 30-year low of 7.20 percent from 7.55 percent. Other banks were expected to follow its lead, which in turn promised to put more money into home owners' pockets and support consumer spending.</p>
