<p>While politicians honoured Mexico's Press Freedom Day at a lunch on Friday, security guards scuffled with reporters and blocked their entry to the event, news agency Notimex said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Reporters were told they could not enter the lunch, attended by about 300 newspaper owners, directors and editors, Notimex said.</p>
<p>Guards grabbed the blouse of one female reporter and violently shoved some photographers to keep them from entering the lunch, it said.</p>
<p>Candidates for Mexico City mayoral race spoke at the event to members of the Mexican Daily Newspaper Association on the importance of respecting the media.</p>
<p>President Ernesto Zedillo said earlier in the week he had begun an investigation to look into recent attacks by his personal military bodyguards on his press pool.</p>
