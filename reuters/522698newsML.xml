<p>Fifteen people were killed and 31 injured in a plane crash on Saturday on the Indonesian island of Belitung, officials said.</p>
<p>The official Antara news agency said a Merpati Nusantara Airlines twin turbo-prop aircraft with 48 passengers and five crew crashed short of the Buluh Tumbang airport on Belitung, 400 km (250 miles) north of Jakarta at about 8:00 a.m. (0100 GMT).</p>
<p>The aircraft was on a flight to Belitung from Jakarta.</p>
<p>Antara quoted an airline spokesman in Jakarta as saying there were only 48 passengers on the British Aerospace ATP aircraft's flight manifest, including two children and two babies, and not 52 as earlier reported by the agency.</p>
<p>Antara quoted Merpati spokesman Tondo Widodo as saying 15 people, including four crew members, had been killed.</p>
<p>It earlier had said 18 people died. Hospital officials on Belitung also said 15 had died.</p>
<p>&quot;Forty-six people were admitted to hospital. Fifteen have died,&quot; a doctor at the Belitung general hospital told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still observing them and we do not yet have information on how many are seriously injured or have medium or light injuries,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears there were only people from Jakarta and Belitung, but the data on the victims is not yet complete,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Merpati released a full passenger list but could not immediately identify the dead, except for the 28-year-old pilot Bartholomeus Suwardi, his co-pilot Imamthu Susmono, 21, technician Agus Supriyadi, 28 and stewardess Kramatiningsih, 21.</p>
<p>Search and rescue officials in Jakarta said the cause of the crash was not yet known. But they said the plane had broken into three sections upon impact.</p>
<p>Antara quoted the South Sumatra provincial administration as saying Transport Minister Haryanto Dhanutirto had already carried out an initial examination at the site of the accident.</p>
<p>Last December, 18 people died when a twin-engined Casa-212 plunged through the roof of a gas factory in the South Kalimantan provincial capital Banjarmasin.</p>
