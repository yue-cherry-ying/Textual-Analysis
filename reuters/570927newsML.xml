<p>Crude oil prices moved within a narrow range in Asia on Thursday with trading in the physical market dull due to a lack of firm buying interest, market participants said.</p>
<p>June cash Brent was notionally assessed at $18.10/18.20 per barrel in late afternoon Tokyo trading.</p>
<p>On SIMEX, June Brent was last traded at $18.10 and was indicated at $18.11/18.15.</p>
<p>In the physical market there were vague rumours of deals done for June barrels of Oman and Lower Zakum.  </p>
<p>A European major was believed to have sold a June Lower Zakum, while South Korea was rumoured to have purchased a June Oman but details of the deals were unavailable.</p>
<p>June barrels of Qatari crudes are believed to have all found homes, traders said.</p>
<p>Some European majors are believed to hold a few more June Abu Dhabi cargoes, but the light gradea are failing to attract much interest from potential buyers, traders said.</p>
<p>Some traders blamed the lack of interest on high domestic stocks of oil products such as kerosene and gas oil.  </p>
<p>Moreover, China appears to have made large purchases of West African crudes sapping its appetite for Middle East and regional grades, traders said.</p>
<p>In the Asian crudes, traders said a 150,000-barrel May Minas had been sold by a Japanese trader to China earlier this month at a premium of 18 cents to the official selling price.</p>
<p>China was also believed to have bought 600,000-barrels of May Tapis at daily market assessments plus 40 cents, traders said.</p>
