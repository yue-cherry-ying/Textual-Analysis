<headline>COMEX copper ends touch lower ahead of holiday.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>COMEX copper settled slightly weaker Friday, ending a week of strong gains from three straight sessions of fresh life-of-contract highs in most-active July contract amid dwindling stocks, dealers said.</p>
<p>Copper prices are now at their best since just before the Sumitomo scandal broke last June.</p>
<p>July COMEX copper settled 0.20 cent weaker at 118.75 cents a lb, traded  119.25 to 117.70 cents. Spot May went out 0.75 cent lower at 118.55 cents, ending in contango to July.</p>
<p>&quot;The outlook is quite constructive but we continue to hit resistance as we get close to 120.00 cents,&quot; Bette Raptopoulos said. &quot;Perhaps we will get a little pullback before resuming upside momentum.&quot;</p>
<p>LME cash to three months premium or backwardation, slipped a touch to about $75/$80 by COMEX close.</p>
<p>July COMEX is now inside overbought territory, according to some dealers, with the 9-day RSI at 82 percent and 14-day RSI at 75 percent.</p>
<p>July, in parallel with LME three months, has surged in the past two weeks, the former ending 7.15 cents higher over this period.</p>
<p>A further draw in LME stocks Friday, down 1,325 tonnes to 137,675 tonnes, helped to underpin the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Friday's session was quiet, ending an hour early at 1300 EDT ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, with the exchange closed Monday.</p>
<p>LME will also be shut Monday due to a U.K. public holiday.</p>
