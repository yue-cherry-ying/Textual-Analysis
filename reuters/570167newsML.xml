<headline>US Treasuries open lower amid light trading volume.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>The prices of U.S. Treasury securities opened slightly lower Thursday morning after very light trading volume overnight in Europe.</p>
<p>The bond market has posted losses following last week's runup based on a balanced budget accord being reached and increased optimism that the lack of any signs of inflation were present in the economy. Players also were awaiting details of the budget pact to determine whether substantial cuts would be included.</p>
<p>The only data set for release this session were initial jobless claims at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT.  </p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters expected, on average, that jobless claims would fall to an increase of 334,000 from last week's 347,000 rise. Analysts would look to the weekly data in trying to assess the overall strength of the U.S. labor market as would officials at the Federal Reserve. The Fed's policy-making arm next meets on May 20 and many economists expected it would again raise short-term interest rates by 25 basis points, as it did at last meeting in March.</p>
<p>Also dampening market sentiment was the dollar's erosion overnight following comments by a Japanese government official about possible intervention to support the yen.</p>
