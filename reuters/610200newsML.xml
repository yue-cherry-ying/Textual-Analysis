<p>A trio of German economic reports on Friday showed inflation creeping higher, but analysts dismissed the gains as largely due to one-time factors and stressed that the Bundesbank has no cause for worry.</p>
<p>Economists said that underlying price pressures in Germany remain tame and that inflation should be subdued for the rest of the year, threatening little impact on monetary policy.</p>
<p>Two of the four states whose data is used to compute preliminary west German consumer prices said May inflation climbed from the same level a year earlier, while another report showed that Germany's producer price index climbed in April to a 16-month high.</p>
<p>&quot;This doesn't mean very much for the Bundesbank,&quot; said Stefan Schneider, chief economsit at Paribas in Frankfurt. &quot;To some extent we are seeing month-on-month volatility.&quot;</p>
<p>In Bavaria, consumer prices climbed 1.5 percent in May from a year ago after edging up 1.1 percent in April. In Baden-Wuerttemberg, consumer prices climbed 1.3 percent from May 1996 after gaining 1.1 percent in April.</p>
<p>The two other states that make up the preliminary west German CPI report are expected to publish their data on Monday.</p>
<p>Producer Price Index data, meanwhile, climbed 0.9 percent from a year ago, the fourth successive rise after an 11-month run of falls that ended last December, and the biggest gain since December 1995.</p>
<p>Analysts said consumer price gains were largely due to highly volatile seasonal factors that do not present a long term threat to German price stability.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not much concern because many of the items that caused the rise were short-term factors, such as food products, heating oil and the notorious holiday expenditures,&quot; said Matthias Haffner, economist at BZW in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Economists said they see little threat of sustained price rises, in large part because weak German consumer demand makes it hard for companies to lift prices and because raw material prices are relatively stable.</p>
<p>Economists said markets have even less to fear from the higher inflation figures because price pressures had been weak so far this year and are well below the Bundesbank's pain threshhold.</p>
