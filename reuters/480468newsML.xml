<p>Taiwan's aluminium ingots prices fell to T$49.00 per kg from T$51.00 two weeks ago, reflecting a recent decline in aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange, traders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Taiwan aluminium demand appeared to be increasing as the island's leading aluminium plate maker, China Steel Aluminium Co, a subsidiary of China Steel Corp, reported its March production at over 7,000 tonnes -- a company record high.</p>
<p>Company officials attributed the volume increase to strong demand for aluminium plate from Taiwan's booming electronics industry, a major export sector.</p>
<p>&quot;Our production volume reached a record high in March,&quot; a company official said.</p>
<p>Taiwan imported some 480,000 tonnes of gross aluminium in 1995, up from 450,000 tonnes in 1994. Figures for 1996 were not yet available.</p>
<p>Other basic metals remained unchanged during the latter half of March, but demand could pick up slowly as the government's many economy stimulus plans take effect.</p>
<p>The interior ministry announced on March 27 it was arranging T$61.477 billion in government credits to offer supplementary low-cost loans for first-time homebuyers in a bid to boost the sluggish property market.</p>
<p>Construction remains Taiwan's top sector for basic metals consumption.</p>
<p>Construction shares in Taiwan's stock market rose on Tuesday on preliminary reports of good March sales in the beleaguered property market and investor hopes for better sales in April.</p>
<p>Brokers said construction firms had launched aggressive ad campaigns promoting planned residential buildings worth some T$200 billion, hoping to lure homebuyers into their sales rooms during the March 29-30 and April 4-6 holidays.</p>
<p>Analysts cautioned that the spring promotions take place every year and that it was too soon to know whether a significant housing rebound was taking hold.</p>
