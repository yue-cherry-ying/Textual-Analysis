<title>UK: NWE gasoil dips as futures knock modest prem gains.</title>
<headline>NWE gasoil dips as futures knock modest prem gains.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE gas oil was steady to a touch weaker on Tuesday as marginally firmer premiums for several grades failed to offset a slide in IPE futures.</p>
<p>April IPE gas oil last traded at $165.50, down $1.25 having spent much of the day flat or 25 to 50 cents down.</p>
<p>Traders said business was quiet.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very slow, partly because people got their requirements out of the way last week (before the Easter holiday weekend),&quot; said one trader. Heating oil barge premiums were about 50 cents firmer with trades done at April IPE flat fob ARA and at April IPE +50 cents for first half April.</p>
<p>Russian cargo premiums were also about 50 cents stronger, with offers pegged around April IPE +$2 cif NWE although nearly all prompt material has been done.</p>
<p>The arb to Asia is workable into May, say traders, but there remained growing concern that this eastwards trade may collapse.</p>
<p>FOD was still scarce in NWE and buying interest was modest. A late trade last week indicated levels were now around April IPE +$2-4 cif NWE.</p>
<p>DIN lost ground after last week's very strong April +$7.50 cif. &quot;The buyer who was supporting that market is no longer backing it,&quot; commented one trader.</p>
