<p>European Union (EU) council of ministers' chairman said on Tuesday he believed a meeting in Malta this month would be useful in helping resolve Middle East problems.</p>
<p>Hans van Mierlo, who is also Dutch foreign minister, told reporters in Algiers: &quot;We are happy that the Arab countries decided last night to take part in the Malta conference. This conference will play a useful role for the Middle East.&quot;</p>
<p>Ministers from the EU and the south Mediterranean, including Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, the Palestinian Authority and Israel, are due to meet in Malta on April 15 and 16 to assess progress in the Euro-Med Partnership agreed in Barcelona in 1995.</p>
<p>Arab-Israeli relations have plummeted since Israel last month started building a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem. On Monday the Arab League recommended freezing links with Israel and reactivating a trade boycott.</p>
<p>But van Mierlo said: &quot;I do not believe it useful to freeze relations with Israel.&quot;</p>
<p>He was speaking shortly after holding talks with Algerian President Liamine Zeroual on cooperation with Algeria ahead of the Malta forum.</p>
<p>&quot;For us, Algeria is very important as a partner but also because we share together the responsibility of the Malta conference as co-sponsors...,&quot; van Mierlo said.</p>
<p>Algeria is spokesman for the Arab group involved in the Barcelona partnership.</p>
<p>The EU delegation also held talks with Algerian officials on Algeria's negotiations with the EU on an association accord which will open the Algerian economy to competition in a Mediterranean free zone by the year 2010, the Algerian state-run radio said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will listen, talk and try to have Algeria's analysis on the evolution of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and bilateral negotiations,&quot; van Mierlo said after arriving in Algiers from Morocco.</p>
<p>He said the EU was looking with interest to Algeria's June 5 parliamentary elections &quot;because political stability would result in improved security&quot;.</p>
<p>European Commission vice-president Manuel Marin was among the European delegation which started its tour in Morocco and is due to visit Tunisia, Malta, Egypt and Turkey, officials said.</p>
