<p>Ivan Pilip, chosen by the centre-right Czech ruling coalition as finance minister on Wednesday to replace Ivan Kocarnik, is an economist and young political mover who hitched his career early to Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.</p>
<p>Pilip, aged 33, rose in 1993 to become the chairman of the small conservative Christian Democratic Union (KDS), a partner in the Klaus-led four-party coalition which came to power after 1992 general elections.</p>
<p>When the KDS merged with Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) ahead of 1996 elections Pilip's new post as a party vice-chairman under Klaus helped lead to his being named education minister in the new cabinet formed last June.</p>
<p>Pilip was named to the finance ministry position after last weekend's resignation of Kocarnik, who bore much of the blame in opinion polls for an economic downturn and poor enforcement of a crime-ridden financial sector.</p>
<p>The appointment of Pilip, who must be formally appointed by Havel, came as a surprise on Wednesday since the ODS leadership had nominated Klaus's chief cabinet adviser, economist Jiri Weigl, as Kocarnik's replacement last Saturday.</p>
<p>Pilip has fought a pitched battle with disgruntled teachers unhappy about the state of the education system.</p>
<p>&quot;In a way, it's replacing one of Klaus's boys with another,&quot; said one Czech market analyst.</p>
<p>The private Czech television station TV Nova reported on Wednesday that Waigl had refused the offer of the ministry post.</p>
