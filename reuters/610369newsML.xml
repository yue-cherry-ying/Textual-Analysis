<p>Istanbul shares eased in quiet trade on Friday amid persisting political worries, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB National-100 closed at 1,467, down four points, or 0.27 percent from Thursday. Over the week, it lost 1.7 percent. Trade volume firmed slightly to 12.03 trillion lira ($86.8 million) from Thursday's 11.01 trillion ($79.6 million).</p>
<p>Brokers said the resignation of a second deputy from the conservative True Path Party (DYP), the junior coalition partner, sparked selling in early afternoon trade and caused the index to fall to a low of 1,447. It rebounded in late trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Such resignations prompted sales at first, but afterwards there was buying on expectations of a new government. But it is not possible to expect a healthy rise until political stability is restored,&quot; sid Erden Gokay from Taksim securities.</p>
<p>DYP deputy Hikmet Aydin gave his resignation in the afternoon after Samil Ayrim stepped down in a row over Islamist activism earlier in the day.</p>
<p>&quot;The thought that the Islamist-led coalition is unraveling negatively affects the market. On the other hand, the expectation of an alternative (secularist) alliance is vague. Therefore, I expect the index to go down towards 1,380 in coming days,&quot; said Serdar Surer from Ekinciler securities.</p>
<p>The market awaits two meetings to be attended by top military generals and Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.</p>
<p>The secularist army had urged the government to take tough measures against rising Islamist activism at a February meeting.</p>
<p>The coalition, ailing since the February meeting survived a censure motion by a close vote in parliament on Tuesday.</p>
