<p>Three U.S. citzens died on Tuesday when a U.S. military cargo plane with 10 people aboard crashed on landing at Tegucigalpa's airport and burst into flames, the U.S. embassy said.</p>
<p>&quot;Three of the North Americans died and seven are alive,&quot; U.S. Embassy spokesman in Honduras, Marti Stell, told Reuters. He said the Hercules C-130 plane had come from Panama and missed the runway on landing, ploughing into a street where it burst into flames.  </p>
<p>In Washington, Army Lt. Col. Stephen Campbell, a Defence Department spokesman, confirmed the death toll and said two of the injured were in &quot;critical condition&quot;.</p>
<p>He said one of the two critically injured crew had a broken back and another had multiple fractures and severe burns. Three of the seven survivors were reported to be in stable condition and two were walking, Campbell said.</p>
<p>He said the C-130 flew out of Howard Air Force Base in Panama. The plane and the crew are attached to the 440th Airlift Wing, an Air Force Reserve unit based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and on temporary duty in Panama. He said the plane was flying routine support missions in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;The crash occurred at about 9:35 a.m. Eastern Time (1435 GMT) and the weather was clear,&quot; he said.</p>
