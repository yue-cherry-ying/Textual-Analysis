<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Tuesday met Chinese President Jiang Zemin and hailed his visit to China as a successful attempt to bolster economic ties between Beijing and Canberra.</p>
<p>&quot;A good thing about the visit is that I brought a very strong business delegation with me,&quot; Howard told Jiang during a meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been able to emphasise the partnership of the government and Australian business community in building a strong relationship with China,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Howard on Monday assured Chinese Premier Li Peng that Canberra wanted close ties with Beijing, but warned that disagreements over human rights could arise.</p>
<p>The prime minister also appealed to Li to release jailed Australian businessman James Peng and said such a move would help relations.</p>
<p>Peng was jailed for 18 years in 1995 for embezzlement. Peng has insisted the charges were trumped up by powerful business rivals trying to gain control of his company.</p>
<p>Diplomats said Howard's visit was intended mainly to boost economic relations, and the prime minister said such ties had been the focus of meetings with senior Chinese leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;We were able to cover all bilateral relations, particularly focused on economic affairs,&quot; Howard told Jiang of his talks with Premier Li Peng the previous day.</p>
<p>Howard and Li on Monday agreed to explore the feasibility of cooperation in finance, insurance and social welfare, the Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>They agreed to hold annual economic and trade meetings at the vice-ministerial level, as well as bi-annual ministerial-level meetings.</p>
<p>Howard arrived in Beijing on Sunday from Shanghai, where he said China's economic boom had presented huge opportunities for Australian firms. He was scheduled to leave Beijing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>China is Australia's fifth-biggest trading partner, with two-way trade worth $6.3 billion in the year to June 30, 1996, but diplomats say there is plenty of room to expand links.</p>
<p>Travelling with the prime minister is a business group that includes representatives of firms that already have a strong presence in the Chinese market as well as companies looking to tap into new areas such as finance.</p>
<p>Howard's visit is also intended to help repair damage to relations from issues including Canberra's military ties with the United States and its welcome last year for exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>Howard had agreed with Chinese Premier Li that China was not a threat to other nations, and said Australia would observe international norms on Tibet, Xinhua said but gave no details.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after the failure of an uprising against Chinese rule.</p>
