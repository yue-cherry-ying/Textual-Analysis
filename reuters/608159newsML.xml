<title>USA: Nasdaq hits new high on small cap strength.</title>
<headline>Nasdaq hits new high on small cap strength.</headline>

<p>Nasdaq shares hit a new high before the Memorial Day holiday as strength in several small capitalization issues and networking stocks offset losses in disk drive makers, traders said.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite gained 17.12 points or 1.25 percent on Friday to close unofficially at 1389.72, surpassing the previous record high of 1388.06 set on January 22.</p>
<p>The Russell 2000, a key index of small capitalization stocks, gained 4.21 point to a new high of 375.67.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been some gains in some small cap names. People have gotten caught in a short squeeze. They got caught short and there was some buying as they tried to square everything up before the holiday weekend,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Advancing issues beat declining issues 2506 to 1623 on total volume of 548 million shares.</p>
<p>Despite gains throughout much of the technology sector, stocks of disk drive companies continued their decline after two brokerages cut their estimates on Seagate Technology Inc, traders said.</p>
<p>Parametric Technology Corp slipped 3 to 44-3/8 after the company said it is comfortable with fiscal 1998 earnings estimates that were less than some expectations.</p>
