<p>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said on Saturday that an &quot;excellent week&quot; of statistics had shown growth in Britain was balanced and not led by consumer demand.</p>
<p>Pointing to figures which showed March producer output prices up 1.0 percent year-on-year and retail sales growth &quot;stabilising at less than three percent per annum&quot;, Clarke said: &quot;That shows growth but balanced rather than consumer-led growth, with low prices for industry and business.&quot;</p>
<p>He told a news conference that borrowing figures released during the week showed Britain was well on course to balance the budget by the year 2000, while inflation data showed there was &quot;low inflation being achieved during strong growth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When next month's figures are published we will know whether we attained our (core inflation) target of 2.5 percent...by the end of this parliament,&quot; he said. Core inflation was an annual 2.7 percent in March.</p>
<p>Clarke said the main opposition Labour Party, which is well ahead in opinion polls and widely expected to win the May 1 election, would jeopardise Britain's economy.</p>
<p>He said Labour would raise taxes and spending in a July budget if it won the election, and abandon the Conservative commitment to balance the budget by 2000.</p>
