<title>CAMBODIA: Khmer Rouge hardliners deny exile deal under way.</title>
<headline>Khmer Rouge hardliners deny exile deal under way.</headline>
<dateline>PHNOM PENH 1997-06-07</dateline>

<p>The political party of Khieu Samphan, the nominal leader of the Khmer Rouge, on Saturday denied reports that hard-line rebels had struck a deal to join the Cambodian government.</p>
<p>Clandestine Khmer Rouge radio broadast a party statement dismissing rumours of an imminent peace deal as &quot;completely exaggerated&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The spokesperson of the National Solidarity Party of His Excellency Khieu Samphan would like to strongly deny there are negotiations, and there is no plan to join forces at all,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Hours after the denial, local radio broadcast comments by co-Premier Hun Sen warning that any negotiations with hard-liners would only revive the decimated guerrilla movement.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand now that (co-Premier) Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party seems to rescue the Khmer Rouge from ruin,&quot; Hun Sen said.</p>
<p>His statements, aired on one of his party's radio stations, were part of an interview on Friday with the Khmer-language service of Radio France Internationale.</p>
<p>Earlier this week a senior military commander loyal to Ranariddh told the Cambodia Daily newspaper that he was concluding an agreement with the Khmer Rouge, architects of the 1975-1979 &quot;killing fields&quot; regime.</p>
<p>Under the reported agreement, nominal Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan would be allowed to enter politics while notorious rebel Pol Pot and two other senior commanders would abandon their last jungle stronghold and go into exile. Rank-and-file troops would join the government.</p>
<p>Ranariddh said on Friday no deal had been worked out yet, but he earlier welcomed the prospect of exile for Pol Pot.</p>
<p>Hun Sen said such a deal would be inappropriate because the hardliners were occupying their jungle territory illegally, had little military might and possessed no bargaining power.</p>
<p>&quot;The Khmer Rouge is kneeling down. It cannot stand any longer on military means, so it is not necessary to give amnesty (to rebels)...,&quot; Hun Sen said.</p>
<p>&quot;Prince Norodom Ranariddh is taking the wrong route by using Khmer Rouge Khieu Samphan as a political counterweight to us,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Khieu Samphan's party has said it would support Ranariddh's political alliance, exacerbating poor relations between Ranariddh and Hun Sen.</p>
<p>The two leaders, who formed an uneasy coalition government following U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993, have been feuding over power-sharing and have competed to lure Khmer Rouge defectors to their own ranks.</p>
