<title>SOUTH AFRICA: S.Africa rand/bonds closing report.</title>
<headline>S.Africa rand/bonds closing report.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>The South African rand clung to weaker levels in subdued late afternoon dealings, off its earlier lows and taking a breather after a hefty dollar order in the morning knocked it out of its recent steady range.</p>
<p>Bonds retraced from their earlier softer levels on short-covering by professional players and as the rand steadied.</p>
<p>At 1428 GMT the rand was at 4.4700/4730 on the dollar from 4.4535/4565 late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange dealers said the rand's slide to a two-month low of 4.4795 bid earlier was prompted by South African firm Illovo Sugar Ltd's purchase of Lonrho Sugar Corp from U.K-based Lonrho Plc for over 1.6 billion rand, foreign exchange dealers said.</p>
<p>The slide through the 4.47 had drawn the Reserve Bank into the market, a move confirmed by the bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank did phone around to ask for prices,&quot; Bertus van Zyl, the Reserves Bank's general manager of international banking told Reuters.</p>
<p>Local market leader Illovo Sugar Ltd said on Thursday it had agreed to buy Lonrho Plc's entire 94.25 percent shareholding in Lonrho Sugar Corp Ltd for 13.90 rand per share in cash, or 1,623.7 million rand.</p>
<p>But once the deal had passed through the market, brisk trade died down.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the deal was executed things calmed down considerably,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>A weaker dollar in Europe also boosted the rand.</p>
<p>A retracement back to stronger levels was, however, capped around 4.4680, where dollar buyers again emerged, dealer said.</p>
<p>The local currency was seen in a range of 4.4600-4.4750 on Friday. &quot;Once you get near 4.48 then its looking too toppish,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Against the crosses, the rand was last substantially firmer against sterling at 7.2224/2412 from 7.2872/2966 late on Wednesday. On the mark the local currency was trading at 0.3828/3831 from 0.3861/3866 before, and at 27.7111/7520 yen from 28.0570/0871 yen previously.  </p>
<p>On the bond market, the key R150 bond retraced from earlier weaker levels in the afternoon on jobber short-covering and as the rand regained some of its composure.</p>
<p>The R150 was last at 14.920 percent, unchanged from late Wednesday after earlier spiking to 14.99 percent -- a level last seen on April 22 -- on the slide in the rand.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was a little bit short which kept it failing at the higher levels and took it back to where it was late yesterday,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was in a &quot;confusing&quot; state with direction difficult to pinpoint. Views differed on a range for Friday with some pegging it at between 14.90 and 14.98 percent while others were more bullish at between 14.87 and 14.94.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a difficult market to call. The fundamentals are looking positive, but technically it's a bit dicey,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said the market would eye the U.S. Treasury bond overnight, which in late dealings had firmed after earlier weakness to trade at 6.94 percent after flat U.S. jobless claims released at 1230 GMT.</p>
<p>The Bond Exchange said foreigners were net buyers of 139.93 million rand's worth of South African bonds on Wednesday after selling 185.34 million rand's worth on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nominal cumulative volumes amounted to 9.18 billion rand from 6.39 billion rand previously.</p>
<p>On the money market major banks kept their three month deposit rates steady at between 16.40 to 16.45 percent offered, while the 90-day BA rate was also unchanged at between 15.80 to 15.95 percent.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank said the money market shortage fell to 8.908 billion rand on Wednesday after sliding to 9.502 billion on Tuesday.</p>
