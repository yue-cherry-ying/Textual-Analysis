<p>Princess Diana reprimanded a member of her staff and sacked him as an official spokesman on Friday after he told a newspaper she was furious with her children's former nanny, Tiggy Legge-Bourke.</p>
<p>The ex-wife of heir to the throne Prince Charles took the action after her staff conducted an investigation into a story in the top-selling Sun tabloid.</p>
<p>&quot;The Princess discovered that The Sun had accurately reported the official's remarks about Miss Tiggy Legge-Bourke but his comments did not, in fact, reflect the Princess's own opinions,&quot; the Sun and lawyers Mishcon de Reya said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The member of staff will no longer act as an official spokesman for Diana, The Princess of Wales,&quot; the statement, which did not name the staff member, added.</p>
<p>The Sun had reported that the Princess was angry with Legge-Bourke for joining her 14-year-old son, Prince William, on a picnic during parents' day at Eton, Britain's most prestigious private school at which he is a pupil.</p>
<p>Prince Charles and Princess Diana both stayed away from the event for fear that the publicity surrounding their visit might spoil the occasion for other pupils and their families.</p>
<p>The Sun quoted the Princess as saying of Legge-Bourke, who also used to look after her younger son Prince Harry: &quot;She has made an idiot of herself publicly.&quot;</p>
<p>According to London's Evening Standard, the Princess was &quot;more than pleased&quot; that Legge-Bourke had been able to join her son at Eton.</p>
