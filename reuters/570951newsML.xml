<p>Seoul stocks closed lower on Thursday on jitters over corporate financial troubles sparked by a textile maker's debt default news, brokers said.</p>
<p>Blue chips fell as institutional investors took to the sidelines. Hansol Group affiliates recovered early losses that were a result of Wednesday's negative newspaper report.</p>
<p>The composite index ended down 0.64 percent, or 4.41 points, at 684.69 after ranging from 682.73 to 690.44.</p>
<p>Affiliates of the troubled Jinro Group sharply rose in an immediate rebound following Wednesday's sharp declines.  </p>
<p>The Jinro Group, struggling under heavy debts, has put some of its property and affiliates on sale to raise cash.</p>
<p>&quot;Bargain hunting set in as the index approached the 680 level that many investors saw as a strong support level,&quot; said Koh Soon-shik of LG Securities.</p>
<p>Brokers saw the market rebounding on Friday in response to a three-percent drop over the past four consecutive trading days.</p>
<p>Five of seven listed Hansol units ended flat after staying in negative territory for most of the day. The group was hit by news reports it had managed a seven billion won fund on behalf of an associate of President Kim Young-sam's son.  </p>
<p>Hansol, the nation's 16th largest industrial conglomerate, has denied the reports.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of share prices of Hansol firms, the impact from the news seems to have been reflected enough,&quot; said Lim Chong-woo of Ssangyong Investment and Securities.</p>
<p>Ke Mong Sa Publishing rose 2,700 won to its limit of 36,600. A company official said it was negotiating with a Japanese electronics maker to import infrared consumer devices.</p>
<p>Hyundai Motor was unmoved by a spokesman's remarks that its chances had improved to win approval to build a joint venture plant in Vietnam.  </p>
<p>Hyundai lost 100 won to close at 21,300. Hyundai, which is seeking a 65 percent stake in the venture, plans to build a plant with an annual capacity of 10,000 vehicles.</p>
<p>Textile maker Yu Sung Co filed for court receivership on Tuesday after defaulting on debt payments. Yu Sung's troubles rekindled concerns about other shaky companies.</p>
<p>Trading of Yu Sung shares was suspended through Thursday.</p>
<p>Brokers forecast stocks backed by rich assets, those that are targets of possible takeover bids and those with strong earnings growth potential would be in demand on Friday.</p>
