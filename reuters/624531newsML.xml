<p>At the EU's Council of Ministers building on Wednesday the Greek singer Nana Mouskouri seemed in no mood for singing, and neither did anyone else for that matter.</p>
<p>Visiting Brussels during a break in a hectic U.S. tour, she was there in her capacity as Greek member of the European Parliament to finalise the conciliation procedure with the Council on the Ariane cultural programme.</p>
<p>Instead of bursting into song at the accord on the two-year, seven-million-Ecu programme to promote the translation and distribution of books in the EU's lesser-known languages, she sped off in a chauffeur-driven car to Paris, hopped on a plane to Las Vegas and resumed her schedule of concerts in America's grand concert halls and casinos.</p>
<p>If it was no singing matter, it was because the parliament was bitter about Ariane and a second cultural programme Raphael.</p>
<p>The Council of Ministers had severely scaled down the budget for the two programmes, and with the Council having to take its decision by unanimity, there was no real room for discussion, European Parliament deputies complained bitterly on Thursday.</p>
<p>For Ariane, delayed for more than two years, the Council had scaled down the budget to seven million Ecus over two years rather than the 34 million Ecus originally proposed by the European Commission.</p>
<p>With any Council move needing unanimity, there was no room to negotiate and Mouskouri decided to accept what was on offer to get the heavily delayed programme on the rails.</p>
<p>On Raphael, aimed at protecting the EU's cultural heritage, the parliament refused to accept the 30 million Ecus over four years on offer from the Council. Germany had blocked any Council move towards the parliament position.</p>
<p>Unless agreement is reached within six weeks, Raphael will have to go back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>Marcelino Oreja, the European Commissioner responsible for the intergovernmental conference, and also cultural policy, said he was &quot;very very upset&quot; at the Council's attitude to cultural matters.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem is that the decisions are taken by unanimity,&quot; Oreja told Reuters, vowing to press on with plans to increase the use of majority voting at the EU treaty review which should wind up at the bloc's June 16-17 Amsterdam summit.</p>
<p>The chairman of the parliament's Culture Committee, Peter Pex, told reporters on Thursday the need for unanimity on cultural matters made a mockery of the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very disappointed in this process,&quot; he said. &quot;Conciliation means you talk with each other to get agreement,&quot; he said, saying that was impossible if one country could block a Council move.</p>
