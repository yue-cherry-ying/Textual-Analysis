<p>Roman Catholic bishops in Albania have called for elections later this month to be free and fair in order to restore peace in the tormented Balkan state, the Vatican said on Friday.</p>
<p>The Albanian Bishops' Conference said in a statement, dated June 11 and released through the Vatican on Friday, it hoped the June 29 elections would end recent violence.</p>
<p>&quot;As the Church, we are in favour of an electoral campaign without hate and divisions, without tricks and scorn, but with tolerance and harmony,&quot; the bishops' statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Throughout the turmoil lived by the Albanian people in recent months, we, as God's spiritual pastors, have told them to avoid destructive violence and to substitute it with harmony, reconciliation, tolerance and dialogue.&quot;</p>
<p>Albania slid into chaos in February after dubious pyramid investment schemes collapsed, wiping out the savings of entire families.</p>
<p>Parts of Albania -- especially in the south -- remain effectively out of government control after protestors angry with the financial fiasco raided state ammunition depots.</p>
<p>Many Albanians have blamed the penury resulting from the crash on President Sali Berisha.</p>
<p>He agreed under international pressure in March to set up a national unity government, headed by Prime Minister Bashkim Fino of the main opposition Socialist Party, to lead Albania to the early general elections.</p>
<p>Italy is heading a United Nations-endorsed multinational force which has a mandate to protect humanitarian aid convoys and guard international observers to this month's polls.</p>
