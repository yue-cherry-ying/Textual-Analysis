<p>Police in Florida received &quot;very important&quot; information in their manhunt for the alleged serial killer and homosexual prostitute accused of murdering Italian fashion king Gianni Versace, a spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But the whereabouts of Andrew Cunanan, one of America's most wanted men even before the Versace slaying, were still not known and police admitted he could have fled the state.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now we are looking at things we believe are very important,&quot; Miami Beach police spokesman Al Boza told reporters. &quot;Unfortunately what's taking place right now cannot be made public because it's very sensitive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that he's still within the state of Florida but that's not a fact right now...We believe that we are moving forward.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the information could include videos from surveillance cameras at Versace's mansion or nearby establishments but declined to be specific.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very large manhunt, it's an intense manhunt,&quot; Jim Chambliss, chief of investigations at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, said earlier.</p>
<p>FBI Special Agent in Charge Paul Philip said the hunt for Cunanan was concentrating on the Miami area.</p>
<p>&quot;He might not be able to (flee)...It's quite possible he might be holed up some place.&quot;</p>
<p>Cunanan was wanted in four previous murders, including that of his former male lover, during a two-week, cross-country killing spree that began in Minneapolis in April.</p>
<p>Maureen Orth, a writer working with Vanity Fair magazine, told NBC television on Wednesday that friends of Cunanan said he had met Versace once backstage at the San Francisco opera and that the designer appeared to recognise him.</p>
<p>Police said they did not know if Versace, a homosexual, had any relationship with Cunanan.</p>
<p>Versace, who dressed the world's most beautiful people, was shot twice in the head on the steps of his Miami Beach mansion by a lone gunman on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Miami Beach Police Chief Richard Barreto said Cunanan &quot;was laying in wait for him ... it appears to me that this was a planned event ... an execution-type incident.&quot;</p>
<p>Chambliss told Reuters that police had not recovered the murder weapon. A local television channel said though that police believed it was the same handgun allegedly used by Cunanan to kill his former lover David Madson in April.</p>
<p>Versace's sister Donatella, a respected designer in her own right, visited her brother's mansion and later left in a limousine, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Boza said Versace's body had been released to his family.</p>
<p>The Italy-America Chamber of Commerce and city authorities planned a Mass in honour of Versace on Friday in Miami Beach which would be open to the public.</p>
<p>Residents of the Beach, usually a pulsating playground for models, fun-seekers and tourists, did not wait to pay their respects though.</p>
<p>Groups of sombre onlookers kept vigil outside the wrought-iron gates of Versace's luxury Mediterranean-style mansion on Ocean Drive.</p>
<p>They built a shrine of flowers and candles on the steps where he had slumped dead, blood pouring from two head wounds, after the killer struck.</p>
<p>Shock and disbelief reverberated from the cafes and model agencies of Miami Beach, an area he helped revitalise, to the capitals of the fashion world over which he reigned.</p>
<p>Versace, 50, symbolised Italian fashion to the world and dressed the likes of Diana, singers Madonna, Sting and Elton John, and actresses Demi Moore and Liz Hurley. He had built a multimillion-dollar empire after learning the basics of fashion from his mother.</p>
<p>He was killed as he walked home after buying magazines at the News Cafe on Ocean Drive, a beach-front street of renovated art deco hotels and trendy restaurants.</p>
<p>The killer ran away and several hours later police named Cunanan as the sole suspect. Barreto said a red truck found by police in Miami after the killing belonged to Cunanan's last alleged victim, a New Jersey cemetery caretaker shot dead in May.</p>
<p>Police said Cunanan was armed and dangerous and warned gays and lesbians in particular to be on guard.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears that on occasion he frequents places where gay folks hang out,&quot; Philip said. &quot;Nobody's safe in this. Everybody's at risk. Everybody's got to help us put this guy in jail.&quot;</p>
