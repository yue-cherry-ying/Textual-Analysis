<p>In the heart of Milan's bustling fashion world the windows of one shop were stripped bare of their gorgeous finery on Wednesday. Instead a simple, black-edged card read &quot;Closed for Mourning.&quot;</p>
<p>The window looked out over Via Montenapoleone, the very place where murdered fashion king Gianni Versace first made his mark in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Versace, killed by a lone gunman outside his Miami Beach summer house on Tuesday, kept the headquarters of his multi-million dollar business in Milan.</p>
<p>Despite critics who said his work was too popular and informal to achieve greatness, he came to symbolise Italian fashion and dressed the likes of Diana, Princess of Wales, singers Madonna, Sting and Elton John, and actresses Demi Moore and Liz Hurley.</p>
<p>&quot;We are surprised and stunned, the death of Versace is a big loss, something will change forever in Italian fashion,&quot; said a Japanese tourist outside the shop's locked front door.</p>
<p>Sales assistants were on duty in another Versace boutique further along Via Montenapoleone, but the doors remained closed there too and three mannequins starkly clad in white clothes were all that was to be seen in the window.</p>
<p>Burly security men stood guard outside Versace's Milan home in nearby Via Gesu, which also served as his workshop.</p>
<p>&quot;We have nothing to say, we are here to do our jobs,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>The street was deserted apart from two young women peering through the gates for a glimpse of the courtyard beyond.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a trauma for us, we have come here to a place we have visited many times when the fashion shows are on. Let's hope that the Versace style will live on, that's the way he would have wanted it,&quot; one of the women said.</p>
