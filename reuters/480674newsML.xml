<title>ITALY: No Italy pension reform talks before '98 - Cofferati.</title>

<p>Debate between government, industry and unions on general reforms to Italy's welfare system can start this year but talks on pensions cannot start until 1998, trade union federation leader Sergio Cofferati said.</p>
<p>The government must also hold bilateral talks with unions and with industry rather than trying to sit all three parties around the same table, CGIL trade union federation leader Cofferati said in an interview with daily Corriere della Sera.</p>
<p>Cofferati said he wanted a proposal from the government setting out what they wanted to do in terms of all aspects of reforms to the social state, including pensions.</p>
<p>&quot;But while discussion on all the other points can start immediately, the pensions chapter must be left until last because a reform passed in 1995 is still underway and still has to be completed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1997 we are ready to discuss the welfare state in its entirety,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The negotiations can be timetabled in such a way that first of all the general framework is dealt with and then the individual chapters, leaving the one on pensions until last.&quot;</p>
<p>The Italian cabinet last week approved a package for 15.5 trillion lire of additional budget-deficit cutting measures this year which has drawn criticism from industry and opposition alike for not addressing structural reforms to state spending.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi, speaking after the budget was unveiled last week, said an eventual reform will be enshrined in the 1998 budget although he expects an uphill battle.</p>
<p>Unions have consistently said the pensions system cannot be touched before 1998, as agreed in a previous pension reform deal worked out in 1995.</p>
