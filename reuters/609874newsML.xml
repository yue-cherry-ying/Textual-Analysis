<p>----------------- VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - May 23 --------------</p>
<p>* Crude markets will look increasingly to NYMEX unleaded gasoline for a lead as Memorial Day in the U.S. on Monday traditionally marks the start of the gasoline season.</p>
<p>* The front-month continuation chart for heating oil has become fairly congested over the past few days, but there are few signs that prices will drop back to fully fill the gap down between 58.07 and 54.04 cents, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>NYMEX crude and heating oil futures continued to seek a lead from unleaded gasoline as thinning trading volumes see momentum on both markets slowing, brokers and analysts said.</p>
<p>Futures brokers said crude markets will look increasingly to NYMEX unleaded gasoline for a lead as Memorial Day in the U.S. on Monday traditionally marks the start of the gasoline season.</p>
<p>NYMEX gasoline prices peaked to around 77.70 cents a gallon at the end of April last year as traders stocked up ahead of driving season demand but similar gains have yet to be seen for this season, although there appears to be little on the charts to block a move up and fundamentals are at least supportive if not bullish, analysts said.</p>
<p>Tom Bentz, analyst at High Yield Analytics in New York, believes crude oil is starting to look for direction in the unleaded gasoline market, as gasoline begins its peak demand season.</p>
<p>&quot;It's gasoline season. If gas is going to lead anything, this is the time,&quot; Bentz said.</p>
<p>NYMEX ACCESS trade saw June unleaded gasoline 0.38 cent a gallon lower at around 66.65. July crude was last done at $21.75 a barrel, off 11 cents, and heating oil 0.35 cent a gallon down at 57.45 cents.</p>
<p>Fenella Graham at MeesPierson Derivatives Limited said, &quot;The longer these markets fail to push decisively upward and soon, the greater the chance of a retest of the lower end of the ranges to find support, as the longs are quietly withering on the vine&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Gas oil and unleaded lead the way up so we look to them to provide this momentum (for crude) soon,&quot; Graham added.</p>
<p>The front-month continuation chart for heating oil has become fairly congested over the past few days as the recent low volume sessions have seen upside momentum slowing and trading ranges narrowing, but there are few signs that prices will drop back to fully fill the gap down between 58.07 and 54.04 cents from the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>On the fundamental side narrower crack margins for products after crude's recent run-up is causing some refiners to think about cutting crude runs. This could start to put some pressure on crude.</p>
<p>The market believes the supply of crude oil is currently adequate, but efforts to trade crude to lower prices have been thwarted in part by nagging concerns about conflict in Iraq between Iraqi Kurds and Turkish government forces.</p>
