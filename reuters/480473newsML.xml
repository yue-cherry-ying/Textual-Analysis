<p>A senior official of the Philippine Central Bank on Tuesday said interest rates are likely to stabilise at current levels following the recent slide of the benchmark 91-day Treasury bill rate to single-digit levels.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they (the 91-day rates) will stabilise at current levels,&quot; said Central Bank managing director for research Amando Tetangco in a interview with a local television programme.</p>
<p>&quot;While interest rates may go down, they should probably go down not that much,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>He said that view explains why the Central Bank dropped its overnight borrowing and lending rates last Wednesday by a slight 0.1 percentage point.</p>
<p>&quot;It's always some kind of balancing act the Central Bank has to perform. While low interest rates are conducive to increasing investments and output, we also believe interest rates should not be too low such that they can generate inflationary pressure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The 91-day T-bill rate fell to 9.498 percent on Monday from 9.724, continuing a three-week decline. This rate was last in single-digit levels in September 1995.</p>
