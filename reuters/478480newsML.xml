<headline>Opposition picks Mobutu rival as Zaire premier.</headline>

<p>Zaire's bickering opposition said on Tuesday it had nominated an arch-foe of President Mobutu Sese Seko as the country's new prime minister.</p>
<p>After a week of bitter wrangling the USORAL opposition alliance voted overwhelmingly for the appointment of veteran politician Etienne Tshisekedi as replacement for prime minister Kengo wa Dondo, who resigned a week ago.</p>
<p>&quot;We have just designated Mr Tshisekedi wa Malumba as prime minister,&quot; USORAL leader Frederic Kibassa told the pro-Mobutu presidential Movement in parliament.</p>
<p>Presidential Movement leader Idambituo Bakata indicated Mobutu would endorse the appointment of the man he sacked as prime minister in December 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to express my great joy, the joy, I think, of all the nation, for the simple fact that today you have given us a conclusion that many of our citizens were waiting for,&quot; Bakata said on the nomination.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi, 64, has huge popular support in Zaire and has long favoured talks with rebels who have seized a quarter of the country since taking up arms last October.</p>
<p>But with rebels keeping up pressure on the battlefield while preparing for negotiations, even some of Tshisekedi's staunchest supporters say he could be Mobutu's last prime minister.</p>
<p>Rebel leader Laurent Kabila has made clear that he will not accept politicians who collaborate with Mobutu in a transitional government Kabila hopes will be formed after negotiations due to start in South Africa at the weekend.</p>
<p>Under Zaire's transitional constitution, the presidential movement which forms the majority in parliament, has to approve the nomination before Mobutu formally signs it into law.</p>
<p>Senior politicians in both camps said they expected the nomination to sail through both stages.</p>
<p>Parliament voted nearly two weeks ago to oust Kengo, a part-Tutsi who has been widely denounced for weakness in dealing with the rebellion spearheaded by ethnic Tutsis.</p>
<p>Banyamulenge Tutsis took up arms in October after local authorities tried to expel them to their ancestral homeland in Rwanda. Rebels have captured key towns in east and south Zaire.</p>
