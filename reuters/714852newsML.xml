<p>The development of small and medium-sized enterprises is the key to improving the living standards of most people in Asia and Europe, Indonesian President Suharto said in opening a business conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Suharto said in a speech opening the three-day Asia-Europe Business Conference the meeting was part of the closer cooperation between the two regions seen since the first Asia-European Leaders Meeting (ASEM) in March 1996.</p>
<p>He said it was appropriate for the conference to focus on four pillars: small and medium business, improving trade and investment facilitation, the future direction of the Asia-Europe business relationship and business match making.</p>
<p>Conference organisers refused to give journalists full details of the participants.</p>
<p>&quot;The concern over the need to develop small and medium size enterprises should be underlined and intensified, to really open the opportunities to small and medium size business communities in the two regions, through the development of supporting industries,&quot; Suharto said.</p>
<p>&quot;The proper and sustainable development of small and medium size enterprises will spur expanded employment opportunities in the two regions that create an increasingly improved well-being and a more solid stability,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In other words, the development of small and medium size enterprises will have a direct impact on the improvement of the living standards of the majority of people,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Suharto asked the conference to come up with ideas and recommendations on how small and medium size enterprises could overcome the limitations they face in capturing capital, technology and markets.</p>
<p>Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Production and Distribution Hartarto told the opening ceremony the meeting was an opportunity to develop and explore new opportunities for business between the two regions.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the participants of the Asia-Europe Business Conference could render suggestions to their respective governments on what kind of facilitations and investments are still necessary....in order to improve the flow of trade and investment between the two regions,&quot; Hartarto said.</p>
