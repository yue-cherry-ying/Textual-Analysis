<p>The Belgian national Bank is knowingly and willingly keeping the Belgian franc at its current relatively weakened position in the run-up to EMU, Belgian analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;This looks like a conscious strategy (by the BNB),&quot; said Conrad Fieremans at Kredietbank.</p>
<p>At 1350 GMT, the franc was at 20.6425/27 to the mark, well above its ERM midpoint of 20.6255.</p>
<p>&quot;They prefer to have (Belgian) short-term rates above German ones and the franc slightly weaker than to have it the other way round,&quot; Fieremans said.  </p>
<p>He noted Belgian central bank governor Alfons Verplaetse had said in February that he was not happy with the fact that Belgian short-term rates were slightly below German ones.</p>
<p>Fieremans said the central bank appeared to believe a steady bond market was at least as important as steady franc and short-term rates.</p>
<p>&quot;They do not want a crisis of confidence (in bonds),&quot; he said, noting that the OLO/Bund yield spread for 10-year paper was consistently very low. It was at eight basis points, against seven at the close on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Fieremans said the national bank would stick to its policy of tightening money market liquidity to prevent short-term rates from caving in again.</p>
<p>Activity in the OLO market was morose on Friday ahead of a market holiday in the U.S. on Monday.</p>
<p>But Fieremans noted there was barely any covering of positions ahead of the weekend, with no crucial meetings or data coming up now.</p>
<p>Traders remained surprised by the strength of the French franc and bond market ahead of the first round of elections in France. -- Bert Lauwers, Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6815</p>
