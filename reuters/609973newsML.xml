<title>UK: UK's Portillo hopes to replace Bildt in Bosnia job.</title>
<headline>UK's Portillo hopes to replace Bildt in Bosnia job.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain said on Friday that former defence minister Michael Portillo had put his name forward to replace Bosnian mediator Carl Bildt, but diplomats said he stood only an outside chance.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as we are aware he has put his name forward, yes. Clearly we would like to see a British representative,&quot; a government spokesman said.</p>
<p>Western powers are next week due to name a new international High Representative to replace Bildt and take over the thankless task of trying to reconcile Bosnia's hostile factions.</p>
<p>British newspapers said Bildt had been impressed by Portillo when the two men met on duty in Bosnia and later asked the former Conservative minister -- who lost his seat in this month's election -- to be a candidate.</p>
<p>But Western diplomats said the favourite for the post was Carlos Westendorp, the Spanish ambassador to the United Nations. Another outside candidate is said to be Ilka Souminen, former speaker of the Finnish parliament.</p>
<p>It was not possible to contact Portillo for comment.</p>
<p>Bildt, former Swedish prime minister, has had to postpone plans to step down partly because Western countries have had trouble finding a successor.</p>
<p>The new High Representative, who oversees the civilian aspects of the 1995 Dayton accord which ended the war, will have to deal with a country still divided into ethnic strongholds 18 months after the fighting stopped.</p>
<p>Moslem, Croat and Serb representatives have failed to agree on most major issues and the United States has yet to commit itself to extending the mandate of the NATO-led peace force, due to expire in mid-1998.</p>
