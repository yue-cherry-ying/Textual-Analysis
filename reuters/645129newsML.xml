<p>Karl Malone is definitely a &quot;just me and my motorcycle&quot; kind of guy.</p>
<p>The Utah Jazz hero in their Game 3 win over the Chicago Bulls Friday arrived at the Delta Centre on a motorcycle, wearing a black, sleeveless t-shirt -- quite a contrast with the defending champions' luxurious style.</p>
<p>&quot;I think these guys started laughing at me because Michael (Jordan) and Scottie (Pippen) were wearing $5,000 suits when they stepped up here, and I came up here with this,&quot; Malone said at the post-game news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;I had two or three of my Harleys at home today and my little son likes them all. I was going to get on the one that was kind of quiet and he shook his head, he liked the other one,&quot; Malone said, laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the one I rode, because he loves them too and he picked out his favourite one, and I said all right, I'd get on that one.</p>
<p>&quot;People don't always agree with it but those are the things that I like to do away from the court.&quot;</p>
<p>He said it helped him prepare for the game. Something did. He dominated with 37 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and four steals to put the Jazz back in a Finals they looked to be in danger of being swept out of.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now you look for anything to get you going, whether it relaxes your mind or anything like that. And I took the long way here, I normally get here at 4:15, I got here today at five minutes to five.&quot;</p>
<p>He has been getting many suggestions on treating his ailing right hand. &quot;Everybody in America has sent e-mails and all that, which is great, but I needed that Harley ride today,&quot; he said, again laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;And I guarantee you I'm going to take it again on Sunday, too.&quot;</p>
<p>Other people's opinions don't mean much to Malone, who was a goat in Game 1 when he missed two key free throws at the end of a close contest and was the brunt of more criticism when the Jazz had a bad loss in Game 2.</p>
<p>&quot;Down 0-2, people didn't want to talk to you. People wanted to kick you in the rear end, now all of a sudden you won a game and they want to pat you on the back.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to talk to anybody when I leave this room, and I don't want nobody patting me or nothing. I appreciate the compliment, but like I said, one day ago they wanted to wring your neck.&quot;</p>
<p>Malone also was limping after landing hard while snagging a rebound late in the fourth quarter, but he stayed in the game after a timeout.</p>
<p>&quot;It is fine,&quot; the big power forward said. &quot;I played the game and I finished the game and I'll be ready to play on Sunday.&quot;</p>
