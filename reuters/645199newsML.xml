<p>U.S. envoy Bill Richardson called for an end to killings of civilians in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, after President Laurent Kabila said he would help a U.N. probe into reported massacres of refugees.</p>
<p>Richardson, Washington's ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters at a transit camp for Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees, near the eastern city of Kisangani, on Saturday that reports of widespread killings continue.</p>
<p>&quot;All of us, the new government of the Democratic Republic of Congo, its neighbours and the international community have the responsibility to stop the killings of innocent civilians,&quot; Richardson said.</p>
<p>Kabila's take over last month as president of Africa's third largest country, after a seven-month bush war, has been coloured by reports that his soldiers have been systematically killing ethnic Hutu refugees in areas they control.</p>
<p>His Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL) denies massacres took place and Kabila on Saturday gave Richardson his pledge that an enquiry by U.N. human rights investigators would be given every assistance.</p>
<p>An earlier mission to investigate reported massacres was stopped from working by Kabila's soldiers -- many of whom are ethnic Tutsis whose origins lie in Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;We are delighted that President Kabila has made this declaration and we are looking forward to its implementation on the ground, which of course is essential,&quot; said Pierce Gerety, U.N. regional humanitarian co-ordinator.</p>
<p>Richardson said Kabila had agreed that an advance team would arrive in Congo on June 20 so that the investigation could begin on July 7. He also said Kabila had agreed to prosecutions for violations of international law.</p>
<p>The refugees are the rump of over a million who fled Rwanda fearing reprisals in 1994 after Hutu hard-liners slaughtered hundreds of thousands of minority Tutsis.</p>
<p>The U.N. refugee agency says some 815,000 have returned home since last November, while 46,000 have been found and about 247,000 remain unaccounted for.</p>
<p>Tutsis from Rwanda are some of Kabila's main allies. The refugees include many civilians but also fighters of Rwanda's former Hutu army who were blamed for the genocide.</p>
<p>As Richardson left the Kilometre 11 camp that is temporary home to around 2,000 people, another 14 were brought from the bush in a truck.</p>
<p>Most were barely able to walk, on legs that were little more than bones with a loose veil of skin.</p>
<p>Many appeared to have difficulty gripping the blankets and plastic bags of biscuits they were given by aid workers to try and ensure their survival after months in thick forests.</p>
<p>&quot;Every day some come in like this,&quot; U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees protection officer, Katrina Lumpp said. &quot;Our teams go up to 30 km (19 miles) into the forests to find them.&quot;</p>
<p>The number of refugees arriving now is a slow trickle compared to April and May when over 40,000 refugees were repatriated to Rwanda. At least 80,000 refugees were reportedly living near Kisangani before the ADFL arrived in March.</p>
<p>Richardson is heading a team of over a dozen experts from different branches of the U.S. administration, who will brief Kabila's government on international expectations after the overthrow of president of the former Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>He is scheduled to return to the United States on Sunday after a morning meeting with civic groups in Kinshasa.</p>
