<p>Great Lakes Aviation Ltd said it has reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration that will lead to a resumption of flights.</p>
<p>The carrier, which operates as United Express, Midway Connection and Great Lakes Airline, voluntarily suspended all service on May 16.</p>
<p>Great Lakes said that as a result of the tentative agreement, it has begun developing a plan for the resumption of service as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;This is good news for the communities who depend on us and who have been without our service for the past week,&quot; President and Chief Executive Doug Voss said in a statement. &quot;We are hopeful of resuming service to a limited number of communities in the very near future.&quot;</p>
<p>The airline said it expects to gradually resume service as the company completes its inspections of the airline's fleet. The inspections are monitored by the FAA.</p>
<p>Great Lakes voluntarily suspended all flights earlier this month after the FAA told the carrier it faced a suspension of its operating authority due to flying &quot;unairworthy aircraft'.</p>
<p>Great Lakes said earlier this week that the airline and the FAA had thoroughly inspected and approved four of its 53 aircraft, finding no safety discrepancies with any of those planes.</p>
