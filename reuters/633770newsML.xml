<title>JAPAN: Female dominates Tokyo Zoo monkey business.</title>

<p>Crowds are surging into Tokyo's main zoo to see female power at work.</p>
<p>The reason for the excitement is &quot;Aizuhomare&quot;, a female monkey who has broken a 27-year-long male tradition by taking over leadership of the zoo's band of 37 monkeys.</p>
<p>Ueno Zoo curator Osamu Ishida told Reuters that in the zoo's 65-year history, there had only been three times when a female became leader of its band of Japanese macaque monkeys.</p>
<p>Each time female rule lasted for less than a year.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very rare in a zoo and in the wild for a female monkey to be on top of the heap,&quot; Ishida said.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old Aizuhomare, named after a famed Japanese sake or rice wine, fought off challenges by half a dozen younger males to reach the point where she automatically now gets first choice of titbits sightseers throw to the monkeys and grooming privileges from other monkeys.</p>
<p>The fight for leadership was set off earlier this year after the death of Satoimo, a male who had ruled the band.</p>
<p>Ishida said in the final leadership battle, Aizuhomare &quot;swatted&quot; the strongest male just after the pair had mated.</p>
<p>&quot;He never recovered and now Aizuhomare rules,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Since publicising the rise of monkey business feminism, the simians have become the zoo's most popular sight.</p>
<p>Among human onlookers, a battle of the sexes has broken out about whether Aizuhomare's rise is a sign of female power or male weakness.</p>
<p>&quot;Monkeys are our ancestors so if these females here are getting stronger, maybe it also means that Japanese women are getting stronger,&quot; mused 23-year-old Kunion Kawasaki.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not surprised,&quot; sniffed Mami Kaneko, 25. &quot;Most Japanese men are very weak now.&quot;</p>
