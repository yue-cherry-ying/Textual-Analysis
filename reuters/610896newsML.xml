<title>JAPAN: Tokyo palladium futures dive by daily limit.</title>
<headline>Tokyo palladium futures dive by daily limit.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Yen-based Tokyo palladium futures fell sharply on Friday, on aggressive private investor selling triggered by expectations that Russian exports of platinum group metals (PGM) would resume soon, Japanese traders said.</p>
<p>All months except for limitless May fell by their 24 yen per gram daily limit by the close. Benchmark April palladium was off 24 yen to close at 581 yen.</p>
<p>&quot;Private investor selling accelerated in the afternoon as Russia's resumption of PGM exports are now in sight,&quot; a trader said. Platinum prices ended also lower on the heels of palladium, while gold was narrowly mixed.  </p>
<p>A resumption in Russian PGM exports would be bearish for the market, traders said. But prices could stay volatile for a while due to a large overhang of short positions in TOCOM palladium futures and because of overseas funds' commitment to NYMEX and the spot market, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if Russia resumes PGM exports, a possibility remains that palladium could spike higher as overseas funds are seen trying to squeeze TOCOM shorts,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Gold futures moved in tandem with the currency market.</p>
<p>Gold futures ranged from four yen per gram lower to three up. Benchmark April was down one yen at 1,267 yen.  </p>
<p>Spot gold was quoted weaker at $341.75/342.25 per ounce at 0808 GMT, against $342.40/90 in New York on Thursday.</p>
<p>In gold futures, market focus remained on the currency market. &quot;Private investors were seen selling gold when prices rose, assuming that the dollar may weaken again, while spot gold is likely to be sandwiched within a range,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Concerns over possible gold sales by European central banks and strong physical demand below $340 has trapped gold into a range, they said. Benchmark April silver was down 1.9 yen per 10 grams at 175.5 yen.</p>
