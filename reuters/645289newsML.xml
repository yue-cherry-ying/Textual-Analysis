<title>ISRAEL: Israel to revoke VIP pass of PLO security chief.</title>
<headline>Israel to revoke VIP pass of PLO security chief.</headline>
<dateline>JERUSALEM 1997-06-07</dateline>

<p>Israel has decided to revoke the VIP pass it gave a top Palestinian security official, suspecting he was involved in the killing of three Arabs who sold land to Jews, PLO officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>They said the head of Israel's Shin Bet security service, Ami Ayalon, told Palestinian President Yasser Arafat at a meeting in the West Bank on Friday that Tawfiq Tirawi's pass would expire on Sunday.</p>
<p>Tirawi is head of Palestinian intelligence in the West Bank. The pass, given to Palestinian dignitaries under the 1993 PLO-Israel peace deal, allows them to enter the Jewish state freely.</p>
<p>Israel refused to comment on the report.</p>
<p>&quot;I was not involved in any way in the killings of the land dealers, this is absolutely untrue,&quot; Tirawi told Reuters.</p>
<p>Israeli police say they are holding at least four Palestinian security officials involved in the killing of three Arabs who sold land to Jews and have linked the suspects to Tirawi.</p>
<p>The PLO decided last month to activate a Jordanian military law banning the sale of land to Israelis on penalty of death, saying the measure was necessary to prevent Jewish settlement building in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, including Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel has no proof of any sort that the intelligence is involved in the killings. The Palestinian Authority is not involved in any way,&quot; said Amin al-Hindi, head of Palestinian intelligence in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>He said that security officials were only gathering information about land sales to Israelis.</p>
<p>PLO-Israeli peace talks ground to a halt in March after Israel began building a new settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.</p>
<p>The ban on land sales was followed by the killing of three Palestinians who were known to have sold land to Israelis.</p>
<p>Israel and Washington strongly criticised the Authority's ban on land sale.</p>
