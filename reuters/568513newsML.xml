<title>USA: IMM currency futures end mostly higher, off peaks.</title>
<headline>IMM currency futures end mostly higher, off peaks.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Most IMM currency futures finished pit trading higher but off session price peaks.</p>
<p>Late action stayed mainly calm after a busy morning. Price boards estimated daily volume in nearby marks, yen and Swiss francs at 22,000, 20,000 and 18,000 contracts, respectively.</p>
<p>Floor brokers linked the Canadian dollar's late erosion to news that Moody's Investor Services said Thursday it lowered the rating to Aa2 from Aa1 on bonds and notes issues in domestic currency by the Province of British Columbia.</p>
<p>&quot;It hit a new (day's) low on the Moody's news,&quot; said one broker of June Canadian dollars.  </p>
<p>Futures showed muted response to an early-afternoon remark by international financier George Soros, who said he was 75 percent sure European economic and monetary union would start on time on Jan 1, 1999.</p>
<p>Most contracts near Europe's close had popped upward to session peaks, hoisted higher by crosses and technicals that drew buyers in yen and Swiss francs.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's pretty much technical,&quot; said one analyst of the move up. &quot;Yen stabilized and are mainly up in crosses.&quot;</p>
<p>Thin overseas trading conditions on the Ascension Day holiday in parts of Europe helped exaggerate the move.  </p>
<p>But June marks backed off after briefly peeking above resistance the analyst pegged near $0.5881 or 1.7050 spot, with some technicians seeing the day's rise as a selling opportunity.</p>
<p>&quot;We obviously had a good dollar turnaround here,&quot; said a floor chartist. &quot;I still think it's (dollar) going the other way. I'd sell currencies here.&quot;</p>
<p>Yen had risen after overnight comments, later clarified, by Japanese finance ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara.</p>
<p>He said it is possible the yen could rise to 103.00 to the dollar, considering currency fluctuations over the past year.  </p>
<p>He later said his remarks contained no specific intent regarding dollar/yen rate, and Japan vice finance minster Tadashi Ogawa said Sakakibara's comment about 103.00 dollar/yen was not a forecast.</p>
<p>But traders stayed jittery about possible central bank intervention after recent rumors and news stories hinted that the Bank of Japan or Group of Three could intervene.</p>
<p>Sterling corrected a portion of Wednesday's slide after the U.K. Treasury denied a wire report Wednesday that senior U.K. Labour source said U.K. membership in ERM would be more attractive if sterling were closer to the 2.50 mark level.  </p>
<p>June yen ended up $0.000082 at $0.008127, marks rose $0.0039 to $0.5870, Swiss francs rose $0.0063 to $0.6941, Sterling added $0.0036 to $1.6212, Canadian dollar fell $0.0015 to $0.7241, Aussie dollar rose $0.0027 to $0.7794, Mexican peso rose $0.000575 to $0.124550.
