<p>South Korea's finance ministry said on Saturday it had decided to limit some business activities of five life insurance companies because of insufficient capital to cover policies.</p>
<p>A ministry statement said the five were unlisted Dong Ah, Handuk, Hankuk, Kukmin and Daeshin Life Insurance.</p>
<p>The government banned the five companies from issuing retirement pension insurance policies for 1998 and cut their sales of floating rate insurance products by 10 percent.</p>
<p>About 33 life insurers are operating in South Korea, the world's sixth biggest life insurance market.  </p>
<p>Analysts warned many of them were technically insolvent. Concerns over the solvency of South Korean life insurers have been raised in the wake of the 200 billion yen ($1.58 billion) failure in April of Japan's Nissan Mutual Life.</p>
<p>South Korea set the solvency margin requirement for life insurers at one percent over policy reserves, compared with four percent in the U.K.</p>
<p>As 18 life insurers, including the five companies, had a policy reserve shortage totalling 1.44 trillion won at the end of fiscal 1996, ending March, the government ordered them to raise their capital by March, 1997, the statement said.  </p>
<p>But just one life insurer met the government requirement and the remaining 17 were ordered to fulfil their obligation by March, 1998.</p>
<p>The statement said the capital shortage in the five insurers ranged between 50 billion and 100 billion won.</p>
