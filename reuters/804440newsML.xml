<title>UK: Greenpeace ends Atlantic oil rig protest.</title>
<headline>Greenpeace ends Atlantic oil rig protest.</headline>

<p>The environmental protest group Greenpeace said on Sunday it was ending its occupation of a British Petroleum oil rig in the north Atlantic.</p>
<p>Up to seven activists had boarded the Stena Dee floating platform over the past week as part of a campaign to stop new oil exploration in the area.</p>
<p>Greenpeace wants to stop oil exploration on the grounds that burning even existing reserves of fossil fuels will cause irreversible climate change.</p>
<p>Greenpeace said its personnel and equipment were being taken off the rig onto the group's ship, MV Greenpeace.</p>
<p>It denied that its campaign against the Stena Dee, which is heading for the Foinavon oil field about 100 miles north of Scotland, had ended in failure.</p>
<p>Greenpeace UK's Deputy Executive Director, Chris Rose, said safety could no longer be guaranteed if the occupation continued.</p>
<p>&quot;Activists are exhausted and our equipment and material is at its limits after operating continuously in the northeast Atlantic since April,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Greenpeace has also been blocking an Alantic Richfield rig off the Alaskan coast to keep it away from a field in the Arctic Beaufort Sea. A U.S. federal judge on Friday ordered the activists to stay outside a moving safety buffer around the mobile rig.</p>
<p>The blockades, aimed at fighting global warming, are part of Greenpeace's most ambitious campaign yet against the oil industry.</p>
<p>British Petroleum had served writs against the Greenpeace protesters, ordering them to stop their occupation of the Stena Dee.</p>
<p>But the group vowed to continue its campaign against fossil fuels and challenged BP to make solar power affordable for ordinary consumers.</p>
