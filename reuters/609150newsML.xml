<p>Mazda Motor Corp announced sharply higher profits on Friday, with the weaker yen giving earnings an added push, but the firm failed to wipe all the red ink off its balance sheet.</p>
<p>Japan's fifth biggest carmaker, turning in its first set of annual results under president Henry Wallace, managed a surge in profits including investment income, but failed to mount a recovery in its core business.</p>
<p>The automaker posted a parent current profit of 13.90 billion yen ($119 million) in the year to March 1997 compared with 1.23 billion yen ($10.6 million) a year earlier.</p>
<p>It also predicted profits would rise 43 percent in the current business year, galvanised by sales of new models it plans to launch, although analysts were doubtful about whether the targets were realistic.</p>
<p>Wallace, a Briton, took the wheel at Mazda in June after Ford Motor Co raised its stake in the Japanese carmaker to a third in order to gain management control. The first foreigner to head a major Japanese company, he was charged with turning around the firm's troubled finances.</p>
<p>Mazda boosted its 1996/97 earnings despite a marginal fall in parent sales after selling off securities to generate 22.18 billion yen ($191 million) of income. Current profits include losses and gains on investments in stocks and other assets.</p>
<p>On an operating level, a measure of actual business, Mazda remained in the red to the tune of 5.38 billion yen ($46.3 million). It also a predicted an unspecified loss in its consolidated results, which are due to be released next week.</p>
<p>By contrast, Mazda rivals Toyota and Honda both turned in impressive earnings results for 1996/97 on both the current and operating levels, after reaping the benefit of the weaker yen, which has made exports more price-competitive.</p>
<p>&quot;Cost-cutting and the weak yen contributed to an improvement in 1996/97 profits, although we had an increase in car development and sales costs,&quot; said Keiichiro Yoshikawa, a Mazda managing director.</p>
<p>Mazda has no plans to sell securities holdings in the current fiscal year, Yoshikawa said.</p>
<p>Mazda predicted a parent current profit of 20 billion yen ($172 million) in 1997/98 on sales of 1.58 trillion yen ($13.6 billion), up 10.7 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;We have introductions of two new models this year and a series of limited editions are planned aggressively throughout the year,&quot; said Gary Hexter, a senior managing director in charge of business planning.</p>
<p>Mazda used a dollar/yen rate of 115 yen in making earnings estimates for 1997/98, against 112 yen in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Analysts were sceptical about Mazda's chances of meeting its rosy profit forecasts.</p>
<p>&quot;Mazda is unlikely to achieve the targeted profits and sales in 1997/98 because of tough sales competition in the domestic market,&quot; said Nikko Research senior analyst Noriyuki Matsushima.</p>
<p>Mazda forecast a parent operating profit of 25 billion yen ($215 million) for 1997/98, compared with its 5.38 billion yen ($46.3 million) loss for the just-ended year.</p>
<p>Mazda predicted its domestic sales would reach 415,000 units in 1997/98, up 10.1 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Seiji Sugiura, a car industry analyst at Nomura Securities Co's research unit, also expressed doubts about Mazda's upbeat outlook. &quot;It's tough (for Mazda) to achieve the target this year. It (the actual profit figure) is likely to be half Mazda's estimate.&quot;</p>
<p>Nobuaki Yanachi, a senior analyst at Kankaku Research, was similarly sceptical, saying Mazda's operating profit was likely to be about 12 billion yen ($103 million) in 1997/98 if its domestic vehicle production reaches 800,000 units.</p>
<p>Mazda predicted domestic vehicle output would rise 12 percent to 875,000 units in 1997/98, while exports were forecast to rise 8.4 percent to 505,000 units.</p>
<p>&quot;Exports are likely to rise as Mazda planned, but its domestic sales will not reach its target as rival makers are also introducing new, competitive models this year,&quot; Matsushima said.</p>
<p>Analysts were also doubtful about whether Mazda's could reach its targets for cost-cutting this year.</p>
