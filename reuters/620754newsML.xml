<p>The head of Germany's Roman Catholic bishops said on Wednesday he hoped for a quick Vatican decision on what role the Church in his country can play in counselling services for women seeking abortions.</p>
<p>The prelates, led by their conference president Bishop Karl Lehmann, met Pope John Paul and top Vatican officials on Tuesday to discuss the issue which has divided the Church in Germany.</p>
<p>According to German law, a woman who wants an abortion has to discuss her decision first with a counselling service. She can have the abortion afterwards if she wishes.</p>
<p>The Vatican said on Tuesday the Pope met the German prelates at their request &quot;to discuss and explore in an in-depth way how Catholic family counsellors can be correctly involved&quot; in services required by law in Germany.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church in Germany has been split over the issue.</p>
<p>Some bishops say the Church should have no part in a process that could eventually lead to abortion, which the Roman Catholic Church considers murder.</p>
<p>Other bishops say the Church should take the opportunity to to explain the alternatives to abortion, such as adoption.</p>
<p>Lehmann said &quot;no winners or losers&quot; emerged from the Vatican meeting. &quot;The winners will be the life of the unborn and pregnant women who need support,&quot; he told Vatican Radio's German service.</p>
<p>This, he said, was why he hoped the Vatican would make a quick decision.</p>
<p>A Vatican statement on Tuesday said a decision would be made after a careful evaluation of the results of the meeting.</p>
