<p>South Korea's customs-cleared trade deficit widened to $1.88 billion in March from a $446 million deficit a year earlier, provisional figures released by the trade ministry showed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>					 March	Feb    March 96</p>
<p>    Trade balance		 -1,876    -2,088	-446</p>
<p>    FOB Exports		   11,346     9,406    11,689</p>
<p>    CIF Imports		   13,222    11,494    12,135</p>
<p>NOTE: in millions of dollars, February figures revised  </p>
<p>South Korea's customs-cleared trade deficit totalled $7.43 billion in the first three months of this year, up from $4.17 billion in the same 1996 period, the ministry figures showed.</p>
<p>February exports fell 2.9 percent year-on-year, compared with a 16.9 percent increase a year earlier.</p>
<p>Imports in the month rose 9.0 percent year-on-year, against a 4.0 percent growth in February 1996.</p>
<p>A trade ministry statement attributed the huge shortfall to increased imports of oil and slowing overseas shipments of key export items.  </p>
<p>Exports of semiconductors fell by 42.8 percent in March, compared with a 42.4 percent rise a year earlier.</p>
<p>But the statement said semiconductor exports showed signs of improving, aided by a production cut in 16-megabit DRAMs that was pushing up prices. It said the export price of 16-megabit DRAMs rose to $9 in February from $8 in January.</p>
<p>Exports, excluding semiconductors, rose 5.4 percent in March on steady sales of steel and petroleum products. This compares with a 4.7 percent rise in February.</p>
<p>March oil imports rose to $1.69 billion from $690 million a year earlier.  </p>
<p>The statement said domestic refiners imported more crude after expanding refining facilities.</p>
<p>But imports of raw materials and capital goods, including machinery, continued to fall as facility investment by South Korean companies slowed.</p>
<p>The March deficit compared with a shortfall of $2.09 billion in February and $3.47 billion in January. The statement said the deficit should continue to narrow month-on-month.</p>
<p>The trade ministry earlier forecast a $14 billion trade deficit this year against a $20.62 billion shortfall in 1996.</p>
