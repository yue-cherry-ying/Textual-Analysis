<p>The Egyptian share market inched up on Tuesday but trading was quiet with investors and buyers procrastinating over low prices, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) all-share index rose 0.45 points to 381.06 from Monday's 380.61 while volume was an above average 110.35 million pounds ($32.50 million). Government treasury bonds accounted for more than 74.00 million pounds of that total.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was quiet today as far as most shares were concerned. No one is buying because they want to wait for prices to get cheaper and no one is selling because they think it's a shame to sell now when prices are so low,&quot; broker Youssef Khalil of Delta/EAB told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The market won't change unless someone takes a decision and either buys or sells,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Egyptian Tora Portland Cement topped the day's list of the most active shares, rising 1.55 pounds to close at 97.06 after shares worth more than 3.76 million pounds changed hands.</p>
<p>Medinet Nasr Housing and Development was close behind Tora, rising 16 pounds to 481 to reverse a recent downward trend.</p>
<p>The stock has been suffering from an announcement that shareholders will have to wait to qualify for their one-for-one free share. The original cut-off date was March 31 but the company postponed it indefinitely because of a technical hitch.</p>
<p>The company said it would announce a new date as soon as the stock exchange agreed to register the capital increase. Without this the new shares would have had to trade over-the-counter in parallel with the old ones.</p>
<p>Commercial International Bank (CIB) did well, rising 4.08 pounds to end the day at 85.78, after shares worth more than 2.90 million pounds were traded while Misr International Bank/MIBANK rose 18 pounds to 760.</p>
<p>The index for openly traded firms fell to 598.87 from 600.41 on Monday. The index for rarely traded &quot;closed&quot; firms rose to 261.03 from 260.11.</p>
<p>Out of the 83  shares traded on Tuesday, 29 gained, 31 lost and 23 ended unchanged.</p>
<p>$1 = 3.395 pounds</p>
