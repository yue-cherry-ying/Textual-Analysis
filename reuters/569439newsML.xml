<headline>HK stocks jump to strong close as HK Tel surges.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>A late rally pushed Hong Kong stocks to a sharply higher close on Thursday, bolstered by a surge in Hongkong Telecom as investors speculated on a deal with a China partner and welcomed the firm's year earnings.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index rose 134.39 points, or 0.99 percent, to 13,740.30, wiping out an early loss of 158.43 points.</p>
<p>&quot;It's predominantly led by Telecom,&quot; said Miles Remington, sales trader at SocGen-Crosby Securities. &quot;China involvement is being rumoured across the board there, which must be taken as positive and that is why people are buying.&quot;</p>
<p>Hongkong Telecom jumped HK$0.80 to HK$15.00.</p>
<p>The stock rose to its highest level in almost a year on Thursday, reaching a session high of HK$15.05.</p>
<p>&quot;It's short-term speculation,&quot; said Geoff Galbraith in institutional sales at Nava SC Securities. &quot;I think Telecom is going to run into some profit-taking.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hong Kong utility announced a rise of 12.5 percent in net profit for the year to March 31 to HK$11.18 billion during the afternoon, slightly better than analysts had expected.</p>
<p>Brokers said warrant-related activity had also pushed Hongkong Telecom shares higher.</p>
<p>Thursday's session was the seventh winning day in a row for the Hang Seng, bringing the blue-chip index to its highest point since its record close of 13,868.24 on January 20.</p>
<p>Turnover was a strong HK$14.04 billion compared with HK$14.76 billion on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just short-term momentum and liquidity. You would never know Wall Street was down overnight,&quot; said Galbraith.</p>
<p>A 139.67-point fall in the Dow industrials on Wednesday to 7,085.65 helped contribute to the market's early weakness. But a record high in HSBC Holdings Plc shares allowed the Hang Seng Index to wipe out its initial losses.</p>
<p>HSBC shares closed at HK$210.00, up HK$3.00, after reaching an all-time high of HK$211.00 during the session.</p>
<p>&quot;We have already revised our target price to HK$230 for the end of the year,&quot; said Edward Chan, head of research at Amsteel Securities, adding that he had a previous target of HK$206.</p>
<p>Some property developers moved ahead, with New World Development Co Ltd adding HK$1.20 to HK$48.90 and Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd gaining HK$0.25 to HK$73.75.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Hang Seng Index could trade in a range in coming days after rising 1,139.88 points, or 9.05 percent, over the last seven sessions.</p>
