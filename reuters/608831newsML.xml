<p>The Czech crown, under intense pressure for more than a week, steadied on Friday, but analysts remain pessimistic that the central bank (CNB) will be able to maintain the currency at current levels.</p>
<p>The CNB has vowed not to give in to the wave of speculative short-selling which has pushed the normally stable crown to record lows on several occasions, and instead continued to use a mix of intervention and interest rate tools to support it.</p>
<p>The central bank has raised its Lombard lending facility to 50 percent from 14 percent, its repo rate to 75 percent from 12.9 percent, and cut off non-residents to the country's money markets all with the hopes of easing pressure on the crown.</p>
<p>But dealers warned the threat of speculative selling was still very prevalent in the market and that the cost of the CNB's policies -- both economic and monetary -- were too high to maintain for more than another week or two at the most.</p>
<p>&quot;The immediate risk for the crown is a further weakening of the economy,&quot; said Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN Amro in London. &quot;That would encourage a renewed speculative attack, perhaps forcing the central bank to widen the official currency band.&quot;</p>
<p>After hitting a record low of 6.4 percent below its dollar/mark basket midpoint on Thursday, the crown stabilised at around -4.0 percent in Friday activity following five central bank repo tenders to drain funds from the market.</p>
<p>The central bank is also estimated to have spent some $2-3 billion so far in intervention alone to defend the currency.</p>
<p>Analysts added the central bank, with limited reserves and few effective options at its disposal, might be running out of room to manoeuvre.</p>
<p>Some said it might be forced to widen or drop altogether the fluctuation band within which it fixes the currency, a key part of Czech currency management since the fall of communism.</p>
<p>&quot;They can't afford to keep rates as high as they are, so at some point rates will ease and people will pile back in 'to have a go' at the crown,&quot; said one trader at a German bank in London.</p>
<p>The CNB has vowed not to devalue the crown despite wilting confidence in the currency due to a soaring balance of payments deficit and a sharp slowing of Czech economic growth.</p>
<p>Analysts said that short of a devaluation of the crown, the CNB may be forced to widen the crown's +/-7.5 percent fluctuation band, or eliminate it completely, although in practice the CNB has intervened to defend the crown long before it got anywhere near the edge of the band.</p>
<p>&quot;They have already spent a lot of money to preserve a policy which is really unsustainable...I think they definitely will have to change the trading band,&quot; said one emerging markets analyst at a London bank, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>Money market dealers said the central bank tightening moves brought trading to a virtual halt since no funds were available. Indeed, the CNB's fifth repo of the day failed to attract any bids.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel that another wave of speculation and buying hard of currency (will come) today and think that we will again go to 105 (minus 5.0 percent), it might be 106 (minus 6.0 percent) and we even have the end of the band,&quot; said Petr Kukla of Girocredit in Prague.</p>
<p>&quot;I think now that the whole feeling in the country is starting to turn arund and everyone is actually already expecting the devaluation of the Czech crown,&quot; he added.</p>
