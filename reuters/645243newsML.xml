<p>A private twin-engine plane slammed into a wall and burst into flames on Saturday in southern Brazil, killing all five people aboard, authorities said.</p>
<p>&quot;There were no survivors,&quot; an aviation official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Rescue workers and police were sifting through the wreckage on Saturday afternoon at the crash site outside Joinville, some 30 miles (50 kms) from the border of the Brazilian states of Santa Catarina and Parana.</p>
<p>The cause of the crash, which occurred shortly after 10 a.m. (1300 GMT), and the identities of the five victims were still not known, he said.</p>
<p>The plane was travelling from Babacheri in Parana state to Joinville in Santa Catarina, when it went down, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Apparently, it hit a wall of some kind. There was no house involved, just a wall,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Local TV Globo, quoting witnesses, said the plane exploded after hitting the structure. The television report said one of the victims was a local appliance store chain owner.</p>
<p>It was the third deadly air crash in two days in Brazil.</p>
<p>On Friday, a plane carrying gold bars crashed in northeastern Brazil, killing all four aboard. Later in the day, a pilot for Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer died when the AMX fighter he was testing crashed in southeastern Brazil.</p>
