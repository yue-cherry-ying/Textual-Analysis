<p>A U.S. Hercules C-130 military cargo plane made a crash landing on Tuesday and burst into flames at Tegucigalpa's airport, firemen said, and radio reports said at least two crew members were killed.</p>
<p>&quot;The plane missed the runway and burst into flames. We don't have any more details,&quot; said Fire Department official Napoleon Gomez. Radio reports said at least two people aboard were killed and another three were dragged alive from the burning aircraft.  </p>
<p>National HRN Radio said there were nine people on the aircraft but this could not be immediately confirmed. A spokesman at Honduras' military hospital said it had received four people who were injured in the crash.</p>
<p>A U.S. embassy spokesman told HRN the plane, which he said had come from Panama, broke apart as it landed.</p>
<p>Radio reporters at the airport said they could see two charred bodies in the cockpit, but there was no official confirmation of the death toll.</p>
