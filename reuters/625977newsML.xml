<p>A prominent British gourmet on Saturday branded Bill and Hillary Clinton boring provincials after examining the tab for a restaurant meal they shared this week with Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife.</p>
<p>&quot;You can tell a lot about people from what they eat,&quot; said Egon Ronay, founder of the British Academy of Gastronomes and for years publisher of respected restaurant guides.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Clinton's choice leaves a sour taste in my mouth -- he ordered as if he was eating in the Wild West. And First Lady Hillary ordered her food as if she was sitting in a cheap Italian restaurant at home in Arkansas.&quot;</p>
<p>Thursday night's dinner for four at Le Pont de la Tour restaurant overlooking the River Thames rounded off a day's visit to Britain by the U.S. president and his wife.</p>
<p>The Sun newspaper got hold of a copy of the itemised 298.86 pound ($490) bill, splashed it on its front page, and invited Ronay to comment on the choices of the diners.</p>
<p>He praised Tony and Cherie Blair for their cultured ordering from the expensive menu. But he wrote: &quot;The calorie-watching Clintons show a lack of style and a boring, predictable side to their characters.&quot;</p>
<p>Ronay said Hillary Clinton's choice of mixed salad without dressing followed by Dover sole and spinach and praline ice cream showed her as basically &quot;unimaginative and straitlaced&quot;.</p>
<p>But he reserved his strongest language for the president's choice of what to wash down his seared tuna, wild roast salmon and strawberries with.</p>
<p>&quot;I was horrified to see that in the middle of drinking excellent wines, he really lost the plot and ordered a beer,&quot; he said. &quot;Tony Blair also had one -- but only out of courtesy, I think.&quot;</p>
