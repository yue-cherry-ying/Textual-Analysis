<p>TransTexas Gas Corp is due to resume drilling on its State Tract 331 1 well in Galveston Bay, offshore Texas, Friday, spokesman Simon Ward said Thursday.</p>
<p>Tuesday the well encountered high pressure gas that forced the halting of drilling operations while pressure of up to 9,600 pounds per square inch in the wellbore was controlled. Natural gas and condensate was encountered at about 15,400 feet in the Vicksburg formation and required the use of 17.3 pound per gallon drilling fluid to control the pressure flow.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a lot sooner than had been expected,&quot; Ward said, noting hydrocarbons were expected at about 16,000 feet.</p>
<p>The fact that such gas pressure was encountered is positive with regard to hydrocarbon production potential from the well, the company pointed out in a statement.</p>
<p>It said additional fluid storage barges and pressure pumping equipment were brought in Wednesday to control the well, which is being drilled in Galveston Bay in water depth of less than 30 feet.</p>
<p>TransTexas said it had received approvals from the Railroad Commission of Texas and the U.S. Coastguard to resume drilling to the planned depth of 18,500.</p>
<p>It said this well is a test of a large 1,150 acre structure in the Vicksburg formation that exhibits similar geology to the nearby Chocolate Bayou field.</p>
<p>The presence of natural gas and condensate at 15,400 feet depth is encouraging with regard to the potential for Vicksburg pay in the structure, the company said.</p>
<p>Potential Frio pay was also indicated at shallower intervals in the well, it noted.</p>
<p>TransTexas should know more in a week or two, Ward said.</p>
