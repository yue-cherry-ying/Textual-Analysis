<p>China's entry into the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is important not only for China but for the rest of the international trading community, although major obstacles remain, a WTO official said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Market access, particularly in the agricultural and financial services sectors, and state subsidies were among issues still to be resolved before China's long-standing application for membership could be granted, Keith Rockwell, WTO director of information, said.</p>
<p>An agreement by Beijing's negotiators in Geneva last month to adopt the WTO's intellectual property provisions immediately upon entry showed China was negotiating in good faith, he said.</p>
<p>Rockwell is in Shanghai accompanying WTO director general Renato Ruggiero, who arrived on Friday for a six-day visit to China during which he will meet Chinese business leaders, and local and central government officials.</p>
<p>Rockwell said Ruggiero would listen to the concerns and objectives of the people he meets and explain the positions of other countries.</p>
<p>Ruggerio said last month China was approaching the final stages of an entry process to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its successor organisation, the WTO, that has already taken a decade.</p>
<p>Agreement has been reached on the principle that China will be allowed to enter under a phased system that would give it time to introduce reforms over a certain period.</p>
<p>Areas where China has yet to meet demands from Europe, Japan and the United States include trading rights -- allowing foreign firms to engage in import and exports in China -- and national treatment on distribution.</p>
<p>&quot;It is sometimes misconstrued that the Europeans, the United States and the Japanese are the only countries that have concerns about the existing negotiating position of the Chinese,&quot; Rockwell said.</p>
<p>The Cairns Group of major agricultural exporting countries, including Australia, Argentina, Canada and New Zealand, was concerned about access to China's agricultural markets, he said.</p>
<p>Rockwell said others among the WTO's 130 member nations were concerned about China's monopolistic banking and insurance sectors, as well other service industries.</p>
<p>&quot;These are the issues that have to be resolved and they are among the toughest,&quot; Rockwell said.</p>
<p>&quot;As in any negotiation these issues are the last to be settled,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What is clear is that China is a developing country and will require a period of transition in some sectors,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is that the WTO needs China because without China we are not a universal trade organisation.</p>
<p>&quot;And China needs us because it is the only way they can be protected from unilateral and bilateral actions that can occur in the form of sanctions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They also need to belong, otherwise when the trading rules of the 21st century are being written, they won't have a hand in shaping them,&quot; Rockwell said.</p>
