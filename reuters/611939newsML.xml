<p>South Korean stocks are forecast to decline further on Friday as rumours of more corporate financial troubles would continue to depress sentiment, brokers said.</p>
<p>But Ssangyong Group  SSYG.CN firms were seen rising on Thursday's remarks by group officials about a possible deal with General Motors Corp on capital investment in its auto unit.</p>
<p>Thursday's release of gross domestic product figures for the first quarter would have little impact, brokers said.</p>
<p>The composite index closed Thursday's trading at 724.38, down 13.33 points or 1.81 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;Rumours of corporate troubles are spreading so widely that investors just want to flee and stay away until the market becomes quiet,&quot; said Koh Kyung-bae of Hyundai Securities.</p>
<p>The Haitai Group was hit hard by such rumours and strongly denied by the group, but shares in its listed affiliates plunged for the past two days.</p>
<p>A Ssangyong Group executive said on Thursday it was discussing with foreign companies on a $300 million capital investment in its loss-making Ssangyong Motor.</p>
<p>The nation's gross domestic product grew 5.4 percent in the first quarter, down from a 7.8 percent rise a year earlier.</p>
