<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS/No end seen to market volatility.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Implied volatility in major U.S. stock index options, which typically declines when the indices rally, held firm Thursday in the face of a strong upswing, suggesting investors see no end to the increased level of choppiness, traders said.</p>
<p>By about 1200 CDT/1700 GMT, the bellwether Dow industrial average was ahead 103 points at 7,189.</p>
<p>The average dropped about 140 points Wednesday. It rose 11 points Tuesday after surging 143 on Monday.</p>
<p>The broader S&amp;P 100 index .OEX was up nearly 10 points at 808.86 and the S&amp;P 500 .SPX rose 10 to 825.67.  </p>
<p>&quot;Volatility is pretty much holding a steady line even though we've got a good rally going,&quot; said an index options trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.</p>
<p>&quot;Hundred-point moves (on the Dow) are expected,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>June S&amp;P 500 futures were ahead 12.85 at 830.50, a point off their session peaks.</p>
<p>One firm pegged fair value at 3.45 points premium to cash, with buy programs at 4.50 points premium or wider and sell programs at 2.70 points premium or narrower.  </p>
<p>&quot;We've seen buyers on both sides of the market here, so there might be some anticipation of more volatility next week,&quot; said Jack Callahan, an independent market maker in the OEX, noting that May options expire next week.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, expirations have been the tamest weeks of the (option) cycle,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said some investors may be starting to unwind positions ahead of next week's expiration.</p>
<p>Put buying and call selling were heavy off the opening, but call buyers quickly emerged as the market began to run higher, Callahan said.  </p>
<p>An SPX options trader at the Chicago Board Options Exchange said many market participants were surprised by the rally.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the large houses are usually pretty good at calling direction,&quot; he said. &quot;But a lot of them were in selling a lot of calls and buying a lot of puts this morning and it doesn't seem to be working out too good right now.&quot;</p>
<p>He said if the market continues to &quot;trudge&quot; higher over the next couple of months, volatility would likely flatten out at elevated levels on the expectation that the market would be poised to correct sharply.  </p>
<p>&quot;The expectation that the market's got to fall is just going to keep premium levels up high,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>Among the biggest trades, an investor did a large spread in the SPX, buying the September 825 puts and selling the June 775 puts about 9,000 times, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;That's going to have an effect on June volatility versus September,&quot; the SPX trader said, explaining that June volatility eased a bit while September volatility moved higher.</p>
<p>At the Merc, the index options trader said most action was from locals, with institutions largely on the sidelines.</p>
