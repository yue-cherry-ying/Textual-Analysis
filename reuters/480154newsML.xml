<headline>Danish bond prices modestly down in jittery market.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Danish bond prices were only moderately down in jittery trade on Tuesday after the Wall Street decline, with investors taking refuge in short-term paper but the market was seen stabilising at present levels.</p>
<p>&quot;The Danish market has done better than Germany and we should stabilise. There has been no panic but long-term jitters are sending investors into short-term paper,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The benchmark eight percent state bond due 2006 was down 0.59 point from Friday's close but 0.01 up on the opening at 108.01 at 1130 gmt, with the 10-year yield gap with Germany three basis points narrower than at the start at 77.  </p>
<p>Dealers said they expected a relatively quiet afternoon with the U.S. March NAPM amd February leading indicators not seen having any great influence.</p>
<p>The 2006 benchmark yielded 6.77 percent in turnover of 1.6 billion crowns while the six percent mortgage bond due 2026 lost 0.35 point to 86.40.</p>
<p>The crown traded at 3.8100 per mark at 1135 gmt virtually unchanged compared to 3.8105 at the opening.</p>
