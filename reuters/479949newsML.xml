<p>U.S. spot gasoline prices fell sharply but distillates gained ground late Monday tracking NYMEX, with little change in differentials except for slippage on New York Harbor heating oil.</p>
<p>NYH heat was offered between 0.40 cent and 0.25 cent below the April print late afternoon, versus a slight premium to the print late last week.</p>
<p>Traders said diffs came off after the spread between April and May NYMEX heat widened, with April heat settling 2.30 cents higher than May after hovering only 1.60 cents higher earlier in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;The spread just blew out,&quot; one East Coast player said, noting that April heating oil futures settled 0.65 cent higher for the day.</p>
<p>Gulf heating oil saw diffs hold at about 2.00 cents under the print, with barrels traded for 1.85 cents under.</p>
<p>Conventional unleaded gasoline diffs were stable, players said, with NYH M2-grade sold for 2.75 cents under and prompt USG M1-grade offered at 3.50 cents below the screen.</p>
<p>The market kept watch for news of the Mississippi River, where ship movements have been curtailed due to swift currents. But traders said no price impact was yet seen.</p>
