<headline>INSIGHT - DUTCH CHARTISTS REMAIN DIVIDED OVER AEX.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Most Dutch chartists remain</p>
<p>cautious about the short term prospects for the AEX share index,</p>
<p>some saying the AEX could undergo a major decline if it slips</p>
<p>through support at 700 points. Two out of five contributors to</p>
<p>our regular survey were concerned about the recent increase in</p>
<p>market volatility. ABN Amro remains broadly positive.</p>
<p>The AEX index closed at 740.99 points on Thursday, 13.69</p>
<p>points above the previous week's close. In the week before that</p>
<p>the index had shed 38.76 points.</p>
<p> Contributor   Trend    Pvs view	 Support	 Resistance</p>
<p>						First  Second  First  Second</p>
<p> ABN AMRO	Up	 Up	     710    700     750    779</p>
<p> Rabo Sec.     Neutral  Neutral	700    670     733    748</p>
<p> MeesPierson   Neutral  Down	   700    685     748    779</p>
<p> ING Barings   Down     Down	   710    700     735    750</p>
<p>Note - Contributors' own analysis follows.</p>
<p>ING BARINGS - As expected last week, the rebound was strong,</p>
<p>but it could not lift the selling condition of the AEX.</p>
<p>Chart-resistance and the 9-day moving average line of the AEX,</p>
<p>both at 740, have thwarted a further rise. At 740, the AEX has</p>
<p>also corrected 50 percent of its recent steep 80 point drop (780</p>
<p>to 700). This 50 percent retracement level weighs heavily on the</p>
<p>charts. Momentum lines below the crucial 0-level confirm bearish</p>
<p>technicals. Expect a test of support at 700. If 700 gives way,</p>
<p>then next targets come in around 686 and 660. A move above 780</p>
<p>is needed to trigger a durable buying condition. Money flow</p>
<p>remains toppy, reflecting selling pressure kicking in.</p>
<p>Advance/Decline ratio's have also formed a (minor) top,</p>
<p>suggesting that leadership in the market is decreasing. All in</p>
<p>all, the short term technicals of the AEX remain bearish.</p>
<p>MEESPIERSON - As we mentioned last week already, the risks</p>
<p>were on the downside. We saw a confirmation of all this on April</p>
<p>Fool's Day. The indicators are basically of no use in such sharp</p>
<p>declines, and we think the market will stay volatile in between</p>
<p>the 700 and 748 levels. After a calm-down, we expect further</p>
<p>continuation of the long term uptrend.</p>
<p>RABO SECURITIES - We expect the market to remain very</p>
<p>volatile but we do expect support at 700 to hold up. Although</p>
<p>the AEX could easily be at the higher end of the broad trading</p>
<p>range by the end of the week, we prefer to stay neutral for the</p>
<p>time being. However, a break of support at 700 would immediately</p>
<p>trigger a sell signal and open the way to the 670 level.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO - We stick to our previous positive opinion. There</p>
<p>has been another sharp correction within a longer term uptrend.</p>
<p>Again, support has been found slightly above 700. We expect</p>
<p>positive momentum to pick up again and foresee a renewed attack</p>
<p>on the 750 level. We continue to prefer an aggressive approach</p>
<p>in this market and advise reopening long positions. This move up</p>
<p>can take place in a very short time frame. The market is heavily</p>
<p>oversold and waiting to bounce up again.</p>
