<headline>Gold Peak seeks mandate to cut holdings.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Gold Peak Industries (Holdings) Ltd will hold an extraordinary general meeting on April 17 to obtain a shareholders' mandate to decide whether to reduce its stake in its two Singapore-listed subsidiaries.</p>
<p>The parent company's stake in GP Batteries International Ltd and Clipsal Industries Holdings Ltd could fall to less than 50 percent under certain circumstances, a company statement issued on March 31 said.</p>
<p>If Gold Peak's shareholdings fell to 50 percent or less, the companies would cease to be consolidated in Gold Peak's accounts.  </p>
<p>A change in the status of the companies, from subsidiary to associate company, is a notifiable transaction according to Hong Kong stock exchange rules.</p>
<p>Clipsal and GP Batteries are subsidiaries of Gold Peak and are the holding companies of the electrical division and battery division of the Gold Peak group.</p>
<p>If Gold Peak's stake in the two companies fell to 50 percent or less, the results of the companies and their assets would be treated on an equity accounting basis, the statement said.  </p>
<p>Gold Peak owns 50.13 percent of GP Batteries and 50.10 percent of Clipsal Industries, both of which have mandates to issue new shares up to 10 percent of their issued capital.</p>
<p>Both also have outstanding warrants and employee share options.</p>
<p>GP Batteries has approximately 16.4 million outstanding warrants, of which Gold Peak owns 10.6 million. Clipsal Industries has about 12.8 million outstanding warrants of which Gold Peak owns about 9.8 million, the statement said.  </p>
<p>The statement said Gold Peak intended to maintain substantial shareholdings in GP Batteries and Clipsal Industries as part of its core business, regardless of whether they were subsidiaries or associates.</p>
<p>Gold Peak said it did not anticipate any material change in the management or operation of the two companies.</p>
