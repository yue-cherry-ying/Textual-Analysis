<p>U.S. trade house Cargill took centre stage on London's sugar freight market as it arranged to ship all the raw sugar delivered against New York's May contract, shipbrokers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The delivery totalled 339,950 long tons, which included 260,000 of Paranagua raws from one of the largest Brazilian producers. The balance came from north Brazil and three central American nations.</p>
<p>Cargill was the receiver of all the sugar and shipbrokers have said its active chartering from Brazil has caused the supply of handy-size vessels to tighten in South America as a whole.</p>
<p>It is now believed to be temporising on some of its freight orders out of south Brazil but market sources said a number of vessels to ship bulk sugar to Egyptian Med/Black Sea or Baltic had already been fixed.</p>
<p>Santos or Paranagua were the quoted origins.</p>
<p>Rates mentioned in the market were around $32.50 basis Black Sea, shipbrokers said.</p>
<p>Cargill was said to have fixed the Kavo Matapas, 25,739 dwt and built in 1992, some tweendeckers and at least another bulker. Earlier this week it fixed the 29,000 dwt Ailsa for a prompt order on the same run.</p>
<p>Cargill also issued a new order for 14/28,000 tonnes of bulk sugar from Puerto Quetzal to US Gulf/Atlantic for the second half of May.</p>
<p>Other new business included CSR, which quoted for 29,980 tonnes of bulk sugar, with five percent more in charterer's option, from Queensland to Kaohsiung for May 25/June 5.</p>
<p>Shipbrokers also cited a fresh order from an unnamed Hong Kong charterer for 11,000 tonnes of bagged sugar from south China to Pakistan or the Red Sea for end-May.</p>
<p>Genoc quoted for 12/12,500 tonnes of bulk sugar from Thailand to Vladivostok for prompt/10 days notice.</p>
<p>Louis Dreyfus was temporising on its order for 22,000 tonnes of bulk sugar from Cuba to the Black Sea for mid-May and E D &amp; F Man was said to have booked 5/6,000 tonnes in bags from Santander to west Africa for mid-May.</p>
