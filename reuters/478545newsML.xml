<headline>Bosnian children return to Sarajevo after 4 years.</headline>

<p>Thirty Bosnian children evacuated from besieged Sarajevo under wartime sniper fire returned to the city on Tuesday after spending more than four years in children's homes in Germany.</p>
<p>The children, aged five to 10, were part of a group attacked by Serb gunmen as they left the Bosnian capital in August 1992. Two were killed.</p>
<p>Aid officials have criticised Germany for deporting Bosnian refugees since a peace treaty ended fighting in former Bosnia in 1995.</p>
<p>But the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said this repatriation was permissible because the children were returning to a shelter which met international standards.</p>
<p>Officials at Sarajevo's children home said that none of the children were orphans, as some aid workers had reported.</p>
<p>&quot;They all have at least one parent,&quot; said Amir Zelic, director of the home.</p>
<p>&quot;They have been brought to our orphanage for various reasons -- problematic families, single mothers who could not take care of their children, but no parent signed off a single child,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Zelic said Bosnian authorities had been trying to repatriate the children since last October but could do so only after German officials inspected the premises.</p>
<p>The building, spotlessly clean, was recently reconstructed through foreign donations. Many workers at the home cried as the children walked in. Some of them had no memories of Sarajevo and spoke only German.</p>
<p>&quot;They're Bosnian children and they belong here,&quot; Zelic said. About 10 parents called in and announced they would be ready to take their children back and raise them.</p>
<p>Karsten Knolle, a member of the Saxony-Anhalt state assembly and one of the organisers of the 1992 evacuation, watched as the children were received at their Sarajevo home.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a terrible day for me,&quot; Knolle said, holding a five-year-old girl named Nermina in his arms.</p>
<p>Knolle said it would have been much better for the children to have stayed on in Germany. &quot;They would have a better future there.&quot;</p>
<p>Many German families applied to adopt the infants when they arrived, but were refused because the Bosnian authorities prevented it, Knolle said.</p>
<p>The UNHCR said that the children were supposed to come back once the war ended. &quot;The understanding from the very beginning was that they would be coming back to Bosnia,&quot; said UNCHR spokesman Kris Janowski.</p>
<p>Aid officials have called the repatriation process premature at a time when nationalist authorities still enforce the country's division into ethnic ghettoes.</p>
<p>Many of the refugees in Germany are Moslems or Croats who fled Serb-controlled territory and still have no way of returning to their homes.</p>
