<p>The first supplies of United Nations food for Albania's poor and needy were handed out on Saturday and ferried across the volatile Balkan country in a flotilla of small private cars.</p>
<p>Without waiting for a multinational security force to provide armed escorts, the U.N. World Food Programme passed out 35 tonnes of wheat flour, beans and vegetable oil at the port of Durres, 40 km (25 miles) west of Tirana.</p>
<p>Vans and cars from 22 orphanages, hospitals and homes for the elderly and handicapped had arrived at the decrepit port on Saturday to pick up the food.</p>
<p>Larger convoys escorted by troops will not be sent until Thursday, Italian military spokesman Paolo Bianchi told journalists. The immediate priority of troops was to secure the roads and plan routes, he said.</p>
<p>Many institutions cannot afford to wait that long. &quot;All of our food was stolen six weeks ago,&quot; said Mark Nyberg, collecting supplies for an orphanage in the southern town of Vlore.</p>
<p>&quot;Our concern is not so much getting it to Vlore, but keeping it once we get there. The situation is far from stable.&quot;</p>
<p>Hospitals and other institutions ran short of supplies amid the armed anarchy that swept Europe's poorest country since the collapse of fraudulent savings schemes in January.</p>
<p>About 300 people were killed and more than 700 injured during two months of mayhem. Armouries and police stations were plundered when soldiers and police abandoned their posts. An estimated one million guns have gone missing.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not expect any trouble on the journey home,&quot; said Gianfranco Jacuzzi, a Roman Catholic priest collecting flour and beans for the poor in 10 villages north of Durres. &quot;There is a clan and if someone makes trouble for us, they will have trouble from the family chief.&quot;</p>
<p>While no cases starvation have been reported, aid workers say the collapse of government welfare and social payments has put many poor and needy in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Jacuzzi said many people were hungry and the situation was rapidly deteriorating.</p>
<p>&quot;There is food in the market, but it is too expensive for many of these people and so they have no access to food,&quot; said Laura Boldrini, a WFP spokeswoman. &quot;The social tensions are rising. We hope this food will fill the gap until the harvest.&quot;</p>
<p>The WFP plans to distribute a total of about 360 tonnes of wheat flour, 36 tonnes of beans and 23 tonnes of vegetable oil -- sufficient to feed 7,500 people for three months -- during the next two weeks.</p>
<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross, which does not use armed escorts, has handed out 50 tonnes of food and two tonnes of medicines since early March.</p>
<p>The WFP said it considered the unescorted distribution of the small amounts of food to be safe. But it asked journalists not to publish information about the operation in advance.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not an operation for which you can have military escorts,&quot; Boldrini said. &quot;It is a low-profile, low-visibility operation.&quot;</p>
<p>Hundreds of French soldiers carrying automatic rifles watched quietly from armoured personnel carriers as the food was loaded into the battered vans and cars.</p>
<p>Gjik Bardhoku, waiting for his small white truck to be loaded, said he was glad the soldiers would not escort him.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want that because it would just make the people afraid,&quot; he said. &quot;I am not afraid at all. I think Durres port is more dangerous.&quot;</p>
