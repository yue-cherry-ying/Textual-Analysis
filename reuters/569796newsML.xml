<headline>Conn. appoints panel to run Hartford schools.</headline>
<dateline>HARTFORD 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>The retired chief executive of distiller Heublein Inc will head up a state panel charged with turning around Hartford's troubled school system, Gov. John Rowland said Thursday.</p>
<p>Robert Furek, former president and chief executive of Heublein, will chair the seven-member board named by Rowland and legislative leaders.</p>
<p>Connecticut last month approved a dramatic state takeover of Hartford's crisis-torn school system, dissolving the Hartford Board of Education.</p>
<p>Other members of the new panel include a priest, a university administrator, a hospital official, a real estate businessman, a social services professional and a broadcast executive.</p>
<p>The appointees have agreed to serve as board members for three to five years.</p>
<p>The state-appointed trustees will try to rescue Hartford's $240 million school system plagued by chronic management problems and the lowest test scores in the state.</p>
<p>Dropout figures and teen pregnancy rates are also among Connecticut's worst.</p>
<p>Board chairman Furek led Heublein for 10 years and was known for boosting the company's profits during a time of declining alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Hartford Mayor Mike Peters said on local radio that he was happy with the diverse composition of the panel.</p>
<p>&quot;The people that they picked are very qualified,&quot; Peters said. &quot;Now hopefully it will all come together in the next week or so.&quot;</p>
<p>Peters said he would press the trustees to put control of the schools back in the hands of principals and get rid of the top-heavy structure of administrators.</p>
