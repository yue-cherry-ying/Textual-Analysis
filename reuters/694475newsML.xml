<p>Hong Kong's future ruler Tung Chee-hwa said on Saturday that Chinese People's Liberation Army troops sweeping in after next week's handover could not move against the people of Hong Kong without his order.</p>
<p>&quot;They will not, they cannot,&quot; he told NBC interviewer Tom Brokaw.</p>
<p>The former shipping magnate, picked by Beijing to take over the reins of Hong Kong after Monday's midnight handover, said its people should not be worried as the Chinese were a very disciplined army.</p>
<p>China announced that it is sending 4,000 troops in ships, helicopters and armoured cars at dawn on Tuesday into the territory it is taking back after 156 years of colonial rule.</p>
<p>It is a highly sensitive political issue as Hong Kong people still vividly recall 1989 images of the Tiananmen student demonstrations crushed by PLA troops.</p>
<p>Asked about the psychological effect on the people of Hong Kong, Tung told NBC: &quot;I think the PLA presence in Hong Kong is a symbol of sovereignty. It is necessary to show that symbol of sovereignty.</p>
<p>&quot;So they will be here and from what I have seen they are a very well disciplined people, a very well disciplined army. They will be there to do what is necessary to demonstrate sovereignty and I think the Hong Kong people will get to know the PLA well and in due time they will be part of our community.&quot;</p>
<p>Tung was laughing and in good humour during the interview. &quot;I am laughing because I have said many times this is a very happy event.&quot; He said nobody could spoil the handover party.</p>
<p>&quot;If anybody feels they can achieve martyrdom they will be very disappointed. People really must behave themselves in accordance with the law,&quot; he warned.</p>
