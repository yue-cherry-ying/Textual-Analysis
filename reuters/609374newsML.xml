<headline>U.S. MUNICIPAL FOCUS -- sideways ahead of holiday.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>U.S. municipal went sideways as a number of traders opted to start the three-day U.S. Memorial Day weekend early, leaving the market looking ahead to even fewer new issues than were seen this week.</p>
<p>Municipal bond sales for next week were predicted to fall about $1 billion to $2.1 bilion, according to Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group.</p>
<p>&quot;Volume's going to be kind of light again, and again I think it'll probably bode well for the (market),&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>On the competitive calender, a $256 million Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority issue on Thursday was the largest. Traders looked for the deal to go well, pointing to a strengthening trend for debt sold by some issuers in that state.</p>
<p>&quot;California is trading at pretty tight spreads, historically,&quot; one said. He pegged such debt at around 10 basis points higher than insured paper.</p>
<p>Another trader noted the deal was weighted towards the long end and was the first big competitive deal seen in some time. But he added a note of caution: &quot;I think the bond funds have a limited amount of cash.&quot;</p>
<p>Another focus of next week likely will be a nearly $244 million sale of general obligation bonds by the financially strapped District of Columbia.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been awhile since you've seen that credit come to market. If it's insured, it'll probably be 15 basis points off the insured level,&quot; speculated a trader.</p>
<p>Although bondholders settled class-action lawsuits alleging securities fraud in the sale of Denver International Airport bonds, according to attorneys, traders said that on a day when trading was as quiet as Friday, outstanding debt showed little reaction.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the market ever opened,&quot; a trader said, adding participants next week likely would have a better feel for the prices of the airport bonds.</p>
<p>June municipal bond futures rose four ticks to 116-14/32, while June Treasury bonds climbed the same amount to 109-6/32. This left the MOB spread at plus 232 ticks.</p>
<p>Broward County, Florida, Professional Sports Facilities Tax Revenues of 2028, which pay a 5-5/8 percent coupon, were bid at 5.74 percent, NET, unchanged.</p>
<p>Cleveland, Ohio, Certificates of Participation Cleveland Stadium Project of 2027, which carry a 5-1/4 percent coupon, were bid at 5.69 percent, NET, down one basis point.</p>
