<p>Total volume on the official list was 64.3 million kroons and the index lost 0.03 percent to 256.45.</p>
<p>Forekspank was active with total turnover of 15.3 million kroons and rose by 8.95 kroons to close on 185.95 kroons.</p>
<p>Dealers were not sure why the share made such a large gain.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors may be waiting for very good first quarter results,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Uhispank was most actively traded with 19.8 million kroons of shares turned over. The bank's stock price decreased by 0.50 kroons to close on 56.00 kroons.</p>
<p>Hansapank turned over 14.7 million kroons of shares. The stock's price fell three kroons to close on 255 kroons.</p>
<p>&quot;Hansapank was rose in the morning, but was brought down afterwards by selling pressure from Helsinki,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>However, Hansa's shares in Helsinki ended three markka higher at 94 markka.</p>
<p>On the free market, total trade was 7.4 million kroons, with Rakvere meat plant most active on 2.6 million kroons.</p>
<p>Rakvere lost 0.55 kroons to close on 15.60 kroons.</p>
<p>Diversified industrialist Norma shares gained 4.25 kroons to end trading on 72.5 kroons with a turnover of 1.8 million kroons of shares.</p>
<p>&quot;The rise in Norma stock was due to news about the increase in profit estimate,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Norma chief executive Peep Aviksoo earlier told Reuters in an interview that Norma increased its profit forecast for the first half of the year to 46.9 million kroons compared with an earlier forecast of profits for the whole year of 50.2 million kroons.</p>
