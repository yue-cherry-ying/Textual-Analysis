<p>Shanghai's B share index ended sharply down on Thursday with investors concerned over the increasing possibility of the securities authorities taking solid measures to cool down the markets, brokers said.</p>
<p>The B index tumbled 4.871 points or 4.96 percent to 93.335 points on volume of 34.349 million shares worth $23.091 million, compared with $29.583 million on Wednesday.</p>
<p>China's official newspapers continued to publish articles warning of risks in the stock markets and a leading economist said the time had come to list currently non-tradable state shares and institutional shares.  </p>
<p>One Hong Kong newspaper said on Thursday that China's Ministry of Finance was considering increasing stamp taxes for trading stocks from the current 0.3 percent to 0.4 or 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>Brokers said all these factors had increased investor fears on the possibility of a government crackdown, triggering heavy profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;Beijing will not tolerate the abnormally high domestic A share prices and rumours circulating in the market say clampdown measures will be worked out soon,&quot; said one broker.  </p>
<p>&quot;The index is likely to rebound slightly tomorrow, but the trend beyond that is hard to judge,&quot; another broker said.</p>
<p>Of 43 B shares, 42 traded, with 40 down and two flat.</p>
<p>Shanghai Worldbest was the biggest loser on profit-taking, slumping $0.070 or 9.33 percent to $0.680 on volume of 2.1 million shares.</p>
<p>The market barometer Shanghai Lujiazui Finance &amp; Trade Zone Development was the most actively traded for the same reason, down $0.108 or 6.67 percent to $1.510 on volume of 3.6 million shares.  </p>
<p>Shanghai's A share index also plunged on the same concerns, with some major institutions which have recently been supporting the market seen off-setting their positions, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index slipped 94.789 points or 6.07 percent to 1,467.861 points on volume of 1.0 billion shares worth 15.4 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The SSE30 blue chip index ended down 320.921 points or 7.27 percent to 4,092.126 points.</p>
<p>Chang Chun Faw Sihuan Automotive was the biggest loser, down 1.96 yuan or 10.01 percent limit-down to 17.62 yuan on volume of 2.5 million shares.</p>
