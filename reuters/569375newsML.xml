<p>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday said he was encouraged by Beijing's support for United Nations reforms after meetings with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other senior leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm leaving encouraged that China supports the reform process,&quot; Annan told a news conference after meetings with Jiang and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.</p>
<p>China was contributing to the debate on reform of the United Nations, and its leadership on the issue was felt throughout the global organisation, he said.</p>
<p>Annan began his first visit to Beijing as U.N. secretary-general on Wednesday saying reform was an important item on his agenda.</p>
<p>His discussions with Chinese leaders also touched on Hong Kong, economic development and disarmament, he said.</p>
<p>Annan was also scheduled to visit the Pudong economic development zone in Shanghai as well as the ancient city of Xian, U.N. officials said.</p>
<p>China, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has in the past prided itself on its good relations with U.N. leaders.</p>
<p>Beijing welcomed Annan's appointment last December, even though it had previously supported a second term for his predecessor Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</p>
<p>Chinese state media have repeatedly called for member nations to pay their dues to the United Nations -- a call mainly aimed at Washington, which has helped drive the organisation to the brink of bankruptcy by withholding contributions.</p>
<p>In March, Annan unveiled a 10-point plan for reforming the world body which included eliminating 1,000 U.N. jobs, merging some departments, creating a code of conduct for employees, and cutting administrative costs by a third by 2001.</p>
<p>The U.N.'s finances was one of the biggest issues facing the organisation, Annan said, adding that he was confident China would support his reforms.</p>
<p>Asked if he would continue Boutros-Ghali's policy of supporting Beijing's efforts to deny diplomatic recognition to its island arch-rival Taiwan, Annan said there was no doubt that the United Nations recognised Beijing had the only claim to speak for China.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.N. has a very clear policy: it has a policy of one China,&quot; he said.</p>
