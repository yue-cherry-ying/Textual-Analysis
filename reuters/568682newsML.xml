<p>Retired Pittsburgh Penguins superstar Mario Lemieux heads the list of finalists for the Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded annually to the National Hockey League's Most Valuable Player.</p>
<p>Lemieux, Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek and Anaheim Mighty Ducks left wing Paul Kariya are in the running for the league's most prestigious award.</p>
<p>The NHL on Thursday (corrects from Friday) announced three finalists for each of seven annual awards with the winners to be announced June 19 at the league's annual awards ceremony in Toronto.</p>
<p>Lemieux, who decided to hang up his skates at the end of this season, bringing to an end a brilliant, but injury and illness-plagued career, will be the sentimental favourite to win his fourth Hart Trophy.</p>
<p>The league's MVP in 1988, 1993 and 1996 and a Hart Trophy finalist for the sixth time, Lemieux already earned his sixth Art Ross Trophy as the NHL regular season scoring leader with 122 points on 50 goals and 72 assists.</p>
<p>Hasek, who is also a finalist for the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goaltender, was largely responsible for Buffalo's first-place finish in the Northeast Division.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old Czech native accounted for 37 of Buffalo's 40 wins in the regular season and led the NHL in save percentage for the third consecutive year (.930).</p>
<p>Kariya, one of the league's top young stars, led the Mighty Ducks to their first playoff berth and finished third in the league in scoring with 99 points (44 g, 55 a), despite playing just 69 games due to an injury that delayed his start to the season.</p>
<p>Kariya, who is also a finalist for the Lady Byng Trophy for sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct, led the NHL with 10 game-winning goals.</p>
