<p>Beijing on Friday slammed U.S. sanctions imposed on Chinese firms and individuals charged with selling chemical weapons components to Iran, saying China strictly enforced controls on the trade of such materials.</p>
<p>&quot;(The U.S. sanctions) are entirely unreasonable,&quot; the official Xinhua news agency quoted Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;China expresses its resolute opposition and requests the United States to immediately rescind relevant sanctions against Chinese companies and individuals,&quot; Shen said.</p>
<p>Washington on Thursday imposed sanctions on China's Jiangsu Yongli Chemical Engineering and Technology Import/Export Corp and its parent company, Nanjing Chemical Industries Group, charging they transferred chemical weapons components to Iran.</p>
<p>Officials of the Jiangsu corporation on Friday said it had had dealings with Tehran, but denied it had exported materials or technology for chemical weapons components.</p>
<p>Shortly after issuing Beijing's condemnation of the U.S. action, Xinhua released a joint statement from the two targeted firms demanding the sanctions be lifted immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. government's accusation that our companies pursue activities of proliferating chemical weapons is absolutely drawn from the air,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The so-called sanctions... are indeed completely without the backing of international law and a brutal intervention in normal international trade and commercial activities,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The United States also slapped sanctions on five Chinese citizens -- Liao Minglong, Tian Yi, Chen Qingchang, Pan Yongming and Shao Xingsheng -- and a Hong Kong company, Cheong Yee Ltd.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong company remained a mystery. It is not listed on the territory's stock exchange and is not found in public telephone directories.</p>
<p>As a signatory to the international Chemical Weapons Convention, Beijing controls the export of sensitive chemical products and technologies, said Chinese spokesman Shen.</p>
<p>&quot;The trade activities that the relevant Chinese companies and persons carried out in the chemical industry are normal ones of international trade and in no way violated the purposes and objectives of the Chemical Weapons Convention,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The sanctions, the first to be imposed on Chinese companies or people under the U.S. Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, are the latest in a long string of irritants to test sensitive cross-Pacific ties.</p>
<p>Both sides say Sino-U.S. relations have improved after a series of high-level exchanges in recent months, but disputes over trade, human rights and Taiwan, as well as over arms proliferation, continue to strain the relationship.</p>
<p>In Washington, the U.S. State Department said there was no evidence the Chinese government was involved in the transfer of chemicals and technology that could be used in arms production.</p>
<p>But there was also no evidence to suggest that Beijing had complied with U.S. requests for it to halt transfers by the sanctioned firms and individuals, the State Department said.</p>
<p>Washington's punitive action came after U.S. President Bill Clinton announced he would renew for one year Most Favoured Nation trade benefits for China, a move keenly desired by Beijing but which is also drawing fire in the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>Some members of Congress have increasingly voiced criticism of the Clinton administration for trying to boost ties with Beijing, despite concerns about Chinese arms sales to Iran.</p>
