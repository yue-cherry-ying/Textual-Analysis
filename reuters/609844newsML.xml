<p>A bout of merger mania -- real and speculated -- blasted the Brussels bourse to a record high close on Friday, and traders said the revitalised nerves of market players could lift it again next week.</p>
<p>&quot;This is definitely good for the market,&quot; one trader said. &quot;People were starting to get nervous, but all this talk of takeovers and the implications has been a boost to confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>The day started with the suspension of shares in six financial holding companies, followed by news that two -- Almanij and Cobepa -- were splitting a third -- Gevaert -- between them.</p>
<p>Deprived of the chance to play directly with any of the suspended shares, traders went instead for their offshoots.</p>
<p>Almanij unit Kredietbank was a major beneficiary of the attention, rising sharply and becoming the main stock of the day by value.</p>
<p>It ended 3.3 percent up at 14,200 francs in a volume of nearly 30,000 shares, having at one stage hit 14,500 francs.</p>
<p>&quot;What is happening at Almanij could be good news for Kredietbank,&quot; one trader said. &quot;Almanij has no cash pile for expanding Kredietbank, but the Gevaert money could give it a lot of options.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There could be lots of developments. Not now but in the coming weeks and months. Will it expand its banking or insurance activities? It is 'watch this space time,'&quot; the trader added.</p>
<p>At the same time, a newspaper report that insurer Royale Belge was on the verge of being sold to either Switzerland's Winterthur or the Dutch ING banking group, triggered a wave of buying.</p>
<p>Winterthur denied the report, ING and co-Royale Belge owner AXA/UAP refused to comment, and Royale Belge itself said all options remained open. This left the market to dally at will and indulge in whatever fantasies it felt moved by.</p>
<p>Royale Belge shares ended the day 2.4 percent higher at 9,910 francs in a volume of nearly 26,000 shares, having at one stage hit 10,250 francs, a new high.</p>
<p>The insurer holds its annual meeting next Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, it was not the only beneficiary of the activity.</p>
<p>Banque Bruxelles Lambert, part owned by Royale Belge and ING, and the subject of repeated merger talk, climbed 0.6 percent to 9,050 francs, having also hit a new high of 9,100 francs at one stage.</p>
<p>&quot;If ING takes Royale Belge it will give it already more than 30 percent of BBL. That is a strong position,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere the market simply went along for the ride, helped by the stronger opening on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p>
<p>The Bel-20 index of blue chip shares ended 22.24 points or 0.99 percent higher at a new record closing high of 2,267.78, having at one stage come within exactly three points of its all time high of 2,271.54.</p>
