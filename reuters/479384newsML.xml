<headline>Spanish minister says speed caused train disaster.</headline>

<p>The passenger train that derailed in northern Spain and killed 18 people was going four times as fast as it should have been when it crashed, authorities said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Just hours after the disaster in the north, a second derailment near Madrid which killed two more people and injured 22 on Tuesday morning raised serious questions about the safety of Spain's railways.</p>
<p>&quot;All existing indications show that excessive speed was the immediate cause of the accident,&quot; Development Minister Rafael Arias Salgado said of the first crash.</p>
<p>Salgado was sent by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to the northern province of Navarre to make a firsthand report of the country's worst train disaster in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>He ruled out sabotage as the cause of the derailment on Monday night in the village of Huarte Araquil, about 32 km (19 miles) northwest of Pamplona in Navarre.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to make clear that any speculation about the possibility of an attack does not have any basis,&quot; Salgado said.</p>
<p>Navarre province borders on the Basque country where violence by separatist rebels is common. The guerrilla group ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) has been fighting for 29 years for an independent state incorporating Navarre, the Basque region and parts of southern France.</p>
<p>Miguel Corsini, president of Spanish rail company RENFE, told reporters the train approached Huarte Araquil station at 137 km (85 miles) per hour when it should have slowed to 30 km (20 miles).</p>
<p>A Pamplona judge investigating the crash ordered the train's driver on Tuesday to take a blood test to detect whether alcohol or drugs affected his ability to operate the train.</p>
<p>A RENFE spokesman told Reuters the train driver and his assistant had escaped injury. RENFE officials and the judge have taken separate statements from the two but no charges have been brought and they have not been detained.</p>
<p>&quot;They were experienced,&quot; the spokesman said of the drivers. &quot;We don't want to say if there was a human error. The investigation is still in progress.&quot;</p>
<p>Opposition political parties led by the Socialists demanded RENFE's Corsini appear before parliamentary committees to explain what caused the accidents.</p>
<p>Less than 10 hours after after the Huarte Araquil crash, a train travelling from Barcelona to Malaga with 54 passengers on board derailed before dawn while changing tracks near Azuqueca de Henares, about 30 km (20 miles) northeast of Madrid.</p>
<p>A train engineer was pronounced dead at the scene and a French woman passenger died on the way to a local hospital, officials said. A RENFE spokesman said the cause of the crash had not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Francisco Alvarez Cascos sought to calm public alarm over the safety of the country's railways.</p>
<p>&quot;Trains are the safest mode of transportation (despite) the dramatic events that have occurred in less than 10 hours,&quot; Cascos said in a radio interview.</p>
<p>The northern train packed with 248 people, many returning from a long Easter holiday weekend, derailed when changing tracks at high speed as it entered Huarte Araquil station.</p>
<p>Medical examiners had to sort through so many body parts they thought at first they had the remains of 19 dead. But a judge investigating the crash reduced the official death toll to 18 on Tuesday afternoon. The 12 women and six men who died were aged 13 to 64 and were all Spaniards.</p>
<p>Forty-three of the 94 people injured on Monday remained in local hospitals on Tuesday, five in very serious condition.</p>
<p>Rescue crews worked through the night pulling bodies from the tangled metal wreckage of the train and ferrying the wounded to hospitals. Passengers described horrifying scenes of people trapped in overturned train carriages screaming for help.</p>
<p>&quot;It was like an earthquake,&quot; said 62-year-old survivor Jos de la Poza Laso who was among the injured rescued after being trapped in a carriage.</p>
<p>&quot;Things were flying everywhere,&quot; he said. &quot;I had only seen something like this in the movies.&quot;</p>
