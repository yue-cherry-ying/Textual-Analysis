<p>Poland is expected to receive a credit rating upgrade from the major rating agencies within the next three to six months given the country's strong economic fundamentals, emerging market debt experts in London said.</p>
<p>&quot;We would anticipate that there is good opportunity for a ratings upgrade and frankly Poland's economic fundamentals are among the best in Eastern Europe,&quot; Daniel McGovern, first vice president and head of emerging markets research for Merrill Lynch in London said. Poland is currently rated Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB-minus by Standard and Poor's Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;Poland is looking very good. I think it (a ratings upgrade) will happen within the next three to six months,&quot; added Stuart Parkinson, senior economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>McGovern said the country's low and steady budget deficits and declining inflation has Poland well-positioned for a ratings upgrade this year. Though the rating agencies may wait for the completion of the country's parliamentary elections to be held in September or October before upgrading Poland, emerging market experts said they do not expect it to impact their decision.</p>
<p>Earlier, a senior Polish banker said Poland's ratings could be upgraded within the next few weeks.</p>
<p>But finance ministry officials have said recent reviews of Poland by Moody's and S&amp;P were not necessarily linked to a ratings upgrade.</p>
