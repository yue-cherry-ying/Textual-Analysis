<p>Britain's new Labour Government has called on the rail franchising director John O'Brien to look into new ways of beefing up his regulatory powers, a spokesman for the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf) told Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>The spokesman said continued concern about the performance of South West Trains, the rail franchise owned by Stagecoach Plc, was one of the reasons Labour was keen to look at ways of strengthening the rail watchdog -- as promised in the election run-up.</p>
<p>O'Brien was given the task after meeting with John Prescott, deputy Prime Minister and head of the joint transport and environment super ministry plus his junior ministers Gavin Strang and Glenda Jackson earlier this week.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour asked the franchising director to look at ways of beefing up his powers,&quot; said Opraf's spokesman in an interview with Reuters. &quot;O'Brien met with Prescott, Strang and Jackson and they accepted he had acted as toughly as he could within his existing powers when dealing with SW Trains.&quot;</p>
<p>But he added that Labour felt primary legislation could be used to give the franchising watchdog more clout and the ability to act more quickly. Opraf is currently constrained under the Railways Act when dealing with errant franchisees.</p>
<p>Before acting it must issue a public order, wait four weeks for a repsonse form the party and then take action based on the franchisee's response. O'Brien plans to report back to government soon, but no date has been given.</p>
