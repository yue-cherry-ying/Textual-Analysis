<p>NWE naphtha prices eased on Tuesday on weaker gasoline, a softer Asian market and a lack of interest from petrochemical buyers, traders said.</p>
<p>They pegged full range cargoes for April delivery around $185/$190 cif NWE.</p>
<p>They said arbitrage to the East appeared to have closed following the export of at least 200,000 tonnes of European material over the past month. Some have said that amount could have been as high as 400,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;With all that extra material we're seeing prices there drop and the arb possibilities are disappearing,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>In Tokyo naptha dipped in quiet trade with first-half June open-spec at $221.50 per tonne and offers at $223.50, against $224.50/$225.50 late on Monday.</p>
<p>Naphtha swaps in Singapore eased by nearly 20 cents per barrel to $22.95/$23.10 for April and $22.60/$22.80 for May.</p>
<p>Traders said the moribund state of the gasoline market at a time when demand should be picking up from the U.S. was also pressuring naphtha.</p>
<p>&quot;Until gasoline takes off naphtha's not going to get much higher,&quot; said one.</p>
