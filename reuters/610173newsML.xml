<p>The leader of Germany's liberal Free Democrats (FDP), Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition partners, vowed on Friday his party would not agree to raise taxes to fill a shortfall in government finances.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to achieve tax cuts, not approve tax rises,&quot; Wolfgang Gerhardt told a party congress.</p>
<p>The FDP has portrayed itself as the champion of lower taxes but has come under pressure to agree to tax hikes to plug a projected gap of 18 billion marks in this year's budget and possible further shortfalls in the next few years.</p>
<p>&quot;The tax shortfalls on the horizon for 1998 to 2001 do not call for tax rises, rather for comprehensive tax reductions,&quot; Gerhardt told around 660 delegates at the congress in the central spa town of Wiesbaden.</p>
<p>Some members of Kohl's Christian Democrats have suggested a rise in petrol or value added tax as a solution to the government's budget problems as Bonn battles to meet the membership criteria for a single European currency.</p>
<p>Others have demanded that the &quot;solidarity surcharge&quot; on income tax -- levied to help pay for German unification -- be cut by only one percentage point instead of two as planned at the beginning of next year.</p>
<p>Gerhardt made clear the FDP was committed to cutting the surcharge but did not state by how much.</p>
<p>&quot;It is and will remain the aim of the FDP to achieve stable budgets without tax rises and to reduce the solidarity surcharge step by step,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gerhardt also called for a faster and more ambitious privatisation programme to stimulate private enterprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Privatisation is urgently required. It is progressing much too hesitantly and is even being fought against in some places and sectors,&quot; said Gerhardt, whose party provides Kohl with his 12-seat parliamentary majority.</p>
<p>&quot;There would be no Chancellor Kohl without us,&quot; he noted, promising the FDP would continue to be a fair coalition partner but would defend its independence.</p>
<p>Other leading figures in the FDP backed Gerhardt's line on taxation.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not yield on our concept of tax reduction, even if we run the danger of annoying our coalition partners,&quot; deputy chairman Rainer Bruederle told ZDF television.</p>
<p>&quot;We will only be able to break the logjam on the necessary reforms with a reduction in the tax burden,&quot; he said.</p>
