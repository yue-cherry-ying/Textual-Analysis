<title>GUATEMALA: Guatemala names reformer as human rights watchdog.</title>
<headline>Guatemala names reformer as human rights watchdog.</headline>
<dateline>GUATEMALA CITY 1997-08-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Guatemalan Congress on Thursday named a new human rights ombudsman, a high-profile post in a country with one of the worst human rights records in the hemisphere.</p>
<p>Julio Arango, a former judge and prosecutor, won 69 of 79 votes to become Guatemala's top watchdog for human rights and government corruption.</p>
<p>On paper, the five-year position is a highly symbolic one, but those who have occupied it in the past have turned it into a bully pulpit, earning nicknames like &quot;conscience of the nation&quot; and &quot;defender of the people.&quot;</p>
<p>The post of human rights ombudsman was created in the mid-1980s by the country's first civilian leader in three decades. Then-President Vinicio Cerezo was under international pressure to clean up the country's dismal human rights record.</p>
<p>Guatemala is emerging from a 36-year civil war between leftist guerrillas and powerful military. Its scorched-earth policies of the war years earned the wrath of human rights groups worldwide as many Indian villages were wiped off the map.</p>
