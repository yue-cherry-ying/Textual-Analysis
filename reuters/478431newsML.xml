<p>NWE straight-run fuel oil markets were quiet on Tuesday as traders dragged themselves back to their desks after Easter.</p>
<p>One prominent low sulphur seller said his phone had hardly rung. Prices were static, despite the fall in crude values, because there was little solid moving them, he added.</p>
<p>But another seller said interest existed for better quality grades, with vessel shortages blocking deals.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a few interested parties for loading mid-April. It is more a question of people trying to line up vessels at reasonable rates,&quot; said the seller.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean straight-run markets were more lively. A Tunisian tender, for loading 6-8/4, was awarded on Friday to a Swiss-based independent trader, players said.</p>
<p>A long-term Tunisian and spot Tunisian and Egyptian tenders, for late month loading, were due to be awarded on Wednesday.</p>
<p>One 0.3 percent low sulphur Libyan cargo which loaded two weekends ago was heard to have gone to the Far East. A second was heard sold to an Italian trader.</p>
<p>Traders said there was good availability of Russian high sulphur straight-run cargoes from the Black Sea.</p>
