<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said U.S. monetary authorities did not intervene in the currency markets in the first quarter, extending the record set last quarter for the longest hiatus since 1973.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no cause to intervene,&quot; said New York Fed executive vice president Peter Fisher at a press conference on Thursday.</p>
<p>The record dates back to 1973 when the double demise of two key international currency pacts signified a switch to the modern day system of free floating foreign exchange markets.  </p>
<p>U.S. monetary authorities last intervened when they purchased dollars on August 15, 1995.</p>
<p>The 19-1/2-month dearth of intervention as of March 1997 surpassed the previous record -- a 14-1/2-month dry spell from March 30, 1981 to June 14, 1982.</p>
<p>When asked whether intervention was ever seriously discussed in the quarter, Fisher declined to comment.</p>
<p>He also said it was unclear whether intervention, when and if it next occurs, will have more of an impact than in the past given the record abstinence.  </p>
<p>&quot;Would foreign exchange intervention be more effective after a hiatus? I have absolutely no a priori reason why (traders) would be more or less affected. It might, it might not,&quot; Fisher told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a very hard time thinking I can predict that with clarity in advance,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The dollar rose 8.8 percent against the mark and 6.9 percent versus the yen in the period, with the bulk of its gains made in January, the Fed said in a report presented to Congress.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, market volatility remained &quot;relatively muted&quot; with the average daily trading range for the dollar widening only slightly.</p>
<p>On average, the dollar traded in a daily range of 0.9 percent against both the mark and yen, up from 0.7 percent in both the previous quarter and the first quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Implied volatility ended the period little changed after a spike up early in the quarter.</p>
<p>The report pointed to the early February Group of Seven (G7) summit as one factor taming the dollar's advance.  </p>
<p>&quot;Comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and the statement by the G7 following their meeting in Berlin were interpreted by market participants as a shift to a more neutral stance in exchange markets,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Also constraining the dollar at times were market expectations of Japanese capital repatriation ahead of that country's March fiscal year-end, the possibility of intervention by Japanese monetary authorities, and the re-emergence of a potential for U.S.-Japan trade tensions, the report said.</p>
<p>At the end of the quarter, foreign currency reserve holdings of the Federal Reserve System and the U.S. Treasury Department's Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) were valued at $17.950 billion and $14.613 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>As of yearend 1996, the balances were $19.264 billion and $19.162 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>The ESF received final repayment from Mexico on January 16 of the remaining $3.5 billion balance outstanding under a medium-term swap arrangement.</p>
