<p>P.J. Carlesimo, who survived earlier rumours of his demise, was fired Thursday as coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.</p>
<p>Carlesimo's firing was announced at a news conference Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Portland was beaten by the Los Angeles Lakers 3-1 in a first-round Western Conference series.</p>
<p>Incorporating several new players, the Trail Blazers were 49-33 this season but failed to win a playoff series for the third straight year under Carlesimo.</p>
<p>There were persistent reports that Carlesimo would be fired at mid-season, but Trail Blazers president Bob Whitsitt promised he would not evaluate Carlesimo until after the season was completed. The 47-year-old Carlesimo had two years left on his five-year contract.</p>
<p>Carlesimo left Seton Hall in 1994 to accept a five-year, $7.5 million offer to become coach of the Trail Blazers.</p>
