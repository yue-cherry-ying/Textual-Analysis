<p>LIFFE robusta coffee futures crept higher in quiet Thursday morning business with activity being curbed by Ascension Day holidays across Europe and in Ivory Coast.</p>
<p>Some Moslem countries including Indonesia, a major robusta producer, are also on holiday to mark Islamic New Year.</p>
<p>Volume reached just 2,636 lots by midsession.</p>
<p>Traders said the advance, extending Wednesday's steep gains, came on the back of arbitrage buying and continued fund stop-loss buying despite scale-up trade selling at the highs.</p>
<p>Benchmark July hit a session peak of $1,780 a tonne, the highest since March 11, but ended the morning trade at $1,778, still a hefty $25 up.</p>
<p>Technically, the contract could continue to edge towards its life high of $1,820 after filling its previous chart gap at $1,705-$1,730 in a fund-led rally on Wednesday. Support is seen intact at $1,590.</p>
<p>&quot;The firm close has left it a touch overbought but the momentum is good,&quot; said Elli Gifford, an independent technical analyst. &quot;I can't see any reason why it shouldn't go higher.&quot;</p>
<p>But analysts said it was doubtful if the market is gaining enough momentum to conquer a double top at $1,815 and $1,820, the recent highs.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, well-supplied robustas have little room on the upside with producers led by Indonesia eager to step up sales into any advance.</p>
<p>But roaster support on the lows could help cushion any sharp falls. The soaring arabica prices on supply tightness might encourage roasters to enhance robusta use in their blends. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985</p>
