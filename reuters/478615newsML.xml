<p>Serbia will soon draft a programme to repay its citizens $4 billion in hard currency savings frozen in 1991. It will also draw up a bank rehabilitation programme to raise credibility of the ailing banking sector.</p>
<p>&quot;Frozen old hard currency savings ruined credibility of our banking system,&quot; Serbian Minister for Economic and Ownership Transformation Milan Beko told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Repaying the debt to citizens is the key to return savings to the banks and to attracting more foreign capital,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Beko insisted structural adjustment of the Yugoslav economy implied a bank overhaul programme and development of a healthy banking system.</p>
<p>Even though the federal government was responsible to tackle both issues, Yugoslavia's constituent republics Serbia and Montenegro have been preparing their solutions to the problem separately.</p>
<p>The crisis of the banking sector, whose fixed term dinar deposits totalled 118.1 million dinars ($21.3 million) at the end of 1996, was also resulting from widespread insolvency of domestic companies.</p>
<p>According to the latest figures issued by the Institute for Market Research, there were 22,356 insolvent companies at the end of February, with mature but unpaid liabilities totalling 7.05 billion dinars.</p>
<p>Beko said the government had to deal urgently with burgeoning internal debt.</p>
<p>&quot;Serbian government will very soon make its intentions public and demand immediate and quick solution to the problem, and that will happen this year,&quot; the minister said. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254</p>
