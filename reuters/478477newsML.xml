<title>CANADA: Old system at Toronto bourse can't handle volumes.</title>
<headline>Old system at Toronto bourse can't handle volumes.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's antiquated computer trading system collapsed in mid-morning trade on Tuesday, crippled for the second time in as many weeks by trading that exceeded the system's capacity.</p>
<p>The system was down for almost an hour today after crashing minutes after trading in Bre-X Minerals Ltd resumed at 1030 EST/1530 GMT following a day-long halt. A total of 7.78 million shares of the troubled Calgary exploration company changed hands in 22 minutes before the system went down.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the last day Bre-X previously traded, TSE systems went down twice during the session and forced the exchange to close 15 minutes early.</p>
<p>&quot;Both days were associated with huge volumes in the system,&quot; TSE spokeswoman Jane Wong told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;It's old architecture. It was developed when the volumes here at the TSE weren't as high, so it's not able to handle increased volumes that we're experiencing right now.&quot;</p>
<p>Wong said the CATS (Computer Assisted Trading System) was due to be replaced later this year by a system driven by TOREX trading engines supplied by the Paris Bourse.</p>
<p>&quot;When we get our new system up in place, these volumes won't be a problem,&quot; said Wong.</p>
<p>Irritated traders in Toronto said the system problems were hurting Canada's reputation as a market player.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel not very good. And neither does the rest of the world,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;(The TSE) looks pretty bad.&quot;</p>
<p>But other traders were taking the collapse in stride.</p>
<p>&quot;(Stuff) happens, there isn't much you can do about it. I don't like it. That's obvious (but) the exchange in the past has had a pretty good record,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The TSE system last collapsed in early 1996.</p>
