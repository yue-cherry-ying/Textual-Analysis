<p>Ohio Gov. George Voinovich late Monday signed into law a bill authorizing the state Department of Transportation to sell up to $432.5 million of highway bonds over the next two years, a department spokesman said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The bonds backed by the state's gasoline tax will fund general construction projects throughout Ohio in the fiscal 1998-99 bienium, which begins on July 1, department communications director Pieter Wykoff said.</p>
<p>The Ohio transportation department spends $800 million to $900 million each year on construction projects, funding some improvements through cash and others through bond sales, Wykoff added.</p>
<p>No date has been set for a bond sale, which will be coordinated by the department's finance director based on cash flow and federal transportation funding, Wykoff said.</p>
<p>The legislation also included $90 million of bonding authority for the state infrustructure bank created last year to provide loans to local governments for funding transportation improvements, Wykoff noted.</p>
<p>The legislation authorizes up to $50 million of bonds for fiscal 1998 and $40 million for fiscal 1999, Wykoff said. Those bonds will be issued by the state treasurer's office, he added.</p>
<p>Ohio's revolving loan program offers low-interest loans to fund such improvements as interchanges, airport expansions and highway projects. It was one of 10 states included in a pilot program created by Congress in the National Highway System Act of 1995.</p>
