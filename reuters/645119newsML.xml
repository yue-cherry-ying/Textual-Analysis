<p>Five Nations heavyweights England crashed to a stunning 33-13 defeat against rugby minnows Argentina in the second and final test on Saturday, allowing the South Americans to square the series.</p>
<p>England, missing several players who carried them to four wins out of five in this year's Five Nations series, were outclassed by a hungrier Argentine side.</p>
<p>The tourists were without Mike Catt and Nigel Redman who were called up to join the Lions' tour in South Africa during the week. But their presence could not have made all that much difference in view of the wide winning margin.</p>
<p>Argentina were also without injured Federico Mendez, but they spent almost the entire first half in the England half.</p>
<p>Although they came close to scoring tries on several occasions, all they had to show for their efforts were two penalties by Gonzalo Quesada and a Facundo Soler try converted by Quesada.</p>
<p>England, who won the first test 46-20 a week earlier, waited until the last 10 minutes of the first half before threatening the Argentine line.</p>
<p>Fly-half Mark Mapletoft landed a penalty for England's only points in the half.</p>
<p>Argentina again dominated territorially in the second half, adding a penalty and two more tries to open a 28-3 lead with 17 minutes to go.</p>
<p>England fought back with replacement full-back Alex King and Danny Grewcock racing over to score.</p>
<p>Argentina had the last say, however, when Eduardo Simone scored with three minutes of the match remaining to seal a memorable win.</p>
<p>Teams:</p>
<p>England: Jim Mallinder (Alex King 60), John Sleightholme, Phil de Glanville (captain), Nick Greenstock, Adedavo Adebayo, Mark Mapletoft, Kyran Bracken, Tony Diprose, Ben Clarke, Martin Corry, Danny Grewcock, Martin Haag, Darren Garforth, Richard Cockerill, Kevin Yates.</p>
<p>Argentina: Ezequiel Jurado (German Aristide 60), Tomas Solari, Eduardo Simone, Lisandro Arbizu (captain), Facundo Soler, Gonzalo Quesada, Nicolas Fernandez Miranda, Pablo Camerinckx, Ignacio Fernandez Lobbe, Rolando Martin (Cristian Viel 76), German Llanes, Pedro Sporleder (Fernandez Lobbe), Roberto Grau, Carlos Promanzio, Mauro Reggiardo (Omar Hasan 57).</p>
