<title>ALBANIA: First U.N. food supplies distributed to Albanians.</title>
<headline>First U.N. food supplies distributed to Albanians.</headline>
<dateline>DURRES, Albania 1997-04-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>The first supplies of U.N. World Food Programme aid to Albania's poor and needy were handed out on Saturday, officials said.</p>
<p>The U.N.'s food agency began passing out supplies of wheat flour, beans and vegetable oil to representatives from about 20 Albanian institutions at the western Albanian port of Durres.</p>
<p>Small vans and cars from the institutions drove to Durres from around the country to pick up the sacks of food supplies. They plan to return to their towns and villages without protection from the multinational security force that began arriving in Albania this week.</p>
<p>&quot;We have asked these institutions to come to pick up the food supplies using their own vehicles,&quot; Laura Boldrini, a spokeswoman for the WFP, told journalists in Durres. &quot;This is not an operation for which you can have military escorts. It is a low profile, low visibility operation.&quot;</p>
<p>The institutions include hospitals, orphanages, and homes for the elderly and handicapped that have run short of supplies amid the armed anarchy that has swept Albania since the collapse of fraudulent investment schemes earlier this year. Some 300 people have been killed in the spasm of looting and banditry.</p>
<p>The relief operation is running in parallel with diplomatic efforts to steer the Balkan country towards early elections in June and end weeks of violent unrest.</p>
<p>The pace of the humanitarian aid effort was set to pick up within the next few days as convoys of soldiers from the eight-nation security force led by Italy spread out across the country.</p>
