<p>Senior Clinton administration and IMF officials Tuesday urged Russia to revitalise its economic reforms, saying the payoff would be growth and fuller membership in the global community.</p>
<p>&quot;We should be under no illusion of how important this particular moment is,&quot; said International Monetary Fund Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer. &quot;It is critical that they succeed.&quot;</p>
<p>Fischer's remarks to the U.S.-Russia Business Council came as his boss, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, was in Moscow for talks with a new team of Russian ministers led by reformer Antoly Chubais.</p>
<p>Camdessus is hoping to get the broad outlines of an accord that allows the second year of the IMF programme to go forward, allowing the release of additional money from the $10 billion loan it agreed to in March of last year.</p>
<p>The IMF, which was reviewing the economic programme on a monthly basis, stopped disbursements of funds in February as Moscow failed to live up to economic conditions agreed to under the programme.</p>
<p>Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who also spoke to the business group, urged the IMF and World Bank to step up their efforts to help Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;The IMF should use the opportunity of a new economic team and new Fund programme to make a fresh start in defining a programme strategy for Russia,&quot; Summers said.</p>
<p>He also called on the World Bank to greatly increase its role in the Russan reform process, saying the development institution should provide $2 billion in additional loans this year.</p>
<p>&quot;I call on the World Bank to now take the lead and greatly increase its role in Russian reforms,&quot; Summers said.</p>
<p>At the same time, he made clear that Russia also must act to solve its own probems, including passing an array of legal, regulatory and investment policy reforms.</p>
<p>Commerce Secretary William Daley, who also spoke to the group, said the Clinton administration was focusing its efforts with Russia on increasing market access, membership in the World Trade Organisation, and emphasis on the rule of law in commercial arrangements.</p>
<p>&quot;With reformist Russian leaders in senior positions, real work should begin in earnest to improve the climate for trade and investment,&quot; Daley said.</p>
<p>Fischer cited Russia's problems with collecting taxes and the need for reforms in general of the tax system as the main problem facing the country as budget difficulties grow.</p>
<p>He also said that that the country must forge ahead with other reforms, arguing that if it did so it would fulfil its huge promise and become an even greater player in the international economic arena.</p>
<p>&quot;If they are undertaken, you may expect to see the situation turn around relatively rapidly, you may expect see growth begin, I believe this year, if this government does what it needs to do,&quot; Fischer said.</p>
