<p>Pacific Concord Holdings Ltd said on Tuesday it will acquire 196.4 million shares of Yaohan International Holdings Ltd (YIH) at HK$0.684 per share from the chairman of Yaohan Group and his family.</p>
<p>The HK$134 million deal was the first step in forming a strategic alliance between Pacific Concord and Yaohan Group involving active cooperation in developing and operating department stores, megamarts and supermarkets in China, it said.</p>
<p>The alliance also allowed the use of the Yaohan corporate identity and the distribution of Yaohan brandname products to all Concord stores in China, as well as the provision of Yaohan operating expertise to Concord stores under managment contract.</p>
<p>The shares, representing 19.87 percent of YIH's issued share capital, will be acquired from Yaohan International Co Ltd (YIC), a company owned by Yaohan Group founder and chairman Kazuo Wada and his family, Pacific Concord said in a statement.</p>
<p>Following the share deal, Pacific Concord and YIC will hold approximately equal percentage interests in YIH. The acquisition is conditional on Pacific Concord not being required to make a general offer for YIH.</p>
<p>&quot;Our Concord stores will immediately benefit from the well proven operating systems of the Yaohan Group and the great variety of quality merchandise under the Yaohan brandname,&quot; Pacific Concord chairman Wong Sai-chung said in the statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Moreover, potential operation of more Yaohan Department stores within the properties of Concord Land in the long run will also be mutually beneficial,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Concord Land Development Co Ltd, a 75-percent owned unit of Pacific Concord, owns a total of 3.2 million square feet of shopping mall space in five Chinese cities.</p>
<p>Pacific Concord is involved in retail, property and telecommunications businesses, and currently operates seven department stores in China.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-listed YIH operates department stores and retails consumer products. Its shares ended down HK$0.04 at HK$0.66 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Yaohan Group operates a total of over 400 stores worldwide.</p>
