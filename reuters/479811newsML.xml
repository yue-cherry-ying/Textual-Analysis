<headline>Slovenia eyes mark Eurobond - London dealers.</headline>

<p>Slovenia could launch a mark Eurobond and has taken bids from banks to underwrite such a deal, bankers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Slovenia has taken bids for a mark deal, at five-, seven- and 10-year maturities,&quot; a trader at a European bank said.</p>
<p>Another dealer said the issue could be for up to 400 million marks, and Slovenia was expected to make a decision on whether or not to launch the deal by the end of April.</p>
<p>This would be its second venture into the international bond market. Last July, Slovenia launched a debut Eurobond issue via J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>The $325 million five-year deal was priced to yield 58 basis points over U.S. Treasury notes, at the time the tightest spread for any Eurobond out of Eastern Europe. The deal was trading at 60 b.p. over on the bid side on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Slovenia has high credit ratings compared with other borrowers in the region. It is rated A3 by Moody's Investors Service and A by Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
<p>A number of other Eastern European countries are also eyeing the mark Eurobond sector.</p>
<p>Romania plans to issue its first mark-denominated bond via CS First Boston and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. The deal is expected to be for up to 750 million marks with a five- to seven-year maturity.</p>
<p>Romania is rated Ba3 by Moody's and BB minus by S&amp;P.</p>
