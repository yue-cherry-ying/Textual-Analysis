<p>Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd said on Thursday the rate of loss of market share in international voice services slowed in the second half of fiscal 1996 with the launch of its new international services.</p>
<p>&quot;The main focus of local competitors during the year was on the offering of discounted international voice services. The rate of loss of market share slowed in the second half as the company responded successfully with a range of competitive offerings,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Hongkong Telecom reported a rise of 12.5 percent in net profit for the year to March 31 to HK$11.18 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;This was driven in part by international telephone revenue growth of 5.2 percent, recovering from 1.3 percent growth last year, and the strong performance of other core businesses which rose 18 percent,&quot; Hongkong Telecom said.</p>
<p>&quot;In April this year the company launched new international services which have helped regain market share,&quot; it added.  </p>
<p>In November, chief executive Linus Cheung said increasing callback services, particularly on North American routes, had reduced international revenues in the first half of its 1996/97 year as the Hong Kong outgoing call charge was replaced by a lower incoming payment from the callback country.</p>
<p>Hongkong Telecom launched two cut-price international direct dial services in April.</p>
<p>It said overall international traffic rose 12 percent in 1996/97, driven by China traffic growth of six percent and non-China traffic growth of 17 percent.</p>
<p>International business services revenues rose 25 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Our aim is to further enhance our international connectivity which will help us lower our cost of delivery of international traffic,&quot; Cheung said in a statement.</p>
