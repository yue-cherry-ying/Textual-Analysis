<p>French police said on Saturday they had broken up a youthful ring of counterfeiters, comprised of seven high school students printing 100-franc ($17) and 200-franc bank notes on a home computer.</p>
<p>&quot;The 100-franc note was particularly successful,&quot; Gendarmerie Captain Michel Balland in Thann, eastern France, told Reuters.</p>
<p>After questioning the seven youths, whose names were not released, prosecutors placed two of them under a judge's supervision before releasing them.</p>
<p>Police said their counterfeiting had begun as a game.</p>
<p>The students, from well-off families and with clearly advanced computer skills, scanned bank notes into their computer's memory, touched them up and then printed out the result on a high-quality laser printer.</p>
<p>In all, they sold some 15 bank notes at 20 francs (about $3.50) each until suspicious local merchants brought the bills to the attention of police, who tracked down the youths and brought them in for questioning. ($ = 5.818 French Francs)</p>
