<p>Local affiliates of CBS Television said Wednesday they were concerned the network would become the station for the retirement community unless it began attracting younger viewers.</p>
<p>Gathering for their annual meeting here, many affiliates expressed concern about the network's recent success building overall audiences since too many of the viewers it picked up in the last season fell outside of the key demographic groups that advertisers covet.</p>
<p>In fact, those happiest with the network's performance tended to be affiliates in areas like Florida which have a large concentration of over-65 viewers. But even they said there was concern that some of the network's most successful programmes fare poorly in major cities and in the key 18-to-24 age group.</p>
<p>&quot;In many major markets like New York and Los Angeles, the television dial starts with Channel 4,&quot; said one general manager of a local affiliate. He was referring to the fact that in those markets, CBS is Channel 2, which a good share of viewers simply bypass.</p>
<p>With a stable of hit shows like &quot;Touched By an Angel,&quot; &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; and &quot;Cosby&quot;, CBS finished the latest season second in terms of total household audiences, after NBC.</p>
<p>But the demographic breakdown of those ratings told a different story. Hip shows like &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot; helped NBC attract the young audience and seal some advertising contracts unprecedented in size. CBS shows were mostly popular among older viewers.</p>
<p>Some of those issues were discussed Wednesday as advertisers were coached on how to most effectively reach target consumers.</p>
<p>A big problem CBS has had to overcome is the fact that only four of its shows made it onto a &quot;preferred&quot; list the consumer group J.D. Power &amp; Associates compiles for automobile advertisers. By comparison, 20 NBC shows, nine ABC shows and seven from the Fox network made it onto the J.D. Power list, which aims to guide advertisers on how to best reach key demographic groups.</p>
<p>CBS' relationship with its affiliates is crucial since it depends on the local stations to promote and air its programmes.</p>
<p>The affiliates meeting falls closely on the heels of a major executive shakeup that has left top management at CBS bracing for more change.</p>
<p>Peter Lund resigned last week as president of the CBS television and cable group, and Mel Karmazin, who formerly headed the network's radio division was named chief executive of the CBS station group. The abrupt change has stirred some concern of a bigger power struggle between Karmazin and his current boss, Westinghouse Electric Corp. Chairman Michael Jordan, over management of the entire company.</p>
