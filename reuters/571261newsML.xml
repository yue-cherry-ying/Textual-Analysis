<p>An Iranian newspaper said on Thursday low rainfall and earthquakes had hit Iran's wheat production and demanded officials explain what it called alarming reports the country was doubling its wheat imports.</p>
<p>The International Grains Council in a report on May 1 predicted Iran would import 6.6 million tonnes of wheat in the 12 months to June 30, more than double the previous year's estimate and sharply higher than a 5.0 million tonnes forecast only a month earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;If the estimates happen to be current, the officials concerned should give proper reasons for the increase in our wheat import over one year,&quot; the English-language Tehran Times said in an editorial.</p>
<p>&quot;We are aware of the fact that decline in the current year's rainfall and earthquakes that devastated massive farmlands across the country have left negative impacts on our wheat production.</p>
<p>&quot;However, the doubling of wheat imports in one year is very much alarming, for dependence on foreign countries for foodstuff, especially a staple diet, is more dangerous than dependence on others for any other commodity,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>&quot;Dependence on foreign countries for staple diet in certain cases can even lead to a political crisis in the country, threatening the whole Islamic system,&quot; the English daily said.</p>
<p>Iran in March appealed for 100,000 tonnes of barley to immediately feed 200,000 head of livestock in its agricultural northwest hit by an earthquake that killed nearly 1,000 people and completely destroyed 20 villages. It also asked for 70 tonnes of wheat seed and 70 tonnes of barley seed.</p>
<p>The Tehran Times said self-sufficiency and self-reliance in the agriculture sector was indispensable for developing countries because dependence on foreign countries made the dependent country vulnerable to blackmail and sanctions diplomacy.</p>
<p>&quot;If we are not in a position to fill up the stomachs of our people, we are doomed to face crisis after crisis. Therefore, we should bear in mind that in our development plans we pay due attention to our agriculture sector,&quot; the newspaper added.</p>
<p>The main exporters of wheat to Iran, which subsidises bread for its population of 60 million, are Australia, Canada and the European Union.</p>
