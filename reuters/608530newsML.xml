<p>Mediterranean oil products were flat to slightly lower on Friday in a dull market, traders said.</p>
<p>Gas oil remained under pressure with end-May and June avails seen piling up in an already over-supplied market.</p>
<p>A distressed Russian heating oil cargo which loaded on May 19 was heard placed into Greece at a significant discount to high cif quotes, traders said. A cargo loading 24-26 at Tuapse was heard sold at high cif quotes +$1.85 a tonne, while another with May 23-25 loading dates was still on offer.</p>
<p>Traders said with Italian barrels looking abundant for next month, buyers were extremely relaxed.</p>
<p>Fuel markets were still quiet and awash with Russian material. Outright numbers have begun to drift lower with both bunker and refinery buying interest very limited and June high sulphur swaps slipping to $75.70 and $76.</p>
<p>Most recent bunker demand in the western Med has been filled by Russian cargoes from the north. One Italian outlet was still negotiating late on Friday with plenty to chose from.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot of Russian material coming through from the Black Sea without homes to go to,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Naphtha was flat in lacklustre trade with cargo prices assessed around the $173/$176 level.</p>
<p>One trader said, however, that there were some five cargoes on offer out of north Africa at the moment and not many takers.</p>
<p>He said there were three cargoes out of Alexandria, one of Libya and a small Tunisian parcel -- none of which he saw going East. He also questioned reports that an Alexandria cargo was heading for the United States.</p>
<p>Gasoline was firm with healthy demand out of Italy and Turkey keeping the market tight in a not overly supplied market. Traders put prices at quotes fob Med +$2.50/+$3.50 for unleaded premium material.</p>
