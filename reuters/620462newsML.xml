<p>Sydney Guilaroff, considered by many to be the greatest hairdresser in Hollywood history, who created &quot;the look&quot; for the top MGM female stars, died on Wednesday. He was 89.</p>
<p>Guilaroff, credited with giving Claudette Colbert her distinctive bangs and turning a naturally blonde Lucille Ball into a redhead, died at the Beverly Hills Rehabilitation Centre after a long illness, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Discovered in New York in the 1930's by Joan Crawford, Guilaroff was the first hairdresser to be given a screen credit for his work.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said actor Roddy McDowell had recently lobbied the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to have a special award given to Guilaroff.</p>
<p>The English-born stylist, who grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba, also counted many of Hollywood's greatest beauties as his friends and wrote about them in his recently published memoirs.</p>
<p>He began his MGM career doing Greta Garbo's hair for &quot;Camille.&quot; He followed with other classic coiffes such as Norma Shearer as &quot;Marie Antoinette,&quot; Marlene Dietrich in &quot;Kismet,&quot; Vivien Leigh in &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; and Debbie Reynolds in &quot;Singin' in the Rain.&quot;</p>
<p>He was a stylist of choice for Ava Gardner, Marilyn Monroe, Natalie Wood, Shirley MacLaine and Elizabeth Taylor.</p>
<p>Guilaroff is survived by two sons.</p>
