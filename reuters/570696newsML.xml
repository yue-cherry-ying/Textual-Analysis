<p>Greek depos and forex forwards were holding but for a minor drop in one-year forwards on a weaker dollar, bonds were steady and ecu/drachma easier in early dealings, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Depos and forex forwards are sitting tight in early scant trading,&quot; said a trader at a private bank. &quot;One-year forwards are slightly lower on a weaker dollar.&quot;</p>
<p>A lower CPI-based inflation figure for April will not affect depos and forwards, the dealer said.</p>
<p>April CPI inflation eased to 5.9 percent year-on-year in April from 6.0 percent in March, a monetary source told Reuters. The official inflation figure will be released later on.</p>
<p>&quot;The lower inflation figure has been discounted,&quot; said the dealer. &quot;Rates will make waves if the the central bank chnages its deposit facility rates.&quot;</p>
<p>Bond dealers said the market was quiet and prices were holding.</p>
<p>&quot;Buying interest for both taxable and non-taxable fixed coupon bonds emerged late on Wednesday from abroad especially when New York opened,&quot; said a bond dealer at a private bank.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 158.86/91 from Wednesday's 158.780 fix, the dollar at 271.96/06 drachmas from 273.330 and the ecu at 309.47/57 from 309.660 drachmas.</p>
<p>&quot;Ecu/drachma is easier trading around 309.45/50,&quot; said a private bank dealer.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece, the domestic money market's biggest player, quoted the following early rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at  9.80-10.30</p>
<p>** T/N at  9.80-10.30</p>
