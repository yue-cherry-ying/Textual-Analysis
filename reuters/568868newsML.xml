<p>Middle East very large crude carrier (VLCC) rates remained firm on Thursday, with rates to Japan pushing above the W60 level, brokers said.</p>
<p>The 280,000 tonne World Phoenix was fixed at W63.5 Mideast/Japan for Idemitsu, while voyages west fetched about W55, with the 280,000 tonne British Valour done at this rate Ras Tanura/east coast Canada for Irving.</p>
<p>&quot;About 20 VLCCs have been done this week. Things are looking pretty active on the AG (Middle East) front after a dull period in April,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>The West Africa market also looked buoyant with VLCCs around W65 and 130,000 tonners (Suezmaxes)at W95.</p>
<p>&quot;There's quite a lot going on in West Africa, too with rates looking firmish, depending on dates,&quot; the broker added.</p>
<p>The 123,000 tonne Corcovado was reported done at W95 Pennington/Pembroke for Stentex. This followed a similar fixture for Texaco on Wednesday, also Nigeria/Pembroke. Little Nigerian crude generally goes to northern Europe.</p>
<p>Cross-Med 80,000 tonne (Aframax) rates dipped to W102.5 from W105 while Suezmaxes were steady to slightly firmer at W92.5. Inter-U.K./Cont Aframaxes were flat at W90/92.5.</p>
<p>On fuel oil, 25,000 tonnes cross-Med dipped to W180 from W190 on a lack of enquiry, while it was steady in the north at W185, brokers said.</p>
<p>The picture on the Caribs/upcoast market was mixed, with 70,000 tonne crude cargoes dipping to W167.5 from W175 and 50,000 tonne fuel oil vessels firmer at W215 from W185.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the usual supply and demand, nothing special,&quot; one broker said of this volatile market.</p>
