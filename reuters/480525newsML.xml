<title>SINGAPORE: Newly-found Somerset Maugham text? April Fool!</title>
<headline>Newly-found Somerset Maugham text? April Fool!</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The tale told on Tuesday of two cleaners unearthing a long-lost manuscript by late British author Somerset Maugham in Singapore's colonial-era Raffles Hotel turned out sadly for his fans to be untrue.</p>
<p>A hotel spokeswoman told Reuters the Straits Times newspaper story of the discovery of a 400-page handwritten manuscript in a disused basement was an April Fool's joke.</p>
<p>It said &quot;The Sacred Flame&quot; was written on faded hotel stationery and wrapped between the covers of an old Tiffin Room menu. The famed hotel, where Maugham often stayed, was completely refurbished in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The newspaper's page two story said the hotel had faxed copies of the manuscript to Maugham experts in Britain who, thoroughly excited, were eager to head for Singapore to authenticate the original.</p>
<p>The story even quoted one expert as calling the discovery important as it was more autobiographical than his previous novels of the late British colonial era set in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>It said the manuscript was titled &quot;The Sacred Flame&quot; and included &quot;poignant episodes&quot; about Maugham's &quot;homosexuality and problems he had with his stammering&quot;.</p>
