<p>Istanbul shares fell in afternoon selling on Thursday amid renewed political concerns over the fate of the Islamist-led coalition government, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB National-100 closed 19 points, or 1.29 percent lower at 1,459. It was up 0.27 percent at the end of the first session. Trade volume retreated to 14.84 trillion lira ($108.8 million) from 19.20 trillion ($140.8 million) on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Yalim Erez's statements negatively affected the market in the afternoon session,&quot; said Erden Gokay from Taksim securities.</p>
<p>Former minister Yalim Erez said on Thursday he was confident of forming an alliance with other secularist politicians to oust Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's Islamist-led government.</p>
<p>Erez has been trying to drum up support for a secularist pact since he resigned as trade and industry minister last month over the government's reluctance to comply with army demands for a crackdown on Islamist activism.</p>
<p>&quot;The market cannot get out of the sideways movement because of politics. There is support at 1,420, I do not expect sharp fluctuations, there will be share-based activity,&quot; said Neslihan Kacamak from Bab securities.</p>
<p>The index recovered 6.2 percent in the last two days after plunging 9.1 percent in eight trade days amid concerns over the fate of the Islamist-led coalition government after the market opened on April 24 following a 6-1/2 day holiday.</p>
