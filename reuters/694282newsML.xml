<p>World championship leader Michael Schumacher on Saturday secured pole position for the French Grand Prix with a strong performance in the early stages of a German-dominated qualifying session.</p>
<p>Schumacher, in his Ferrari, clocked the best time of one minute 14.548 seconds after only 13 minutes of the hour of frantic activity on the Magny-Cours circuit and then relaxed as his rivals attempted to improve on his time.</p>
<p>Schumacher made two further runs without trimming his time but was challenged strongly by both his 21-year-old brother Ralf, in a Jordan, and fellow German Heinz-Harald Frentzen in a Williams.</p>
<p>Frentzen will share the front row of the grid with Schumacher, whose pole was the 16th of his career and his second in succession this year. Frentzen clocked 1:14.749.</p>
<p>Ralf Schumacher was third fastest, the younger of the two racing drivers from Kerpen grabbing the best grid spot of his fledgling Formula One career.</p>
<p>Canadian Jacques Villeneuve, who is second in the title race, wound up fourth fastest in the second Williams after recovering from a heavy accident during the morning's free practice session when he spun backwards off the track into a tyre barrier.</p>
<p>Briton Eddie Irvine was fifth fastest in the second Ferrari ahead of Italian Jarno Trulli, making his debut for the Prost team as replacement for injured Frenchman Olivier Panis.</p>
