<p>Troops fired in the air on Friday to break up a Kinshasa protest by supporters of veteran populist politican Etienne Tshisekedi, who was excluded from the new government of the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>&quot;A group of demonstrators were heading towards the parliament building and the soldiers opened fire in the air,&quot; one witness said. There was no immediate indication of any casualties.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi told a news conference: &quot;This government doesn't exist for me. I ask all the people to resist with their last energy all attempts to impose a government without popular legitimacy,&quot;</p>
<p>About 300 to 400 chanting Tshisekedi supporters called for the departure of Rwandan and other foreign soldiers in Laurent Kabila's Alliance forces who captured Kinshasa last weekend and created the new Congo from the former Zaire.</p>
<p>On a march from Tshisekedi's house in Limete into the city centre the demonstrators chanted slogans calling Kabila a dictator.</p>
<p>As the protests flared, ousted Zaire president Mobutu Sese Seko headed for Morocco from Togo on the Togolese presidential plane.</p>
<p>&quot;President Mobutu has asked permission to spend a few days in Morocco for health reasons before going to his permanent place of residence,&quot; the official MAP news agency said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Mobutu's stay in Morocco will be strictly private.&quot;</p>
<p>Reporters were banned from Rabat airport.</p>
<p>Kabila, whose rebels captured Kinshasa on May 17, angered many in the city of five million by failing to appoint Tshisekedi prime minister of the new government announced late on Thursday.</p>
<p>Two days behind schedule, self-proclaimed president Kabila announced an incomplete list of 13 cabinet ministers and dropped the position of prime minister.</p>
<p>As soon as he took charge of Africa's third biggest country, Kabila came under intense domestic pressure and some Western encouragement to appoint Tshisekedi to a key post such as the prime ministership.</p>
<p>He brushed aside those calls despite warnings that Tshisekedi, a longtime political foe of Mobutu, remains a hugely popular political figure, especially in Kinshasa's teeming shanty towns.</p>
<p>Senior members of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL) said six of the ministers on the list, run hourly on Friday by national radio, were not Alliance members.</p>
<p>But the pro-Tshisekedi La Reference newspaper said the Alliance had awarded itself all but four posts.</p>
<p>In the Zimbabwe capital of Harare, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki cautioned that Kabila's new transitional government cannot afford to rush into elections.</p>
<p>He said South Africa would finalise plans next week to send a team of experts to Kinshasa to help reconstruct the economy of &quot;bankrupt&quot; former Zaire,</p>
<p>The ousted Mobutu, who has prostate cancer, arrived in Lome from his jungle palace at Gbadolite in northern Zaire on Sunday night, a day after Kabila's rebels marched into Kinshasa.</p>
<p>He initially landed in Togo for a technical stopover but Togolese sources said the government had reluctantly agreed to let him stay longer because of his state of health.</p>
<p>Sources close to Togo President Gnassingbe Eyadema said Mobutu would spend a few days in Morocco and then go to France.</p>
<p>French Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain hinted on Wednesday that France might be prepared to admit Mobutu for medical treatment but there has been no confirmation.</p>
