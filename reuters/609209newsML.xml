<p>Voting in Iran's presidential election ended on Friday after four extra hours of balloting because of a high turnout in polls to choose a successor to President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.</p>
<p>More than 33,000 polling stations which opened at 8.00 a.m. (0330 GMT) and were due to close 10 hours later were twice instructed by the Interior Ministry to remain open. They eventually closed at 10.00 p.m. (1730 GMT) but the ministry said anyone still waiting to vote had to be allowed to cast their ballot.</p>
<p>Analysts said the result, likely to be announced by Monday, was expected to show a close contest between the two leading candidates -- moderate Mohammad Khatami and conservative Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri. Both are Shi'ite Moslem clerics. The two other candidates allowed to stand are rated outsiders.</p>
<p>Thirty-three million Iranians aged 15 and over were eligible to vote. Rafsanjani must step down in August after serving the maximum two consecutive four-year terms allowed by the Islamic republic's law.</p>
