<p>A U.K. court on Thursday ordered Abbas Gokal, the biggest borrower from the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), to pay 2.94 million pounds for false accounting and conspiracy to defraud.</p>
<p>Britain's central criminal court, the Old Bailey, said if Gokal failed to pay the fine, he would be ordered to serve three years in prison.  </p>
<p>Gokal was found guilty in April of conspiring to account falsely and of conspiracy to defraud following a trial lasting nearly five months.</p>
<p>BCCI collapsed in 1991 with debts of more than $12 billion after evidence emerged of widespread money laundering. Thousands of people lost their savings in what was the biggest fraud in banking history.</p>
<p>Gokal, 61, had with BCCI officials been found to have masterminded a massive fraud totalling around $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Liquidators Deloitte &amp; Touche are pursuing claims against various parties as a result of the bank's demise.</p>
<p>There are civil cases pending against both Gokal and his Gulf shipping and trading group and further action is expected against him in Pakistan.</p>
<p>So far creditors of BCCI have received some $2.65 billion, around one quarter of their claims, and a further 10 percent is expected to be paid within the next year. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717</p>
