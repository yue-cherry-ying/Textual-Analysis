<p>The Serb member of Bosnia's collective presidency snubbed German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Thursday, refusing to meet him due to a dispute over protocol, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Momcilo Krajisnik, a hardline Serb nationalist, withdrew from a meeting between Kinkel and other presidency members at the last moment after expressing dissatisfaction with seating arrangements.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems so ridiculous, don't you think?...I think the way in which Mr Krajisnik has behaved is irresponsible,&quot; Kinkel told a news conference afterwards.</p>
<p>&quot;We came here to discuss important questions and we wanted to talk to the three gentlemen in the presidency and then we met only two of the three because the other one didn't think it neccessary to come...&quot;</p>
<p>Kinkel, who travelled to Sarajevo to discuss the repatriation of Bosnian refugees, instead held talks with the other presidency members, Alija Izetbegovic, a Moslem, and Kresimir Zubak, a Croat.</p>
<p>Diplomats said Krajisnik disagreed with the seating order, which put Izetbegovic, chairman of the presidency, in the centre flanked by his Serb and Croat counterparts.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the international High Representative to Bosnia, Carl Bildt, said Krajisnik's boycott was &quot;childish and a missed opportunity&quot;.</p>
<p>European Union commissioner Hans Van den Broek, who accompanied Kinkel to Sarajevo, said the &quot;display of disunity&quot; would do nothing to encourage more international aid for Bosnia.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is correct to say that in the international community there is a certain donor fatigue vis a vis Bosnia-Herzegovina,&quot; Van den Broek said.</p>
<p>Van den Broek said that the EU had spent 300 million ECU on reconstruction in 1996 and will fund the construction of housing for some 50,000 people by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Kinkel's visit coincided with growing pressure in Germany to return some of the 320,000 Bosnian refugees who fled the Yugoslav conflict.</p>
<p>German states, complaining the Bosnians have become a financial burden, announced plans last year to deport between 70,000 to 90,000 refugees.</p>
<p>Kinkel said Germany was committed to returning refugees in a &quot;humane way&quot; but said Bosnia's peacetime government had to show it was willing to welcome the refugees back.</p>
<p>&quot;We have made an enormous effort, we have made available an enormous amount of money -- the international community and Germany -- and we will continue to do so.</p>
<p>&quot;But we want to be given the impression that this side too is trying to come to grips with the problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Kinkel has criticised Germany's 16 states for deciding last year to compel refugees to return to their war-ravaged country if they failed to leave voluntarily.</p>
<p>The foreign minister has urged the states to come up with a unified plan to return refugees but state interior ministers declined to accompany Kinkel on his trip.</p>
<p>The interior ministers said nothing significant could be accomplished by the trip without the participation of Germany's Interior Minister Manfred Kanther.</p>
