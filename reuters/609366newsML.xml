<p>With broad support from President Clinton's Democrats, the Republican-led Senate approved a five-year plan Friday to balance the federal budget and cut taxes.</p>
<p>The Senate approved the budget on a 78-22 vote, drawing on the broad middle political ground with 41 Republicans and 37 Democrats voting for it. Those voting against it, 14 Republcans and eight Democrats, were among the Senate's most liberal and most conservative members.</p>
<p>The House had passed its version, 333-99, Wednesday. Before the budget deal can be sealed, differences in the two versions must be worked out. The House abruptly closed for a 10-day recess Thursday before the work on the budget and an unrelated disaster relief bill could be completed.</p>
<p>A House Democratic aide said they must still settle the thorny issue of whether Congress will send Clinton separate tax and domestic savings bills as the White House has wanted. Separating the two is thought to give the administration greater advantage in negotiations.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia said the strong Democratic vote for the budget agreement, following Democratic votes for tax hikes in 1993 that many say cost them control of Congress, put an end to the image of the party as not watchful over taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;This is now a Democratic Party which is committed to fiscal responsibility.  And nobody ever again can say that we're not. The facts are there. We've made the votes,&quot; he said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, praised the accord saying, &quot;Everybody will tell you this is not a perfect document, but it's the best one I've seen in the last 10 or 15 years.&quot;</p>
<p>Budget Committee chairman Pete Domenici, who spearheaded the negotiations for the Senate, noted that it is a blueprint for congressional action on future legislation which faces difficult months of negotiations.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the American people now must judge us on whether we implement this agreement,&quot; the New Mexico Republican said.</p>
<p>A host of amendments that called for more spending on schools, roads and domestic programmes were rejected during the week's debate.</p>
<p>The budget plan trims Medicare by $115 billion over five years and makes changes to the programme -- including shifting the cost of home health care to the individual health care plan and out of the hospital trust fund.</p>
<p>These changes are expected to keep it solvent for the next decade after which the large baby boom generation will start retiring and make heavy demands on the programme. Reform of Medicare and other entitlements are acknowledged as the next tough job facing Congress and the administration once this year's tax and spending bills are completed.</p>
<p>The plan brings the deficit to zero by 2002, slows the growth of federal spending and provides a net tax cut of $85 billion through 2002.</p>
<p>The tax cuts would be used to give a $500 per child tax credit, add deductions and credits for post-secondary education, cut the capital gains tax rate, reduce inheritance taxes and expand retirement savings tax breaks. An amendment passed by the Senate to limit the size of the tax cut was expected to be dropped in conference with the House, Domenici said.</p>
