<headline>Cairn resumes drop amid profit-taking.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Shares in Cairn Energy Plc fell to their lowest level in more than three months on Thursday as investors, disappointed that the UK oil exploration concern did not attract a bid, took profits, dealers said.</p>
<p>By 0822 GMT, the stock, down for five straight sessions, had dipped 18-1/2p to 512-1/2.</p>
<p>The stock has been struggling since April 29 when Cairn and Shell Exploration B.V., a unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, announced an alliance.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the agreement, which still need governmental approvals, the companies will combine their oil and gas exploration and production activities in Bangladesh and areas of India.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a lot of people who were hoping that Shell would make a bid for Cairn, but I don't think it was ever in the cards,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Cairn shares had risen sharply from mid-December to mid-March, when they reached an intraday peak of 640. Dealers said the rally was fuelled, at least in part, by bid speculation.</p>
<p>&quot;The deal with Shell is a good one,&quot; said another dealer, who says the stock is oversold. &quot;Shell is a big partner and that can only be good news for the company over the long term.&quot;</p>
