<p>Steel Dynamics Inc said Friday its board authorized the company to proceed with engineering and market studies to build a structural steel mini-mill.</p>
<p>The location of the plant is targeted for the upper Midwest, with the current principal focus on Ohio, Indiana and Michigan. The facility is anticipated to have an annual capacity of between 500,000 and 1,000,000 tons, cost between $200 million and $250 million and employ as many as 300 people.  </p>
<p>The company said it expects the plan will make a broad range of structural products for the construction market.</p>
<p>Steel Dynamics said it plans to begin construction of an Iron Dynamics Inc plant at Butler, Ind., pending resolution of certain outstanding issues including air and building permits.</p>
<p>The company said it formed Iron Dynamics to operate a 520,000 metric tonne a year plant to make direct reduced iron. This iron, after further processing into 450,000 tonnes of liquid pig iron, will be used in Steel Dynamics' mini-mill as a steel scrap substitute.</p>
<p>The company said it expects this project, which will employ 65 people, to be completed in 1998. The IDI facility is estimated to cost $85 million including the capital costs for a new technology.</p>
<p>The company said this type of facility could be easily expanded onsite or duplicated at another location to support commercial opportunities.</p>
