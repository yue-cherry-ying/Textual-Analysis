<p>The New Zealand dollar ended around the middle of Thursday's range after a quiet session.</p>
<p>Comments from Australian Reserve Bank Governor Ian Macfarlane were perceived as meaning rates there would not go lower, which brought some selling of Kiwi against the Aussie.</p>
<p>But Kiwi ended little-changed at NZ$0.6842/49 from 0.6844/51 at the close, having traded a 0.6838-64 range on the day.</p>
<p>The Trade-Weighted Index closed at 67.85 from its 67.96 open, mostly reflecting a decline on the Australian dollar cross rate, which ended at A$0.8784/02.  </p>
<p>A short squeeze early in the session took the Kiwi up to a high of 0.6864 where it met with offshore selling.</p>
<p>Dealers were generally bearish on the Kiwi but did not rule out another squeeze higher overnight.</p>
<p>&quot;I think most people are in the bearish camp and for that reason they are a bit short,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>&quot;But what tends to happen is that as the market moves up, the more people you get buying it on a stop loss basis.&quot;</p>
<p>He nevertheless expected weakness to re-emerge next week.</p>
<p>Expected range overnight: 0.6835-75.</p>
