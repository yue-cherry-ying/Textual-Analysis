<p>Concerns that cooking canola oil can lead to higher levels of fatty acids are unfounded, scientists at the federal Health Canada department said.</p>
<p>Scientists said concerns raised in a Canadian newspaper column recently on possible health risks linked to canola plant genetics, processing or cooking had no scientific basis.</p>
<p>&quot;The fatty acid profile is the same between the transgenic canolas and non-transgenics, with the exception of specific intentional modifications,&quot; Paul Mayers, head of Health Canada's food biotechnology office, told Reuters.  </p>
<p>The Canola Council of Canada touts canola oil as the world's healthiest cooking oil because it contains the lowest concentration of saturated fats at seven percent, compared to soybean oil and olive oil at 15 percent each.</p>
<p>But the views of critics of such claims were given wide currency in a July 9 consumer news column in the Toronto Globe and Mail, one of the country's biggest newspapers. The column was titled: &quot;Is the hype about canola just snake oil?&quot;</p>
<p>The column, which cited various correspondence from Globe readers, suggested that cooking canola oil robbed it of its low-fat virtues.  </p>
<p>One letter writer claimed heating canola oil &quot;radically changes the chemical composition&quot; and raises the trans-fatty acid content of canola oil.</p>
<p>&quot;That's wrong information,&quot; said Nimal Ratnayake, a Health Canada research scientist.</p>
<p>&quot;You get a little bit of trans-fatty acids and it's not unique to canola oil. With any oil that is deodorized and refined you get very small amounts of trans-fatty acids, less than one percent of the total fatty acids,&quot; Ratnayake said.</p>
<p>&quot;You'll see that in corn oil, soybean oil or any oil with higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>&quot;You take some oil home and heat it in the frying pan and you get very small amounts of trans-fatty acids. But you don't have to be worried about that,&quot; Ratnayake said.</p>
<p>The Health Canada officials said all types of canola, including new transgenic canola were screened prior to licensing seed for sale to farmers.</p>
<p>Any differences in dietary fat content between natural or transgenic canola is intentional, Mayers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a group of canolas that have been developed to have a very specific fatty acid profile. For example, one of those has a high level of laurate acid,&quot; he said. &quot;That is intentional so that the oil is of a similar fatty acid profile to a tropical oil and so it has the potential to be used in situations where a tropical oil like coconut oil might be used,&quot; Mayers added.</p>
<p>The column sparked a storm of protest from canola growers. It was &quot;a collection or errors and misrepresentations that slander Canada's canola industry,&quot; the Canadian Canola Growers Association said in a statement.</p>
<p>Canada is one of the world's top producers of canola.</p>
