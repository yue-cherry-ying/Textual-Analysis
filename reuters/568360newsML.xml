<p>Biotechnology giant Amgen Inc. is gearing up to expand its operations over the next five years to accomodate its shift from a two-drug to a multi-drug company, Chairman Gordon Binder told shareholders Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;In five years, we will be a five-product company,&quot; Binder said at the annual meeting. He said the company expects to introduce Infergen, a drug for hepatitis by the end of this year, which will likely be followed in 1998 by Stemgen, a stem cell stimulating factor for chemotherapy patients.</p>
<p>To successfully launch these drugs, Binder said Amgen is investing aggressively in its research pipeline, as well as staff and its infrastructure. The expansion will likely involve a shift of a larger portion of its workforce and its production facilities to locations overseas, he said.</p>
<p>But he added that the company continues to view  aggressive sales and marketing of its two existing drugs as critical to its future growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing is more important to the company than defending and growing our two current products,&quot; Binder said, referring to the blood cell stimulating factors, Neupogen and Epogen.</p>
<p>Combined, those two drugs generate more than $2 billion in annual sales, and are almost legendary in the fledgling biotechnology industry, where profitable ventures to date have been rare.</p>
<p>Despite that phenomenal success, growth is slowing for both Epogen, a red blood cell stimulating factor given to kidney dialysis patients, and Neupogen, used to boost white blood cell count in chemotherapy patients.</p>
<p>Binder said Amgen is optimistic an increased focus on marketing these drugs can revive their growth prospects. For Epogen, he said Amgen continues to see growth both from the patient population using the drug and from recent increases in the allowed dose levels.</p>
<p>While Amgen has numerous other products in development, it has never said whether it expects any single future drug launch to match the phenomenal success of Epogen or Neupogen. But on Thursday, it offered some sense of the potential market size for its hepatitis drug, Infergen, which is currently awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>Craig Brooks, Amgen's vice president of product marketing, said trials show Infergen can successfully treat 40 percent of people suffering from hepatitis C, the most common form of the disease. This compares to a lower success rate of about 20 percent for hepatitis drugs currently on the market.</p>
<p>He said 4 million Americans are afflicted with hepatitis, but only about 10 percent are diagnosed, and of them, only about 60 percent receive treatment.</p>
<p>The company appeared to downplay what has become one of its most high-profile projects, involving the leptin protein as a treatment for obesity.</p>
<p>However, in response to shareholder questions, company officials said the project was on track that tests of the protein had produced a weight loss in virtually all the animals in which it was tested. He said results of safety trials of the compound in humans should be released over the next few months.</p>
