<p>An Egyptian human rights group said on Tuesday two detained Moslem militants died after prison authorities denied them medical treatment.</p>
<p>The independent Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) said in a statement the two men had not been convicted of any crime but were repeatedly detained for their political allegiances.</p>
<p>Human rights groups say Egyptian security officials use powers given to them by emergency laws in effect since 1981 to detain suspects for long periods of time without trial.</p>
<p>The Egyptian government is locked in a battle with Moslem militants bent on turning Egypt into a strict Islamic state.</p>
<p>More then 1,000 people have died since the militants launched their anti-government campaign in 1992.</p>
<p>The human rights group said Bakheet Abderrahman Salem, 38, died last Wednesday after officials moved him from prison hospital to a normal cell. It said torture had left him semi-paralysed, with bed sores on his legs.</p>
<p>Salem, married with six children, was arrested in 1993 on charges of taking part in an attack on a police checkpoint in southern Egypt. He was acquitted but was repeatedly detained.</p>
<p>Kamel Mohammed Mohammed Sayyed, 56, died on Saturday after authorities moved him out of a prison hospital although he was in a coma.</p>
<p>The rights organisation said Sayyed, repeatedly detained since August, 1993, had a kidney condition.</p>
<p>&quot;The Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) affirms with regret that according to information and complaints it has received that prison authorities intentionally use maltreatment as a means of attacking the basic right to life of prisoners and detainees,&quot; the group said.</p>
