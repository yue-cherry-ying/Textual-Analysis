<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton's summit on Thursday with presidents of the isthmus connecting North and South America threw the spotlight on a tricky question: what exactly is Central America?</p>
<p>Originally billed as a summit with Central American leaders, Clinton's partners at the meeting don't include Panama -- whose president Ernesto Perez Balladares sniffily declared that Panama was not interested in the summit agenda, even though it is Costa Rica's next-door neighbour.</p>
<p>This prompted one U.S. official here to comment that Panama &quot;seems to have fallen off&quot;.</p>
<p>But the Central America summit does include the Dominican Republic -- a Caribbean island located hundreds of miles off the shores of the isthmus.</p>
<p>No official explanation was available for the Dominican Republic's inclusion but diplomats volunteered the reason that the island is Spanish-speaking, whereas most of the participants at Clinton's Caribbean summit on Saturday are English-speaking.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic is nonetheless keeping its options open. The government will be sending its vice president to the Caribbean summit as well.</p>
<p>Neither of the Caribbean's other Spanish-speaking nations will be invited to either summit -- Cuba because it is communist and Puerto Rico because it is a commonwealth of the United States.</p>
<p>In another summit twist, the Costa Rican hosts pointedly referred to their participants as &quot;Central America and Belize,&quot; even though Belize is wedged between Guatemala and Mexico and a definite geographic part of Central America.</p>
<p>Central Americans said they made that distinction because Belize is English-speaking and a member of the Caribbean Community CARICOM.</p>
<p>That then raised the question of why Belize was not invited to Saturday's summit, which is to be held mostly with CARICOM members who, like Belize, tend to be former British colonies.</p>
<p>Billed as a Caribbean summit, Saturday's encounter also contains geographical oddities.</p>
<p>As well as the Caribbean islands, participants also include Surinam and Guyana, which are geographically part of South America but members of CARICOM.</p>
