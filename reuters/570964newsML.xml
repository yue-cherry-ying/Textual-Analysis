<p>SIMEX Nikkei futures ended slightly higher in relatively thin trade on Thursday after efforts to test the downside failed, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are still willing to buy. The correction has been quite healthy after the recent rise,&quot; a trader with a Japanese futures house said.</p>
<p>After opening sharply lower following Wall Street's 140-point loss overnight, the lead Nikkei 225 June contract recovered to close 45 points higher at 20,105. Market turnover was 12,315 lots.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think people are trying to hold the market above 20,000 ahead of tomorrow SQ (special quotation for the options settlement),&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>He said the market could undergo a further correction after the settlement on Friday, but was likely to be supported around the 19,800 level.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the market will consolidate around here for a while. The topside should be capped at 20,300,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The May MSCI Taiwan index contract ended at 344.5 against its opening 348.4 on volume of 1,207 lots.</p>
