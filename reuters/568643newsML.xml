<p>A court told Alberto Tomba to pay around $6,000 on Thursday for an incident in 1995 when he threw a glass trophy at a freelance photographer who had taken nude pictures of the Alpine skiing star.</p>
<p>The judge in the northern city of Bolzano gave Tomba a sentence under a plea bargain of two months and 20 days in prison, converted into a six million lire fine plus four million lire in legal costs.</p>
<p>Italian photographer Aldo Martinuzzi is also suing the former Olympic and world champion for civil damages in a separate court case that has yet to be heard.</p>
<p>Tomba lobbed a magnum of sparkling wine, which missed Martinuzzi, and a heavy glass trophy at the photographer in December 1995 from the podium in the resort of Alta Badia after finishing third in a World Cup slalom.</p>
<p>Martinuzzi said at the time that he had taken pictures of Tomba naked in a Swiss sauna before the 1988 Calgary Olympics, apparently with the skier's consent.</p>
<p>They were published in an Italian magazine in 1995.</p>
<p>He suffered minor cuts to his hand and said that Tomba had thrown the trophy at him deliberately.</p>
<p>Tomba was a sergeant in the Carabinieri paramilitary police force at the time of the incident which occurred just days before his 29th birthday. He has since left the force.</p>
