<title>RUSSIA: Iraq's deputy prime minister in Moscow for talks.</title>

<p>Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz arrived in Moscow on Thursday for a brief visit on his way home from a trip to China, the Iraqi Embassy said.</p>
<p>Aziz, anxious to bolster world support to lift sanctions imposed by the United Nations on Baghdad after it invaded Kuwait in 1990, has found a sympathetic ear in Moscow on past visits.</p>
<p>&quot;He will very probably have talks in the Russian Foreign Ministry tomorrow,&quot; said ministry spokesman Valery Nesterushkin.</p>
<p>&quot;The talks will certainly touch on fulfilling the Security Council humanitarian Resolution 986 and on Iraqi cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission on disarmament as well as a series of bilateral issues,&quot; he told a news briefing.</p>
<p>U.N. sanctions bar Baghdad's oil exports until the U.N. Special Commission -- the body in charge of disarming Iraq -- testifies that Baghdad has no more weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>But the U.N. in December allowed Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to buy food and medicine.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has said he expects the Security Council to renew the sale before June. Iraq is lobbying for $4 billion in oil sales, double its previous limit.</p>
<p>Russia has been a major buyer of oil under the plan, and the Foreign Ministry said it expected to continue the cooperation.</p>
<p>&quot;We are oriented toward developing cooperation, but along with the fulfilment of the relevant U.N. resolutions,&quot; Nesterushkin said.</p>
<p>Russia has been stepping up efforts to improve ties in Asia and the Middle East, partially as a counterbalance to NATO plans to invite new members in eastern Europe. Moscow is also anxious to further cooperation with Iraq in oil development projects.</p>
