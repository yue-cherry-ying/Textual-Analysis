<title>GERMANY: German court finds Serb guilty of war crimes.</title>
<headline>German court finds Serb guilty of war crimes.</headline>

<p>A 34-year-old Bosnian Serb was found guilty on Friday of taking part in the mass murder of Moslems during the Bosnian war and sentenced by a German court to five years in jail.</p>
<p>Novislav Djajic was found guilty by a Bavarian state court of 14 counts of being an accomplice to murder and attempted murder. It was the first war crimes trial in Germany since the Nuremberg tribunal on Nazi war crimes more than 50 years ago.  </p>
<p>German federal prosecutors, who took on the case because of an overload at the United Nations war crimes tribunal in the Hague, said Djajic took part in a June 1992 raid in which 14 Moslem men were killed and 15 others taken prisoner.</p>
<p>The 15 were never seen again. Prosecutors told the court that Djajic had known the Moslems would be shot. Djajic, who entered Germany in 1993, was arrested in January 1996. Much of the prosecutor's case revolved around the testimony of one survivor of the massacre.</p>
<p>Although the alleged offences were not committed in Germany, Djajic was tried in Germany under a section of international law which says the perpetrators of genocide should not receive shelter anywhere and can be tried abroad.</p>
<p>German prosecutors are investigating 48 other people suspected of war crimes in former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Germany's Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders was conducted by judges and prosecutors from the four Allied victors.</p>
