<headline>SHARES IN CZECH SPT SLIDE AFTER RESULTS.</headline>
<dateline>PRAGUE 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in Czech telecoms operator SPT Telecom fell back on Tuesday after the company said it made 1996 consolidated losses of 483 million crowns compared with a 4.8 billion crown profit in 1995, according to international accounting standards.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the continuous trading session, whose start was delayed by technical problems, SPT was down 50 crowns, 1.4 percent, to 3,400.  </p>
<p>Dealers said that SPT's results were far more disappointing than had been expected but added that Wednesday was likely to be the decisive day as investors, particularly from abroad, were still deciding how to react.</p>
<p>&quot;The foreigners are not selling out. So we don't think there will be tremendous selling today but tomorrow (there could be) if this is widely reported through the Wall Street Journal or the Financial Times,&quot; said Radek Vavra of Citicorp Securities.  </p>
<p>SPT Chief Financial Officer Urs Kamber told journalists that the firm posted the loss due to one-time extraordinary charges of 8.757 billion crowns but Vavra said such an explanation was only partly convincing.</p>
<p>&quot;We really hadn't expected such a disaster and frankly it is a disaster,&quot; he said.</p>
