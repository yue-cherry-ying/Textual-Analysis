<title>BANGLADESH: Large number of Bangladeshis stranded on Thai border.</title>

<p>Up to 50,000 Bangladeshi illegal immigrants are stranded in southern Thailand jungles en route to Malaysia where they had hoped to find jobs, Dhaka government officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The officials said many of the illegal immigrants were flown to Thailand by bogus employment agents who did not have work permits or the necessary documents for the hopeful workers.</p>
<p>The chief of the Thai immigration office in southern Songkhla province, which borders Malaysia, said he had met with officials from the Bangladesh embassy who had sought information on the numbers of Bangladeshis at the border.</p>
<p>But he said he could not confirm there were 50,000.</p>
<p>The officer said he told the Bangladesh officials that Thai authorities would arrest and deport any illegal immigrants as and when they were found.</p>
<p>&quot;More than 300 of them are in police custody,&quot; the officer said. &quot;I cannot estimate the number of illegals hiding in the jungle, I can only say that thousands of them, maybe a large number of them, are still hiding in the jungles on the Malaysian side of the border.&quot;</p>
<p>Bangladesh's official BSS news agency reported on Tuesday that &quot;about 50,000 illegal immigrants were living a wretched and unbearable life in the jungles of Thailand&quot;.</p>
<p>Bangladesh government officials said a high-level meeting at Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's office had directed the country's high commission in Kuala Lumpur to make very effort to convince the Malaysian government to allow the immigrants to enter the country legally.</p>
<p>&quot;The Prime Minister has asked the Kuala Lumpur High Commission to issue passports to all illegal entrants in the next two months,&quot; one officials said.</p>
<p>Malaysian immigration officials could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Tenaganita, a non-governmental organisation in Malaysia that deals with labour issues, said it has heard about Bangladeshi illegal imigrants trapped in jungles on the Thai-Malaysia border, but could not confirm it.</p>
<p>&quot;But we don't know how accurate the information is. We've been told by the same workers that there are also Chinese and Indians at the Thai border trying to enter Malaysia illegally,&quot; a spokeswoman for Tenaganita said in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>On January 10 immigration officials in southern Thailand said they had rounded up 270 Bangladeshis and eight Indians suspected of trying to cross the border to work in Malaysia.</p>
<p>At the time Thailand's National Security Council estimated there were 5,000 Bangladeshis, Burmese and Indians hiding in jungles of southern Thailand trying to get into Malaysia.</p>
<p>About 300,000 Bangladeshis work in Malaysia, making them one of the largest expatriate communities, according to official statistics.</p>
<p>Last year the country completed a three-metre wall along parts of the border with Thailand in an effort to deter smugglers and stem the flow of illegal immigrants.</p>
