<p>---------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - Aug 14------------------</p>
<p>Copper, stuck in a $2,250-$2,300 price range so far this week, is expected to continue drifting for now against a background of neutral technicals and the seasonal slowdown, analysts said.</p>
<p>Aluminium is more fragile in the near term, with prices seen taking a look at initial support at $1,680.  </p>
<p>COPPER - Near-term technical indicators had started to flatten out from the recent downtrend and a positive close on Wendesday suggested a test of $2,300 resistance was possible.</p>
<p>Next resistance was seen around $2,335 and $2,370.</p>
<p>But the market was seasonally sluggish and might have trouble generating sustained buying interest, analyst added.</p>
<p>&quot;With the slower summer period and stocks increasing, we expect copper to drift, whilst expecting to see signs of strength encounter increased selling pressure,&quot; said analyst Martin Squires of brokers Rudolf Wolff.</p>
<p>On the downside a breach in the band of support around $2,270-$2,260 could trigger sell stops and send prices reeling towards $2,225, analysts said.</p>
<p>Three months copper was quoted at $2,287/92 per tonne at 0800 GMT, versus $2,290 at Wednesday's kerb close.</p>
<p>ALUMINIUM - The market's recent downward correction was probably not over, chartists said.</p>
<p>The recent rises in  LME stocks had contributed to the decline.</p>
<p>&quot;On the charts, the moving averages appear to be topping out and with the RSI still declining there may be more scope to test the downside. Support is evident at $1,685 and $1,650,&quot; brokers Brandeis said in a commentary.</p>
<p>Three months aluminium was trading at $1,698 at 0800 GMT, compared with $1,696 at Wednesday's kerb close.</p>
