<p>By Nidal al-Mughrabi</p>
<p>U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross struggled on Thursday to put Israeli-PLO peace talks back on track despite tough stands by both sides on a Jewish settlement under construction in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Ross, on his second rescue mission in a month, held three hours of talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in Gaza following two sessions on Wednesday and Thursday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Officials gave no details about the talks but said Ross would see Netanyahu later on Thursday and meet Arafat again in the West Bank town of Ramallah on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;There are difficult problems that have to be overcome but we all realise the importance of trying to find ways to move forward,&quot; Ross told reporters in Gaza after the meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;I've seen the chairman. We had a good discussion and I will see him again after seeing the prime minister. I will try to find ways and means to overcome the difficulties that exist,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Israeli-PLO peace talks broke down two months ago after Netanyahu gave the final go-ahead to build 6,500 houses for Jews on a West Bank hilltop which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Arafat spokesman Marwan Kanafani said the Palestinian leader stressed to Ross the need to stop all settlement activity before peace talks could resume.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know if Mr Ross will come with an answer to our grievences and our worries,&quot; Kanafani said.</p>
<p>&quot;But we hope that Mr Ross will understand that nothing can be moved without stopping Israeli settlement activities. This is not only illegal and an obstacle to peace. This is a suicide to the peace process in its entirety,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, the secretary-general of the Palestinian Authority said Israel's suspension of work on the new settlement was a condition for resuming peace talks.</p>
<p>Ahmed Abdel-Rahman said that settlement activity was carving up the West Bank into enclaves and making it impossible for Palestinians to establish an independent state.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's aide David Bar-Illan said the work would continue.</p>
<p>&quot;We obviously are not going to stop building in the settlements any more than the Palestinians are going to stop building in their towns,&quot; he said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Israel demands the Palestinian Authority crack down on &quot;terror&quot; before resuming talks.</p>
<p>Israeli and Palestinian officials have played down any expectation of a breakthrough during Ross's mission.</p>
<p>Palestinians have rejected Israel's offer to build housing for East Jerusalem Palestinians and to discuss speeding up talks on building a seaport and opening an airport in Gaza as part of a compromise to revive peace talks.</p>
