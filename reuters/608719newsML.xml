<p>Chaos overshadowed the start of voting on Friday in two referendums which western diplomats said would test whether post-communist Slovakia was ready to join the West.</p>
<p>Slovaks were to vote on whether they want their country to join NATO, and whether the president should be directly elected by citizens, instead of by parliament.</p>
<p>But the situation was thrown into confusion by a row over ballots, tied to a long-running feud between the president and the prime minister.</p>
<p>It led to some polling stations lacking any ballots at all, while others had voting slips without the presidential question.</p>
<p>&quot;We are carefully watching the way the referendums are being carried out, whether the authorities are guaranteeing a truly democratic poll,&quot; one western diplomat said.</p>
<p>&quot;That is the yardstick of democratic maturity and will again be a test of whether Slovakia is ripe for integration into western structures.&quot;</p>
<p>The vote on presidential elections is seen as a way for the opposition to stop Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar assuming presidential powers when the term of his political enemy, the incumbent, Michal Kovac, ends next March.</p>
<p>Under the current constitution, if parliament is unable to muster a three-fifths majority to elect a new president, which neither the ruling coalition or opposition appear likely to achieve, presidential powers would pass to the prime minister.</p>
<p>Meciar's government has therefore been fighting a fierce battle to have the referendum on presidential elections cancelled.</p>
<p>Polls were open on Friday from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. (1200 to 2000 GMT) and again on Saturday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. (0600 to 1200 GMT), with the results to be made public on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>The outcome was cast into doubt after Meciar's interior minister Gustav Krajci, who is responsible for the technical organisation of the referendums, issued ballots this week without the question on presidential elections.</p>
<p>Ballots with only the three questions of the NATO plebescite were distributed throughout Slovakia, but some mayors refused to accept them, insisting they were illegal as they did not have the seal of the Central Referendum Committee (UKR).</p>
<p>&quot;Our mayor decided to not distribute ballots without the question on presidential elections,&quot; an aide to the mayor of Petrzalka, a district of the capital Bratislava, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Citizens who come to vote will find only the mayor's announcement that the Interior Ministry did not provide legal ballots, approved by the (UKR),&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Krajci said on Friday that scrapping the question on direct presidential elections was justified due to a Constitutional Court ruling that an appendix to the question was irrelevant.</p>
<p>&quot;The court ruled the appendix was illegal which means that the entire question was illegal,&quot; Krajci told a news conference. &quot;I tried to persuade UKR to drop the question and when it refused, I took my own decision.&quot;</p>
<p>The UKR is responsible for supervisising the referendum and must approve its result for the outcome to be valid.</p>
<p>UKR Deputy Chairman Jozef Rumpolec, who took part in the news conference as an observer, said the UKR would recognise only those ballots with four questions, including the presidential one.</p>
<p>&quot;The three-question ballots are a forgery,&quot; Rumpolec said, adding that the official UKR seal had been reprinted on them from the original four-question ballot.</p>
<p>&quot;This is falsification of an official document which is punishable by law, and we shall prosecute,&quot; Rumpolec added.</p>
<p>For the propositions to be approved, a turnout of 50 percent of eligible voters is needed with a simple majority of those voting in favour.</p>
<p>Leaders of Slovakia's parliamentary opposition parties, except for the reformed communist Party of the Democratic Left, on Friday issued an appeal to the population to insist on being handed a four-question ballot or to refuse to register.</p>
<p>Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, are widely seen as favourites among former Soviet-bloc countries to receive membership invitations from NATO at an alliance summit in Madrid in July.</p>
<p>Diplomats have said Slovakia is unlikely to be invited because of shortcomings in its democratic reforms.</p>
