<p>The European Commission said on Friday it was considering extending the role of its expert advisory group on biotechnology ethics, whose mandate expires on July 31.</p>
<p>Commissioner Anita Gradin told the European Parliament the Commission thought the Group of Advisers on the Ethical Implications of Biotechnology (GAEIB) should be allowed to finish its examination of the proposals for a fifth EU research framework programme.</p>
<p>The Commission had asked the GAEIB to draw up a plan for its future activities, which it would use as a basis for deciding at the end of the year whether to widen the scope of the group's work, Gradin said.</p>
<p>In a resolution adopted on Friday, Euro-MPs said the GAEIB's mandate should be extended and clarified, adding that the group had played an essential role in attempts to establish ethical standards in biology, biotechnology and medicine.</p>
<p>The resolution said the Commission should regularly consult the directly elected parliament on bioethics questions and submit an annual report to Euro-MPs.</p>
<p>The GAEIB -- made up of outside scientific, legal and ethical experts and headed by French lawyer Noelle Lenoir -- advises the Commission on ethical issues such as cloning.</p>
<p>Ethical concerns have grown since scientists in Scotland, working with the biotechnology company PPL Therapeutics Plc, cloned a sheep known as Dolly from a single cell of another sheep.</p>
<p>In a report submitted to the Commission on May 30 the group said cloning of farm animals could have medical, agricultural and economic benefits but should only be allowed &quot;when the aims and methods are ethically justified and when it is carried out under ethical conditions&quot;.</p>
<p>The group called for a ban on &quot;reproductive&quot; human cloning -- creating a genetically identical human being using cells from a child or adult -- saying the technique was &quot;ethically unacceptable&quot; and a safety threat.</p>
