<p>U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich warned Japan Tuesday against adopting &quot;predatory export&quot; policies to solve its economic woes and urged Tokyo instead to cut the red tape that stifles imports and domestic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Understandably, Japan wants to boost economic growth. In an economy led by export industries, driving up exports becomes a simple answer. However, seeking stronger growth through predatory export policies and a restricted domestic market will not only fail to reinvigorate Japan's economy. It will also inflame trade tensions between our two countries,&quot; Gingrich told a news conference here.</p>
<p>In a meeting Tuesday with Japanese Trade Minister Shinji Sato, Gingrich said that while some progress had been made in redressing two-way trade gaps, current foreign exchange rates meant Japan's trade surplus with the United States was becoming a cause for concern, a Japanese trade official said.</p>
<p>Gingrich told the news conference that important differences remained between Tokyo and Washington over such areas as the automotive sector, telecommunications, paper products, agriculture and photographic film.</p>
<p>&quot;Although our trade deficit with Japan had been declining, it has begun to increase substantially,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also urged Japan not to boost its domestic growth through &quot;lax monetary or fiscal policy,&quot; which he said U.S. experience showed led to bigger deficits and rampant inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;The way to gain broader economic growth in both our countries is through a deeper commitment to economic freedom and deregulation,&quot; he said, adding that cutting official red tape would not only boost growth but reduce the trade gap.</p>
<p>U.S. finance officials have urged Japan to take the necessary macroeconomic measures to ensure its recovery does not falter and choke off demand for imports.</p>
<p>Such remarks are closely monitored by currency markets for clues as to whether Washington might change its stance in support of a strong dollar.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is expected to repeat U.S. demands for strong Japanese domestic growth policies when he meets Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka in Tokyo on Friday.</p>
<p>Tokyo argues that its recovery is on track, that its trade surplus is not poised to grow substantially and that Japan must give priorty to cutting its big budget deficit rather than to stimulating growth with more public spending as in the past.</p>
<p>Japanese interest rates, meanwhile, have been at record lows since September 1995, when the Bank of Japan cut its official discount rate to 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>Gingrich took note of steps in Japan's latest update of a three-year deregulation plan released last week, but said government regulations still disadvantaged U.S. goods and limited U.S. investment opportunities.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe ... that this is the most elegantly sophisticated protectionist society in the world,&quot; he said.</p>
