<p>House Commerce Committee chairman Thomas Bliley said Tuesday lawmakers had &quot;a lot of work to do&quot; to be able to overturn controversial new clean air rules that the Clinton administration was about to issue.</p>
<p>The top Democrat on Bliley's committee, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, vowed to fight the Environmental Protection Agency's new standards for smog-forming ozone and fine particles, which industry groups and many counties said would cost billions of dollars to meet.</p>
<p>&quot;I figure that we will need at least a hundred Democrats because (Dingell's) not going to get all the Republicans,&quot; Bliley, a Virginia Republican, said at an energy industry luncheon.</p>
<p>Some Republicans from Northeastern states have supported the administration's effort to set strict new limits on smog and soot because the new rules will force midwestern states to curb pollution that drifts into the Northeast.</p>
<p>Bliley predicted that lawmakers would fail if they tried to kill the new air quality standards by attaching an amendment to the EPA's 1998 spending bill. &quot;It's very difficult to do,&quot; he told reporters after his speech, adding that he would oppose such a move because it was against Congressional rules to tie legislation to a spending bill.</p>
