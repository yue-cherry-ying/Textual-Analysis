<p>An oppressive heat wave smothering the populous Northeast is breaking records for electricity demand and straining the multistate power grid.</p>
<p>It is also pumping up air pollution levels, as utilities turn to old coal and oil-burning power plants in a bid to keep pace with demand from millions of air conditioners.</p>
<p>&quot;Our forecast is that we will exceed yesterday's load,&quot; Richard Mulieri, a spokesman for Consolidated Edison in New York City, said Wednesday. &quot;As the day goes on, we'll have a better idea where we end up.&quot;</p>
<p>ConEd hit a record power load of 11,013 megawatts (MW) late Tuesday when the thermometer in Central Park hit a withering 97 degrees. This easily surpassed the previous record of 10,805 MW on Aug. 2, 1995.</p>
<p>But the record was marred by outages in some of the city's northern suburbs and an 8 percent voltage reduction, or &quot;brownout,&quot; in parts of the New York City borough of Brooklyn.</p>
<p>ConEd warned again Wednesday that power demand could hit a new high and urged customers in some neighbourhoods to switch off all unnecessary lights and appliances, especially energy-hungry air conditioners.</p>
<p>The warning was repeated across much of the East Coast.</p>
<p>The New England Power Pool, which oversees operation of the power grid spanning the region's six states, declared Wednesday a &quot;conservation day&quot; and asked customers to voluntarily cut back on electricity usage.</p>
<p>Grid operators in the Mid-Atlantic states told their member utilities to issue the same plea after PJM, the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, reported it moved a record 49,820 MW of power Tuesday.</p>
<p>PJM oversees the operation of 540 power plants and transmission lines serving about 9.1 million customers from northern New Jersey to Maryland, including Baltimore and Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Temperatures across the Mid-Atlantic states are expected to hit the 90s again Wednesday, the fifth day of 90-plus weather in what is so far the summer's most severe heat wave.</p>
<p>To cope with the surging electrical loads, many utilities are firing up older, less efficient coal- and oil-burning power plants, many dating from the 1950s.</p>
<p>While automobiles account for most low-level ozone, fossil fuel power plants are also major contributors.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an unfortunate coincidence that hot weather results in higher power generation for cooling and also in a rise in ozone levels. ... It's kind of a double whammy,&quot; said Marika Tatsutani, a policy analyst at the Boston-based Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management.</p>
<p>She said the problem was compounded by high electricity demand in the Ohio Valley, where generating units are currently running flat out.</p>
<p>Most big Midwest power stations are coal-fired, and the nitrogen oxides they emit tend to drift eastward on the prevailing winds.</p>
<p>&quot;Power plants are particularly good at contributing to the transported pollution problem because they have very tall smokestacks, which is an old-fashioned solution to the problem -- just send it higher into the air,&quot; she said.</p>
