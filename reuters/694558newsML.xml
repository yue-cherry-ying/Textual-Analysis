<p>Riot police ejected immigrants from a Paris city hall on Saturday after they turned celebrations over the new leftist government's pledge to give residence permits to some illegal immigrants into a protest.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the protesters said two of them were injured and taken to hospital. Police has no immediatel comment.</p>
<p>The African immigrants occupied the hall earlier in the day, alleging that one of their group was expelled from France last week although he could have qualified for residence rights under the government's plans.</p>
<p>&quot;We helped the left return to power. They made promises that they are not keeping,&quot; said the group's Senegalese spokesman Ababacar Diop.</p>
<p>The protesters had gathered at the city hall of the heavily-immigrant 18th district to mark the anniversary of their occupation of the nearby Saint-Bernard church which publicised their demands for residence permits. Police expelled them from the church last August.</p>
<p>The meeting was also intended to allow French people to vouch for the good integration of the immigrants into France, thus enabling them to apply for residence permits under plans announced by left-wing Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.</p>
<p>Jospin has pledged a case-by-case review of the status of immigrants who say the previous conservative government' stiffer immigration laws deprived them of residence rights.</p>
