<p>Rescue teams on Friday rushed food and medicine to some 4,000 people whose homes were razed in a powerful earthquake that killed dozens of people in central India and injured more than 1,000.</p>
<p>Authorities said 38 people were killed in the quake that struck India's heartland in Madhya Pradesh state early on Thursday and measured 6.0 on the open-ended Richter scale.</p>
<p>Rescue teams set up camps for the 3,000 to 4,000 homeless in Jabalpur, a city of 1.2 million people 720 km (450 miles) southeast of New Delhi and about 20 km (12 miles) from the epicentre.</p>
<p>Volunteers from the Indian Red Cross Society distributed foodgrains, medicine and bed sheets to the homeless.</p>
<p>In Jabalpur's Victoria Hospital, survivors lay on blood-splattered beds.</p>
<p>&quot;The earth shook like a see-saw and the roof fell on me,&quot; Ram Kali Bai, 60, from Puranabasti village near Jabalpur, said from her hospital bed.</p>
<p>Relief workers brought bamboo and wooden logs to villages outside Jabalpur that were flattened by the quake.</p>
<p>Villagers, many of whom spent the night in their fields, were advised to keep the roofs low in their new dwellings to reduce the risk of injury in the event of another quake.</p>
<p>Ajay Singh, a senior official in Jabalpur, said the tremor caused extensive damage to property but killed relatively few people despite its magnitude.</p>
<p>The quake, which struck at dawn, levelled several villages near Jabalpur. But relatively few villagers died as they were either sleeping outside in the summer heat or were doing early morning chores outside their huts, officials and residents said.</p>
<p>&quot;The death toll is not likely to rise very much because most of the houses that collapsed were made of mud and thatch, and no big buildings fell,&quot; Singh told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Geological Survey of India was sending a team of experts from New Delhi to assess damage and the chances of aftershocks in the region, part of the Narmada River basin that has been hit by five quakes of at least 6.0 on the Richter scale since 1927.</p>
<p>Soldiers helped to clear debris from Jabalpur, where several hundred people were still in hospital, most with spinal injuries, limb fractures or pelvic injuries.</p>
<p>Many panic-stricken residents of Jabalpur shifted their beds outdoors, saying they feared possible aftershocks.</p>
<p>&quot;I've not taken my family inside the house and I do not plan to either,&quot; said Jabalapur resident Sunderlal Tiwari. He said five people in the next house had been buried in their sleep.</p>
<p>The earthquake was centred on the village of Kosamghat, 23 km (14 miles) south of Jabalpur. All of that village's 160 houses, mostly mud huts, were flattened, leaving more than 1,000 residents homeless, elder Mohan Lal Yadav said.</p>
<p>In September 1993, about 10,000 people were killed in neighbouring Maharashtra state when an earthquake measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale struck the Latur-Osmanabad region.</p>
<p>A seismology department official in New Delhi said the quake in Latur was much closer to the surface than the one in Madhya Pradesh, making it more deadly. In addition, the soil in central India was more solid.</p>
