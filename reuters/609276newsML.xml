<p>A Manhattan stockbroker accused of robbing his father's penthouse and killing a police officer who blocked his escape was indicted on Friday on first-degree murder charges, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Scott Schneiderman, 33, was charged with three counts of first-degree murder, including one count of intentional murder. He was also charged with one count of second-degree murder and multiple counts of robbery, burglary, criminal possession of a weapon and grand larceny.</p>
<p>Schneiderman is the estranged son of Ray Schneiderman, 59, a Garment District millionaire. The son was fired from the family firm three years ago after his father accused him of embezzlement.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say that Schneiderman, wearing a ski mask, arrived at his father's 10th-floor apartment in the Chelsea section of Manhattan after midnight on Monday.</p>
<p>The intrusion started one of the father's dogs barking, awakening the father and his 27-year-old girl friend, Wendy Brown, who called police.</p>
<p>Schneiderman then tied his father and Brown in duct tape, prosecutors say, and grabbed $5,000 and a 9 mm pistol from the safe. While trying to leave the building, he was cornered in the stairwell by police officer Anthony Sanchez, they added.</p>
<p>After a gunbattle, Sanchez, 31, died of a wound to the back of the neck. He was the first New York police officer killed in the line of duty this year.</p>
<p>Under the law, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau has 120 days to announce if he will seek the death penalty, starting with the day of arraignment. Schneiderman is to be arraigned on June 9.</p>
<p>New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is urging Morgenthau, who opposes capital punishment, to seek the death penalty.</p>
