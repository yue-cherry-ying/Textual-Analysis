<text>
<p>Missouri legislators Thursday adopted a compromise health budget bill that eliminates Planned Parenthood funding.</p>
<p>The vote broke a legislative stalemate that prevented a state budget accord earlier in May, but puts lawmakers squarely opposite a court ruling that barred their earlier attempts at the same action, a spokesman for Gov. Mel Carnahan said.</p>
<p>Carnahan opposed the action and will take a few weeks to decide how to approach the legislative decision, spokesman Chris Sifford said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is important to note there is a permanent injunction on the State of Missouri from excluding any provider of family planning services, and the governor feels that is an important factor to consider as he makes his decision,&quot; Sifford said.</p>
<p>Legislators approved a $6.4 billion general fund operating budget for fiscal 1998 beginning July 1 and $14.9 billion of overall spending in their just concluded session, said Steve Price, state House appropriations staff director.</p>
<p>The budget includes state appropriations of $5.9 million for family planning, Price noted.</p>
<p>The budget includes one percent pay raises and step wage increases for state employees and 2.9 percent increases for lawmakers and judges, Price said. All were made eligible for a new vision and dental health benefits program as well, he said.</p>
<p>Carnahan has until June 30 to sign the budget bill, Sifford noted.</p>
<p>&quot;We probably won't push the deadline that close, but I would suspect it will be several weeks, at least three weeks, before we make a decision,&quot; Sifford said.</p>
