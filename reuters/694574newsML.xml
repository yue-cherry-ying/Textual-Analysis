<p>Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi warned on Saturday against being over-optimistic about Italy's chances of joining Europe's planned economic and monetary union (EMU) from its launch in 1999.</p>
<p>Ciampi, speaking after the Bank of Italy cut interest rates to their lowest level in 22 years on Friday, told La Stampa daily that Italy still had a long way to go to meet the criteria for admission to the single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not deny that I have a big concern: I hear too much enthusiasm going around, I hear too many people saying 'It's done now, we're in Europe, we don't have to make any more sacrifices',&quot; Ciampi said in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;But this is a fatal error which we must not make: joining the monetary union in the first wave and remaining there is not a goal you reach suddenly...It is a daily exercise, it is the daily effort we must continue to make,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts believe Italy's chances of joining EMU have been boosted by recent political developments in Europe, with both Germany and France struggling to reduce their deficit to three percent of gross domestic product, as demanded by the Maastricht Treaty for euro aspirants.</p>
<p>Italy is also committed to cutting its deficit to three percent of GDP from 6.7 percent last year, but many economists expect the Treasury to slightly overshoot.</p>
<p>The centre-left government is due to launch a wide-ranging review of the welfare state next week with trade unions and employers, and hopes to introduce a reform of social spending in the 1998 budget.</p>
<p>Analysts say a reform is vital if Italy is to keep its state accounts balanced in the years ahead. -- Rome newsroom +396 6782501</p>
