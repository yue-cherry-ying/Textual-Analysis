<headline>FOCUS - Wall Street selloff pounds European markets.</headline>

<p>Stock markets plunged across Europe on Tuesday as traders returned from their Easter break to grapple with two days of heavy losses on Wall Street and fears that the long bull run had run its course.</p>
<p>The London, Paris and Frankfurt bourses all tumbled during the morning, with German stocks rivalling Wall Street's plunge of 4.3 percent since Thursday.</p>
<p>Unlike most of Europe, Wall Street opened after the Easter break on Monday and promptly added to Thursday's 140-point fall on the Dow Jones industrial average by losing another 157 points to 6,583.</p>
<p>Despite hopeful talk by some analysts that Europe might have become decoupled from the United States, investors were asking whether the long-predicted end to the stocks bull run had arrived.</p>
<p>&quot;Is the big correction people have been warning about finally here? This could certainly be the start of it. The mood is very nervous,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>European bond markets also fell, dragged down by gloom in global bond markets, while the dollar weakened as traders returned to their desks in nervous mood after the falls in U.S. asset markets.</p>
<p>German bund futures fell below support levels at 99.5 during the morning but soft British government gilts steadied after economic data indicated the British economy was continuing to expand.</p>
<p>In contrast, gold was fixed $1.70 higher in London with traders saying they expected the precious metals market to be well supported by investors looking for refuge from turmoil elsewhere.</p>
<p>Some of Europe's smaller equity markets suffered even worse than the big bourses, with Amsterdam and Stockholm sliding more than four percent. In Asia, Tokyo fell only 0.74 percent but Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 3.67 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Taking all of Europe, those that were first will be last and vice versa. Peripheral countries which have benefited most on (economic and monetary union) convergence plays will be correspondingly harder hit on a sell-off,&quot; Schroders equity strategist Paul Walton said.</p>
<p>&quot;So you'd be looking at Italy and Spain and perhaps Portugal. Then there's some huge PEs (price/earnings ratios) now in Scandinavia.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the gloom, London dealers said they detected some support from the hope that Europe was decoupling from the U.S. market.</p>
<p>&quot;This is going to be a test of just how decoupled these markets truly are,&quot; one said. &quot;One should take into account the more moderate valuations here. It's going to be pretty grim but I don't want to predict the wheels falling off yet.&quot;</p>
<p>By the European mid-session, most markets had struggled off their lows and were anxiously awaiting U.S. economic data due at 1500 GMT, particularly the North American Purchasing Managers Index (NAPM) for March.</p>
<p>If the survey turns out stronger than expected, Wall Street could suffer further losses as concerns mount about the interest rate outlook, dealers said.</p>
<p>Further out, the main focus of a potentially torrid weak is on U.S. non-farm payrolls data for March that will come out on Friday.</p>
<p>U.S. shares trading in London were generally a bit firmer by midday as investors sought some bargains.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen a bit of bargain hunting but nothing too extraordinary. It's anyone's guess what Wall Street will do but we could see a firmer start today,&quot; one market maker said.</p>
<p>By 1100 GMT London's blue chip FTSE 100 index was down 2.06 percent at 4,224 points but off the worst levels hit at the start.</p>
<p>Paris was down more than three percent, but Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index was still down nearly four percent, although off its lows.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a crash in the 1987 sense of the word, although nominally it's about as bad,&quot; one Frankfurt trader said. &quot;People are certainly going to be offloading, and fast. We will have to see over the next few days whether this is a real change in trend.&quot;</p>
<p>With talk about the buoyant U.S. economy forcing the Federal Reserve to act once more to tighten monetary policy, foreign exchange traders said it was hard to justify the dollar's softness.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks as if the Fed will be tightening again...But the buoyancy in the U.S. economy argues for a firmer dollar,&quot; said Tony Norfield, treasury economist at the Dutch bank ABN AMRO.</p>
<p>&quot;It is hard to see why, for economic or policy reasons, the dollar is sliding. Data from Germany remains weak and other core European countries look in pretty poor shape.&quot;</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1100 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.6713 marks and 123.70 yen, compared with 1.6763 marks and 123.48 yen in late European trade before the holiday on Thursday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1100 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index was down 88.9 points, or 2.06 percent, at 4,224.0.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 was down 83.28 points, or 3.13 percent, at 2,573.40.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index was down 135.79 points, or 3.96 percent, at 3,293.26.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $349.85 after the four-day Easter holiday, versus $348.15 on Thursday. Silver fell nine cents to $5.04.</p>
