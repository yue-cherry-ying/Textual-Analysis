<title>USA: U.S. Spot Products-Gulf gasoline dips after run-up.</title>
<headline>U.S. Spot Products-Gulf gasoline dips after run-up.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. Gulf gasoline differentials slid lower by early afternoon Friday, paring gains from the short-lived morning rally, as market players sought an early exit ahead of the three-day Memorial Day weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;The phone has stopped ringing. By the NYMEX close I think business will have folded up,&quot; one Gulf player said.</p>
<p>On the NYMEX, June gasoline was down 0.03 cent and June heating oil was down 0.35 cent.</p>
<p>- U.S. GULF COAST</p>
<p>Prompt conventional M1 gasoline differentials jumped to 1.25 cents under the June NYMEX early, up about 0.50 cent from late Thursday, though buying interest soon evaporated and those barrels were talked near 2.00 cents under the NYMEX by early afternoon.</p>
<p>Players attributed the early strength to a scheduling deadline Friday for the M1 barrels on the Colonial Pipeline, the main artery from Houston to the Northeast.</p>
<p>Refiner buying on a scheduling deadline earlier this week pushed M1 differentials up nearly four cents Monday and Tuesday before prices cooled off.</p>
<p>- MIDCONTINENT</p>
<p>Unleaded gasoline values lost ground Friday in Chicago after rising sharply earlier in the week on concerns about delayed shipments to the Midcontinent region and lost output from refinery maintenance.</p>
<p>&quot;All that news which boosted things Wednesday and Thursday was priced in and is now old. The worries have faded,&quot; said a trader in Arkansas.</p>
<p>In Chicago, unleaded gasoline fell to flat to 0.25 cent over gasoline for June delivery on the NYMEX.</p>
<p>Maintenance at Marathon's 166,000 barrel per day Robinson, Ill. refinery  and delivery deferral had created gasoline supply concerns in the region.</p>
<p>Low sulphur in Chicago eased to 3.35/3.50 over from 4.00/4.25 over Thursday while jet fuel was slightly stronger.</p>
<p>Group Three values were mostly unchanged ahead of the three day Memorial Day weekend.</p>
<p>- NEW YORK HARBOR</p>
<p>Differential levels showed little change Friday, though premium-grade gasoline levels were talked slightly firmer, traders said.</p>
<p>Prompt premium V2 grade gasoline was offered at 3.50 cents over the June futures, up about 0.25 cent from Thursday, and prompt premium reformulated D2 gasoline was offered at 8.00 cents over the futures, up about 0.50 cent.</p>
