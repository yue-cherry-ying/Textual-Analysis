<p>West Africa tanker rates dipped in quiet trade on Tuesday while Middle East very large crude carriers (VLCCs) were mainly steady, brokers said.</p>
<p>West Africa/U.S. Gulf 130,000 tonne rates fell to W95/97.5 from W100 on low enquiry after the long Easter weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;West Africa seems to be on the way down. The demand just isn't there at the moment,&quot; one broker said. But he added that West Africa VLCC rates were steady for now at W70.</p>
<p>Some brokers said they saw cross-Mediterranean rates edging down with the West African market, although one said this did not apply to prompt tonnage which was tight.</p>
<p>They said the cross-Med 130,000 tonne sector remained quiet, as it was for much of last week, while 80,000 tonne vessels were down about five points at W130, or slightly lower to Sidi Kreir where there are few constraints on tonnage.</p>
<p>There was fair activity in the trans-Atlantic sector, with the 330,000 tonne Laconia fixed at W60 for Koch, loading April 10 for the U.S. Gulf, as well as the 136,000 tonne North Star which fetched W93 to USAC for Sun.</p>
<p>Middle East VLCCs were steady, with Singapore voyages at W60 and trips west at about W55/57.5.</p>
<p>Inter-U.K./Cont 80,000 tonne cargoes were little changed at W135.</p>
<p>In the Western Hemisphere, 70,000 tonne crude cargoes remained extremely firm at W235, although one broker said rates were set to fall.</p>
<p>&quot;Charterers seem to be confident that ships are not disappearing like they were last week, so they may not attract the kind of rates we have been seeing,&quot; he added.</p>
