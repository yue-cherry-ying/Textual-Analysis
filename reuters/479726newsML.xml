<headline>ECU/DRACHMA TRADES BELOW 309, DEPOS, FORWARDS DOWN.</headline>

<p>Ecu/drachma was back on track after a mid-session detour that took it down to 308.35/45 trading around 308.70/80 in late trade, and depos and fx forwards were softer with the drop more pronounced in the short-end of the spectrum, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Ecu/drachma is currently around 308.70/80,&quot; a foreign bank forex dealer said. &quot;It has been very volatile lately but we have not seen forex outflows. Contrary to that, I would say we have had inflows from abroad.&quot;</p>
<p>Money market dealers said depos and implied drachma rates from forex forwards had fallen 10 to 20 basis points in late trade with the short-end having retreated more than the long-end.</p>
<p>&quot;As usually, the market had overshot and interest rates corrected afterwards,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>Interest rates will find their equilibrium after Wednesday's central bank money tender of 14-day funds and banks make their own calculations, said a dealer at a private bank.</p>
<p>Greece raised about 600 billion drachmas from the sale of 12-month T-bills and 200 billion from two-year zeros, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Retail demand was weak but there was strong demand from local banks and foreign investors who exploited arbitrage opportunities,&quot; said a banker.</p>
<p>Two-year zero coupon notes at an unchanged gross yield of 10.1 percent and 12-month T-bills at a gross rate of 10.3 percent, down 20 basis points from the previous issue, go on sale today.</p>
<p>&quot;The market expects T-bills to sell very well, perhaps three or four times over expiries of about 300 billion drachmas, and this will soak liquidity out of the market,&quot; said a senior dealer at a private bank.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 158.70/80 from Tuesday's 158.650 fix, the dollar at 265.22/33 drachmas from 265.040 and the ecu at 308.66/76 from 308.450 drachmas.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece , the domestic money market's biggest player, quoted the following late rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at 9.80-10.30</p>
<p>** T/N at 10.00-10.50</p>
<p>** S/N at 10.00-10.50</p>
<p>** One week at 10.00-10.50</p>
<p>** Two weeks at 10.10-10.60</p>
<p>** Three weeks at 10.20-10.70</p>
<p>** One month at 10.30-10.80</p>
<p>** Two months at 10.30-10.80</p>
<p>** Three months at 10.30-10.80</p>
<p>** Six months at 10.30-10.80</p>
<p>** Nine months at 10.30-10.80</p>
<p>** Twelve months at 10.30-10.80</p>
