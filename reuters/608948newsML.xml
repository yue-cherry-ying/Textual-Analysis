<p>Mexican overnight Cetes rates bucked a downward trend that prevailed for most of the session to close up 35 basis points at 17.55 points on Friday, due to what traders said was a late supply of paper.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase was due to an surplus of paper. Rates reversed their earlier falls after Banco de Mexico intervened,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Overnight Cetes had fallen as low as 16.30 percent before the central bank drained 748 million pesos, by a combination of three direct sales of paper and two repos.  </p>
<p>Some dealers said the late rise in secondary rates was also due to big players which had previously withheld large cash positions swaying the market in order to obtain higher returns on paper.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they added, normal demand for cash ahead of the weekend also exerted pressure on rates.</p>
<p>Overnight rates on bank paper closed down 10 basis points at 18.85 percent.</p>
<p>June Cetes futures traded in Chicago meanwhile closed up nine centavos at 78.95 pesos.</p>
<p>Liquidity of 966 million pesos was due to return to the system on Monday from prior central bank participation.</p>
