<p>Villagers in mountain hamlets overlooking Tehran cast their vote in Shi'ite mosques on Friday to choose Iran's next president.</p>
<p>Away from the sprawl of the Iranian capital, mulberry growers and shepherds were among villagers deciding who would replace President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as the highest elected official.</p>
<p>Voters in Kan, a relaxed village nestled in mountainous farmland 15 km (nine miles) northwest of central Tehran, said the main election issues were the economy and the future shape of social freedoms in the Islamic republic.</p>
<p>Opinion was diverse and gave every indication that the two leading candidates in the race -- Parliamentary Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri and former culture minister Mohammad Khatami - -- could both rely on popular support.</p>
<p>First voting results could be as early as Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The greatest concern of the president should be how to solve the problem of inflation. The second is to defend the nation's interest,&quot; said Mahmoud Hassanzadeh, a 32-year-old paper packer, one of the 30,000 people who live in Kan.</p>
<p>&quot;The main issue for me was young people's problems -- to get more cultural and sporting facilities and entertainment for young people,&quot; said Sorayya, a 16-year-old student voting for the first time in a presidential election.</p>
<p>Khatami has been able to secure particular support among Iranian women and the young because of his perceived backing of more moderate social policies, analysts said.</p>
<p>Men and women in separate queues handed in their red identification papers to officials seated at a bench outside Kan's mosque. Voters were given a form on which they wrote the name of their chosen candidate before putting the folded paper into a white ballot box.</p>
<p>An armed conscript guarded the entrance to the mosque while nearby, sheep were slaughtered for sale to Tehran dwellers.</p>
<p>Election officials said they were prepared to extend the hours of voting which were due to end at 6 p.m. (1330 GMT).</p>
<p>At the village of Soulghan, 10 km (six miles) from Kan and reached by a winding tarmac road through the steep Alborz mountain range, some of the 700 villagers eligible to vote were gradually starting to make their choices.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the election) is to continue the path of the martyrs. The president should fight and suppress anti-revolutionary forces and make the chador obligatory throughout Iran,&quot; said Masoumeh, a 16-year-old girl student voting in Soulghan's elegant mosque.</p>
<p>She was referring to the all-enveloping veil that some conservative Islamists believe women should be required to wear rather than a headscarf and a long coat over trousers.</p>
<p>&quot;The president's duty is to be 100 percent obedient to the leadership,&quot; said Reza, a 36-year-old policeman, referring to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate power in the country of 60 million people.</p>
<p>Election officials in Soulghan said that 250 villagers had voted in the first four hours since the mosque opened but voting would increase in the evening as the weather cooled.</p>
<p>Agricultural villages across Iran similar to Soulghan are expected to be support centres for Nateq-Nouri, analysts said.</p>
<p>But expectations of a close vote between Nateq-Nouri and Khatami were reinforced by diverse support for both candidates in Tehran's mountain villages.</p>
<p>&quot;I want the next president to follow the policies of Rafsanjani. During Mr Rafsanjani's first term we got a telephone in this village and the roads were improved,&quot; said Reza Moradi, a farmer in Soulghan.</p>
