<headline>Slovak crown strengthens after fix, seen firming.</headline>

<p>The Slovak crown firmed some 80 basis points shortly after the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) again fixed the currency stronger than market levels.</p>
<p>Local dealers said the NBS fixing will push the Slovak crown into a strengthening trend and that the currency will gradually move toward the levels at which the NBS fixed it.</p>
<p>The crown firmed to around 110 basis points on the depreciation side of its mark/dollar basket, from -1.96 percent versus the midpoint, after the NBS fixed it at -0.67 percent against the parity.</p>
<p>&quot;This was another, and even stronger, signal from the NBS that the speculators will find it hard, or at least very expensive, to push the Slovak crown down,&quot; said one local trader.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the NBS fixed the crown ay -0.78 percent versus the parity.</p>
<p>&quot;The crown was so weak before the fixing due to only small volumes traded among local banks, the foreigners seem not to be active at all at the moment,&quot; he said, adding the crown was likely to strengthen further as a reaction to the fixing.</p>
<p>Another Bratislava-based dealer said the NBS so far seemed to be winning the battle for the crown against foreign speculators, but he warned the fight was not completly over.</p>
<p>&quot;They (NBS) seem to be doing it very well, mainly the by reducing access to crown funds and by using a strong fixing, but it is still early to celebrate the victory,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We still don't know how foreigner players will react to the new situation and if they would not seek a way of how to repeat their run on the crown again,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>The Slovak and Czech crowns have for the past week been under strong speculative pressure, mainly from foreign banks.</p>
<p>While the Czech National Bank (CNB) this week intervened several times on the market to boost the ailing currency, the NBS has used only indirect intervention through its daily fix.</p>
<p>The CNB is reported to have used $1.5-2.0 billion in intervention to boost the Czech crown. The NBS is estimated to have bought around $350 million in exchange for for Slovak crowns at its fixing this week.</p>
