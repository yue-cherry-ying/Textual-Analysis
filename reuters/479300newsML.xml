<p>Japan has made progress in cutting its trade surplus and it is important that it not be reversed, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;They have made real progress, but the issue is not to have it go back the other way,&quot; Rubin told reporters ahead of a six-day trip to Asia that starts on Thursday and which will take him to Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Japan's trade surplus rose in February for the first time in two years, expanding by 6.5 percent from a year earlier.  </p>
<p>A senior U.S. Treasury official, who declined to be named, said that a rise in the surplus was not that surprising given Japan's slow economic growth, and stressed the importance of the country enjoying a healthy economy led by domestic demand.</p>
<p>&quot;Their (economic) prospects over time are probably very good but they have clearly run into a period when they're having difficulty,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>The outlook is less optmistic than it was six months ago, when there seemed to be clearer signs that Japan's economy was on the mend, he added.  </p>
<p>U.S. officials in the past have voiced concern that Japan's plans to tighten budget policy sharply in 1997/98 could undermine its fragile economy. Those plans include an increase in consumption taxes that became effective Tuesday.</p>
<p>The senior Treasury official said that Rubin plans to discuss Japan's budget plan and its economic prospects while in Tokyo on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the issues that people have discussed is whether ... the phasing (in) of that (the budget plan) is such as to cut against the resumption of growth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rubin also intends to talk with Japanese policymakers about their efforts to solve the problems besetting their banking industry. In that regard, the senior Treasury official noted that the United States incurred enormous costs by delaying its efforts to resolve its savings and loan crisis.</p>
<p>Rubin's trip to Japan comes on the heels of a visit there by his deputy, Lawrence Summers, earlier this year.</p>
<p>The senior Treasury official denied that the United States was turning up the heat on Tokyo, although he acknowledged that that impression might have been given.</p>
<p>While in Tokyo, Rubin is scheduled to meet Prime Minuster Ryutaro Hashimoto and Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka.</p>
