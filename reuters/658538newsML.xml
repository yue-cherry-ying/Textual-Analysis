<p>The single currency, employment and European integration may be top of the politicians' agenda at next week's European Union summit in Amsterdam, but the Dutch city's copious coterie of activists, anarchists and flat-out freaks have other things on their minds.</p>
<p>Try sex riots, smoke-ins, arson and organised projectile vomiting for starters.</p>
<p>The summit, on June 16 and 17, has had an unintentionally bad press on the street in Amsterdam from the word go, largely due to linguistic coincidence. &quot;Summit&quot; in Dutch translates as &quot;top&quot;, so the event is universally referred to as the Eurotop.</p>
<p>The unfortunate fact that this, judiciously spaced, becomes &quot;EU rot op&quot;, the Dutch for &quot;EU get stuffed&quot;, has not been lost on the city's pamphleteers, flyposters and t-shirt merchants.</p>
<p>Promising the most extreme fringe activities around the summit are the anonymous organisers of the Chaos Days, touting a &quot;punk fest&quot; on the lines of the infamous German event which left 170 police injured in Hanover in 1995.</p>
<p>Invitations circulating on the Internet thoughtfully include a precise schedule of planned activities -- presumably because effective anarchy needs good organisation.</p>
<p>Highlights include: &quot;June 14, 15:00 - stop public traffic. Dam Square. (bring anchors to sabotage the electricity lines of the trams); 23:00 - Workshop: 'How I use drugs'. Health Office; 24:00 - mass vomiting in City Hall.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;June 15, 14:00 - occupying Dam palace to paint it pink on the inside, 21:00 - final meeting on Nieuwmarkt square and burning down subway station.&quot;</p>
<p>Amsterdam will have 5,000 police available around the summit, half brought in from outside units, and the local force is confident it can handle any disturbances.</p>
<p>&quot;We have more than enough officers to both secure the summit and maintain public order in the city,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;We're not going to get too worried about things like that.&quot;</p>
<p>TRADITIONAL RESISTANCE TO AUTHORITY</p>
<p>On the other hand, Amsterdam has a long tradition of gritty resistance to authority spoiling the city's idea of fun.</p>
<p>In 1886, locals took offence at police intervention in a gathering indulging in the now almost extinct folk sport of eel pulling -- where a man in a fast-moving boat attempts to snatch a writhing eel from a line strung across a canal.</p>
<p>Three days of streetfights in the central Jordaan quarter led to the army being called in and resulted in a total of 26 dead and 136 wounded. The fate of the eel is unrecorded.</p>
<p>An uprising of a different sort will be sharing the square at the Nieuwmarkt on June 15 during the Sex Riot -- a series of performances &quot;for people who successfully explore their sexual development and sexual boundaries.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Eurosummit is just going to be about jobs and, after all, sex is far more important,&quot; say the organisers. &quot;During the Eurosummit, Amsterdam will be a free European sex zone.&quot;</p>
<p>Clearly, though, that is a message which has yet to reach the city's call-girl community, who have been kicking up a fuss about restraint of trade related to security measures at summit delegates' hotels.</p>
<p>Escorts have been told they will not be cleared for access to Europe's political elite during the meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a pity, that would have been steady work,&quot; grumbled one club owner.</p>
<p>But Amsterdam has always been a trading city and the commercial sex industry is not giving up easily. Plans are afoot to target a more accessible, if possibly less affluent, market.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, there are going to be at least 2,000 journalists here,&quot; the club owner said. &quot;They'll definitely want to have a bit of a party.&quot;</p>
<p>OTHER CONCERNS</p>
<p>Of course there are organisations with more didactic intentions for the crush of the world's media in town for the summit.</p>
<p>The organisers of the Euro Marches hope to bring in as many as 20,000 demonstrators from across the Union by the weekend to highlight Europe's unemployment situation and agitate for more government attention for labour issues.</p>
<p>And the Top from the Bottom, an &quot;alternative summit&quot; that will shadow the official meeting, aims to tackle broader European concerns such as racism, poverty, development and gender issues within the bloc.</p>
<p>Some local organisations, too, are keen to inject some serious debate into activities around the summit and to defend their city's reputation.</p>
<p>&quot;The Amsterdam Eurosummit welcomes Europe to Amsterdam,&quot; says one group set up to brief the foreign press on the empirical success of the city's liberal sex and soft drugs policies. &quot;But will Europe really welcome Amsterdam?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The city has been cursed over and over again for being a Sodom or Gomorrah...generally completely unjustly.&quot;</p>
<p>Others favour more direct action to hammer home the tolerance message.</p>
<p>Events like the Amsterdam Anti-Prohibition Street Party, EuroravE and EuroBlow, a &quot;mass smoke-in&quot; at the summit site on the last day of the meeting, are likely to feature casual substance abuse that would invite a mass lock-up anywhere else.</p>
<p>At least, though, one result of the Amsterdam summit seems certain.</p>
<p>Whether or not the delegates sign the EMU Stability Pact, or conclude the Inter-Governmental Conference on expansion of the Union, one group quite close to the negotiations won't care -- or, quite possibly, even remember.</p>
