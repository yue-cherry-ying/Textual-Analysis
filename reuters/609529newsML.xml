<p>The head of Italy's state-owned rail company Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) said on Friday he had requested government authorisation for a loan of 1.3 to 1.4 trillion lire after cuts in state funding.</p>
<p>FS managing director Giancarlo Cimoli told a news conference here the situation at the rail giant was not immediately serious but &quot;given the cut in available cash, I said we would need a loan for 1.3 to 1.4 trillion lire.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have requested authorisation from the Treasury and we hope to have that soon,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Cimoli told the budget commission of the Italian lower house of parliament a lack of resources would take the FS into a cash deficit with &quot;heavy repercussions on investment and payments to employees and suppliers.&quot;</p>
<p>He did not say over what timescale this situation might arise but said the problem was urgent, noting that this year 5.6 trillion lire of funds earmarked for the FS had not yet been transferred.</p>
<p>Cimoli said on Friday if the situation did not ease, &quot;like all companies we must make a choice... whether to slow down investments, what policies to follow for 1998.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the government's budgetary measures in the last six months had cut FS funds by 6.5 trillion lire and the company now needed to know what Rome was preparing in its three-year plan of economic targets which is expected to be unveiled next week.</p>
<p>Newspapers have reported recently that the document could include spending cuts worth around 4.0 trillion lire in funds to state companies, including the railway giant.</p>
<p>&quot;We have continued to invest, in fact we have speeded up investment. We understand the government has to square its accounts, we want a solution which suits the (Treasury) and doesn't damage the company,&quot; the rail chief said.</p>
<p>Cimoli, drafted in to run the FS last year after predecessor Lorenzo Necci was arrested on suspicion of corruption, said rail reform started by the new management should definitely make 1997 operating results better than 1996 results and the aim was not to increase business volume but to improve the accounts.</p>
<p>Cimoli pointed out the company had already taken steps to restructure, selling fixed assets, liquidating some companies and selling other small ones.</p>
<p>He said however a more central point for the railways was a government plan to separate management of railway lines and infrastructure from rolling stock. This would allow the company next year to evaluate margins on individual services and assess the path to operating profits for the divisions.</p>
<p>Italy's rail services have been hit by a succession of strikes in the last few months as rail unions protested over contract renewals and plans to restructure rail transport.</p>
<p>Earlier in May rail executives reached a preliminary accord with five rail unions on renewing contracts but did not address the sticky issue of restructuring the rail giant.</p>
<p>Cimoli said after months of meetings &quot;we are half way along a path which aims to make contracts more flexible and adapted to competition.&quot;</p>
