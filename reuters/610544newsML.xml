<p>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said on Friday the earlier reduction in interest rates is good for jobs but the government had no immediate plans to revises its forecasts for unemployment.</p>
<p>Costello also told reporters in Melbourne that Australia's interest rate policy was determined by domestic events and that he was unconcerned at the shrinking interest rate differential with the United States.  </p>
<p>Asked if the governmetn was concerned about the narrowing interest rate differential and its impact on the Australian dollar, Costello said: &quot;No, because we are going to run our monetary policy in a way which is consistent with our inflation targets.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the rate cut was the result of a good budget outcome, and the government was focussed on domestic influences.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to set it (the budget) with reference to domestic events here in Australia. The domestic events, gave us a unique window of opportunity and you've seen the reduction in interest rates as a consequence,&quot; he told reporters.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is good for jobs,&quot; Costello said.</p>
<p>&quot;The interest rate cuts if passed on in full by the banks to the small business sector would create the right conditions for further investment and job creation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked if the government planned to revise its forecast for unemployment to be eight percent by the June quarter of 1998, Costello said: &quot;You don't revise forecasts on a weekly basis.&quot;</p>
<p>In its budget for 1997/98 (July-June), announced on May 13, the government forecast employment growth of two percent for 1997/98 from an estimated 1.25 percent in 1996/97.  </p>
<p>Australia's unemployment rate was 8.7 percent in April and has remained at or above 8.5 percent for more than a year.</p>
