<p>New Century Holdings, a U.S. investment fund active in the Baltics and Eastern Europe, said on Thursday that it was prepared to invest one million dollars a week in Latvia.</p>
<p>&quot;We have funds at our disposal which would allow us to invest up to one million dollars a week in Latvia,&quot; New Century representative Karlis Cerbulis told an investment conference.</p>
<p>Over the past 18 months, the company has invested $35 million in Latvia.</p>
<p>The conference was organised by the Riga bourse, Reuters and the Riga Business school.</p>
<p>Cerbulis acknowledged that it is not easy to find a project of that size, but the funds were readily available without prior consent from the initial investors.</p>
<p>Cerbulis also said that an index calculated by Nomura showed a 1996 growth on return on investments in Latvia of 350 percent in dollar terms against 64.5 percent in Russia, 25.7 percent in the U.S and 190 percent in Lithuania and Estonia.</p>
<p>As risk diminishes in the Baltic countries, investors will be ready to accept lower profits, Cerbulis added.</p>
<p>Talented management tops News Century's list of criteria for choosing a company to invest in.</p>
<p>Good finance and control systems plus fast growth potential are also important, Cerbulis said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking for substantial participation, no less than 10 percent of a company's capital,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Latvia's companies still suffer from a lack of transparancy, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is such an air of secrecy that sometimes the second-in-line managers themselves do not know what happens in a company,&quot; Cerbulis said.</p>
<p>Management may also have a vested interest in maintaining chaotic conditions in a company, especially in legal and financial matters, to frighten away other investors, Cerbulis said.</p>
