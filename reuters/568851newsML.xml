<title>UK: European jet fuel dragged up by stronger futures.</title>
<headline>European jet fuel dragged up by stronger futures.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>European jet fuel was pulled higher by futures on Thursday amid steady premiums in a slow day.</p>
<p>May IPE gas oil closed $1.50 a tonne stronger at $169.00.</p>
<p>Traders said business was sparse with much of continental Europe on holiday.</p>
<p>A barge traded at May IPE +$20.25 fob ARA, unchanged  from the last few days, while cargoes were struggling to find buyers.</p>
<p>Offers of May IPE +$21 cif NWE were failing to generate any appreciable interest.</p>
<p>Dealers said the northern European jet market was long, but not in ARA, hence barges' relative strength against the cargo market.</p>
<p>The buy tender by German compulsory stocks agency EBV was also giving some support to the barge market.</p>
<p>Up to four Mediterranean cargoes were headed northwards because of the lack of selling opportunity in their home region.</p>
<p>Jet paper was also slow with balance of May offered at $21.50, June offered at $22.50 and 3Q at $26.00. There were no takers.</p>
