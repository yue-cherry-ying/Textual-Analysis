<title>USA: Continental, pilots to open labor talks.</title>
<headline>Continental, pilots to open labor talks.</headline>

<p>The union representing pilots of Continental Airlines Inc. and its sister company Continental Express plan to open talks with the airline on new labour pacts on Wednesday, the pilots said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Independent Association of Continental Pilots, which represents 4,000 Continental pilots and 1,000 Continental Express pilots, did not release terms of initial contract proposals to be delivered to the company on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A union spokesman said the pilots expect the Houston-based airline to live up to an earlier pledge to avoid protracted talks on contracts that expire July 30 for the Continental pilots and Oct. 1 for the Continental Express pilots.</p>
<p>&quot;In keeping with the company's stated goal of achieving a contract quickly and without acrimony, we hope to see a prompt response on the substantive issues,&quot; the spokesman said in a statement recorded on the union's telephone news line.</p>
<p>Continental, the nation's fifth-largest airline, emerged from bankruptcy in 1992 and is now recognised as one of the strongest domestic carriers. The airline posted record earnings of $319 million on revenues of $6.4 billion in 1996.</p>
<p>But Continental pilots earn about 35 percent less than their peers at the nation's largest airlines, and about 15 percent less than the average wage of pilots at the top 10 domestic airlines, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our pilots deserve more pay and we plan to pay them more, just like we have done for all employee groups over the past year,&quot; Continental spokesman Ned Walker said.</p>
<p>The Continental pilots, who will receive a 5 percent across-the-board raise on June 30 under terms of the current contract, are the latest to open contract talks with a domestic airline.</p>
<p>American Airlines pilots are mulling contract terms forged after President Clinton intervened to halt a strike of the Dallas-based airline. US Airways Group Inc. sought to trim its pilots wages, while United Airlines recently agreed to terms with its pilots.</p>
<p>Continental's class A stock fell 75 cents to $31 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
