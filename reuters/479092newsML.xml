<headline>SBC completes Pacific Telesis merger.</headline>
<dateline>SAN ANTONIO 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>SBC Communications Inc. said Tuesday it completed its $16.5 billion acquisition of Pacific Telesis Group and announced plans to enter the long-distance market by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The merger of the parents of Southwestern Bell and Pacific Bell creates the nation's largest provider of local telephone services, with a territory that stretches from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean and a market value of $47.9 billion.</p>
<p>Its annual revenue of $23.5 billion ranks it among the top 30 publicly held U.S. corporations on the Fortune 500.</p>
<p>The closing of the merger followed Monday's approval of the deal by the California Public Utilities Commission, the last regulatory agency required to give its blessing, and subsequent votes by the two companies' boards of directors. Pacific Telesis has its headquarters in San Francisco.</p>
<p>San Antonio, Texas-based SBC agreed to the California regulators' demand that it issue refunds totalling $341 million to California consumers over a five-year period beginning in 1998 to cover a portion of the short-term and long-term benefits of the merger.</p>
<p>&quot;Growth prospects for our business are outstanding,&quot; said SBC Chairman Edward Whitacre.</p>
<p>&quot;Exploding demand for Internet access and high-speed data services, strong growth in wireless services, increased demand for basic wireline service and tremendous opportunities in long-distance and in markets outside the United States -- all point to an exciting future for the new SBC,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In a conference call with reporters, company executives said SBC hoped to introduce long-distance service in its markets before the end of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a zero market share in that business and we plan on being big, as we are already today in the long-distance business in the wireless market place,&quot; said Phil Quigley, PacTel's former chief executive and now SBC vice chairman.</p>
<p>The merger of the two Baby Bell companies has met with stiff criticism from consumer groups and rival telephone companies, who argued that the combination of the two would slow the opening of local exchange markets to competition.</p>
<p>&quot;There is little here for consumers to cheer about. A bigger monopoly is still a monopoly,&quot; said Rian Wren, AT&amp;T Corp. vice president for local services in the southwestern United States. &quot;This merger doesn't speed up anyone's ability to choose between local phone companies,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Whitacre and Quigley said the merger would bring consumer benefits, notably in long-distance markets. &quot;I can assure you there is going to be more competition. More competition means better prices and better products,&quot; Quigley said.</p>
<p>The combined company, which will retain the name SBC Communications Inc., has nearly 110,000 employees and net income of more than $3 billion.</p>
<p>SBC will serve the nation's most populous states -- California and Texas -- seven of the top 10 U.S. metropolitan markets and 16 of the top 50, and selected countries overseas, including Mexico, Chile, South Korea, Taiwan, France and South Africa. Other states it serves include Nevada, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri and Kansas.</p>
<p>The $23 billion merger of Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic Corp. and New York's Nynex Corp., which has been held up by anti-trust regulators, would surpass the value of the SBC-Pacific Telesis deal.</p>
<p>The combined Bell Atlantic would also become the largest local phone service provider by most basic measures.</p>
<p>&quot;This merger better positions SBC to be the telecommunications provider of choice at a time when all markets are opening to competition,&quot; Quigley said.</p>
<p>While SBC's corporate headquarters will remain in San Antonio, the company will set up headquarters for its Internet, international, long distance and administration activities in California. That would bring 1,000 new jobs to California and extra jobs to San Antonio, Whitaker said.</p>
<p>The merger involves an exchange of stock with current Pacific Telesis stockholders receiving SBC stock. Each Pacific Telesis shareowner will receive 0.73145 share of SBC for each share of Pacific Telesis they own.</p>
<p>After the merger, which qualifies as a tax-free exchange, SBC shareholders will have 64 percent of the combined company and Pacific Teleis holders the remaining 34 percent.</p>
<p>California's consumer-oriented utility commission had held up approval of the deal, demanding a series of concessions from the company, including rebates to the state's consumers, job growth guarantees and other requirements.</p>
