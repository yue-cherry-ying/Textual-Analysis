<headline>Florida judge rules smoking trial should be split.</headline>

<p>A Florida judge ruled Thursday that the trial of a secondhand smoke class-action lawsuit filed by airline flight attendants will be split into two parts, with common issues decided before individual claims.</p>
<p>The ruling resulted from a hearing Monday in which the tobacco companies had asked Dade County Judge Robert Kaye to divide the trial, first having a jury consider whether second-hand smoke causes diseases and later determining the industry's liability.  </p>
<p>The plaintiffs, suing on behalf of all flight attendants, did not want the issues separated, saying they were intertwined.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to conserve precious court time and to expedite the trial of the issues, it has become apparent that this case should be decided in stages and phases which would include 'special verdicts' and 'general verdicts,'&quot; Kaye wrote.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, known as Broin v. Philip Morris (Cos Inc ) et al, was filed by a group of flight attendants who said they were sickened by second-hand smoke while working on U.S. passenger jets.  </p>
<p>It is the first class-action suit of its kind to go to trial, which is due to begin June 2.</p>
<p>Kaye's ruling said: &quot;The first stage shall encompass all common issues with regard to the subclass of lung/pulmonary/sinus diseases and disorders, including lung cancer ... The second stage shall be concerned with the non-common or individual claims of the plaintiffs in this subclass.&quot;  </p>
<p>Kaye revamped an initial trial plan, deciding that the issue of whether secondhand smoke causes lung cancer and other maladies should be linked to the behavior of the defendants, the tobacco companies.</p>
<p>As a result, the first stage of the trial will decide whether the plaintiffs can prove the secondhand smoke-illness link, when the tobacco companies knew about the dangers, whether they knew about the threat to flight attendants, and whether they fraudulently misrepresented the hazards.  </p>
<p>The first stage would also decide whether the tobacco companies had a duty to warn flight attendants of the dangers of second-hand smoke and whether the flight attendants were entitled to punitive damages.</p>
<p>If the jury found for the flight attendants in the first phase, the second phase would deal with the claims of individuals and the amount of punitive damages.</p>
