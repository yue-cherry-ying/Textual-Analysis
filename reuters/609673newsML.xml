<p>Pakistan aims to bring down the budget deficit close to five percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal 1997/98 (July-June) against 6.3 percent in 1996/97, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said on Friday.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our revised estimate of budget deficit (in 1996/97) is 6.3 percent of the GDP....my aim is to bring it down at least by one percent because anymore or larger target would not be realistic,&quot; said Aziz, who was talking by telephone to Reuters Financial Television in Tokyo and was monitored in Islamabad.</p>
<p>&quot;So if we bring it down close to five percent we have done very well,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>He said Pakistan had set a target of increasing its exports by ten percent in 1997/98. Pakistan total exports in July-March were $6.129 billion against imports of $8.753 billion.</p>
<p>He said repayment of Pakistan's short term debt will become easier if exports went up by ten percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The actual amount that we borrowed short term this year is less than a billion dollars and every year we kind of roll it over to meet our requirements.</p>
<p>&quot;If we are able to increase our exports by ten percent next year, which is our target for next year, which is an extra billion dollars, then the short term debt servicing will become fine,&quot; he added.</p>
