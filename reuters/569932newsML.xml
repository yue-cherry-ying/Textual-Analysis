<p>Pakistan said on Thursday it wanted India to discuss all issues dividing the two old foes, including the key dispute over the Himalayan region of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>A Foreign Ministry spokesman told reporters that talks between Prime Ministers Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Inder Kumar Gujral of India in the Maldives next week had no set agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope all outstanding issues between the two countries will come under discussion,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sharif and Gujral are due to meet on Monday on the fringes of a seven-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit in the Maldivian capital Male.</p>
<p>Apparently rejecting Gujral's statement in parliament on Wednesday that Kashmir was an integral part of India, the spokesman said: &quot;We hope he can bring himself to discuss all outstanding issues, including what we believe is the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Gujral himself had stated his Male talks with Sharif would be very useful and added: &quot;We hope this meeting will set the tone for future negotiations between the two countries.&quot;</p>
<p>He disagreed with a suggestion that Pakistan's insistence on making Kashmir a core issue might hamper progress in ties between the two states, which have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947. Two of them were over Kashmir.</p>
<p>&quot;All I will say here is that if you go to a doctor with certain symptoms and he keeps on giving you aspirin to cure your symptoms and ignores the disease, you are not going to get better,&quot; he said. &quot;I think India-Pakistan relations fall in the same category.&quot;</p>
<p>India is fighting a separatist Moslem revolt in the two-thirds of Kashmir it rules. Pakistan rules the rest of the former princely state, where armies of the two countries face each other across a United Nations-monitored control line.</p>
<p>India regards the whole of Kashmir as its own.</p>
<p>Islamabad says that predominantly Moslem Kashmir must decide in a U.N.-mandated plebiscite whether to join Islamic Pakistan or Hindu-majority India.</p>
<p>Some of the militant groups fighting Indian rule want to reunite the two parts of Kashmir in an independent state.</p>
<p>The two neighbours resumed talks in March after a three-year break marked by bitter recrimination.</p>
<p>Gujral met Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan last month before becoming prime minister in a political shakeup.</p>
