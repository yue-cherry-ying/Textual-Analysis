<headline>NZ SPORT-Semifinals new experience for Hurricanes.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-05-24</dateline>

<p>The Wellington Hurricanes exceeded all expectations by reaching the semifinals of rugby's Super 12 and are finding it difficult to adjust to the pressure of tonight's showdown with ACT Brumbies in Canberra, NZPA reported.</p>
<p>Coach Frank Oliver said his pre-season goals was make the top six but now the team are in the semifinals, they've found themselves in new, and slightly uncomfortable, surroundings.</p>
<p>Captain Mark Allen said it was a huge step up for him, with second division playoffs with Taranaki his only previous experience of do-or-die semifinals.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to compare matches for different teams but this is a huge game for me,&quot; Allen told NZPA.</p>
<p>&quot;We're part of making history for the Hurricanes and the whole experience of semifinal rugby at this level is so different to any other game I've played in.&quot;</p>
<p>Allen said his feelings were shared by most of the Hurricanes squad, who by and large have not seen much success with their respective provinces.</p>
<p>&quot;The Hurricanes players are generally not used to being in this situation. The background for most of the players is coming from teams that don't usually win at provincial level.&quot;  </p>
<p>While the semifinal experience is also new to ACT, most of the Brumbies have some knowledge of the demands of top level rugby for either Queensland or New South Wales and have played in vital contests like the tensely-fought State of the Union matches between the bitter inter-state rivals.</p>
<p>Allen said the key to victory would be in how well the Hurricanes' forwards play.</p>
<p>Last week, they were on the back foot and their sparkling backline went flat as a result. If Wellington can go forward they can score the tries to match ACT.</p>
