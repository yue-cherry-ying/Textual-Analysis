<p>Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Daniel Vacek claimed the French Open doubles crown on Saturday, denying the world number one pairing of Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde a fourth consecutive grand slam title.</p>
<p>For the winners of more grand slam doubles titles than any pairing in the Open era, the French has proven elusive for the 'Woodies', as Woodforde and Woodbridge are better known in their native Australia,</p>
<p>This time they lost 7-6 4-6 6-3 to the part-time pairing of Kafelnikov and Vacek, allowing the Russian to retain at least one of the two French titles he won last year.</p>
<p>Kafelnikov, the defending singles champion, went out in the quarter-finals this year to unheralded Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten, who will play Spain's Sergi Bruguera in Sunday's final.</p>
<p>Kafelnikov and his Czech partner, who have only played together in 17 tournaments, become the first pair to keep the French doubles crown since Ken McGregor and Frank Sedgman in 1952.</p>
<p>Having won eight grand slam titles and strung together 23 consecutive grand slam wins, the Woodies were heavily favoured coming into the final but struggled on the slow clay.</p>
<p>&quot;The record would say that this is our most difficult surface,&quot; said Woodforde, who made it to the quarter-finals in the men's singles before losing to compatriot Patrick Rafter. &quot;It's the one tournament we haven't won and it's our goal. When we win here we can say we belong with some of the great pairs.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the one great hurdle left for us to jump.&quot;</p>
