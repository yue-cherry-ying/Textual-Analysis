<p>Britain's manufacturing sector expanded for the 10th consecutive month in March with strong growth in output and new orders, a leading business survey said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) said its purchasing managers' index stood at a seasonally adjusted 52.9 in March compared with 53.4 in February.</p>
<p>A reading over 50 indicates expansion in the sector, with the small fall in the index level showing the pace of growth eased.</p>
<p>CIPS said the fall was a result of a drop in manufacturing employment, the first since last May. &quot;A slightly higher number of firms cut staffing levels as part of effiency-boosting rationalisation programmes, such as downsizing, than recruited new staff,&quot; the institute said.</p>
<p>The PMI is seen as a reliable barometer of activity in manufacturing. The snapshot it provides is often confirmed by subsequent official data.</p>
<p>The survey said the principal source of growth of new orders registered in March came from the home market. Export orders also rose, and to a greater extent than in February, due to faster growth in European economies.</p>
<p>But the pound's spirited rally continued to dampen demand for British goods abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;The impact of the recent increase in the value of the pound continued to subdue export orders compared to the strong performance recorded in the latter half of last year,&quot; the CIPS said.</p>
<p>But there was a positive outcome from the pound's strength. The cost of imported raw materials and components prices fell for the 17th month in succession.</p>
<p>Further evidence of subdued prices was provided by suppliers' delivery times which lengthened for the seventh month running as demand continued to increase. But the incidence of delays and shortages remained relatively low.</p>
<p>&quot;This suggests that any inflationary effects associated with capacity constraints remain suppressed,&quot; the survey said.</p>
