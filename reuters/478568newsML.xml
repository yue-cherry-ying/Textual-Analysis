<p>U.S. technology group Motorola Inc's pull-out from a large mobile telephone network project in Ukraine came as no surprise to analysts who say Kiev has been playing favourites with local companies.</p>
<p>&quot;What this does is takes the real players out and lets the guys on the fringe come in and take over,&quot; said one Western analyst on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Motorola announced last week that it would pull the plug on a project to launch a GSM 900 (global system for mobile communications) phone network with its local partner Ukrainian Radio Systems (URS). Motorola owned 49 percent of the venture.</p>
<p>Foreign investors have viewed the former Soviet republic's underdeveloped telecommunications system as a potentially lucrative opportunity but complain about deterrents such as inconsistent laws, corruption and high taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;There were ever-changing terms and conditions,&quot; said Motorola country manager Gregory Perchatsch, who declined to provide further details but said his company had invested several million dollars in setting up the system.</p>
<p>A Ukrainian Communications Ministry spokesman countered: &quot;There were equal conditions for the tender. Why isn't Motorola happy when the other two winners are? It's Motorola's problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Motorola plans to continue participating in a local GSM 1800 network and to sell telecommunications equipment but it had forecast investing $500 million in the next 15 years to supply equipment and to back URS.</p>
<p>Under Ukrainian law only local companies are entitled to frequencies.</p>
<p>The Western analyst said Motorola had quit in reaction to the tender process for frequencies, which has been drawn out and reportedly seen frequency prices hiked.</p>
<p>&quot;They just said they're not playing this game anymore,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Three firms, including two foreign joint ventures and one newly-created Ukrainian company, won tenders in February.</p>
<p>But the Ukrainian government said it would not allocate frequencies for another five months because the companies -- URS-Motorola, Ukrainian Mobile Communications (UMC) and Kiev Star -- were not equally ready to begin.</p>
<p>The analyst said Kiev Star, an unknown concern started last year and thought to be the parent of a Kiev newspaper, needed to find financial backing and equipment.</p>
<p>&quot;Kiev Star wouldn't survive without the five months,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Motorola opened its representative office in Ukraine in late 1993 and UMC was formed in 1992.</p>
<p>UMC, owned by the state, Deutsche Telekom AG, Tele Danmark AS and Koninklijke PTT Nederland NV (Dutch PTT), threatened to withdraw after the government raised tariffs last year.</p>
<p>Some company officials at the time accused Ukraine of shutting out Western competitors from the GSM market.</p>
<p>&quot;Three companies cannot share the frequencies that are available,&quot; said another analyst. &quot;There was only enough room for two operators.&quot;</p>
<p>Although the tender fees were not disclosed, media reports said the government hiked the per frequency rate to $65 million from under $10 million.</p>
<p>Ukraine has attracted only $1.4 billion in direct foreign investment since independence five years ago and the government has been slow to address investors' complaints.</p>
<p>Roman Shpek, chief of the state-run National Agency for Reconstruction and Development, said it was unfortunate that Motorola was pulling out.</p>
<p>&quot;But all the same there were three winners of the tender and two are still here,&quot; Shpek said.</p>
<p>Motorola has promised to try to find a partner for URS.</p>
<p>URS president Volodymyr Vernyck said Motorola had its reasons for leaving but would not stop his company's activities. &quot;We will carry on as before,&quot; he said.</p>
