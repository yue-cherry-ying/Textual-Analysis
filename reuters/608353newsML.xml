<p>Englishman Roy Hodgson parted ways with beaten UEFA Cup finalists Internazionale Milan on Friday, quitting on the spot with two crucial games left in the serie A season.</p>
<p>Hodgson, who is moving to English club Blackburn next season, informed Inter chairman Massimo Moratti that he was resigning with immediate effect. He had tendered his resignation on Thursday but Moratti had asked him to sleep on it.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought Hodgson would stand up to it psychologically but he didn't,&quot; Moratti told reporters. &quot;I understand Hodgson from a human point of view but now I have to carry on and run this club,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hodgson's decision was largely symbolic given his move to the former English premier league champions, which was announced in February. But it highlighted the bitterness Hodgson has felt in a successful but rocky 18 months with Inter.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, fans pelted him with coins and cigarette lighters as he left the pitch after Inter lost the UEFA Cup final to German club Schalke in a penalty shoot-out at the San Siro stadium.</p>
<p>He also had a brief but very public altercation with Inter's Argentine midfielder Javier Zanetti, who resented being substituted in the dying minutes of extra time.</p>
<p>Hodgson's place on the bench will be taken for the remainder of the season by goalkeeping coach Luciano Castellani. Gigi Simoni, formerly of Napoli, is due to join Inter as the fulltime coach next season.</p>
<p>The remaining two matches, at home to Napoli on Sunday and at Bologna on June 1, will decide whether Inter finish second and thus secure a European Cup berth next season.</p>
<p>With Juventus needing just a point to clinch the league title on Friday evening, Inter lie third in the table, eight points behind the leaders and two behind second-placed Parma.</p>
<p>They could still overtake Parma to clinch second place.</p>
<p>Although Inter have had a successful season, Hodgson, who joined in October 1995 from a much-praised stint as Swiss national coach, has not enjoyed a happy relationship with fans, media and senior figures within the club.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry that the fans consider Hodgson the guilty party, I think they exaggerated,&quot; Moratti was quoted as saying in Friday's Gazzetta Dello Sport newspaper. &quot;I know Hodgson well, he doesn't deserve such a mortification.&quot;</p>
