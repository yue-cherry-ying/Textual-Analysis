<p>LOT Polish Airlines said it will operate a total of six additional direct flights from New York and Chicago to Poland between May 15 and June 7.</p>
<p>Its North American marketing manager Oliver Green said the summer schedule will be operated by Boeing 767s from New York-JFK, New York-Newark International and Chicago's O'Hare airports.</p>
<p>The new flights are in addition to the 20 existing flights during the period.</p>
<p>Regional sales manager Pawel Lodzinski said the carrier, which is purchasing five additional Boeing aircraft this summer, is forecasting a good year with a 12 to 15 percent increase in cargo revenues against 1996.</p>
<p>Lodzinkski said the order, valued at $225 million, will see delivery of two Boeing 737s by late April, one 767 in mid-May and two further 737s by end-June.</p>
<p>Magorzata Budnicka, LOT cargo manager at John F. Kennedy airport, said its station handled over 3,000 metric tonnes or 33 percent system-wide business, on inbound and outbound cargo in 1996.</p>
<p>Budnicka said that fabrics, apparel, and paper goods were among the most frequently imported cargo in 1996.</p>
<p>Electronics and heavy machinery headed the list of cargo exported from the U.S. during the same period.</p>
<p>Via onward connections from Warsaw, Rudnicka said LOT saw &quot;tremendous cargo traffic (potential) to all of central Europe and the Baltic republics&quot;.</p>
<p>Budnicka added that said the carrier is considering removing its cargo fuel surcharges. These were applied from December 8 at 10 US cents per kg.</p>
<p>If and when fuel costs returned to June 1996 levels, LOT would definitely remove the surcharges, she said. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax:5017</p>
