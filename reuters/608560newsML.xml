<p>The IPE's natural gas futures contract narrowly escaped another blank day on Friday when two deals, each of the minimum size of five lots, were done three minutes before the close of trade.</p>
<p>Deals were done in front month June, down 0.13 pence a therm at 11.05 pence, and in September at 11.25 pence, down by 0.14 pence. Otherwise interest was thin, with bids only seen in five of the 12 contract months by the close and no offers posted at all.</p>
<p>The 10 lots done on Friday took the total for the week to 255. Although this is higher than the 55 seen last week, it is still disappointing compared with a few weeks ago, when more than this was regularly done in a day.</p>
<p>But traders said the market had suffered at the end of the week as many gas market players were away watching cricket of Thursday and several of these apparently then took Friday off ahead of the long bank holiday weekend.</p>
