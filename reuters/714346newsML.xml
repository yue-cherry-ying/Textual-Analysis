<p>Hollywood bid a final farewell on Monday to one of the greatest stars from the Golden Age of movies -- Jimmy Stewart.</p>
<p>Dozens of fans crammed trendy Rodeo Drive outside the Beverly Hills Presbyterian Church where many of Stewart's long-time friends and colleagues attended a memorial service.</p>
<p>The actor, who died last Wednesday of a heart attack at the age of 89, was buried earlier in the day at a private funeral at a Los Angeles cemetery. He had been a virtual recluse since his wife, Gloria, died in 1994.</p>
<p>Nancy Reagan was at the service on Monday, but without her husband, former President Ronald Reagan, who is suffering from Alzheimer's Disease and is rarely seen in public.</p>
<p>A frail-looking Bob Hope attended with his wife Dolores, as did two of Stewart's big-screen leading ladies, June Allyson and Esther Williams. Actor Robert Stack and comedienne Carol Burnett were also among the 75-strong congregation.</p>
<p>Inside the Spanish-style church, Rev. James Morrison eulogised Stewart as a war hero, who served his country in the Second World War.</p>
<p>Later, a bugler from the Air Force played &quot;Taps&quot; (The Last Post) for a man who flew bombing missions over Germany and ended the war the highest-ranking Hollywood star in the U.S. armed services. He won the Distinguished Flying Cross and later served in the Air Force Reserve for many years.</p>
<p>&quot;He was a man ... of great success, but he would never have measured success as most measure it today, in terms of status, position, wealth,&quot; Morrison told the congregation.</p>
<p>&quot;He would measure success in the ability that one had to relate to other people and enrich a life, and indeed he did enrich lives.&quot;</p>
<p>The minister noted that Stewart was a long-time Presbyterian, who regularly attended services at the church just a block away from the ritzy shops of Rodeo Drive -- a symbol of conspicuous materialism many of Stewart's screen characters might have rejected.</p>
<p>He was remembered by fans as portraying a decent American &quot;everyman&quot; in many of his nearly 80 films.</p>
<p>&quot;He probably epitomised what is best about America,&quot; said Linda Brown, a tourist from Jacksonville, Florida, outside the church. Her husband Quince said: &quot;Jimmy Stewart was one of the greatest actors. There will never be another.&quot;</p>
<p>Stewart's twin daughters Judy and Kelly and his stepson, Michael McLean, were accompanied into the church for the 45-minute service by an Air Force honour guard.</p>
<p>&quot;When they played 'Taps', we all fell apart,&quot; Edie Wasserman, wife of legendary Hollywood studio executive Lew Wasserman, told reporters after the service.</p>
<p>&quot;He was the most loyal, honest and true gentleman I ever knew,&quot; said Allyson, who played opposite Stewart in &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot;.</p>
<p>President Reagan, a former actor who presented Stewart with a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985, last week mourned the loss of a &quot;close, close friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We shared so many of life's precious moments with him and with Gloria,&quot; Reagan and his wife, Nancy, said in a statement. &quot;We'll miss him terribly, but we know they're happy to be together once again.&quot;</p>
<p>Daily Variety, the trade paper of Hollywood, carried two full-page tributes to Stewart on Monday.</p>
<p>One, from Republic Pictures, showed the actor in a still from &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; surrounded by his screen wife Donna Reed and their children.</p>
<p>&quot;Every time a bell rings, we'll think of you&quot; it said, in a paraphrase of the line from the film in which his daughter said everytime a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.</p>
<p>Sony Pictures had an ad showing Stewart in a still from &quot;Mr Smith Goes to Washington&quot; saying simply: &quot;Farewell, Mr Smith.&quot;</p>
