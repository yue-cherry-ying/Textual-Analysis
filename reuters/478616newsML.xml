<p>Czech industrial sales, hit by a nationwide rail strike, fell again in February but a further sharp rise in nominal wages means a short-term easing of monetary policy is unlikely, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Industrial sales were 3.6 percent lower in February and 1.7 percent down in the first two month so the year thasn in the corresponding period of 1996. The bureau said the fall was partly due to the five-day-long rail strike in early February.</p>
<p>But nominal monthly industrial wages grew 16.2 percent in February after a 14.4 percent rise in January. For the first two months of the year, the rise was 15.2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The short-term results of these figures would be that chances for easing the monetary policy would be close to zero,&quot; said Zivnostenska Banka chief economist Pavel Sobisek.</p>
<p>&quot;The pressure for wages to grow is still quite strong, which is unsustainable in the long run so concern about this from the state authorities and the CNB (central bank) is justifiable,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>CNB governor Josef Tosovsky last month said wage growth was a key problem for the economy and said it could not afford more than a nominal 10 percent rise in pay in 1997.</p>
<p>The government has forecast wages will grow 13 percent this year. Nominal gross wages grew 18 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>The bank said last week it saw no reason to change the current course of monetary policy and called on the government, employers and workers to limit wage growth to 10 percent.</p>
<p>The Czech economy has enjoyed seven years of demand-led growth as industry imported technology and the population slaked a thirst for consumer goods denied them under communism.</p>
<p>But growth is slowing. Some analysts say this indicates investments were not effective and restructuring inadequate.</p>
<p>&quot;The (industrial sales) figures simply confirm the tendency of the economy to slow down,&quot; said WoodCommerz economic researcher Jiri Krovak, adding that he believed a proportion of industrial output was simply going to stock-building.</p>
<p>&quot;This is what widens the gap between output and labour productivity, which is catastrophic becauase this gap in the medium and long-term undermines macroeconomic stability.&quot;</p>
<p>Sobisek said that if the trend continued inflationary pressures would build up or the trade deficit would widen.</p>
<p>&quot;Both of these factors would be extremely bad for an economy which is at the stage we are currently in,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus last month revised downwards his forecats for economic groweth in 1997 to more than four percent from an original forecats of 5.4 percent.</p>
<p>He took issue with the restrictive anti-inflationary policy of the central bank which he said had restricted growth.</p>
<p>But Creditanstalt Prague capital markets director Matt Starr said he believed interest rates would fall in the second or third quarter of 1997 because of the need for growth.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy is really struggling rigth now and a lot of thre the demand that you see in the economy comes from investment which is starting to slow down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik has said he expects a debate early this month on two percent cuts to almost all state spending to keep the 1997 budget in balance.</p>
<p>&quot;They simply have to adopt some measures otherwise the economy is heading for instability,&quot; said Korvak.</p>
<p>Sobisek said it was possible industrial sales and output could be pushed up by increased demand in Western Europe and that a slightly weaker Czech crown, which was at record highs in February but has since eased, could also help.</p>
<p>IPB bank chief economist Miroslav Soucek said a reduced number of working days in February meant data on sales were not comparable. He saw first quarter industrial output flat.</p>
