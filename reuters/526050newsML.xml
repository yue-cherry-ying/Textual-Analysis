<p>Ali Agca, the Turkish  gunman who tried to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981, said in an interview published in Paris on Monday that he was in love.</p>
<p>Agca told the newspaper France-Soir from his Italian prison cell that the object of his love was a young compatriot with whom he corresponded by mail. He did not say if he had met her face-to-face.</p>
<p>&quot;She's from Istanbul and her name is Epru. She's a 25-year-old university student.</p>
<p>&quot;She told me she loved me a few months ago. If I go back to Turkey, I will marry her. I believe in love a lot...,&quot; he told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Agca, who is serving a life sentence for shooting and wounding the Pope on St. Peter's Square in the Vatican, repeated that he regretted the act which he then saw as a blow against capitalism and imperialism.</p>
<p>He also repeated that he believed he was &quot;the material and spiritual reincarnation of Jesus Christ.&quot;</p>
