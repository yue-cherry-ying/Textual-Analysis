<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS/Living Centers deal no surprise.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>The merger deal between Living Centers of America Inc and GranCare Inc, announced Thursday, did not surprise options traders, who said volume and volatility in Living Centers options had been on the rise recently.</p>
<p>&quot;The (trading) crowd has anticipated this coming for quite some time,&quot; one industry source said.</p>
<p>Lawrence McMillan, who publishes the Daily Volume Alert, said in a report Tuesday that Living Centers had popped up on his high volatility and high volume lists for several days earlier, suggesting &quot;something is going on&quot;.  </p>
<p>One trader added that Living Centers had long been a subject of takeover talk on an on-and-off-basis, and was not surprised that a deal finally materialized.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it was just a matter of time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Options traders said investors were mostly exiting positions in Living Centers options, taking profits from the calls, which were most active.  </p>
<p>Under the deal, Living Centers shareholders would receive $40.50 a share in cash for 93 percent of Living Center's outstanding common stock and retain the remaining 7.0 percent under a recapitalization plan.</p>
<p>After the recapitalization, each outstanding share of GranCare would be exchanged for 0.2469 shares of the recapitalized Living Centers, the companies said.</p>
<p>The merger, which was valued at $1.8 billion, would create the second largest long term care provider in the U.S.  </p>
<p>In afternoon activity and after an intraday trading halt, Living Centers was up 1-5/8 at 38-1/8 on about 1.75 million shares.</p>
<p>GranCare rose 1-3/8 to 9-1/8 on turnover of roughly 865,000 shares.</p>
<p>The options industry source said the complexity of the deal was keeping some would-be investors sidelined.</p>
<p>&quot;People are holding back waiting to see what the real story is because it's a very complex deal,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The Living Centers May 35 call was most active, with 1,185 contracts changing hands. The option, which was up 13/16 at 3-1/4, had open interest of 2,482. Open interest declined by 171 contracts from Wednesday.</p>
<p>Other active Living Center options included the May 35 put, with volume of 200 contracts. The May 30, 40, June 35 and August 35 calls each traded fewer than 200 contracts.</p>
<p>No GranCare options traded by afternoon.</p>
