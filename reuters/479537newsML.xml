<p>The Pakistani cabinet has decided to move a constitutional amendment to curb presidential powers to sack a prime minister and parliament and appoint armed forces chiefs, a government statement said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It said the cabinet took the decision late on Monday after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in a televised broadcast that his party and its allies had decided to restore the supremacy of parliament.  </p>
<p>The cabinet meeting decided to introduce the constitutional changes through a constitutional amendment bill to be introduced in parliament, the statement said.</p>
<p>It did not say when the bill would be moved in parliament. But political sources said Sharif would move quickly as both houses of parliament, the National Assembly (lower house) and Senate (upper house) are in session.</p>
<p>Under the proposed amendments, dissolution of the National Assembly (lower house) and consequential sacking of a prime minister, appointment of armed forces chiefs and provincial governors by the president would be subject to a mandatory advice from the prime minister.</p>
<p>The amendments are certain to be approved as Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League and its allies hold two-thirds of parliament.</p>
