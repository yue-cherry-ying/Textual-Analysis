<headline>Advanced Micro to unveil K6 chip, take on Intel.</headline>

<p>Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  on Wednesday will unveil its K6 microprocessor, a long-awaited computer chip that could be a formidible rival to chips from industry giant Intel Corp.</p>
<p>The K6 is the most important product launch for AMD in years, company executives said.</p>
<p>The K6 can crunch numbers, animate graphics and play video games slightly faster than Intel's top-of-the-line Pentium Pro, AMD executives claim. It also will sell for at least 25 percent less than Intel's rival chips.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first time in our corporate history that we will have a contemporaneous product for the mainstream that is equivalent to Intel's mainstream product in performance,&quot; said Ben Anixter, AMD vice president of corporate affairs.</p>
<p>By offering a microprocessor that works as well as an Intel chip, AMD will have more chances to land PC manufacturers as customers, Anixter said.</p>
<p>Investors are hoping the same thing. Since AMD demonstrated the chip for the first time to industry executives in November, its stock has more than doubled from about $18. On Tuesday, AMD shares fell $1.875 to $39.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>AMD could ship between two million to four million K6 chips in 1997, said Tony Massimini, analyst at market researcher Semico Research Corp. in Phoenix.</p>
<p>Based on demand for the new chip, AMD's revenue from microprocessor sales could rise more than three-fold to $1.1 billion in 1997, compared with $340 million in 1996, estimated Mark Edelstone, at brokerage Prudential Securities in New York.</p>
<p>At least one major PC maker is expected to announce plans Wednesday to make machines based on AMD's K6, analysts said.</p>
<p>Intel spokesman Howard High said Intel has not yet had a chance to inspect the K6. While he would not be surprised if the K6 does well on everyday calculations, he said he expects the chip to &quot;fall short&quot; in high-end graphics applications.</p>
