<p>A decision to close the Panathinaikon stadium on Saturday to spectators hoping to watch the finish of the world women's marathon was not made for security reasons, Greek under-secretary for Sport Andreas Fouras said.</p>
<p>Earlier officials from the IAAF, athletics governing body, said they had been told spectators would not be admitted for security reasons after the explosion which destroyed part of Stockholm's Olympic stadium on Friday.</p>
<p>Both Athens and Stockholm are bidding to host the 2004 Olympics.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision of the mayor was for the people of Athens to welcome the runners at the entrance of the stadium so to honour the athletes more,&quot; Fouras said. &quot;There were no rumours, thoughts or suspicions of security matters and the stadium was not closed for security reasons.&quot;</p>
<p>Athens mayor Dimitris Avramopoulo added: &quot;It's not true that the stadium was closed for security reasons.  Athens is a safe city.&quot;</p>
<p>In a statement later on Saturday the IAAF said the local organising committee had informed the world governing body that the closure was not related to security.</p>
<p>&quot;A decision was taken to forbid entry to the Panathinaikon stadium in Athens for the arrival of the women's marathon event this morning by the mayor of Athens,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite various rumours regarding this decision, the local organising committee has informed the IAAF that the closure was not related to concerns about security.&quot;</p>
<p>The Stockholm bomb followed a series of arson attacks which Swedish media have linked to opponents of the city's bid for the 2004 Games.</p>
