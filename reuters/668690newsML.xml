<p>The port of Rouen was operating normally despite freak floods which killed four people in the northern French city overnight, port officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Flooding was localised and while roads were disrupted for several hours deliveries were not affected, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no problems here at all but in the centre of town things were very bad indeed,&quot; said another official at the port, which is the largest European outlet for grain.</p>
<p>A 28-year-old woman and her two children aged three and seven were swept away by a mudslide near their home in the Rouen suburb of La Vaupaliere overnight, officials said earlier.</p>
<p>A motorist was killed in an accident in the city centre, blamed on poor visibility due to torrential rain.</p>
<p>Roofs, trees and cars were damaged in the downpour and several dozen individuals were evacuated from their homes by helicopter during the night.</p>
<p>The rail line from Paris to the port city of Le Havre was out of service during the night but had resumed operation by the morning, state railway company SNCF said.</p>
