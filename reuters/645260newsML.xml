<headline>Taiwan, South Africa talk reaches some concensus.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-06-07</dateline>

<p>Taiwan said on Saturday it had reached consensus with South Africa on certain issues in a third round of talks to negotiate their future relations after Pretoria switches ties to the island's rival China later this year.</p>
<p>A foreign ministry statement said the talks were held in Taipei on Friday and Saturday between South Africa's deputy foreign minister Aziz Pahad and Taiwan's deputy foreign minister C. J. Chen.</p>
<p>Taipei said further talks were due.</p>
<p>&quot;Both sides reached consensus on certain issues and agreed that discussions on other aspects will be continued,&quot; the statement</p>
<p>It did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Taiwan has repeatedly said it hopes to maintain high-level contacts with South Africa after Pretoria and Beijing normalise ties.</p>
<p>President Nelson Mandela said in November 1996 that Pretoria would cut diplomatic ties with Nationalist-ruled Taiwan and recognise the island's communist rival by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Taipei responded by postponing all aid projects and treaties.</p>
<p>Taiwan's foreign minister John Chang recently said the island would consider resuming suspended economic cooperation programmes and direct flights after the sides reach agreement on the nature of bilateral ties.</p>
<p>South Africa is the largest of only 30 countries -- mostly underdeveloped states in central America and Africa -- that recognise Taiwan's exiled Republic of China government rather than the communist mainland's People's Republic.</p>
<p>Beijing, which has viewed Taiwan as a renegade province since a civil war split them in 1949, insists the island is ineligible for foreign ties and has tightened a diplomatic squeeze on Taipei in its quest to bring Taiwan under mainland rule.</p>
