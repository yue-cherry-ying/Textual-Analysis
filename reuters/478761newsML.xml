<p>Benchmark Mexican peso contracts closed unchanged after seesawing through the session on Tuesday in parallel with changes in U.S. long bond yields and losses posted by the local stock market, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market zigzagged somewhat within a narrow trading range,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate both closed unchanged at 7.9120/7.9140 and 7.9090/7.9110 per dollar respectively.</p>
<p>Same-day peso contracts had earlier closed 2.3 centavos firmer at 7.8980/7.9030 per dollar.  </p>
<p>U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds were up 6/32 to yield 7.08 percent as the foreign exchange markets were closing in Mexico, after being down 5/32 in early trade to yield 7.12 percent.</p>
<p>The leading IPC index of Mexican share prices was meanwhile down 1.58 percent at 3,688.74 points.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel the market is still long on dollars, and I think it will stay that way while the bourse is still on the downside,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the peso could trade on Wednesday at similar levels to those notched up during Tuesday's session if rates increased at the central bank's primary auction to be held later in the day.</p>
<p>Money market traders surveyed by Reuters revealed they forecast Banco de Mexico would assign bellwether 27-day Cetes at an average rate of 21.22 percent.  This would be a gain of 63 basis points since last week's auction.</p>
<p>Auction results are due out at 1830 local time/0030 GMT.</p>
