<headline>Lawyers ask military court to throw out sex case.</headline>

<p>The lawyer for an Army sergeant charged with rape urged a military court Tuesday to throw out his case because of what they said was undue influence by top military officials.</p>
<p>&quot;It would send a message to the Army leaders that there is a process and you have violated it,&quot; Maj. Mike Sawyers said in the second day of pre-trial hearings in the case of Staff Sgt. Delmar Simpson.</p>
<p>Simpson, whose trial is scheduled to begin April 7, is charged with raping 10 women and with dozens of other counts of misconduct including forcible sodomy and battery. The charges involve 28 women. He has not entered a plea.</p>
<p>He would be the first of 10 soldiers charged with sexual misconduct at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground to go to trial.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, Army Trial Judge Col. Paul Johnston rejected a request by Simpson's attorneys to question top military officials such as Army Secretary Togo West and Chief of Staff Dennis Reimer about their public comments on the case.</p>
<p>After Tuesday's session, the pretrial hearing was recessed until Thursday.</p>
<p>Simpson's attorneys have also asked that charges against him be dismissed due to heavy pre-trial publicity, excess influence by higher-ups on the case, and lack of a speedy trial.</p>
<p>&quot;What we're trying to do is show an atmophere of undue influence,&quot; Sawyers said. He said denial of the interviews could be a ground for appeal if Simpson is convicted.</p>
<p>Simpson's attorneys have been seeking to show that public comments by West and others in disclosing the sexual harassment scandal at Aberdeen last November prejudiced the case and placed undue pressure on the investigation.</p>
<p>West and others condemned the alleged acts, called for &quot;zero tolerance&quot; of harassment and pledged an aggressive probe.</p>
<p>The Army's investigation at Aberdeen has been clouded by charges that investigators tried to coerce witnesses into making false allegations of rape and that the probe has unfairly targeted African American soldiers.</p>
<p>Sawyers said the comments by West and others reflected an excess concern with protecting the Army's reputation from the type of damage caused by the Navy's 1991 Tailhook sexual harassment scandal.</p>
<p>But Maj. Gen. John Longhouser, commander of the proving ground, denied in testimony that the Army's concern with sexual harassment had unduly influenced the investigation.</p>
<p>The Army's prosecutor, Capt. Theresa Gallagher, told the court that publicity in the case made no difference in the decision to press charges against Simpson.</p>
<p>Of the 10 soldiers charged, four cases have been resolved, although none were convicted of forcible sex and one was cleared of rape charges. Punishments have ranged from four months in prison to dismissal from the service. One soldier has appealed his conviction.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems as if the Army needs someone to hang a rape charge on,&quot; said Simpson's civilian attorney, Frank Spinner.</p>
