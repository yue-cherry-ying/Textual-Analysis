<p>Winnie Madikizela-Mandela is selling bottles of soil for 50 rand ($11) from the house she shared with her former husband President Nelson Mandela in the 1950s, a South African newspaper said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Sunday Times said each bottle came with a certificate of authenticity signed by Madikizela-Mandela and a history of the house in Africa's biggest township Soweto.</p>
<p>The former deputy minister, who was sacked from the position by her then husband in 1995, has turned the garage of her old home -- in the same neighbourhood as that of Truth Commission chairman Desmond Tutu -- into a thriving tourist attraction.</p>
<p>Traditional African ornaments such as necklaces, sculptures and masks are also on sale for up to 50 rand.</p>
<p>Zebeth Hlophe, who runs the attraction, told the Sunday Times about 100 people visited every day and that guided tours of the house, including the old bedroom of the president -- whom she divorced last year -- would probably start in June.</p>
<p>($= 4.45 rand)</p>
