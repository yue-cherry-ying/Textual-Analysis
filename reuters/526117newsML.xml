<p>Telefonica de Espana SA's chairman said negotiations with former partner Unisource would end soon now that the telecommunication firm had allied with British Telecommunications Plc and U.S.-based MCI Communications Corp .</p>
<p>In a interview published in El Pais on Monday, chairman Juan Villalonga said talks with Unisource are likely to end soon.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll start negotiations and since we have a good relationship there will be a deal soon. We'll recover the data transmission firm we brought (valued around 65 billion pesetas) and we'll have to sell Unisource's shares,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Telefonica also responded to critics of the deal, who said the company seemed to have surrendered to bigger competitors.</p>
<p>&quot;This alliance is an opportunity and not a threat,&quot; Villalonga told the newspaper.</p>
<p>He stressed that the deal did not entail a merger.</p>
<p>Last Friday, Telefonica said it had formed a global telecommunications alliance with BT and MCI to create one of the world's top five telecoms operators.</p>
<p>That was considered Telefonica's first step out of its previous international alliance, the Unisource group.</p>
<p>On Saturday, El Pais, commenting on the shift in alliances, said: &quot;It could be said Telefonica has changed from being the head of the mouse to being the tail of a lion&quot;.</p>
<p>And in this morning's interview, Villalonga said &quot;We were not a mouse's head before and now we are not the lion's tail, because this is a alliance and not a merger.&quot;</p>
<p>Financial daily Cinco Dias said on Monday that this alliance made Telefonica English.</p>
<p>&quot;For Telefonica the British alliance is to rule out a frightening competitor in the domestic market and to find a strong ally outside home,&quot; the daily wrote.</p>
<p>Villalonga said in the interview that pressure from competitors was forcing the deal.</p>
<p>&quot;The unstoppable globalisation process in the telecommunications forced us to change our strategic view. We needed a very strong ally, with knowledge and financial strength to help us to get stronger in the Spanish speaking market,&quot; Villalonga added.</p>
<p>Unisource has been jointly owned by four European telephone companies: Telefonica, Koninklijke PTT Nederland NV , Telia of Sweden and Swiss Telecom.</p>
