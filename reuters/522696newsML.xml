<p>Cambodian strongman Hun Sen said on Friday that dissident royalists had given him an outright majority in parliament.</p>
<p>Hun Sen is second prime minister in an awkward partnership set up after a U.N.-managed election in 1993 that was intended to make political peace after more than two decades of civil war.</p>
<p>He shares Cambodia's divided government power with First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who now faces a split in his FUNCINPEC royalist party.</p>
<p>Hun Sen, whose Cambodian People's Party and allies control 56 votes in the 120-seat national assembly, told reporters on Saturday that 12 of FUNCINPEC's 58 members of parliament had now split with Ranariddh.</p>
<p>He pledged to oppose any attempt to remove the dissidents from government and political posts, offering them political backing, financial assistance and protection. &quot;They (Ranariddh's supporters) should not forget we (the CPP) have 51 seats in the national assembly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hun Sen denied Ranariddh's charges he had engineered the rift but said his party had the right to agree with the prince's critics. &quot;It is not a coup d'etat, it's just a split in a party in which the other side has received the support of CPP,&quot; he said</p>
<p>He said the that CPP could now count on a parliamentary majority but did not want to remove Prince Ranariddh as co-premier.</p>
<p>A CPP statement gave the names of only 11 defecting royalist MPs, including Ung Phan, a minister of state who announced the split on Tuesday by rejecting Ranariddh's leadership and blaming him for the dismal coalition relations.</p>
<p>The dissident royalists could give the CPP the votes it needs to pass legislation but it would still be short of the two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution, dismiss senior government officials and lift the immunity of MPs.</p>
<p>The next session of parliament was due to open on Monday but has been postponed .</p>
<p>Hun Sen said the differences between the parties should not disturb the work of government and &quot;I don't believe this tension could lead to bloodshed.&quot;</p>
<p>The dissidents plan to hold a congress soon to challenge Ranariddh's leadership. The FUNCINPEC steering committee on Friday expelled Ung Phan and four party officials.</p>
