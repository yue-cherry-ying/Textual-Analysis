<p>Sri Lanka's coastline is losing up to 300,000 square metres (yards) annually to erosion, most critically along a 1,680 km (1,050 miles) tourist strip in the southwest, a government official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Between 150,000 and 300,000 square metres, predominantly in the southwest sector, is being lost annually,&quot; Nissanka Perera, director of the Coast Conservation Department, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;This is due to natural erosion and man-made factors.&quot;</p>
<p>Fifty-five percent of the beaches south of the capital Colombo are severely threatened by erosion, he said.</p>
<p>This is caused largely by the reef being depleted through coral mining, with as many as 18,000 tonnes excavated annually, Perera said.</p>
<p>Coral, used locally in construction, acts as a natural barrier against erosion and is vital to the support of marine-life.</p>
<p>&quot;Coral reef is primarily required for the existence of the coastal eco-system,&quot; Perera said.</p>
<p>&quot;Reefs also provide natural barriers against erosion, especially during the monsoon seasons,&quot; he added. &quot;With the removal of reef, that protection is removed and so waves break a lot closer to the shore.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the conservationist, the long-term solution to the problem was to import sand to affected areas of coastline.</p>
<p>But since sand-mining of riverbeds was quickly reaching saturation -- at such a rate that river-beds were already dropping below sea-levels -- the only sound option was to pump sand in from beyond the reefs.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have to supplement the sand on the beaches by pumping more in from off-shore areas, except that is costly,&quot; Perera said.</p>
<p>His department's 1997 budget was limited to 40 million rupees ($690,000), he said, adding that a 1987 Danish-funded initiative to pump sand into the Negombo area, north of Colombo, cost 155 million rupees. ($1 = 58 rupees)</p>
