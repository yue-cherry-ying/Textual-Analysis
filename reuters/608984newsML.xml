<p>Argentine President Carlos Menem on Friday defended tough police action against roadblocks by unemployed sugar workers in the poor northwestern province of Jujuy, calling the protests &quot;clearly criminal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone knows we're not afraid of strikes or protests. This is not a matter of repression for repression's sake, but simply of keeping order as the law requires,&quot; the Peronist leader said in comments released to the media on Friday.</p>
<p>The sight of helmeted and masked paramilitary gendarmes charging impoverished Jujuy shanty-dwellers with truncheons, teargas and rubber bullets earlier this week, with up to 140 people injured, sparked nationwide protests.</p>
<p>The violence in Jujuy coincided with rioting by street hawkers and students in the city of La Plata near Buenos Aires on Wednesday, which also met with a heavy response from the police. Senior La Plata policemen were fired the next day.</p>
<p>State workers and students in the provincial capital of Jujuy held a one-day strike on Friday, after protests on Thursday night in which local government offices were stoned. Students in Buenos Aires also came out on the streets in protest, and brought rush-hour traffic to a standstill late on Thursday.</p>
<p>The police withdrew from National Highway 34 overnight and the road was clear around the town of General San Martin.</p>
<p>But jobless people at another poor Jujuy town, San Pedro, blocked the same road to protest at unemployment in their town of 37 percent -- compared to 17 percent nationwide.</p>
<p>Far away in the central province of Cordoba, out-of-work olive and cotton industry workers in the town of Cruz del Eje called off a roadblock planned for Tuesday after government promises of tax breaks, job programmes and free cottonseeds.</p>
<p>Menem's Chief of Staff Alberto Kohan told reporters that the Cruz del Eje agreement was possible &quot;because the people there understood that you have to try sending petitions before carrying out roadblocks.&quot;</p>
<p>Picketing national highways has become a favoured method of protest in past months, from the southern reaches of Patagonia to the northwestern deserts of Salta and Jujuy.</p>
<p>The violence is a barometer of discontent in a country where, despite macroeconomic successes such as zero inflation and solid growth, unemployment has risen to more than 17 percent from just 6 percent when Menem came to power in 1989.</p>
<p>Even the International Monetary Fund's Michel Camdessus, a fan of Menem's economic reforms, warned Argentina this week that neglecting the poor and jobless would mean trouble.</p>
<p>Jujuy's Catholic Bishop Marcelo Palentini, who mediated to get Highway 34 cleared and the gendarmes out, agreed that stopping the traffic was not the best way to protest.</p>
<p>&quot;It's wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;But the underlying demand of the unemployed is right, since they have tried for a long time to find a peaceful way out.&quot;</p>
