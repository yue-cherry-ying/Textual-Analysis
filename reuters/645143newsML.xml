<p>Belgium scored five times before the break to rout minnows San Marino 6-0 in their World Cup qualifier on Saturday and close the gap on European group seven leaders The Netherlands.</p>
<p>Arch-rivals Belgium and the Netherlands now both have 15 points from six matches although the Dutch are still ahead on goal difference.</p>
<p>The two neighbouring countries face each other next in the Netherlands in September.</p>
<p>Belgium, brimming with confidence after two successive away wins against Wales and Turkey in recent months, quickly stamped their authority on the match and could already have been 4-0 up when midfielder Lorenzo Staelens opened the scoring in the 16th minute.</p>
<p>Belgium, finalists in the past four World Cups, added four more goals before the break against the part-timers from San Marino whose five-man defence was constantly ripped open by mercurial Belgian strikers Luis Oliveira and Lokonda Mpenza.</p>
<p>Mpenza scored twice, Fiorentina's Oliveira once and libero Eric Van Meir also netted before the break.</p>
<p>Belgium, who often struggled in the past to topple weaker opponents, found it difficult to get back into their stride after the interval and had to wait until five minutes from time before Staelens added the sixth goal.</p>
<p>San Marino, who were not a force to be reckoned with in the first hour of play, repeatedly ventured into the opposition half in the last 30 minutes but never posed a real threat for local goalkeeper Filip De Wilde.</p>
