<p>Ousted Burundian President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya ended a year of &quot;exile&quot; on Saturday with a call for a negotiated settlement involving all parties to the conflict in his tiny and volatile central African state.</p>
<p>Ntibantunganya left the U.S. embassy in Bujumbura on Saturday after taking refuge there almost a year ago. Earlier, he held talks with the man who replaced him, moderate Tutsi President Pierre Buyoya, in the presence of Catholic bishops.</p>
<p>He said he would not contest Buyoya's claim to the presidency.</p>
<p>&quot;I reaffirm that I shall not yield on the principle for a search for a negotiated solution for all problems that face our country. This approach must be guarded by tolerance, mutual respect and a strong resolve to save a nation more than ever confronted by numerous uncertainties,&quot; he told a news conference at his new residence.</p>
<p>Ntibantunganya, 41, was Burundi's third civilian president at the time he was toppled. Burundi's first fairly elected head of state, Melchior Ndadaye, was killed in 1993 by hardliners in the army, which is 95 percent composed of the Tutsi minority.</p>
<p>Ndadaye's killing sparked a frenzy of revenge massacres by his Hutu tribe, a vast majority in a six million population but excluded from power since independence from Belgium in 1962.</p>
<p>Ndadaye's successor, Cyprien Ntaryamira, was killed in April 1994 with Rwandan president Juvenal Habyarimana.</p>
<p>Ntibantunganya said he wanted the talks to end Burundi's crisis to protect against &quot;selfishness, arrogance and contempt by parties that wanted to impose their views on Burundi&quot;.</p>
<p>Ntibantunganya would not say whether he had been asked to help in negotiations with the main ethnic Hutu CNDD party, which began direct talks with Buyoya's government last month.</p>
<p>Ntibantunganya said he would tell Burundians and regional leaders in the coming days how he planned to help rebuild the country &quot;after examining how the country is governed&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I will tell them how I plan to work to rekindle their hope for peace, how we will emerge from the very serious challenge of history in which our nation finds itself,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Buyoya announced this month his government had signed a pre-ceasefire agreement with the rebel Hutu National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), after direct talks in Rome.</p>
