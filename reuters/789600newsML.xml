<p>The All Blacks overwhelmed the Springboks 55-35 in a hard-fought test match at Eden Park on Saturday, claiming their win by a record margin with a rollicking display of rugby.</p>
<p>In an action-packed game played at immense pace, New Zealand outscored the South Africans by seven tries to five to tighten their grasp on the Tri-Nations championship.</p>
<p>It was the highest score an All Black side has ever posted against South Africa and the largest winning margin.</p>
<p>&quot;It was an important psychological blow for the All Blacks,&quot; coach John Hart said after the match. &quot;To score 55 points against South Africa is a special day for New Zealand.&quot;</p>
<p>But it was the underdog Springboks who drew first blood when, just two minutes into the game, they engineered a powerful rolling maul to send Ruben Kruger in for the first try.</p>
<p>Moments later the storming Springbok flanker was almost in for a second time. But Kruger was felled just short of the line and, in the first of two telling blows for the South Africans, fractured an ankle attempting to evade the tackle.</p>
<p>New Zealand hit back immediately. Centre Frank Bunce, playing his 50th test, burst through the midfield to set up a try for Alama Ieremia.</p>
<p>The lead changed hands regularly in the first half as the teams vied for dominance in a blistering, often violent, encounter. The tension was palpable and punches were traded on several occasions.</p>
<p>With three tries apiece there was little between them at the break, the All Blacks leading 23-21.</p>
<p>Two penalties early in the second spell widened the home side's lead, but it was a red card offence by South African loose forward Andre Venter that swung the match decisively in New Zealand's favour.</p>
<p>Venter was sent off 10 minutes into the half for stomping on All Black captain Sean Fitzpatrick's face while he was on the ground in a ruck. A judicial hearing into the incident is to be held on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Springboks were forced to play the remaining 30 minutes with only 14 men, and the All Blacks took full advantage, piercing their weakened opponents' defence to score four more tries.</p>
<p>The landslide was sparked by a try from scrumhalf Justin Marshall, who crashed over the line after flanker Josh Kronfeld burst through a gap.</p>
<p>The All Blacks were beginning to enjoy the game, throwing the ball wide for their backs to attack. Victory was put beyond all doubt when flying fullback Christian Cullen completed a deft midfield manoeuvre, dancing through two tackles for his second try.</p>
<p>The Springboks staged a spirited rally as fulltime neared, crossing twice, but their fate had already been sealed.</p>
<p>A disappointed Springbok captain Gary Teichmann, who played an outstanding game, said his team had buckled under the All Black pressure after Venter was sent off.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought at halftime we were in with a chance. Unfortunately, you've got to play this game for 80 minutes and in the second half we just went astray,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The win puts the All Blacks firmly in control of the Tri-Nations series and only Australia, who play New Zealand next Saturday in at Dunedin, have any chance of wresting the championship from them.</p>
