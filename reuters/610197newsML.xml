<p>The head of Belgian insurance company AXA-Belgium, a unit of France's AXA-UAP, dismissed on Friday speculation a major shake up in the Belgian insurance sector would be announced next week.</p>
<p>&quot;I know there are lots of rumours in the market and the press at the moment, that we (AXA Belgium) or Royale Belge will be sold, but it's all crazy. Everything is pure speculation. There's nothing behind it,&quot; AXA Belgium chief executive officer Patrick de Courcel told Reuters in a telephone interview after the company's annual meeting.  </p>
<p>The newly combined AXA-UAP has been expected to make an announcement on the future of its Belgian units -- AXA Belgium and Royale Belge -- any day.</p>
<p>Le Monde newspaper reported on Friday that it would be announced at Royale Belge's annual general meeting on May 28 that Royale Belge would be sold.</p>
<p>Previously, both AXA Belgium and Royale Belge have said that, following their parent companies' mergers, they were studying whether it would be possible to combine their operations in the Benelux and that an announcement would be made before the summer.  </p>
<p>&quot;No decision has yet been taken about (the future),&quot; de Courcel said. &quot;One day we will take a decision, but today there's nothing. I do not think there will be any decision taken for some weeks, at least that's my personal view.&quot;</p>
<p>Royale Belge's shares rose nearly six percent to a new record high of 10,250 francs on Friday as speculation mounted the group could be sold. Swiss insurance company Winterthur denied it was a possible buyer. Dutch financial services group ING, cited as another possible, declined to comment.</p>
<p>ING's Belgian insurance arm La Patriotique also declined to comment.</p>
<p>Separately, de Courcel said AXA Belgium had no plans to use a new Belgian law to squeeze out its minority shareholders.</p>
<p>AXA Belgium is now only 0.3 percent held by the public following a public offer last year to shareholders to exchange their stakes for interests in the French parent group.</p>
