<title>USA: U.S. mortgage-backeds creep higher with T-bonds.</title>
<headline>U.S. mortgage-backeds creep higher with T-bonds.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>U.S. mortgage-backed securities held on to modest gains near the end of a quiet Tuesday session.</p>
<p>Overall, yield spreads to Treasuries were unchanged to slightly wider, traders said. And volume was relatively thin.</p>
<p>Among key coupons, Ginnie Mae 30-year 8.0 percent paper rose 3/32 to 100-19/32 bid, yielding 120 basis points over the five-year Treasury note.</p>
<p>Comparable Fannie Mae current coupons were up 3/32 at 100-18/32 bid, while Freddie Mac paper rose 4/32 to 100-25/32 bid.  </p>
<p>The five-year Treasury note was up 5/32 at 99-19/32 bid to yield 6.72 percent, while the 10-year Treasury note was 7/32 higher, to yield 6.88 percent.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, traders said market fears of higher interest rates will flatten the Treasury yield curve, generating more volatility and wider spreads in mortgages.</p>
<p>&quot;Volatility should be bad for mortgages,&quot; said one trader in New York. &quot;I think if you look at it, the yield curve should flatten and mortgages should widen,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The trader said overall pass-through prices are expensive, adding that they &quot;have come too far too fast.&quot;  </p>
<p>Another market participant said he had witnessed numerous odd-lot paper exchanging hands. &quot;Other than that, it's been quiet,&quot; he said.</p>
