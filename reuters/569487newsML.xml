<p>Blue-chip stocks and bonds rebounded Thursday as Wall Street welcomed plans to lower the capital gains tax rate.</p>
<p>The dollar fell for the third day in a row, to its lowest level in a month against the German mark and Japanese yen, amid concerns that central banks would sell dollars to halt its two-year-old rally.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average was up 50.97 points at 7,136.62 as it recaptured part of Wednesday's 140-point plunge. At one time, the blue-chip index was up nearly 130 points before profit-taking trimmed the gain.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,403 to 1,097 on heavy volume of 534 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The market's bounce went against conventional wisdom that news of a proposal to make a capital gains tax cut effective as of Wednesday would unleash a wave of pent-up selling on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It was definitely a shock,&quot; Jay Meagrow, institutional trader at McDonald &amp; Co. said of the market's action on Thursday. &quot;I didn't see it coming.&quot;</p>
<p>After the stock market closed Wednesday, the Republican chairmen of the congressional tax-writing committees said they would propose setting May 7, as the effective date for a capital gains tax.</p>
<p>The tax cut would allow investors to keep more of their profits when they sell stocks.</p>
<p>But lightening the capital gains tax burden also makes investing in stocks more attractive, a view that held the day Thursday, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand for stocks seems to be the dominant factor,&quot; said Robert Stovall, president Stovall/Twenty-First.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index rose 7.92 points to 1,330.83.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000 face value, lowering its yield to 6.94 percent from 6.96 percent on Wednesday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to its lowest level in a month against the mark and yen as concerns grew that central banks would sell dollars to halt its two-year-old rally.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to 123.75 yen in late New York trading from 125.08 late on Wednesday, and it lost more than a pfennig against the mark to 1.7085 from 1.7195.</p>
<p>Precious metals prices gained, with gold for June delivery on the COMEX in New York closing up $2.40 an ounce at $344.80.</p>
<p>The strength of the dollar against yen in particular has been partly to blame for gold's slide to four-year lows earlier this year.</p>
<p>A rally in gasoline prices tied to rumours of production problems at southern refineries and signs that OPEC might tighten its exports combined to push oil prices higher.</p>
<p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for June delivery closed 72 cents higher at $20.34 a barrel. June gasoline rose 1.58 cents a gallon to close at 62.50 cents and June heating oil rose 1.30 cents a gallon to 54.38.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's leading FTSE 100 index closed up 42.9 at a record high of 4,580.4 after being down around 20 points at its worst. In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average was 12.91 points higher at 20,061.81.</p>
