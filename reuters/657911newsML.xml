<text>
<p>At least 174 forest fires were raging in the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba on Wednesday fueled by brisk winds and hot, dry weather.</p>
<p>Government officials said 111 fires were burning in several parts of Quebec including the timber and mining region in the northwest and in areas along the north and south shores of the St. Lawrence River. As a precaution, timber harvesting operations were halted on Monday in most Quebec regions.</p>
<p>More than 1,600 people were evacuated from two villages menaced by smoke and flames in the northern part of the French-speaking province. In northwestern Quebec, 300 people from the village of Val Paradis, about 60 miles (100 km) north of Rouyn-Noranda, were evacuated as flames approached.</p>
<p>About 800 native Indians were evacuated from the Weymontachie reserve in the Haute-Mauricie region 186 miles (300 km) northeast of Montreal, while 500 others were evacuated from surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Officials in Maine and New Hampshire warned motorists of forest fire smoke drifting down from Quebec and New Brunswick.</p>
<p>Ontario officials said 45 forest fires were burning in the northeastern part of that province, mainly south of Timmins, a town threatened by fires just two weeks earlier.</p>
<p>In Manitoba, 18 forest fires were reported.</p>
