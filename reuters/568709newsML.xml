<p>The Italian Open women's tournament was hit by rain on Thursday with the opening third round matches delayed for nearly five hours and then interrupted after just under an hour of play due to further showers.</p>
<p>Spain's Conchita Martinez, the third seed and winner at the Foro Italico clay court tournament for a record four successive seasons, was leading 12th seeded Russian Elena Likhovtseva 6-2 2-0 when the rain interrupted their match.</p>
<p>The matches had been due to start at 1100 GMT but the rain pushed them back to 1545 GMT.</p>
<p>Compatriot Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the second seed in search of her first title this year, had won her first set against 13th seeded Belgian Sabine Appelmans 6-3.</p>
<p>The rain began to fall just as their second set started with play at 30-30, sending both women running for cover.</p>
<p>Top seed Monica Seles was due to play France's 10th seed Mary Pierce on centre court after Sanchez Vicario.</p>
