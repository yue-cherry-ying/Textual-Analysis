<p>World swimming's governing body said on Friday it wanted women's water polo included in the 2000 Sydney Olympics.</p>
<p>The International Amateur Swimming Federation (FINA), however, insisted Sydney Games organisers would have to raise their quota of participants by at least 120 athletes before the women's team event was admitted to the Olympic fold.</p>
<p>FINA said in a statement it had proposed to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that women's water polo and marathon swimming be added to the Olympic programme and the synchronised swimming duet event be restored.</p>
<p>The Olympics have grown to enormous proportions over the years and limits are imposed to prevent the numbers from getting out of hand.</p>
<p>Women's water polo, FINA's top priority for inclusion in the Olympic programme, has been part of the world championships since 1986.</p>
<p>Men's and women's  25-kilometre long-distance open-water events were introduced at the 1991 world championships. Five-kilometre races will be added at next January's world championships in Perth, Australia.</p>
<p>Synchronised swimming entered the Olympic programme at the 1984 Los Angeles Games with the solo and duet events. They were replaced by a team event at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.</p>
