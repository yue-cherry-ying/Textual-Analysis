<p>Slovakia, facing serious foreign trade problems, will soon impose a 7.0 percent import surcharge on all goods except raw materials, the finance ministry said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The surcharge should become valid in the near future,&quot; Finance Ministry spokesman Jozef Mach told Reuters. &quot;It has to be published in the official collection of laws, and we think it could become effective from August,&quot; Mach said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Slovakia should be able to defend the surcharge plans in world economic institutions, as the measure should be a more acceptable way to regulate the inflow of goods than often-criticised mandatory deposits currently in place.</p>
<p>The surcharge will be cut to 5.0 percent of the declared value of the imported goods from the beginning of next year, and lowered to 3.0 percent from July 1998. It should be abolished on January 1, 1999, Mach said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will have to present the surcharge at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), but we think the chance is pretty high that we'll be able to defend it successfully,&quot; said Mach.</p>
<p>Slovakia has long been fighting a ballooning trade deficit and governemnt officials have said Bratislava would introduce an import surcharge to help reverse trade problems.</p>
<p>The trade deficit widened to 29.859 billion crowns for the January-May period of 1997, from 27.908 billion crowns in the first four months of the year.</p>
<p>The trade shortfall has been fuelling a burgeoning current account deficit, which totalled $479 million in the first quarter of 1997 making the Slovak crown vulnerable to speculative downward pressure.</p>
<p>The central bank (NBS) successfully defended the crown during an attack on the currency in May and June, but analysts have said Slovakia's weakeness in foreign trade makes its currency still a target.</p>
<p>Mach said the planned surcharge should affect some 80 percent of all Slovak imports.</p>
<p>Slovakia canceled its first import surcharge, imposed in 1994, in January this year after fierce criticism from the European Union and the WTO.</p>
<p>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has said cancelation of the surcharge was one of the main conditions for Slovakia's membership in the organisation, which Bratislava hopes to achieve by the end of this year.</p>
<p>In an attempt to curb the trade deficit, Bratislava introduced import deposits last May, requiring importers to place an equivalent of 20 percent of their imports on an interest-free accounts for six months.</p>
<p>The Slovak government has said that the European Union had demanded the abolition of the import deposit measure arguing that it would rather accept an import surcharge.</p>
<p>&quot;(But) it is now more matter of defending the surcharge at the WTO than at the EU,&quot; said Mach.</p>
<p>He did not say when the government planned to abolish the deposit system after the surcharge becomes effective.</p>
<p>&quot;We can only say the deposits will be abolished subsequently after the introduction of the surcharge,&quot; Mach said without elaborating further.</p>
