<p>Florida's Supreme Court will hear arguments Friday on a proposed constitutional amendment requiring the state to spend at least 40 percent of its budget on public schools, the court clerk said.</p>
<p>An advocacy group, Coalition to Reclaim Education's Share, must collect at least 435,000 voter signatures to put the proposal on the ballot. It has already collected about 300,000 signatures and verified 150,000 of them.</p>
<p>Citizens for Budget Fairness, an opposition group co-chaired by state Board of Regions Chairman Steve Uhlfelder, has challenged the proposal, arguing that it would intensify a budget battle that pits school children against the poor and elderly.</p>
<p>The opposition group, which includes the Florida Chamber of Commerce and the Florida Retail Federation, has asked the state Supreme Court to keep the proposal off the ballot. They said it violates the constitutional requirement that amendments address a single topic.</p>
<p>The group seeking the amendment said Florida schools and universities have suffered budget cuts since the lottery was adopted in 1986.</p>
<p>The amendment establishing the lottery required that its revenues be used for education enhancement. Instead, lottery money has replaced general fund spending for schools.</p>
<p>Education spending accounted for 40 percent of Florida's budget 10 years ago, but only 33 percent this year.</p>
<p>The proposed new amendment would require that at least 40 percent of state money, excluding federal funds and lottery revenues, be spent on public schools. If it passes, lottery money would still be used for education but would become an enhancement rather than a substitution for general funds.</p>
<p>If it passes, the Legislature would be required to allocate an additional $1.5 billion a year for schools.</p>
