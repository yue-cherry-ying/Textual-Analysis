<p>Jake, an ageing but feisty tomcat, was hailed as a hero on Friday for thwarting a burglary attempt at his mistress' home in San Diego.</p>
<p>The ailing, 18-year-old orange and white feline leaped at the suspect, landed on his shoulder and clawed his back and both arms, San Diego Police Det. James Dixon said.</p>
<p>He said the suspect, Juan Mendoza-Guzman, a Mexican national who had worked as a locksmith, allegedly broke into the apartment of a 33-year-old woman on Thursday night by picking the lock to her door.</p>
<p>When he tried to unhook the video cassette recorder, a watch on top of the VCR began beeping. Apparently fearing the woman would wake up, he crept into her bedroom, Dixon said.</p>
<p>&quot;The next thing he knew, the cat jumped on his right shoulder and scratched him on his lower back and both arms. I'm sure the cat startled the guy and he yelled out,&quot; the detective said.</p>
<p>The suspect's shout awakened the woman, but Mendoza-Guzman put his hand over her mouth and told her not to scream. The victim then bit his finger and screamed loudly, causing the suspect to flee, Dixon said.</p>
<p>Mendoza-Guzman was arrested soon after, given first aid for his scratches and charged with burglary.</p>
<p>Dixon said the woman had asked that her name not be disclosed.</p>
