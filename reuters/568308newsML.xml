<p>Quintiles Transnational Corp said on Thursday it signed a definitive agreement to acquire CerebroVascular Advances Inc, a clinical research company, for about 251,000 shares of Quintiles stock.</p>
<p>The agreement will be recorded as a pooling of interests, Quintiles said in a statement.</p>
<p>Completion of the acquisition, which is subject to CVA shareholder approval, is expected later this year, Quintiles said.</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to be neutral or slightly accretive to Quintiles' 1997 earnings per share, it added.  </p>
<p>CVA, based in San Antonio, Texas, recorded net revenue of $4.5 million and net income of $1.3 million in 1996, Quintiles said.</p>
<p>The company also said that it plans to enter into employment agreements with several members of CVA's management staff, including its president and chief executive David Edwards.</p>
<p>It said a CVA strength was its research into stroke-related drugs.</p>
<p>&quot;With aging populations in many regions of the world, we believe more resources will be devoted to develop drugs to prevent or counteract the debilitating effects of stroke,&quot; said Quintiles chief executive Dennis Gillings.</p>
<p>&quot;CVA has an outstanding record of clinical development in this area,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Quintiles Transnational Corp provides contract research, sales and marketing services to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries.</p>
