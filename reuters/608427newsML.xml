<headline>SOCCER-HODGSON CONFIRMS EARLY EXIT FROM INTER.</headline>
<dateline>MILAN 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Englishman Roy Hodgson on Friday confirmed his decision to resign immediately as coach at beaten UEFA Cup finalists Internazionale Milan, club sources said.</p>
<p>They said Hodgson, who is moving to English club Blackburn next season, had informed Inter chairman Massimo Moratti that he was quitting with two games left in the serie A season.  </p>
<p>Hogdson's place on the bench for Sunday's match at home to Napoli and the game at Bologna on June 1 will be taken by the club's goalkeeping coach, Luciano Castellani.</p>
<p>Those matches will be crucial to Inter's hopes of clinching second place and a European Cup berth.</p>
<p>Although Inter have had a successful season, reaching the UEFA Cup final and staying in the top flight in serie A, Hodgson has not enjoyed a happy relationship with fans, media and senior figures within the club.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, fans pelted him with coins and cigarette lighters as he left the pitch after Inter lost the UEFA Cup final to German club Schalke in a penalty shoot-out at the San Siro stadium.</p>
