<title>USA: AT&amp;T losing 3 executives to McCaw start-up.</title>
<headline>AT&amp;T losing 3 executives to McCaw start-up.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>AT&amp;T Corp. said Thursday that three key executives were leaving its wireless communications business to join a start-up firm that will become a partner with the telecommunications giant in entering local phone markets.</p>
<p>The executives, top managers of AT&amp;T's wireless unit, were leaving to rejoin entrepreneur Craig McCaw, who founded McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. in the 1970s and sold it to AT&amp;T in 1994.</p>
<p>Wayne Perry, Steve Hooper and Gerry Salemme, who helped McCaw found his pioneering mobile phone company, were leaving AT&amp;T to head up his latest venture, OneComm LLC, a company specialising in providing competitive local phone services.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T said the three men will resign effective May 12 but will continue to be available to the company for advice on a range of issues while they develop OneComm.</p>
<p>Analysts said the departures were sure to be a setback for AT&amp;T, which is redefining itself following the enactment of a new communications federal law and the split-off of its high technology and computer manufacturing businesses.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not good for them, but it's not a disaster,&quot; Frank Governali, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Having some of the top talent in the organisation leaving is a part of the difficult period that AT&amp;T is going through,&quot; Guy Woodlief, a Prudential Securities analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;It's another in a long series of blows to AT&amp;T,&quot; another analyst, speaking off the record, said.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T and OneComm said they agreed to work together to bring competition to selected local communications markets, but details of the business arrangements were not disclosed, although the companies said they were non-exclusive.</p>
<p>Perry, who had been vice chairman of AT&amp;T Wireless Services, will become chairman of OneComm, which will provide management and strategic guidance to local communications carriers.</p>
<p>Hooper, who was president and CEO of the AT&amp;T wireless unit, will become president of OneComm, and Salemme, who was AT&amp;T wireless vice president for federal government affairs, will have a similar post at the new firm, which is based in Kirkland, Wash.</p>
<p>&quot;We formed OneComm because we're entrepreneurs at heart and we believe that opening up the local markets to competition is the most important effort in telecommunications today,&quot; Perry said in a statement.</p>
<p>While at McCaw Cellular, which he joined in 1976, Perry played a key role in the early development of the mobile phone industry and was involved in other forms of communications.</p>
<p>Hooper had served in a number of senior positions at McCaw, which he joined in 1982 as treasurer.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T said Dan Hesse, 43, will succeed Hooper as an executive vice president of AT&amp;T and president and CEO of AT&amp;T Wireless Services. The company, whose wireless unit faces stiff competition from start-ups, did not name replacements for the other two executives.</p>
<p>Hesse joined AT&amp;T in 1977 in sales has had assignments in network engineering, network operations, business development, product management and sales, AT&amp;T said.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T Chairman Robert Allen praised the three departing executives.</p>
<p>&quot;I can appreciate their excitement over the chance to create OneComm and take advantage of opportunities in local telecommunications,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T's stock was unchanged at $32.625 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
