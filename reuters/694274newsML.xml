<p>Wimbledon officials have been forced to schedule play on the middle Sunday for only the second time in history as a consequence of the wet weather which has dogged the 111th championships.</p>
<p>Despite the prospect of virtually a full day's play on Saturday, the All England Club management committee have decided an extra day is still necessary to clear the backlog of matches caused by heavy rain in the opening week.</p>
<p>The announcement was made after &quot;lengthy, detailed consultation&quot; with police and local residents, setting the scene for a second &quot;People's Day&quot; to rival the 1991 version which has entered Wimbledon folklore.</p>
<p>&quot;This has been a tough decision, but everyone with whom we have consulted has been most understanding and co-operative,&quot; said chief executive Chris Gorringe. &quot;Although the forecast is not the best, we are having to take a chance that some play will be possible.&quot;</p>
<p>The gates will be opened at 0900 GMT with play on all courts starting an hour later. A total of 27,500 tickets will be issued on a first come, first serve basis.</p>
<p>When play was washed out for the second successive day on Friday, referee Alan Mills revealed that the tournament was running 260 matches behind schedule.</p>
<p>Saturday's break in the weather has improved matters slightly, but the forecast for the early part of next week is not encouraging.</p>
<p>Mills himself had favoured extending the tournament into a third week, a scenario which may yet come to pass if the rain should return.</p>
<p>The 1991 Sunday was made memorable by a boisterous Centre Court crowd, who performed the first Mexican waves seen at the normally conservative venue and witnessed a rousing performance by the extrovert former American champion Jimmy Connors.</p>
