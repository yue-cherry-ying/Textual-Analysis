<p>China kept a firm grip on the Sudirman Cup mixed team badminton championship with a convincing win over former winners South Korea in the final round of group matches on Thursday.</p>
<p>But there was no joy for China's traditional big rivals Indonesia who were edged out 3-2 by Europe's strongest country, Denmark.</p>
<p>China, led by All-England champion, Dong Jiong, the top seeds won the opening three rubbers in straight games to dent the Korean hopes of regaining the crown they took in 1991 and 1993.</p>
<p>It was only after the match was over as a contest that the Chinese relaxed their grip, allowing the Koreans to take the two dead rubbers, the men's and mixed doubles, to make the final score 3-2.</p>
<p>Ge Fei and Gu Jun set the Chinese on the road to victory with a 15-4 15-9 win in the women's doubles, and Dong, despite trailing 3-6 in the first game, made it 2-0 with a 15-9 15-6 scoreline against Jang Chun-wong.</p>
<p>The holders rested All-England champion and world number one Ye Zhaoying in the women's singles, but the petite world number two , Gong Zhichao, proved to be a more than able deputy. In a tie lasting just nine minutes, she defeated Lee Joo-hyun 11-5 11-0 to wrap up the Chinese win.</p>
<p>The Indonesia-Denmark game went all the way with the Danes edging home in a five-hour marathon after a hard-fought victory in the mixed doubles, Jens Eriksen and Marlene Thomsen triumphing 15-6 15-12.</p>
<p>The Danes now have high hopes of reaching the final for the first time. They meet South Korea in the semifinals while China play Indonesia.</p>
<p>The Danish victory was teed up in the opening match by Olympic gold medallist Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen who overcame world champion Heryanto Arbi 17-16 12-15 15-4.</p>
<p>The Dane has not been at his best since Atlanta but he came good on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;After so many months struggling to hit form, I now feel I am back to by best and this was a very important win for me,&quot; said Hoyer-Larsen.</p>
<p>&quot;I did suffer from post-Olympic euphoria, but I now feel my mental toughness is back to 100 percent.&quot;</p>
