<p>Commerce Secretary William Daley on Tuesday called for increased access of U.S. and Russian goods to each other's markets, saying there was a possibility that bilateral trade could exceed $10 billion for the first time this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Bilateral trade is likely to increase modestly this year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If a few large investment projects were to get underway and if Russia's economy were to begin to grow, our bilateral trade turnover could exceed $10 billion for the first time ever,&quot; Daley said.  </p>
<p>But Daley made clear that stabilization, debt rescheduling and entry into private capital markets were not sufficient to increase business to its full potential.</p>
<p>He said while the measures had been &quot;necessary for Russia's development as a commercial partner, (they) are not sufficient to expand trade or investment to their vast potential.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that U.S.-Russia bilateral trade remained virtually unchanged last year, climbing only half a percentage point to just under $7 billion.  </p>
<p>&quot;American companies remain the top foreign investors in Russia but this investment -- a little over $3 billion -- grew little during 1996,&quot; Daley said.</p>
<p>But the Commerce secretary said that there was room for optimism now that senior positions in the Russian government had been filled with reformist leaders. He said the real work should begin in earnest to improve the climate for trade investment but added &quot;words must be backed up with action.&quot;</p>
<p>He cited a five-priority program needed to bring about reform including a substantially improved tax system, energy sector reform, increased market access and membership of Russia in the World Trade Organization, increased respect for the rule of law and initiatives to expand business development in areas outside of the major Russian cities.</p>
