<title>ITALY: Italian bonds/futures closing report.</title>
<headline>Italian bonds/futures closing report.</headline>
<dateline>MILAN 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Italian bonds and futures sat back for a bout of consolidation, ending slightly under par but with plenty of support beneath the closing levels, dealers said.</p>
<p>With many parts of Europe closed for a holiday, traders said business had been fairly subdued and Btps had taken their starting cue from weaker Treasuries on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The February 2007 Btp ended 14 basis points lower at 96.20 and was yielding 7.42 percent with a spread over the benchmark Bund of 165 basis points.</p>
<p>The June LIFFE future was 24 basis points down at 128.99 and having difficulty getting through 129.00 resistance.  </p>
<p>One London broker said the market could not push through 129.15/20 while another said that the market was getting there slowly and had scope to push higher medium term.</p>
<p>An Italian broker said: &quot;At the moment Italian investors seem more speculative and are selling at these levels, while foreigners have a more medium term vision of Italy and that's why they're buying a bit.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said expectations for an official interest rate cut continued to buoy the market although some in Italy reckoned an easing has been priced in at these levels and the market will need further news to spur it higher.  </p>
<p>Many brokers see interest rates remaining on hold until the end of the month when preliminary inflation data will be available. One broker said he expected Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio to hold off until he had an outline of the government's document of three year rolling financial targets or DPEF, also due by the end of May.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni said earlier the DPEF will also indicate possible reforms to be undertaken as well as the government's key economic policy goals.</p>
