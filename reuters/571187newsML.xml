<p>A U.S. peace drive faced an uphill battle on Thursday when both Palestinians and Israelis stuck to their positions on a Jewish settlement going up in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross, on his second rescue mission in a month, met Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in the Gaza Strip after seeing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a second day in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Israeli leader said in a statement he hoped a meeting later in the day of Israel's Shin Bet secret security chief Ami Ayalon and U.S. and PLO security officials would lead to a breakthrough in security cooperation.</p>
<p>Israeli-PLO talks broke down two months ago after Netanyahu gave the final go-ahead to build 6,500 houses for Jews on a West Bank hilltop which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, secretary-general of the Palestinian Authority, told Israel's Arabic radio the U.S. mission would fail unless it addressed the core issue of Jewish settlements.</p>
<p>He said work had to stop on the East Jerusalem settlement which Israelis call Har Homa on a hill Palestinians know as Jabal Abu Ghneim.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a basic condition and it is not possible to speak of resuming the peace process without halting settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim,&quot; Abdel-Rahman said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's aide David Bar-Illan vowed not to stop the work.</p>
<p>&quot;We obviously are not going to stop building in the settlements any more than the Palestinians are going to stop building in their towns,&quot; Bar-Illan said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Israel demands the Palestinian Authority crack down on &quot;terror&quot; before resuming talks.</p>
<p>Israeli and Palestinian officials have played down any expectation of a breakthrough during Ross's mission.</p>
<p>Israel has offered to build housing for East Jerusalem Palestinians and to discuss speeding up talks on building a seaport and opening an airport in Gaza. But the Palestinian Authority rejects the offers.</p>
<p>Abdel-Rahman said Jewish settlements divide up both the West Bank and Gaza Strip and make establishing an independent Palestinian state impossible.</p>
<p>He said Ross's mission would &quot;fail before it starts&quot; if the U.S. envoy neglected the settlement matter only to discuss side issues such as raising a quota on Palestinians working in Israel or operating a Gaza airport and seaport.</p>
