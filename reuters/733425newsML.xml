<p>A former U.S. surgeon general, the leadoff witness in a $5 billion secondhand-smoke trial, testified Wednesday that the tobacco industry's own research in the 1960s and 1970s helped create a medical consensus that smoking caused cancer.</p>
<p>Julius Richardson, the federal government's top medical official under President Jimmy Carter, also testified that the industry vigorously and unethically fought government anti-smoking campaigns and refused to cooperate with surgeon general's office researchers assessing smoking and health risks.    Richardson said that in 1979 the tobacco industry called a</p>
<p>news conference in Washington a day before the public release of the surgeon general's report on smoking's health dangers and denounced the report's conclusions without ever seeing the report itself.</p>
<p>&quot;No one had seen the report,&quot; said Richardson, testifying for the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit. &quot;I was offended because it was a very unethical process.&quot;</p>
<p>The very first Surgeon General's Report on Smoking -- issued in 1964 and reviewing all research on smoking and health up to that time -- concluded smoking was a substantial health risk and rocked the U.S. tobacco business.</p>
<p>That report led to a law several years later requiring that cigarettes sold in the United States carry health warnings.</p>
<p>The 1979 report included some health studies funded at a cost of $15 million by the tobacco industry, and Richardson said those studies helped bring about the conclusion that cigarette smoking was connected to lung cancer and other diseases among Americans.</p>
<p>He said he agreed that smoking was &quot;slow-motion suicide.&quot;</p>
<p>Richardson, now professor emeritus at Harvard University's medical school, also testified that reports issued by the surgeon general's office and the National Academy of Sciences in 1986 solidified scientific thinking on the dangers of secondhand, or environmental, smoke to young children and other non-smokers.</p>
<p>Secondhand smoke likely caused asthma in children and emphysema, lung and sinus cancers and cardiac diseases in adults, Richardson said.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel that after 1986 ... it was really established scientifically that there was a relationship between environmental tobacco smoke and cancer and other disorders,&quot; Richardson told the six jurors hearing the landmark case.</p>
<p>Lawyers pressing the case -- on behalf of an estimated 60,000 non-smoking airline flight attendants with tobacco-related illnesses -- say U.S. tobacco companies knowingly sold a defective product and lied, decieved and conspired to hide the dangers of smoking and secondhand smoke.</p>
<p>&quot;On the basis of the scientific evidence and what we know of the composition of cigarette smoke ...  breathing secondhand smoke in enclosed spaces, particularly ones like airplane cabins, (carries) a risk of disease that is considerable. It does cause disease,&quot; Richardson said.</p>
<p>Tobacco company lawyers, who on Tuesday lost a bid to block the use of the surgeon general's reports as evidence, were yet to question Richardson, a bespectacled man who spoke softly and slowly to the jury.</p>
<p>The lawyers defending seven tobacco companies and two trade groups seldom interrupted Richardson's morning testimony.</p>
<p>Testimony in the case, Norma Broin et al vs. Philip Morris et al, was expected to last through at least September.</p>
<p>It is both the first secondhand-smoke case and the first class-action lawsuit against the U.S. tobacco industry to come to trial. AMB.N</p>
