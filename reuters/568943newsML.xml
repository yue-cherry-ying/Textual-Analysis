<title>NIGERIA: Nigeria consults West Africans on Liberia vote.</title>

<p>Nigeria's military government said on Thursday it was consulting key West African leaders to decide whether Liberia's general election set for May 30 should be postponed.</p>
<p>An official statement said Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, who is on a mission for military ruler General Sani Abacha, was meeting Liberian leaders in Monrovia after talks with President Lansana Conte of Guinea on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He would also meet Presidents Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone and Matthieu Kerekou before returning to Abuja later in the day.</p>
<p>&quot;(Abacha) is expected to make a statement on the holding of the general elections after the series of consultations with member states of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) committee of Nine on Liberia,&quot; said the statement.</p>
<p>Abacha is chairman of the regional body. Last week he met the head of the Liberia electoral commission, Henry Andrews, in Abuja to discuss its preparedness.</p>
<p>The commission and some candidates have argued that the vote should be postponed because they are not ready for it. But Charles Taylor, who launched the Liberian civil war in 1989 and is a presidential candidate, wants the polls held as scheduled.</p>
<p>The May 30 date is part of a peace plan brokered by West African countries and backed by the Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force ECOMOG, which ended the war that killed more than 150,000 people.</p>
<p>More than half Liberia's pre-war population of 2.5 million were displaced while several hundred thousand are refugees in neighbouring Ivory Coast, Guinea and Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>Freed American slaves founded Liberia in 1847.</p>
