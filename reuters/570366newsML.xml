<headline>Swissie firms on mark amid quiet mark cross trade.</headline>

<p>The Swiss franc strengthened against the mark by Europe's midday, with trading subdued as many European markets, including Germany, were closed for the Ascension Day holiday.</p>
<p>The mark was slightly firmer against its other European counterparts on the back of a drop in sterling/mark.</p>
<p>Sterling had dropped heavily on a Bridge News wire report, later denied, which quoted a source in Britain's ruling Labour party as saying the pound should go back into the European exchange rate mechanism in 2001 at a rate of 2.50 marks.  </p>
<p>&quot;Apart from that, the mark crosses have been pretty much sidelined today, with people watching sterling and the dollar,&quot; said one trader at a U.S. bank in London.</p>
<p>Traders said, however, that after sterling's moves today on the ERM report, the Swiss franc was gaining against the mark because it was standing out as a safe-haven European currency.</p>
<p>The Swiss franc was at 84.72/74 centimes per mark at 1100 GMT after firming to a five-month high of 84.57 centimes earlier. It was at 84.91/93 in late European trade on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders also said that the moves were exaggerated due to the thin holiday market.  </p>
<p>&quot;Sterling has gained quite a bit in the past on its status as a safe-haven currency... But with a new government in place and reports about going back into the ERM, it's starting to lose its flavour,&quot; said one trader at a Swiss bank here.</p>
<p>&quot;So the best safe-haven currency around now is the Swiss franc...it's the only European currency outside EMU that people can safely buy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The mark was mostly steady on the other crosses, standing at 3.3733/39 French francs against 3.3729/34 in late European trade on Wednesday, and at 988.80/00 lire against 989.30/60.  </p>
<p>The market showed little reaction to comments by European Commissioner Yves Thibault de Silguy, who said uncertainty over France's intentions on European monetary union could lead to higher French interest rates.</p>
<p>De Silguy also said he hoped Britain would join the euro but that the decision was up to the British.</p>
<p>Earlier, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he saw EMU being launched as scheduled in 1999, and that there would be enough countries fulfilling the criteria to make that possible.</p>
