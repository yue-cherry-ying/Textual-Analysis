<p>The gloomy picture of Yugoslav economic trends at the start of 1997 has not improved despite certain positive indicators in February, the Belgrade Institute for Market Research (IZIT) said in its latest report.</p>
<p>&quot;The business climate in February and early March has deteriorated and the most important preconditions for the announced reforms -- functioning of a labour market and secondary capital market, and an adequate social programme -- have not been secured yet,&quot; IZIT director Jovan Todorovic said.</p>
<p>Slightly improved results in February, when industrial output rose 11.4 percent against January and 7.8 percent year-on-year, were attributed mainly to seasonal factors and a low starting base.</p>
<p>According to the institute, the 12.5 percent month-on-month increase in average wages should be viewed in the context of the population's declining purchasing power in real terms.</p>
<p>Falling demand is the best indicator these are not reliable signals the economy is coming out of recession and firms warned of growing internal debts and falling orders for their products on both the local and foreign markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflow of local and export orders in industry, new construction deals, retail sales and exports are all on a downward trend,&quot; the institute's chief researcher Slobodan Milosavljevic said.</p>
<p>Monthly retail price growth slowed to 0.6 percent in February and 1.0 percent in March primarily due to restrictive credit and monetary policy, the economy's and the population's low purchasing power and declining domestic and export demand.</p>
<p>&quot;But these have also remained serious obstacles to raising production activity,&quot; Todorovic said.</p>
<p>However, as many as 38 percent of the 200 industrial firms polled by the institute expected to raise their prices within the next six months.</p>
<p>The &quot;external&quot; environment is unchanged, with no sight yet of Yugoslavia's return to the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organisation or other international institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;The business climate is quite dreary. The only novelty in this period is a reduction in the central bank's discount rate in March to 2.5 from 4.5 percent,&quot; Todorovic said.</p>
<p>Although trade dropped in February, the deficit of $351 million in the first two months of the year, with imports worth $534 million and exports $283 million, was still high for the cash-strapped economy to sustain, the institute said.</p>
<p>The structure of imports and exports remains unfavourable with raw materials and semi manufactured goods dominating on both sides.</p>
<p>&quot;From month to month the negative factors are multiplying -- lack of finance, Yugoslavia's unfavourable position on world markets, high customs, shortage of funds for raw materials, administrative problems, high fiscal burden and high transport costs...,&quot; the institute's researcher Snezana Popovcic said.</p>
<p>&quot;The climate is not good, with a prevailing dose of pessimism and a general view that unless radical steps are taken this year could be totally lost,&quot; Todorovic said. -- Amra Kevic, Belgrade newsroom +381 11 222 4305</p>
