<headline>U.S. MUNICIPAL FOCUS -- tone seen slightly better.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. municipal bonds were mostly unchanged at midday Thursday, though traders said they noticed an improved tone amid a higher Treasury market.</p>
<p>Fixed income markets were weaker at the start of trading, but have since drifted higher in lackluster action.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 12/32 at 96-4/32 to yield 6.93 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;For the most part, sentiment probably is still slightly positive, but not as positive as it has been,&quot; one muni trader said.</p>
<p>New issues this week moved well, but traders said supply continues to be too low to get activity levels back to normal.</p>
<p>&quot;We need some paper to give the market some blood,&quot; a second trader said. He said a few bid-wanted lists generated by bond funds were circulating Thursday, but nothing substantial.</p>
<p>The Blue List of secondary market offerings rose slightly Thursday to $964 million, but the level is still well below average.</p>
<p>Secondary quotes were flat, with bids on Chicago Board of Education AMBAC 5-3/4s of 2020 unchanged at 5.91 percent. Port of Seattle FGIC 5-1/2s of 2022 were down one basis point to 5.81 percent.</p>
<p>In debt futures, the June municipal contract reversed early losses, and were up 7/32 at 115-1/32. June T-bonds were 9/32 higher at 109-19/32. The MOB spread narrowed to 174 ticks from 176 ticks at the close Wednesday.</p>
<p>In follow through action from Wednesday, J.P. Morgan Securities said it had a $14.6 million balance on Tennessee's $173 million bond deal.</p>
