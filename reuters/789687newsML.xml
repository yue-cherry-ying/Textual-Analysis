<p>Sri Lanka, still savouring new world records by its cricketers, is now planning a red carpet welcome for sprinter Susanthika Jayasinghe who won the 200 meters silver medal at the World Athletics Championships in Athens this week.</p>
<p>Sports officials said Susanthika, only the second Sri Lankan in 50 years to win a medal in a major world championship, would return home early next week to a rousing welcome and would be feted by President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.</p>
<p>The only other Sri Lankan to win a medal was Duncan White, who picked up the silver in the 400-metre hurdles at the 1948 Olympics in London.</p>
<p>Jayasinghe clocked 22.39 seconds to win her medal, defeating favourite Jamaican Merlene Ottey. The gold went to Ukrainian Zhanna Pintussevich.</p>
<p>Officials said Jayasinghe was also likely to receive a house in one of the plush residential districts of the capital Colombo and a luxury car.</p>
<p>Other awards, from the government and corporate houses, were also expected for the island's new sprint queen after the cricketers were gifted plots of lands for scoring the highest ever test score of 952 for six, beating England's 59-year-old record.</p>
