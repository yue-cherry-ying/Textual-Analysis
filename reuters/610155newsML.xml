<headline>Texas executes 4th inmate in week.</headline>

<p>Larry White, who killed elderly women in Texas and Florida, was executed by lethal injection at the state prison here on Thursday.</p>
<p>It was the fourth execution in Texas in four days.</p>
<p>White, 47,  was sentenced to death for the murder of Elizabeth St. John, 72, of Houston, whom he robbed, stabbed with a screwdriver and strangled after having sex with her on March 2, 1977.</p>
<p>He confessed to the crime and to the murder of an 82-year-old woman in Florida, for which he was also later convicted.</p>
<p>White died five minutes after the executioner began pumping a lethal combination of chemicals into his arm, said prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to apologise for all the hurt, pain and disappointment I caused my family and the victims' families and all my friends. I hope all the veterans and teenagers out there who have a drug problem will get help,&quot; White said in his final words.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope the lord will forgive me all my sins. I hope those who support the death row inmates will continue to work and maybe we can get this resolved and do away with the death penalty. I have confessed to my sins; it's a lot better place where I'm going,&quot; he concluded.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald said White spent his last day visiting with two friends. His final meal was liver and onions, cottage cheese and tomatos. He was denied a request for a final cigarette because they are now prohibited in Texas prisons.</p>
<p>White's execution was the fourth in four days and the fifth since last Friday in the state that has far and away more executions than any other. Fitzgerald said it was the 15th execution in Texas this year and the 122nd since the death penalty was reinstated here in 1982.</p>
<p>The state's next execution was scheduled to take place Wednesday, May 28. Ten executions have been set for June, officials said.</p>
