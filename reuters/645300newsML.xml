<p>A Bahraini Shi'ite Moslem has died in hospital from injuries he received in clashes with police, an exiled Bahraini opposition group said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The London-based Bahrain Freedom Movement said in a statement sent to an international news organisation that Abdul-Zahra Ibrahim Abdullah, 27, died one week after he was beaten by the security forces.</p>
<p>&quot;Abdullah was beaten by the security forces who attacked the residents of Sanabis on June 1. He was beaten severely ... and had been in a critical condition since June 1,&quot; the group said.</p>
<p>A government official confirmed Abdullah had been arrested on June 1 in Sanabis village, five km (three miles) west of the capital Manama, during anti-government protests.</p>
<p>&quot;The man was arrested on June 1 and was freed on June 3. He later died in hospital from a blood disease,&quot; the official told Reuters. He gave no further details.</p>
<p>The statement said that during the attack, security forces &quot;deployed rubber bullets and tear gas before storming houses and damaging at least 50 private cars as part of the collective punishment policy.&quot;</p>
<p>Residents said Abdullah was buried in Sanabis on Friday. They said riot police patrolled the area after protesters blocked roads in Sanabis and the nearby village of Daih. There were no reports of injuries or arrests.</p>
<p>The death of Abdullah raises the total to at least 29 killed in more than two years of anti-government protests in the Gulf Arab state. Hundreds of people, including children, have been arrested.</p>
<p>Members of the island's majority Shi'ite community have waged sporadic protests, bombings and arson attacks since December 1994 to demand political and economic reforms by the Sunni-led government.</p>
