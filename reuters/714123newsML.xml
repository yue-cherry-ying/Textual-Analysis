<p>Protestant &quot;Loyalist&quot; gunmen emerged from the shadows of the Northern Ireland conflict on Tuesday in an ominous show of force aimed at their Roman Catholic IRA enemies.</p>
<p>Six hooded men brandishing automatic weapons were shown in a local television report and said they would &quot;defend&quot; Protestant areas from Irish republican attack.</p>
<p>It was the first time since Northern Ireland was swept by Catholic violence over a Protestant parade that the Loyalists had shown their hand in a reminder that both the province's communities have self-styled guerrilla guardians.</p>
<p>The Irish Republican Army (IRA) and allied groups fighting British rule of the province have shot nightly at British troops and local police since violence flared over the routing of an Orange Order parade in a Catholic area of Portadown on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Loyalists told Ulster Television reporter Ivan Little that they would fight back if Protestant suburbs adjacent to Catholic enclaves came under attack either from the IRA or from rampaging Catholic youths who have rioted since Sunday.</p>
<p>Little said the men had the authority to speak on behalf of the Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC), an umbrella organisation for Loyalist guerrilla groups fighting to maintain British rule of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The CLMC called a ceasefire to years of sectarian war in October 1994, but police believe Loyalists are responsible for a string of recent attacks against Irish nationalist targets since the IRA ended its own truce on february 1996.</p>
<p>According to Little, the group was ordered onto the streets to &quot;reassure&quot; Protestants that they would fight back if current violence spills over into Protestant zones.</p>
<p>There was no way of knowing whether the CLMC, which is as shadowy an organisation as the guerrillas it groups, had sanctioned the display or not.</p>
<p>The men had a British army-issue SLA-80 automatic file, an AK-47 assault rifle and an Uzi submachine gun as well as walkie-talkies. All wore masks.</p>
<p>They were interviewed shortly after a Loyalist was found dead in a south Belfast park on Monday, apparently killed by a bomb which he was thought to be handling.</p>
<p>Local residents said he was a member of either the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) or Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), the two main Loyalist &quot;paramilitary&quot; organisations.</p>
<p>They and a breakaway group are suspected of responsibility for a string of abortive attacks in recent weeks against offices of Sinn Fein.</p>
<p>Loyalists, so-called because of their allegiance to Britain, say they are defenders of the majority faith against what they see as attempts by the IRA, its political wing, Sinn Fein, and the Irish government to reunite the province with Ireland.</p>
<p>They are the reverse side of the Northern Ireland coin to the IRA, which says it has been the guardian of the Catholic minority because the local police force is 92 percent Protestant.</p>
<p>Loyalists  have matched IRA violence over the years by killing Catholics to avenge their enemies' attacks against British troops, police and British targets.</p>
<p>Together, the two groups have been locked in a conflict that has killed 3,200 over the past 28 years.</p>
