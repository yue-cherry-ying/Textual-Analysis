<title>LITHUANIA: Lithuanian shares extend losses in higher trade.</title>
<headline>Lithuanian shares extend losses in higher trade.</headline>

<p>Lithuanian shares extended their recent losses in higher trade on Thursday and dealers continued to look down the road for gains.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will go up but I think it will be after one or two weeks,&quot; said Aurelijus Rimkus, a broker at Mifonda.</p>
<p>Others were less bullish.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the market will pick up until the end of the summer or autumn,&quot; said Petras Slekys, a broker at Alterna Invest.</p>
<p>The market has been struggling since a bull run last January which analysts say was fuelled more by speculation than the real value of the infant bourse's shares.</p>
<p>One of the morning's top performers, Klaipeda Stevedoring Company (KLASCO), did not follow through on its earlier promise.</p>
<p>While KLASCO shares jumped almost 10 percent in the morning, following a similar loss the day before, turnover in the company's shares was only 33,437.30 litas.</p>
<p>&quot;The supply was very low,&quot; said Grazina Baciuliene, a broker at Vilfima. &quot;Demand was three times higher than supply.&quot;</p>
<p>She added that shareholders may be holding off selling KLASCO shares in the hope of driving up prices.</p>
<p>Among blue chips, Rokishkis Cheese dropped to 43.50 litas from 44.50 litas. Dealers said that the share appeared to be underpriced and said it had lots of room to rise.</p>
