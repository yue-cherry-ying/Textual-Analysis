<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures were well supported on the charts and traders and technical analysts said on Thursday that a recently neutral market was likely to test gingerly upwards.</p>
<p>June Brent closed nine cents a barrel firmer on Wednesday at $18.16, while June gas oil gained a dollar to end the day at $167.50.</p>
<p>While we have been seeing the formation of a sideways channel the market has recently been trying to move higher - there have been more attacks to the upside than to the downside, said Tom James at Credit Lyonnais Rouse in Singapore.</p>
<p>There is very strong support between $17.75 and $18.00 and we have not seen the market trying to make new lows to the range.</p>
<p>He said that he also expected a summer rally in U.S. gasoline prices to support energy markets.</p>
<p>When gasoline finally stirs from its sleep things could happen quite quickly.</p>
<p>Resistance, he said, would be encountered around the site of previous congestion on the charts at $18.35-$18.40.</p>
<p>Steve Kwan at MMS in London saw a similar picture, although he was a little more cautious about the technical patterns.</p>
<p>&quot;After the long downwards move (of this year) we have seen a lot of speculative buying underneath $18.00,&quot; he said. &quot;This is potentially bullish.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking for range trading today,&quot; he said, and anticipated the market would remain witin a 50 cent band above $18.00.</p>
<p>&quot;But at the moment the technical patterns are not clear. We could be forming a bear flag, or we could be forming a base. We need to have a few sessions under $18.00 to turn bearish.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the key on the upside remains the gap between $18.75 and $18.77 formed last month.</p>
<p>&quot;If we break $18.77 then we are likely to move above $19.00.&quot;</p>
<p>Gas oil, James said, would find suport first at the psychological level of $165.00, and then at around $163.50.</p>
