<title>RUSSIA: Moscow's monument to last tsar destroyed by bomb.</title>

<p>A bomb on Tuesday obliterated Moscow's only monument to Russia's last tsar, Nicholas II, a 10-metre (30-foot) bronze statue only erected last year.</p>
<p>&quot;A preliminary investigation has proved that the explosion was carried out in a very professional way. Practically nothing is left from the monument,&quot; said a spokesman for the Moscow office of the Federal Security Service (FSB).</p>
<p>&quot;It was a senseless act of vandalism,&quot; Itar-Tass news agency quoted Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin as saying. &quot;One can have differing views of the last Russian emperor, but this senseless, barbaric act cannot strike out pages of our country's history.&quot;</p>
<p>Neighbours told Reuters a loud explosion at about 6.30 a.m. blew the statue to pieces.</p>
<p>The statue, showing Nicholas wearing a crown and regalia, was erected last yar in a remote spot in northeast Moscow that reflected official uncertainty towards the tsar.</p>
<p>Police at first thought the report might be an April Fool joke. &quot;I did not believe it at first since it is April 1 today,&quot; said Mikhail Smorodsky, the district police chief.</p>
<p>Curious onlookers walked by the site littered with bronze fragments and children took little pieces as souvenirs.</p>
<p>Nicholas abdicated 80 years ago last month, a move that paved the way for the Bolsheviks to take power. Public interest in the monarchy has grown since communism's collapse, and the resurgent Orthodox Church is considering making him a saint.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the All-Russia Monarchist Centre said the act could be related to the current visit to the capital of one of the royal family's descendants.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure this has a political background, especially now when Grand Duchess Leonida Georgiyevna is paying a private visit in Moscow,&quot; the spokeswoman said.</p>
