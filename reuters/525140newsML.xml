<p>The ashes of 1960s LSD guru Timothy Leary and &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry were blasted into space on Monday on a rocket carrying Spain's first satellite.</p>
<p>The cremated remains of Leary, a former Harvard professor whose final request before dying was for &quot;one last far-out trip&quot;, were launched into orbit with those of Roddenbury and 22 other space enthusiasts for the world's first space funeral.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a very special day...the families know their loved ones will now be passing overhead every 90 minutes,&quot; said Charles Chafer, vice president of Celestis, the Texas-based company organising the venture.</p>
<p>The ashes, secured in sealed vials, piggybacked aboard a mission to send Spain's first satellite into orbit via a Pegasus rocket launched over the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>A Lockheed L-1011 jetliner carried the rocket aloft, releasing it at 11,000 metres (36,000 feet) above the Spanish island of Gran Canaria.</p>
<p>It roared into space and some 10 minutes later deployed its primary cargo, the Minisat, the first satellite to be entirely built and designed in Spain.</p>
<p>The lipstick-sized capsules containing the ashes were then free to orbit with what remained of the rocket.</p>
<p>The ashes will circle earth for anywhere between 18 months and 10 years before gravity pulls them back into the atmosphere when they will burn up like a shooting star.</p>
<p>Family and friends cried and held each other as they watched the launch from an airbase in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very tense in there for a while but when we knew the ashes were successfully in orbit there was alot of hand shaking and hugging,&quot; said Chafer.</p>
<p>The space burial posthumously fulfills a lifelong dream for Leary, who urged a generation of Americans to get high on LSD so they could &quot;turn on, tune in and drop out&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Timothy had always been a space pioneer and wanted to travel into space and now he has the opportunity,&quot; said Carol Rosin, a close friend of Leary who was by his side when he died of prostate cancer last year.</p>
<p>Also celebrating the launch was Spain's Defence Ministry, which helped send a 4.5 billion pesetas ($31 million) Minisat satellite smoothly into orbit.</p>
<p>&quot;Spain has achieved an incomparable success in space history today,&quot; Spain's State Secretary for Defence Pedro Morenes told a news conference after the launch. &quot;We are extremely satisfied by the way things have gone&quot;.</p>
<p>Representatives from Orbital Sciences Corp, which built the Pegasus rocket, hailed the launch as an overwhelming victory. Their last mission in November failed when the rocket's two cargoes failed to separate.</p>
<p>&quot;Each launch is like a first date; you never know what is going to happen. But this date was a real success,&quot; said J.R. Thompson, Orbital's group manager.</p>
<p>The Minisat, designed and managed by Spain's National Institute of Aerospace Technology (INTA), will start scientific studies in about two weeks, looking at ultraviolet light, gravity and low energy gamma rays.</p>
<p>Celestis is planning a second launch of ashes in September aboard a Taurus rocket from California with room for 150 passengers each paying $4,800 for the journey.</p>
<p>&quot;This kind of memorial clearly is not to everyone's taste but we believe it will gather popularity and we expect to be doing three to five launches a year in the future,&quot; said Chafer.</p>
