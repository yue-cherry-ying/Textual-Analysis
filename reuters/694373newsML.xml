<p>Britain's new Africa minister told military putschists in Sierra Leone on Saturday that &quot;the game is up&quot; and they should return power quickly to the elected government.</p>
<p>Tony Lloyd backed West African countries who on Friday agreed to negotiate with the junta in Freetown for the reinstatement of ousted civilian President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah but retained the option of military force.</p>
<p>&quot;The demands were for the coup plotters to recognise that the game is up, and it is up. However long it takes, the game for them is up,&quot; Lloyd said during the first visit to Africa by a minister in the new Labour government.</p>
<p>&quot;The people of Sierra Leone do not deserve what they've had unleashed,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview in Kenya.</p>
<p>&quot;Our commitment and that of the whole international community is to make sure that the legitimate government is back in power as quickly as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Junior military officers toppled Kabbah on May 25, evoking a list of grievances.</p>
<p>Sierra Leone, which was Britain's oldest African colony before independence, faces the threat of ethnic factional war similar to that which broke out in neighbouring Liberia in 1989 with devastating results.</p>
<p>West African foreign ministers, meeting in Guinea, said no country should recognise Major Johnny Paul Koroma's regime.</p>
<p>The tough regional response, and the threat that it might be enforced by a Nigerian-led military intervention, appeared to produce a conciliatory tone in Freetown on Friday.</p>
<p>The Armed Forces Revolutionary Council said it welcomed dialogue.</p>
<p>&quot;Who drove Tejan Kabbah away? We did not drive Kabbah away. The AFRC is open to negotiations about his return as president to Sierra Leone,&quot; spokesman Colonel Abdul Sesay said.</p>
<p>Lloyd, the junior foreign minister responsible for Africa, said Britain wanted to see the crisis in Sierra Leone resolved without bloodshed.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a very strong need now for the coup plotters to recognise that it is in their hands to offer proper salvation to the people of Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>&quot;(They need to) to get round that negotiating table and to recognise that they cannot continue with the present position,&quot; he said.</p>
