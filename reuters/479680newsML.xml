<p>Central and South West Corp said the Public Utility Commission of Texas issued an order lowering the base rates of its Central Power and Light Co unity by about $30 million.</p>
<p>The company said it was studying the order, then would take any appropriate legal steps.</p>
<p>Base rates were to be lowered by about $30 million from the level existing prior to Central Power's higher bonded rates in May 1996, it said.</p>
<p>The commission also voted to require the company to lower its rates by $16 million in 1998 and by an additional $16 million in 1999, Central and South West said.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to be extremely disappointed and disagree with the commission's decision,&quot; E.R. Brooks, chairman, said. &quot;We are studying the final order to determine the exact financial impact. After we have fully studied the commission's order, we will file a motion for rehearing and will take legal steps as are appropriate.&quot;</p>
<p>The commission voted on its final order in the case on Monday, the company said.</p>
