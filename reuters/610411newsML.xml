<p>British companies have been more radical in restructuring and refocusing their activities over the past decade than their German counterparts, according to a report published on Friday.</p>
<p>A study by the Centre for Economic Performance based on a survey of 116 companies in both countries said that since the mid-1980s around 80 percent of British companies had refocused their activities, with more than half spinning off or selling unwanted businesses.</p>
<p>German companies have been more cautious about giving up businesses, with around half narrowing their focus but a third adding to their range of activities.</p>
<p>&quot;British firms have so far shown a much greater willingness than German ones to get out of unwanted activities,&quot; said the report's author Ansgar Richter.</p>
<p>However Richter said the different performance between the two countries could in fact indicate greater convergence.</p>
<p>&quot;Fifteen years ago British companies were among the most diversified in the world,&quot; he said, adding that while Germany had a number of highly diversified conglomerates, such as Veba and Degussa, &quot;many German companies which have grown out of the Mittelstand sector are rather specialised or have started to diversify only relatively recently.&quot;</p>
<p>The Mittelstand refers to the medium-sized companies which are the backbone of the German economy.</p>
<p>Richter said large-scale break-ups such as the demergers of Imperial Chemical Industries and Zeneca, former conglomerate Hanson and Thorn and EMI &quot;are gaining importance in the UK, whereas less has happened on this front so far in Germany&quot;.</p>
<p>The report said there were also increasing signs of convergence in the number of layers of management at British and German firms. Between 1986 and 1996 the number of managerial layers in British companies had been cut from seven to five.</p>
<p>In Germany it had been reduced from a much lower starting point of 5.4 to 4.4, the report said.</p>
