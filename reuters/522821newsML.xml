<p>President Jacques Chirac will call an early French general election on Monday, and Prime Minister Alain Juppe will set out an outline manifesto the following day, the usually well-informed newspaper Le Monde said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The daily said the ruling centre-right coalition would campaign on a swing towards more liberal economic policies than those pursued so far.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Chirac refused to comment on whether he had decided to call a snap poll, after days of strong speculation that he may try to renew his majority and clear the decks for a crucial year in European integration.</p>
<p>Le Monde said Chirac would dissolve the National Assembly in a televised broadcast on Monday evening. It said the two-stage election could take place on May 25 and June 1 or on June 1-8. Juppe would make his speech on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The newspaper Liberation said earlier that Monday was the most likely day as the week's other evenings were taken up by European Cup soccer matches.</p>
<p>&quot;The nature of a politician is that he must always be ready,&quot; Juppe told France 3 television. &quot;I see much agitation. So people should calm down a little. This decision is entirely up to the president.&quot;</p>
<p>Michel Pericard, head of Chirac's RPR Gaullist party in the Assembly, said that a dissolution was the most likely option.</p>
<p>&quot;The country is in some form of crisis, or rather it is up against a wall...and Chirac must make a strong gesture to give public opinion a say and unblock the situation,&quot; Pericard told Europe-1 radio.</p>
<p>Le Monde quoted an unnamed official as saying the ruling coalition was considering three policy options -- &quot;frenzied liberalism&quot; as advocated by sacked finance minister Alain Madelin, &quot;a more moderate liberalism&quot; as pressed by Juppe, or &quot;tougher austerity&quot; as urged by Finance Minister Jean Arthuis.</p>
<p>An official who refused to be named dismissed this report. &quot;The idea of a liberal swing is incorrect. No policy mission has been entrusted to anyone whatsoever,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>If he called a vote, Chirac was expected to argue that it was needed to prepare for a vital year of European integration. The European Union is due to decide early in 1998 which countries attain predetermined criteria to join the single currency due to be launched in 1999.</p>
<p>Arthuis has denied reports that the government was facing problems in meeting Maastricht treaty budget criteria and so might be forced to introduce unpopular spending cuts.</p>
<p>Socialist Party chief Lionel Jospin, leader of France's biggest opposition force, planned to &quot;hit hard&quot; at the ruling coalition and accuse Chirac of breaking his promises in a television interview due on Sunday at seven p.m. (1700 GMT), an aide said.</p>
<p>The Paris stock market's CAC 40 index tumbled 2.59 percent on Friday on fears of a period of political uncertainty and perhaps a new round of fiscal austerity to help France qualify for the EU's planned single currency.</p>
<p>The National Assembly's five-year term expires in March 1998. Speculation of an early election has gained ground over rumours that Chirac may be considering a less dramatic cabinet reshuffle.</p>
<p>Recent opinion polls have predicted a close battle but differed on whether the centre-right or the left would win. 191359 GMT apr 97</p>
