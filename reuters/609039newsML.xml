<p>A Singapore court on Friday ordered the arrest on tax evasion charges of an opposition politician who is also facing record multimillion dollar libel damages claimed by government leaders.</p>
<p>Magistrate Brenda Tan issued an arrest warrant for Tang Liang Hong after he was formally charged with 33 counts of tax evasion that could bring him more big fines -- and time in jail.</p>
<p>Tang fled to Malaysia after losing a ferocious battle to get into parliament in a general election that gave the PAP 81 out of the 83 seats.</p>
<p>He said he had received death threats after his war of words with the PAP, in which Goh called Tang an &quot;anti-Christian Chinese chauvinist&quot; who endangered the harmony of multi-racial Singapore.</p>
<p>Tang called them liars and was promptly sued.</p>
<p>Tang already faces paying S$12.9 million (US$9 million) in libel damages -- the sum demanded by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and 10 fellow leaders of the ruling People's Action party (PAP) for calling them liars in a January election campaign.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, the Internal Revenue Service of Singapore (IRAS) raided his house and office and seized documents. It also barred Tang's wife, Teo Siew Har, from leaving the country.</p>
<p>The Home (Interior) Ministry said then the IRAS suspected Teo may have been involved in the administration of Tang's tax matters.</p>
<p>Magistrate Tan issued the arrest warrant at a hearing to charge Tang formally on 33 counts of tax evasion totalling Singapore $211,000, saying he was unlikely to appear voluntarily to defend himself.</p>
<p>Tang did not return from self-exile to challenge the libel cases and the court awarded them to Goh and his PAP colleagues. They demanded exemplary and aggravated damages, alleging Tang had continued to libel them in media interviews from abroad.</p>
<p>Tang, who was in Hong Kong earlier this week according to the Singapore Straits Times, could be fined three times the amount of tax he is alleged to have evaded plus a fine of S$10,000 on each charge.</p>
<p>He could also be jailed for three years on each count.</p>
<p>A judgment on the amount of libel damages is still awaited.</p>
<p>Tang intends to appeal against the judgment when it is announced and against other aspects of the libel cases, his lawyer told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>He said High Court Justice Goh Joon Seng agreed Tang could bring senior lawyer Charles Gray from London to conduct the appeals.</p>
<p>Goh also referred to the Court of Appeals a motion by Tang to reverse an earlier court decision that told him to pay the legal costs of a hearing which ruled that former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew could have remarks deleted from an affidavit made in pursuit of his libel case against Tang.</p>
<p>Lee had referred to Johore, the south Malaysian state to which Tang fled, as &quot;notorious&quot; for crime.</p>
<p>The leak of the comment unleashed fury in Malaysia and a major diplomatic spat that rumbled on, despite two Lee apologies, until the Singapore elder statesman announced he would ask the court to delete the remark from the record.</p>
<p>Lee said Tang was responsible for the diplomatic row because he leaked the affidavit and the court agreed, awarding legal costs for the hearing against Tang.</p>
