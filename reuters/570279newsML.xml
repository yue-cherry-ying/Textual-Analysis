<p>Zinc prices rumbled to 4-1/2 year highs on Thursday, spurred on by fresh investment fund buying on the back of good demand and shrinking stocks.</p>
<p>The price of three months zinc futures rocketed to a high of $1,328 per tonne by midday on the London Metal Exchange (LME), from $1,287 when business ended on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Metals analysts said the price leap was no surprise, considering zinc's bullish fundamental background, and forecast further gains in future.</p>
<p>&quot;The zinc story is truly fundamentally based. This isn't hocus-pocus. It's a genuinely tight market,&quot; said Nick Moore, a London-based metals analyst for Flemings Global Mining Group.</p>
<p>&quot;We think zinc prices could peak out this time next year at 85 cents/lb ($1,873/tonne).&quot;</p>
<p>Prices charts show a steep uphill curve indicating a gain of nearly $300, or 26 percent, since the start of the year.</p>
<p>LME floor traders said the zinc's move above the psychological $1,300 level had triggered technical &quot;buy-stops&quot;, causing speculators to pile in and drive prices still higher.</p>
<p>But industrial consumers may hold off on buying physical metal until they are more certain prices will stay at current high levels, traders added.</p>
<p>The metal, used primarily in galvanising steel and manufacturing brass, became the darling of funds and speculators in recent months after world demand overtook production and started eating into big inventories.</p>
<p>&quot;The general expectation is that much of the previously huge inventory overhang will have been eroded by the latter part of 1997,&quot; brokers Billiton said in a report issued on Thursday.</p>
<p>The funds may have have pre-empted that development, driving prices higher than the fundamentals justified, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, with only a few reservations, we believe that there is considerable upside potential yet,&quot; Billeton added.</p>
<p>Market-titillating statistics include a decrease of around 15 percent in zinc inventories held by the LME since the beginning of January.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Western world demand exceeded supply by 200,000 tonnes last year, and the trend was expected to continue, according to the International Lead and Zinc Study Group, a government-backed market monitoring organisation.</p>
<p>Moore said the stock to consumption ratio had shrunk to eight weeks, compared to 16 weeks in 1994, and set the critical level at just seven weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is recognising just how tight this market is and the prospects of further stock erosion bode extremely well for further price advances in this market,&quot; Moore said.</p>
<p>Longer term some analysts have cautioned that China, the world's biggest zinc producer, could increase metal exports into the West if prices kept climbing. But others have dismissed the prospect as insufficient to dampen zinc's bullish stance.</p>
