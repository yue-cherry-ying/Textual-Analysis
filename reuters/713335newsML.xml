<title>USA: Manager's affair caused U.S. bank massacre - suit.</title>
<headline>Manager's affair caused U.S. bank massacre - suit.</headline>
<dateline>DETROIT 1997-07-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>A deadly bank shooting rampage in March resulted from a cash-for-sex relationship gone awry between the bank's manager and the gunman, the family of one of the victims has alleged in a lawsuit.</p>
<p>The civil wrongful death suit was filed on Monday in Wayne County Circuit Court by the family of James Isom, one of three people shot to death on March 11 by 21-year-old Allen Lane Griffin, who burst into a Comerica Bank branch on Detroit's east side with a shotgun.</p>
<p>At the time, investigators had little explanation for Griffin's rampage, which ended when police shot him dead in a hail of bullets. At one point, Griffin, dressed in camouflage fatigues, forced terrified bank patrons to lie face down on the floor and sing the Lord's Prayer with him.</p>
<p>But the lawsuit, which followed months of work by private investigators, alleged branch manager Stanley Pijanowski was paying Griffin, who worked at a nearby carwash, for sex.</p>
<p>Pijanowski, 52, was killed in the incident, as was Isom, 25, a customer service representative at the bank, and Stanley Hays, 77, a bank customer.</p>
<p>The suit named as defendants Comerica Bank and security guard Virene Brown and her employer, Guardsmark Inc., for failing to provide adequate security in the incident.</p>
<p>The suit charges that Pijanowski, a 29-year Comerica employee from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, had &quot;intentionally acted with wilful and wanton conduct knowing that harm was imminent and (James Isom) among others, would be injured.&quot;</p>
