<p>Thousands of radical students armed with iron bars and firebombs paraded the coffin of a colleague through the streets of the South Korean city of Kwangju on Friday.</p>
<p>The steel coffin of student Yoo Jae-ul, who died during a protest in March, has become a rallying point for anti-government demonstrations in a city that has just completed anniversary mourning rites for the 1980 Kwangju massacre.</p>
<p>Students had made several earlier attempts to stage a funeral procession but were beaten back in pitched battles with riot police ringing the campus.</p>
<p>The coffin had been sitting on a pickup truck parked on the campus of a local university since May 16.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, it was finally trundled off the college grounds in a march by more than 4,000 students that threatened to explode into violence.</p>
<p>Many of the students carried boxes of molotov cocktails hung from iron bars slung across their shoulders.</p>
<p>Similar student funerals in the past have provoked spasms of street violence.</p>
<p>The truck was preceded by students beating drums and cymbals and was flanked on each side by two rows of protesters wielding metal staves and dressed identically in white t-shirts bearing the image of the student.</p>
<p>Scores of colourful banners fluttered overhead.</p>
<p>The student's distraught mother stumbled along behind the coffin, sobbing and wailing and occasionally throwing herself on the casket, which was draped in the national flag.</p>
<p>Initial medical reports showed the student died of a heart attack.</p>
<p>But his parents and radical students groups rejected a government request for an autopsy and are demanding an official apology and the right to bury Yoo in a newly-dedicated cemetery for Kwangju massacre victims.</p>
<p>More than 200 people died, by official count, when paratroopers stormed Kwangju in 1980 to crush a citizen's revolt against martial law. Most were students.</p>
<p>By Friday evening the procession was circling the main city plaza in front of the provincial government building, which was cordoned off by ranks of riot police massed behind sandbagged barricades.</p>
<p>The plaza was the scene of the worst of the carnage in 1980. Anniversary ceremonies over the weekend were the first to be officially-sponsored by the government.</p>
<p>It was not clear whether students would try to force their way into the plaza, or head towards a cemetery on the outskirts of the city.</p>
<p>No major clashes were reported.</p>
