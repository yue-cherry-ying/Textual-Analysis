<p>--------------------MARKET COMMENT----------------------------</p>
<p>* Toronto stocks broke new ground at the open, surpassing the previous record session high of 6348.02. * 7.2 million shares traded worth C$125 million. * 11 of 14 sectors surged higher.  </p>
<p>Toronto stocks climbed to new highs at the open on Friday, surging past the previous record session high of 6348.02 reached March 11, but traders said the market has likely reached its near-term peak.</p>
<p>Trading was expected to taper off later in the session ahead of the U.S. holiday weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm guessing we're reasonably close to our near-term peak, at least for today. After lunch is pretty much going to be a non-event in anticipation of the Memorial Day holiday,&quot; said Pier Donnini, head trader of institutional equities at Yorkton Securities in Toronto.  </p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index climbed 32.82 points to 6368.84 in turnover of 7.2 million shares worth C$125 million. Advances outpaced declines 262 to 159 while 216 issues were flat.</p>
<p>Donnini said the TSE has lagged gains by New York and was playing a bit of market catch-up as the sectors posted moderate gains nearly across the board.    &quot;None of the sectors are</p>
<p>particularly strong, they are sort of all up, and there are no disasters looming. Gold is flat, so the golds aren't getting creamed, and the banks are up and steady,&quot; Donnini said.</p>
<p>Eleven of Toronto's 14 sub-indexes gained ground, led by oil and gas, utilities, industrials, conglomerates and banks.</p>
<p>Real estate made the biggest move in the opposite direction, slipping 42.39 points or 1.83 percent to 2271.56.</p>
<p>--- HOT STOCKS ---</p>
<p>* BCE Inc continued to lead the market higher, rising 0.45 to 37.05 in turnover of more than 440,000 shares. Bell has risen 6.25 since April 14.</p>
