<p>Bonds closed firmer, lifted by the stronger performance of the U.S. Treasuries, but traders said that the market was uncertain and might not hold on to the gains on Friday.</p>
<p>With the approach of the next Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting on May 20, international markets were going to become increasingly vulnerable to attacks of nerves over the possibility of a hike in U.S. rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Until the Fed decision, the market is going to be very volatile, very dependent on the (economic) indicators for whatever pointers they may give,&quot; said one trader.  </p>
<p>The spread with Bunds narrowed as Spain also gained slightly on the German market, but volumes were generally thin given the market closures in much of Europe, traders added.</p>
<p>The escudo ended little changed against the mark and traders expected it to continue trading around 100.50 to the German currency.</p>
