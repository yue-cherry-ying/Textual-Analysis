<p>Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini was quoted on Saturday as saying that Italy's centre-left government must set out planned reforms to the welfare state by the summer or consider modifying the ruling coalition.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no time to lose,&quot; Dini, who led a technocrat government before the election last year of Prime Minister Romano Prodi, told Corriere della Sera newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;The government must define soon, before the summer, a proposed reform of the welfare state undersigned by the entire majority and then negotiate on that basis with the interested parties,&quot; Dini said.</p>
<p>He said that otherwise Prodi &quot;must have the political honesty to admit promptly -- without waiting until 1998 -- that we are not in a position to take part in the single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;At that point the possibility of broadening the majority to include other centrist forces must be looked into,&quot; he said in a warning to hard-left allies Communist Refoundation, who hold the balance of power in the lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>Prodi's administration has drawn up a 15.5 trillion lire ($9 billion) supplementary budget in a sustained effort to ensure Italy makes the first wave of European economic and monetary union (EMU) from January 1999.</p>
<p>But there have been doubts as to the sustainability of the deficit-cutting measures imposed by the heavily-indebted country. Both industry and the opposition have criticised the mini-budget for not addressing structural reforms.</p>
<p>Prodi has said eventual reforms to welfare spending, including costly pensions, will be enshrined in the 1998 budget.</p>
<p>Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has said the government would set out &quot;strategic lines&quot; for pension reforms in its annual document of three-year rolling economic targets (DPEF) to be presented in May.</p>
<p>However the government faces determined opposition from trades unions and Refoundation to make any changes before 1998.</p>
<p>Dini said he backed Prodi for recently warning Refoundation, who went against the government in a recent vote on an Italian-led force for Albania, that time was running out.</p>
<p>He said the DPEF needed more than just guidelines.</p>
<p>&quot;When we ask for an agreement by June we are not doing it for the pleasure of making ultimatums but because time is limited. Talks with the unions and employers can only start when a proposal by the entire majority has been defined.&quot;</p>
<p>Dini said however that he hoped the centre-left coalition would not need to be enlarged.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that the current coalition can do it, that the ideological barriers erected by Refoundation can be overcome.</p>
<p>&quot;But if this intransigence does not fall, it will be necessary to enlarge the coalition towards the centre.&quot;</p>
