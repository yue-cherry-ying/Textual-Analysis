<p>Greece announced on Thursday plans to build the world's biggest solar power plant on the holiday island of Crete.</p>
<p>&quot;The Greek government backs investments involving alternative energy sources and that's why it decided to support the construction of the world's biggest photovoltaic power station on Crete,&quot; Development Minister Vasso Papandreou told a news conference.</p>
<p>The environmental group Greenpeace, which has campaigned for years to turn Crete into a solar-powered island, said in a statement the project would shatter assumptions that solar power needs expensive investments.</p>
<p>Greece and the European Union will fund 55 percent of the $17.75 million needed to build the first five megawatt of the proposed 50 megawatt station, it said.</p>
<p>IWECO Solar, a subsidiary of the U.S. Enron Solar company, will build and operate the plant. Its proposal calls for building nine megawatts a year to reach 50 megawatts by 2003.</p>
<p>&quot;At 50 megawatts, the Crete solar power station would be 15 times larger than any other solar photovolatic installation in the world,&quot; Greenpeace said. Italy now has the world's biggest solar power plant at 3.3 megawatts.</p>
<p>The station is designed to cover the energy needs of 100,000 people at a price lower than that charged by Greece's Public Power Corporation.</p>
<p>&quot;This smashes conventional assumptions on solar power in terms of scale and costs,&quot; said Greenpeace International Executive Director, Thilo Bode, in Athens to celebrate the announcement of the plant.</p>
<p>&quot;If the world builds the equivalent of eight such solar power stations, we can create a $27 billion market for solar photovoltaic and create hundreds of thousands of jobs,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bode urged governments to invest in environmentally friendly energy sources in order to reduce pollutants, such as carbon dioxide, which are blamed for altering the earth's climate.</p>
<p>Greenpeace wants nations to commit to a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide by 2005 and to begin negotiations for a fossil fuel phaseout, including a halt to new oil exploration.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the type of energy investment which governments must now implement if we are to have a chance of avoiding dangerous climate change,&quot; Bode said.</p>
