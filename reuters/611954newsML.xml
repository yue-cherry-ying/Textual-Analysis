<p>Iranians began voting on Friday to choose a successor for President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, bound by law to step down in August after eight years in office.</p>
<p>Supreme spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Rafsanjani, in remarks broadcast by Tehran radio, called on all eligible voters to take an active part in the election.</p>
<p>&quot;If one candidate shows the slightest tolerance to America and the Western countries' interference and cultural onslaught the people will not vote for him,&quot; Khamenei said.</p>
<p>&quot;They will vote for someone who can stand against America and those who want to impose their will on our nation.&quot;</p>
<p>Khamenei, one of the first to vote, said after casting his vote in a special ballot box at his official residence he expected the next president to be a servant of the people. He should also be within the framework of the Islamic rules and do his best for people's welfare and spiritual affairs, he added.</p>
<p>Thirty-three million Iranians aged 15 and over are eligible to vote at 33,180 mosques, schools and clinics turned into polling stations and guarded by 200,000 police. They opened at 8:00 a.m. (0330 GMT).</p>
<p>Approaches to election headquarters at the Interior Ministry were barricaded and guarded by armed police.</p>
<p>The result looked set to be a close-fought contest between two Shi'ite Moslem clergymen, more moderate-minded Mohammad Khatami and conservative Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri. Two other candidates, Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri and Reza Zavarei are believed unlikely to make much impact.</p>
<p>Khatami is supported by women, youths and intellectuals and is expected to sweep the capital and some other major cities.</p>
<p>Nateq-Nouri is popular with conservative clergy and Iran's merchant class of bazaaris. He is stronger in rural areas.</p>
<p>Both men are Shi'ite Moslem clerics. All four candidates passed scrutiny by a body of senior clergymen and lawyers for their belief in Iran's Islamic system of government before they were allowed to stand. Some 234 other contenders were rejected.</p>
<p>Iranian analysts and Western diplomats said the election was too close to call.</p>
<p>In the courtyard of a mosque near Ibn-Sina square in Tehran where men and women joined separate queues to vote, a 16-year- old youth taking part in an election for the first time turned to the man behind him and said: &quot;I'm voting for Khatami, who are you voting for?&quot;</p>
<p>Told the vote was confidential, the youth replied: &quot;Vote for Khatami, he is better.&quot;</p>
<p>Ballot papers do not name the candidates but a notice lists the four with Nateq-Nouri's name first followed by those of Reyshahri, Khatami and Zavarei. Voters have to write in the name of their preferred candidate. There are no photographs of the candidates.</p>
<p>Tehran radio played songs especially composed for the election and epic poems on people's duty to go to the polls.</p>
<p>A man interviewed on the radio about the election said voting was &quot;a strong smack in the jaw of world arrogance&quot; -- a term usually taken to mean Western powers, in particular the United States.</p>
<p>Television coverage included footage of Iran's &quot;bad old days&quot; before the 1979 Islamic revolution including scenes of U.S. President Richard Nixon meeting Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlevi as well as scenes of crowds burning U.S. flags and the Jewish Star of David.</p>
<p>Images of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the revolution which toppled the shah, were shown repeatedly with scenes from Iran's 1980-88 war with Iraq.</p>
<p>Fears of vote-rigging marked the election campaign which ended 24 hours before polling began. Both Khamenei, Iran's highest authority, and Rafsanjani, its most senior elected official, warned against any attempt to tamper with ballots and promised the election would be fair.</p>
<p>The result is expected to be known by Monday.</p>
