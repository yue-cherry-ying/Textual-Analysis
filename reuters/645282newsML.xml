<p>Kuwaiti parliamentarians sharply criticised the government on Saturday after a leading liberal opposition MP was wounded in an assassination attempt.</p>
<p>The government urged MPs not to foment internal strife after Oxford-educated Abdullah al-Naibari, 61, was shot twice on Friday evening. His wife was also wounded in the ambush.</p>
<p>Gunmen ambushed Naibari's car as he drove to Kuwait City from a beach near the southern border with Saudi Arabia. He was hit in the jaw and shoulder and his wife suffered a superficial bullet wound near her left shoulder. On Saturday government officials said both were in good condition in hospital.</p>
<p>Naibari has played a key role in efforts to combat alleged corruption since parliament was restored in 1992 and he often questions lucrative arms deals.</p>
<p>At the end of a tense debate on Saturday parliament said in a statement the attack was an attempt &quot;...to scare decision makers from defending rightfulness and legitimacy&quot;.</p>
<p>The tiny Gulf Arab state's acting premier and foreign minister, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, told MPs: &quot;Please do not pour petrol on the fire. Starting a fire would not only harm us but will harm the whole of Kuwait.&quot;</p>
<p>Some MPs claimed that government failure to strike hard against former officials who allegedly mismanaged and squandered public funds had led to the attack against Naibari.</p>
<p>&quot;The country is in real danger...These people are not without allies. They will continue on this path unless there is a clear position,&quot; speaker Ahmad al-Saadoun told parliament.</p>
<p>MP Ahmad al-Mulaifi said: &quot;This case (attack) is an extension of other cases that we failed to deal with. Judges, ministers and undersecretaries could be the next targets.&quot;</p>
<p>There are several cases before the courts of alleged illegal profits by former officials, including some involving operations at the state-owned Kuwait Oil Tanker Company (KOTC).</p>
<p>The government has strongly condemned the attack against Naibari and promised an intensive investigation to secure the swift arrest of the unidentified gunmen.</p>
<p>Diplomats said Western embassies were assessing the security situation but did not expect visits to Kuwait this month by U.S. and British ministers to be postponed.</p>
