<headline>Euro oil swaps firm, fuel up $1 again, CFDs up 9 c.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>European oil swaps moved slightly higher on Thursday morning but trading was quiet due to a public holiday across much of Europe.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs rose nine cents a barrel for next week's dates to 15 cents under June with the following week three cents up at 17 cents under.</p>
<p>Monthly CFDs were little changed. The balance of May talked 34 cents under the front line Brent futures contract with forward levels at the following levels under the IPE: -25 cents June, -21 cents July, -17 cents 3Q97, -14 cents 4Q97.</p>
<p>Fuel swaps climbed $1 a tonne, extending similar gains made on Wednesday. May barge swaps talked up to $85, dragged higher by firm Singapore swaps around $102.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no market in Europe today so it's just getting dragged up by Singapore and the U.S.,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Low sulphur was also strong with levels close to $91 for May and $92.50 on June.</p>
<p>Further forward the shape of the barge market was little changed despite reports on Wednesday of growing Russian exports.</p>
<p>Up to 4.5 million tonnes of Russian fuel is likely to be exported through St Petersburg from May to November this year, a Western trader based at the port told Reuters.</p>
<p>This is well above 1996 but close to the volumes seen in 1995 when peak exports levels hit around one million tonnes in the month of August.</p>
<p>Gasoline firmed $1 a tonne on June swaps which traded at $193.25 and $193.50. May was $1 higher at $194.50 and was partially held back by sluggish physical barges which talked $193 by lunchtime.</p>
<p>Middle distillates were flat although the underlying tone remained weak. Gas oil crack spreads held at $4.30 a barrel (3Q97), $4.85 (4Q97) and $4.70 (1Q98).</p>
