<p>Three children were killed and four more injured in Turkey's troubled eastern provinces on Thursday, when military shells they found exploded.</p>
<p>Thirteen year old Remzi Yigit and Haluk Akdogan, aged 10, died instantly when a mortar shell they were playing with went off. They had found the shell at the edge of their village, in Turkey's southeast Hakkari province, Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>Another child died and four others were hurt in a separate incident when a bomb they found on an army shooting range in the eastern province of Erzurum exploded, security officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Four-year-old Fedia Ogurce died in the blast which occurred after the children took the bomb home. Four other children in the family, aged between six and 12, were badly hurt and taken to hospital.</p>
<p>Anatolian said police searched nearby houses after the bomb explosion and found two sacks full of unexploded bombs, rocket launchers and mortar bombs.</p>
<p>Police detonated the bombs found in Pasinler near an ancient castle, Anatolian said. Police have arrested two people in connection with the explosives.</p>
<p>Turkey's Third Army Corps is based near Erzurum and troops from the province sometimes join the fight against rebel Kurds in the nearby southeast of Turkey.</p>
<p>Security officials said 25 rebel Kurds were killed in the rugged province of Hakkari on Thursday, where thousands of troops are based.</p>
<p>More than 22,000 people have been killed in over 12 years of fighting between government troops and guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) seeking self-rule in the mainly Kurdish southeast.</p>
