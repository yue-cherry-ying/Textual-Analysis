<headline>NBA BASKETBALL-KNICKS SECURE HOME COURT ADVANTAGE FOR FIRST ROUND.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Patrick Ewing had yet another big game for the Knicks on Friday, helping New York to nail down home court advantage in the first round of the playoffs and hold onto third place in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>Ewing scored 26 points and pulled down 14 rebounds to lead the Knicks to a 97-89 victory over the Indiana Pacers.</p>
<p>New York's victory, coupled with a Charlotte loss, ensured that the Knicks can finish no worse than fourth in the East.</p>
<p>The Knicks can clinch third place with a win at Chicago Saturday, a victory that will keep them from running into the Bulls no sooner than the conference finals.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we got our defensive intensity back for the most part,&quot; Ewing said. &quot;We just played hard-nosed basketball, which is what we've been known for.&quot;</p>
<p>Charles Oakley added 18 points and 12 rebounds and Larry Johnson and Allan Houston drained key three-pointers down the stretch for the Knicks.</p>
<p>Reggie Miller scored 19 points for Indiana, which was eliminated from post-season contention earlier in the week.</p>
<p>In Detroit, Terrell Brandon had 23 points and seven assists for the Cleveland Cavaliers, who stayed in contention for the final playoff spot in the East with an 82-75 victory over the Pistons.</p>
<p>Bob Sura added 16 points for the Cavaliers, who can nail down a playoff berth with a win over Washington Sunday. The winner of that game earns the unenviable right to face the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>Grant Hill had 14 points for the Pistons, who remained one game behind fifth-place Charlotte in the East.</p>
<p>At Washington, Rod Strickland scored 27 points and handed out nine assists as the Bullets moved within one win of their first playoff spot in nine years with a 104-93 triumph over the Orlando Magic.</p>
<p>Juwan Howard added 25 points for the Bullets, who have won 15 of thier last 20 games but must beat Cleveland in their final game Sunday to qualify for post-season.</p>
<p>Penny Hardaway scored 20 points to lead Orlando.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, Elden Campbell had 21 points and Shaquille O'Neal added 18 -- but just one in the second half -- as the Lakers beat the Clippers 123-95.</p>
<p>Nick Van Exel had 15 points and 10 assists for the Lakers, who moved back into a tie with idle Seattle for first place in the Pacific Division at 56-25.</p>
<p>Rodney Rogers and Eric Piatkowski scored 15 points apiece for the Clippers, who own the final playoff spot in the West and a date with the Utah Jazz in the first round.</p>
<p>In Charlotte, Damon Stoudamire scored 28 points as the Toronto Raptors snapped the Hornets' team-record nine-game winning streak with a 108-100 victory.</p>
<p>Doug Christie chipped in 23 points and Marcus Camby had 20 and eight rebounds for Toronto, which ended a four-game skid.</p>
<p>Glen Rice poured in 38 points and Ricky Pierce had 23 for the Hornets, who fell 1 1/2 games behind fourth-place Atlanta, but stayed a game ahead of sixth-place Detroit in the East.</p>
<p>In Houston, Charles Barkley had seven points and two assists in overtime as the Rockets rallied to defeat the Dallas Mavericks 112-102.</p>
<p>Clyde Drexler finished with 27 points and nine assists and Matt Maloney added 24 points, including a three-pointer that put the Rockets ahead to stay in the extra session.</p>
<p>Sasha Danilovic scored 23 points to lead the Mavericks.</p>
<p>In San Antonio, Cedric Ceballos scored 22 points off the bench and Rex Chapman had 21 and seven assists as the Phoenix Suns overcame a 16-point first-half deficit to post a 106-95 victory over the Spurs.</p>
<p>Kevin Johnson added 11 points and 16 assists for the Suns, who took the lead with an 11-0 third-quarter surge and put the game away by opening the fourth on a 10-0 run to stay tied for sixth place in the West with Minnesota.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, Tom Gugliotta scored 22 points and Dean Garrett had 18 points and eight rebounds as the Timberwolves posted their best offensive effort of the season in a 122-112 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks.</p>
<p>Kevin Garnett also scored 18 points, while Stephon Marbury had 17 and 17 assists for Minnesota, which remained tied with Phoenix for sixth place in the West at 40-41.</p>
<p>In Miami, Kendall Gill scored 24 points and New Jersey outrebounded the Heat 52-39 in an 86-74 win for the Nets.</p>
<p>Jimmy Jackson scored 21 points for the Nets, including a three-pointer with 1:25 left that capped a crucial 16-4 run.</p>
<p>Eric Montross grabbed 17 rebounds and Tony Massenburg pulled down 15 for New Jersey.</p>
<p>Voshon Lenard scored 16 points and P.J. Brown added 15 for the Heat, who have lost three of four games since clinching the second playoff spot in the East.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, Antoine Walker posted his second straight triple-double as the Boston Celtics, in their last opportunity, beat an Atlantic Division foe for the first time this season -- a 119-113 victory over the 76ers.</p>
<p>Walker had 23 points, 12 rebounds and 13 assists and David Wesley scored 28 points for Boston, which finished 1-23 against divisional opponents. No NBA team had ever gone winless in its division.</p>
<p>Rookie of the Year favourite Allen Iverson had 32 points and a 15 assists for the Sixers.</p>
