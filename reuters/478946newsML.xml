<title>THAILAND: Thai baht, interbank rate up in late trade.</title>
<headline>Thai baht, interbank rate up in late trade.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Thai baht was higher against the dollar in late trade on Tuesday on U.S. unit's further fall abroad and tighter liquidity, dealers said.</p>
<p>The baht was quoted at 25.954/25.959 to the dollar late compared with 25.958/25.961 in early morning.</p>
<p>&quot;The liquidity was tighter today with rising short-term baht interest rates. This triggered some interest in the baht,&quot; said one dealer at a local bank.</p>
<p>The tightening liquidity pushed the overnight interbank rate up to 9.75-10.00 percent late 7.50-8.00 earlier, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the lower money supply was attributed to the fund being drained from the banking system to settle the Bank of Thailand's bonds being auctioned last Friday.</p>
<p>The central bank on Friday arranged the bond auction worth 30 billion baht ($1.15 billion) which was raised from two billion baht orginally planned.</p>
<p>The central bank said the move was being made to mop up excess liquidity that would hit the market following the scheduled launch of a 78 billion baht Government Pension Fund (GPF) last week.  </p>
<p>The one-month baht/dollar swap premium was traded at 7.50/8.50 satangs per dollar late against 8.25/9.00 in early morning.</p>
