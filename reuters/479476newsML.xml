<p>Tamil Tiger rebels on Tuesday criticised the suggestion that Sri Lanka might hold elections in the island's north, saying such a move would be done to mislead donor nations into thinking conditions had returned to normal.</p>
<p>Government sources said last month that the Sri Lankan government, fresh from its landslide victory in February's local polls, may hold elections for local bodies in the former LTTE stronghold of Jaffna.</p>
<p>&quot;Calling for elections in the army-occupied areas of the north and east is a gimmick by the Sri Lankan government to mislead the aid donor countries into thinking that normalcy has returned to Jaffna,&quot; Anton Rajah, a spokesman for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels, told Reuters by telephone from London.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka's donor nations are scheduled to meet in Paris later this month to finalise aid for the strife-torn island.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a strong possibility that elections (for local bodies) will be held in Jaffna,&quot; a senior government official told Reuters.</p>
<p>But Rajah said it was difficult to hold free and fair polls in the region which was under army control.</p>
<p>&quot;How can you hold a free election when the armed forces are intimidating the local Tamil population. Any election held under these conditions cannot reflect the democratic wishes of the people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Local elections were not held in the island's north and east, where government troops are fighting the LTTE, after minority Tamil parties told the government that it was impossible to hold free polls in the two regions, large areas of which are under rebel control.</p>
<p>&quot;It is only fair we give the choice of the vote to the people of the north and east, just as we did to the people of the rest of the country,&quot; the government official said.</p>
<p>The LTTE are waging a 13-year-old war for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in majority Sinhalese Sri Lanka. The government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the conflict. The LTTE says the number is higher.</p>
<p>&quot;(An election) would be a good  way to bring the people of these areas into mainstream politics, regardless of the situation there,&quot; the official added.</p>
