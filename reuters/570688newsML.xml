<p>French farmers can expect more rain, especially in western France, on Thursday with blustery weather across most of the country until at least Saturday, the state weather service said.</p>
<p>The big grain belt south of Paris saw a break in the rain on Thursday morning but the afternoon will be overcast and showery as a new weather system moved east, Meteo France said. High winds up to 100 km/hour were forecast in southeast France near the Mediterranean coast.</p>
<p>Eastern France would be cloudy with less fierce winds and snow in high areas.</p>
<p>The outlook for Friday was for showers, mostly in the north, and a strong westerly wind but mild temperatures in the maize-growing southwest where farmers are busy sowing.</p>
<p>Saturday would see less frequent showers across most of France with some sunny spells, followed by warmer weather up to 24 degrees and a few bursts of rain on Sunday.</p>
<p>Farmers have expressed relief at the rain which arrived at the weekend and helped to break up hard soil after four months of dry weather and drought fears. But underground water resources needed for irrigation remain far below normal -- up to 50 percent in some areas.</p>
<p>Private U.S. forecast Weather Services Corp said earlier on Thursday ample rain was erasing drought conditions in western Europe. --Tim Hepher, Paris newsroom +331 4221 5146</p>
