<p>Czech telephone monopoly SPT Telecom said on Tuesday that floods which hit the eastern Czech Republic had cut almost 50,000 phone lines in the region, and it warned the situation could worsen in the coming hours.</p>
<p>SPT said in a statement that its emergency teams were fighting to keep the key lines and exchanges running as water levels were still rising.</p>
<p>&quot;Considering the development of the weather and continuing rainfall...an increase in the problems can be expected in other areas,&quot; SPT said.</p>
<p>SPT said it has begun to trace the extent of damage to its networks. It said about 40,000 lines had been cut off in Northern Moravia, 7,000 in Southern Moravia, and about 2,000 in Eastern Bohemia.</p>
<p>The firm said numerous power supply suspensions forced it to use its own back-up generators, and added that rising water was preventing any repair work. It said the telegraph service was down completely in the region.</p>
<p>Torrential rains have forced thousands of families out of their homes in the region of the third largest Czech city of Ostrava and the city of Olomouc.</p>
<p>Rail and road links have been cut, and a number of companies announced they were shutting down due to flooding.</p>
<p>Tuesday's weather forecasts expected heavy rain to continue at least until Tuesday evening, and warned floods were moving downstream of the affected rivers.</p>
