<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's senior adviser flew to Israel on Friday to pave the way for Mubarak's summit with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week.</p>
<p>Airport sources said the aide, Osama el-Baz, left from a military airport. He did not speak to reporters. It was not clear how long he planned to stay in Israel.</p>
<p>The two leaders are due to meet in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on Tuesday in a bid to revive peace talks that have been on hold since Israel started to build a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem in March.</p>
<p>The government daily newspaper al-Ahram said Netanyahu telephoned Mubarak twice on Thursday to suggest the Sharm el-Sheikh meeting and to agree that Baz should fly to Israel.</p>
<p>Baz, Mubarak's political consultant, was due to meet Israeli officials &quot;to discuss ideas suggested to take the peace process out of the current crisis,&quot; al-Ahram said.</p>
<p>Mubarak sent a handwritten message to Netanyahu expressing his worry about the freeze in talks between Israel and the Palestinians and the need to end the crisis, the paper added.</p>
<p>Mubarak has suggested that a six-month Israeli freeze of settlement activity would give peace efforts a boost. Netanyahu has said his government will press ahead with Jewish construction in areas Israel captured in 1967.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak said in a statement on Thursday that &quot;the meeting will take place according to a proposal by Mubarak aimed at exchanging ideas...to further the political process in the region&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an Egyptian policy and Egypt is a player. I certainly think there will be an open ear from the Israeli side for the Egyptian ideas,&quot; Netanyahu's new foreign policy adviser Uzi Arad told Israel television.</p>
