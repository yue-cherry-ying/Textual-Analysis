<p>Singapore prompt gas oil swaps were traded below the $25.00-per-barrel physical support level amid high stocks and unsold supplies, brokers and traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>June swaps traded at $25.05, $24.90, $24.85 and $24.95 and were last quoted at $24.80/$24.95, down from its morning quotes of $25.00/$25.20 per barrel, brokers said.</p>
<p>Traders said they expect more physical cargoes would be offered in the evening, especially from oil majors, while buying interest might be limited to a handful of buyers.  </p>
<p>In the physical market, on average of seven to 10 offers were heard looking to sell about 1.5 million barrels of gas oil for June lifting.</p>
<p>Traders said physical prices were precariously clinging to a $25.00 per barrel support.</p>
<p>They said high stocks and unsold supplies might cause prices to eventually buckle and fall below that support later next week.  </p>
<p>Singapore middle distillate stocks for the week ended May 21, comprising jet fuel, kerosene and gas oil, hit an at least three-year high of 10.345 million barrels, up 1.381 million barrels from the previous week, Singapore's Trade Development Board said.</p>
<p>Barely two months ago, middle distillate stocks were at an at least three year low at 4.953 million barrels.</p>
<p>Chinese demand were also lacklustre, traders said.</p>
<p>The jet fuel/gas oil spread or regrade was also undermined by strong selling pressure, brokers said.  </p>
<p>June regrade was last quoted at minus 40 to minus 20 cents, about 5 cents lower than Thursday.</p>
<p>Fuel oil swaps hovered around its morning level. Traders said any recovery would also be capped amid soft demand despite reduced supplies.</p>
<p>June was last quoted at $100.50/$102.00 per tonne, down about 25 cents from Thursday, brokers said.</p>
