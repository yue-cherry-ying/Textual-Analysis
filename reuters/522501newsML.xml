<p>Nick Price, continuing his return to the form that made him the world's best golfer not so long ago, retained his one-stroke lead after the second round of the Heritage Classic on Friday.</p>
<p>Despite bogeying the final two holes on the most exposed part of the Harbour Town course, Price managed a two-under-par 69 in extremely windy, unseasonally cool conditions on a day when the field averaged 73.1 strokes.</p>
<p>Price, who led by one stroke after the first round, stood at eight-under 134 to keep his slim margin over Lennie Clements, who shot 68, and Brad Faxon and Rick Fehr, who each matched the leader's 69.</p>
<p>&quot;I am really happy with the way I played today, because when it is cold it is hard to feel your grip,&quot; said Price, who was ranked number one in the world after winning two major championships in 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;With the exception of the bogeys on 17 and 18, I played almost as well as I could,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The last five, six tournaments I have been striking the ball very well. The difference this week is that I have finished it off. The greens are so pure. I've got a good feel for them and my pace has been good.&quot;</p>
<p>The 39-year-old from Zimbabwe won his first major at the 1992 PGA Championship. In 1994 he won it again, as well as the British Open, but suffered something of a decline over the following two years.</p>
<p>Price says he is striking the ball even better now than three years ago, although the same can't be said of his short game.</p>
<p>&quot;From tee-to-green I probably have more control than ever. My swing is more repetitive,&quot; he said. &quot;For the better part of 14, 15 months, my putting wasn't very good.&quot;</p>
<p>Price demonstrated that he was on the way back with a pair of victories in South Africa in February.</p>
<p>He stands 16th on this year's PGA Tour money list, despite playing just a handful of events, and has risen to ninth in the world rankings.</p>
<p>While Price tamed the ocean winds, however, many big-name players were blown away.</p>
<p>Among those to miss the cut, which fell at four-over 146, was Briton Nick Faldo, who failed to bounce back from his Masters misery, shooting a four-over 75 Friday for a 149 total. It marked the first time the three-time Masters champion had missed two successive cuts on the PGA Tour since the 1994 Memorial and U.S. Open.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very frustrating. I love this course,&quot; said Faldo, who will take three weeks off before returning for the Byron Nelson Classic.</p>
