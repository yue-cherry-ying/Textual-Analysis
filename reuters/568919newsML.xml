<headline>Tee-Comm shares fall, future in doubt.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Heavy selling wiped out half the value of Tee-Comm Electronics Inc shares on Thursday after the satellite television provider's future was cast into doubt.</p>
<p>Tee-Comm, which took on the big direct broadcast satellite players in the United States with its own offering and recently launched a service in Canada, suffered a liquidity crunch this week.</p>
<p>The company said on Thursday and may propose to its convertible subordinated debentureholders a swap of debentures for equity and the investment of additional capital.</p>
<p>The stock collapsed 1.05, or 51.22 percent, to 1.00 in turnover of 2.62 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;(Tee-Comm is) going to have a very, very difficult time going forward because even if the debenture-holders did agree to convert into common equity, it still doesn't change the fact that they are draining C$5 or C$6 million per month. Somebody has to fund that,&quot; said Doug Cunningham, a cable television industry analyst at Midland Walwyn Capital Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;They need a new source of financing, over and above any re-negotiation with the debenture holders because they are in a liquidity crisis,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Cunningham said Tee-Comm set itself up for a fall when it took on deep-pocketed giants like News Corp, MCI Communications Corp and Hughes (Electronics Corp) Direct with its AlphaStar satellite offering in the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;When some of the U.S. players are prepared to subsidize the satellite receiving equipment up front, it's a very, very expensive proposition and unfortunately Tee-Comm did not have the financial circumstance to participate in that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tee-Comm's problems were compounded when they were late getting into the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Company officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>Cunningham said Tee-Comm is unlikely to prove an attractive merger prospect for either a U.S. or Canadian direct-to-home satellite player.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't believe that Tee-Comm is necessarily large enough from a subscriber point of view to be of interest to any of the other U.S. competitors,&quot; Cunningham said.</p>
<p>Tee-Comm has about 43,000 subscribers in the United States and roughly 5,000 in Canada.</p>
<p>Although the financial problems at Tee-Comm did not come as a surprise to the market, much of the stock is in the hands of retail investors who had hoped the dark clouds would pass.</p>
<p>Traders said this is why the stock tumbled so sharply despite the suspicions of investors.</p>
<p>One analyst, who declined to be identified, said he thought debtholders may let the company go forward with its business plan after weighing the value of Tee-Comm's assets with the potential the company could bail itself out.</p>
<p>&quot;It's arguably worth more if they let it follow its business plan for some time,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;But from a business point of view, if this company were liquidated, what would its assets be. Boxes of no value, there would also be the uplink centers and the AT&amp;T (satellite space) lease,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Cunningham said the company may be forced to seek court protection if its debtholders fail to okay its proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;That may happen in the near-term, it really depends on the debenture holders in the short-term,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not believe that the debenture holders are going to wait any longer.&quot;</p>
