<p>A cut in the Philippine Central Bank's overnight borrowing rate on Thursday indicated the peso was stabilising after being hit by speculation in recent days, bankers and traders said.</p>
<p>The 25 basis-point cut to 11.25 percent came days after the Central Bank raised its key rate twice in less than a week by a total of 125 basis points to stop peso speculation.</p>
<p>The Central Bank raised rates to defend the peso from attack after the stock market fell sharply.</p>
<p>&quot;We are happier at the moment,&quot; Central Bank Treasurer Sergio Edeza told Reuters Financial Television on Thursday, when asked to comment on the current level of the peso-dollar exchange rate.</p>
<p>Last week, after the stock market's steep fall, the peso weakened to a year-low of 26.375 pesos. Following the Central Bank's action, it recovered to 26.365 at the start of the week.</p>
<p>On Thursday, it closed at 26.368 to the dollar.</p>
<p>Traders said banks had been anticipating the rate cut when they gave lower bid and offer quotes for Treasury bills in the secondary market earlier in the week.</p>
<p>The Central Bank, however, was still cautious over the possible adverse effect of its overnight borrowing rate cut on the peso.</p>
<p>The bank sought to temper the impact of the overnight borrowing rate cut by simultaneously raising its term reverse repo rates by 25 basis points each for the one, two and six month maturities.</p>
<p>Its move on the term reverse repos was also to align with the trend in the secondary market for T-bills, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;He (the Central Bank) just doesn't want rates to go down that fast,&quot; a foreign bank dealer said, adding that a sudden drop might renew peso speculation.</p>
<p>The rate reduction was triggered by Monday's announcement of a low inflation rate of 4.6 percent in April, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they (the Central Bank) can keep it at 11.25 percent until such time the peso-dollar stabilises,&quot; said Antonio Agcaoili, treasurer of Banco Santander in Manila.</p>
<p>Edeza also said the Central Bank had raised its overnight lending rate to 13 percent from 12.65 percent in line with the normalising market conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally, the Central Bank has a two percent spread between bid and offer and the past few days when we've raised interest rates we have not touched the lending rate of the Central Bank,&quot; Edeza said.</p>
<p>&quot;Since we think market conditions are beginning to normalise, we are trying to support the bid and offer difference at two percent,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Asked by Reuters Financial Television whether there would be further cuts in the overnight borrowing rate, Edeza said: &quot;We'll probably have to look at the next few days to make a final judgement as to whether we believe the market had truly normalised.&quot;</p>
