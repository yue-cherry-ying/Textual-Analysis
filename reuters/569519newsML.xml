<text>
<p>Living Centres of America Inc. and Grancare Inc. said Thursday they agreed to a $1.8 billion merger that will create the second largest long-term care provider in the United States.</p>
<p>Houston-based Living Centres, which provides health care services to senior citizens, said in March that it was exploring a possible sale, merger or other venture to bolster its competitive position.</p>
<p>Grancare, based in Atlanta, offers specialised medical and long-term care services.</p>
<p>Living Centres and Grancare are moderately sized nursing home companies that analysts have said would probably need to find merger partners to survive as the industry consolidates.</p>
<p>News of the deal comes a day after Vencor Inc., a long-term care company based in Louisville, Ky., launched a tender offer worth about $640 million for Transitional Hospital Corp., which has agreed to a $565 million takeover offer from Select Medical Corp.</p>
<p>Vencor, which operates hospitals, nursing centres and other facilities, in March acquired Georgia-based Theratx Inc. in a deal worth $550 million.</p>
<p>Nursing home chains are trying to merge because of growing competition and cost pressures because of managed care.</p>
<p>The merger of Living Centres and Grancare will form a company with 330 facilities with 38,000 beds in 21 states providing long-term care, drug and rehabilitation services, assisted living and speciality health services, the companies said.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Living Centres shareholders will receive $40.50 a share in cash for 93 percent of the outstanding Living Centre stock and retain the rest under a recapitalization plan.</p>
<p>As part of the recapitalization, investment group Apollo Management LP will invest $200 million and own 39.3 percent of the new company. GranCare shareholders will own 49.5 percent and Living Centres shareholders will own 11.2 percent.</p>
<p>High-profile Wall Street investor Leon Black is one of the investors in Apollo Management.</p>
<p>The stock of both companies rose after the deal was announced, with Living Centres up $1.25 to $37.75 and Grancare up $1 to $8.75, both in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The board of the combined company will include two directors from Living Centres, four from GranCare and four members named by Apollo. The new board will select a management team of executives from both companies.</p>
<p>Savings resulting from integrating the two companies would be about $30 million, the companies said.</p>
<p>The deals are subject to approval by regulators and shareholders of the two health care companies.</p>
