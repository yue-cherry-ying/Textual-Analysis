<p>Canada were quick to gloat on Saturday after the U.S. men's 4x100 metres relay team made a mess of the first baton chance in the first round heats at the world championships.</p>
<p>A calamitous exchange between Brian Lewis and Tim Montgomery destroyed the Americans' hopes for the second consecutive world championships followed a similar bungle in their heat at the 1995 world championships.</p>
<p>The Canadians, anchored by Donovan Bailey, won the 1995 title and triumphed again at last year's Atlanta Olympics.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a little sorry. It is not quite the same without them in the race,&quot; Bailey said.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of talking about how they are going to beat us, they should learn about the little baton. You have got to pass it to each other.&quot;</p>
<p>Team mate Glenroy Gilbert added: &quot;They came in saying our reign was over. It is not about reigns. It's about getting through the rounds. It's stunning but it's the Americans.</p>
<p>&quot;They have got the wheels. They have the talent. But there are way too many egos on the team.&quot;</p>
<p>The change went badly awry when Montgomery seemed to take off from his mark early and Lewis was unable to catch him and hand over the baton. Montgomery eventually had to turn his head around to see his team mate and the pair bumped into each other and left the track in disgust.</p>
<p>&quot;We just missed it,&quot; said Dennis Mitchell who was due to run the third leg. &quot;I still think we could have salvaged it but Montgomery hadn't got the momentum after that.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a young team in 1995, a young team in '96 and now another young team in '97. We'll put this thing together and get on top of it but it will take some time.&quot;</p>
<p>Lewis admitted he was in the wrong while Montgomery left the arena without talking to reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a poor mistake and I can't explain it,&quot; Lewis said. &quot;It was simply a misunderstanding of when to call for the stick.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States won the first the relay gold at each of the first world championships before they fell apart in Gothenburg.</p>
