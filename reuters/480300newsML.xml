<p>--------------------------(April 1)-----------------------------</p>
<p>* NZ debt sold at close in line with global weakness</p>
<p>* Volumes thin, small burst of selling at finish</p>
<p>* Traders keeping wary eye on U.S. reaction to NAPM tonight</p>
<p>New Zealand yields crept higher on light flows during Tuesday's session after a poor start on the back of global weakness.</p>
<p>The long bonds finished 13 basis points higher, while the mid-curve maturities were off nine. Dealers said there was some selling pressure first up as traders returning from the four-day Easter break encountered a bearish U.S. reaction to strong February wages data.  </p>
<p>The market came back slightly bid around lunchtime but by the close was deteriorating once more as dealers geared up for tonight's U.S. National Association of Purchasing Management's (NAPM) monthly index.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the general feeling is you'd want to go into that a little bit short rather than long,&quot; one local dealer said, adding that U.S. Treasuries had sufficient time to rally back from their weakness but failed to do so.</p>
<p>New Zealand debt securities held in quite well on the spreads against the dollar bloc during the session, only slightly underperforming the U.S. and Australia.  </p>
<p>Money market dealers said the hawkish sentiment from the bonds had filtered into their territory, with 90-day bank bill rates up 11 basis points by the close, to 7.80 percent.</p>
<p>The June futures contract was down 12 at 92.08, with 1,541 contracts traded.</p>
<p>Dealers said the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's weekly Treasury bill tender went quite well but was nothing startling. The weighted average yield for NZ$75 million of 98-day bills was 7.62 percent, against 7.43 percent for a similar maturity at last week's tender.</p>
