<p>Machine tool giant Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc. said Thursday its directors unanimously rejected a $747 million hostile takeover offer from Harnischfeger Industries Inc. as inadequate, and said it was in talks with others about a possible transaction.</p>
<p>Giddings said its board carefully considered the manufacturing equipment maker's offer of $19 a share and assumption of $116 million (corrects from $110 million) in debt, which Harnischfeger announced April 25.</p>
<p>Giddings, the largest supplier of industrial automation products and machine tools in North America, said financial adviser Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. said Harnischfeger's offer was financially inadequate for Giddings shareholders other than Harnischfeger.</p>
<p>Fond du Lac, Wis.-based Giddings also said it had had preliminary discussions with other parties about their interest in a possible transaction. It did not identify the parties.</p>
<p>Harnischfeger, based in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield, Wis., said it was examining Giddings' response to its offer.</p>
<p>Harnischfeger reiterated it plans to seek a special shareholder meeting where it would ask shareholders to remove Giddings' board. If the board is removed, Harnischfeger would then ask the new board to remove Giddings &quot;poison pill&quot; takeover defense.</p>
<p>Harnischfeger also said it has filed a lawsuit challenging the completeness and accuracy of filings Giddings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The lawsuit could be used as a vehicle to ask the court to prevent Giddings from employing its takeover defense or taking other action to prevent a takeover, Harnischfeger said.</p>
<p>At the time of the offer, many analysts doubted Giddings would be able to entertain a much higher bid. The $19-a-share offer was about a 39 percent premium over Giddings' closing price the day the offer was announced.</p>
<p>Giddings stock was at $20.875, up 37.5 cents, on Nasdaq in early afternoon. Harnischfeger rose 75 cents to $42.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Harnischfeger said when it made the offer it hoped to use Giddings to expand into the fragmented industrial products service business.</p>
<p>Giddings' products include drill point grinders, lathes, cutting tools and industrial computers.</p>
<p>Harnischfeger makes heavy machinery and manufacturing systems for papermaking, mining and materials handling.</p>
