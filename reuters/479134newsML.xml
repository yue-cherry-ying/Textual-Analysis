<title>USA: US spot resid prices pressured by growing supply.</title>

<text>
<p>U.S. spot residual fuel oil prices ended flat to lower Tuesday, pressured by growing supply and little spot demand in the Gulf and East Coast.</p>
<p>&quot;There isn't really any demand,&quot; said one cash resid trader, noting the continued slump in buying interest from most Northeast electric utilities.</p>
<p>An Illinois utility reportedly issued today a tender for over 100,000 barrels of 0.7 percent sulphur resid material for early April delivery.</p>
<p>&quot;It shouldn't put much pressure on prices,&quot; said one Gulf fuel oil dealer, referring to the tender's small volume.  </p>
<p>The dealer said there is ample supply from Caribbean and South America to meet any incremental fuel oil demand.</p>
<p>Separately, barge traffic on the Mississippi River continued to be restricted amid efforts to clean up a petrochemical spill after a barge carrying the toxic material capsized March 17.</p>
<p>USG three percent sulphur grade tightened to $13.75-14.00 a barrel from Monday's $13.75-14.2. USG three percent paper for April softened to $13.20-40 from $13.25-50 yesterday. One percent physical was still thinly discussed at $14.75-15.00.</p>
<p>In the New York harbor, the one percent physical quote narrowed to $15.50-75 from Monday's $15.50-16.00 as offers were heard as low as $15.50.</p>
<p>One percent NYH paper for balance of April was assessed at $15.15-15.30, slightly lower than $15.20-35 Monday.</p>
<p>NYH HSFO materials were thinly discussed with three percent remaining at $13.50-75.</p>
<p>NYMEX May crude futures extended yesterday's decline, settling down 13 cents at $20.28 a barrel.</p>
<p>Swing gas deliveries at New York City gate for Wednesday were quoted at $2.15-2.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) or $13.67 a barrel equivalent after a winter-like storm pushed across the Northeast yesterday.</p>
<p>Gas prices for April 2 delivery were lower than Monday's $2.40/mmBtu or $15.12/bbl equivalent on forecasts of more spring-like temperatures returning to the Northeast.</p>
<p>Natgas at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point, rose to $1.94/mmBtu or $12.22/bbl equivalent from Monday's $1.84/mmBtu or $11.59/bbl equivalent.</p>
