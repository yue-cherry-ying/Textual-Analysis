<p>Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman said on Monday he would meet with former Sandinista President Daniel Ortega later this week to try to jump-start stalled property talks.</p>
<p>&quot;I talked with Commander Daniel Ortega this afternoon and we agreed to meet to clarify, and leave in an advanced and defined state, the issue of property,&quot; Aleman told a news conference.</p>
<p>He did not specify the day of the meeting.</p>
<p>Representives of Aleman's right-wing government began a series of talks with the left-wing Sandinista opposition on Jan. 27 to resolve the sticky issue of the ownership of tens of thousands of properties confiscated by the Sandinista government in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Many of these houses, farms and businesses are being reclaimed by their former owners, creating bitter disputes that have exploded in violence in the past and threatened Nicaragua's political stability.</p>
<p>But the long-awaited talks collapsed at the end of February, with the Sandinistas saying they would not return to the bargaining table until the government had halted a wave of court-ordered evictions of families who had received property during the Sandinista land reform.</p>
<p>The two delegations have not met since, dimming hopes that Nicaragua would be able to negotiate a peaceful solution to its property problem.</p>
<p>The Sandinistas accused the government of trying to roll back their land reform and return property to family members and collaborators of former dictator Anastasio Somoza, who was toppled by the 1979 Sandinista revolution.</p>
