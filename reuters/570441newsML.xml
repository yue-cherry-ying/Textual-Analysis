<headline>Israeli media, experts cite U.S. &quot;Mega&quot; mistake.</headline>
<dateline>JERUSALEM 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Israeli media and experts said on Thursday a misunderstanding over the codename &quot;Mega&quot; was apparently responsible for the U.S. news report of a possible Israeli spy scandal in Washington.</p>
<p>The Washington Post said on Wednesday that the &quot;Mega&quot; in a communication intercepted by the National Security Agency was believed to be a U.S. official whose help Israel wanted in getting a copy of a sensitive letter from then secretary of state Warren Christopher to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.</p>
<p>The newspaper quoted an Israeli intelligence officer in Washington as having told his superior in Tel Aviv: &quot;The ambassador wants me to go to Mega to get a copy of this letter.&quot; The Post quoted the supervisor as saying no.</p>
<p>&quot;I know what this thing is,&quot; said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet secretary Danny Naveh when asked by army radio if he knew what Mega was. But Naveh declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>&quot;I can tell you that I know the facts, know the truth. When the truth becomes clear, I believe everyone will understand how false and ludicrous the story is,&quot; Naveh said.</p>
<p>Israel's Haaretz newspaper said Mega was apparently a mistaken decoding of &quot;Elga&quot; -- an old Israeli intelligence word for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p>The biggest daily Yedioth Ahronoth's main headline screamed: &quot;Israel's message to the United States: You misunderstood what you heard.&quot;</p>
<p>Some Israeli media reported the Jewish state would protest at its closest ally's wiretapping of what was supposed to be a secure communication.</p>
<p>Even Israeli masterspy Rafi Eitan, who was involved in the Jonathan Pollard spy affair that rocked Israeli-U.S. relations in the mid-1980s, said he believed it was all a mistake.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the word 'Mega' was used for something else,&quot; Eitan told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>Journalist Uri Dan, who writes about Israeli intelligence, told the radio: &quot;If it weren't so sad a story it would be funny.&quot; He said Mega was short for the codeword Megawatt.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoever covers intelligence matters knows that for more than 20 years two international authorities have been operating, one of which is called Megawatt and the other Kilowatt.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Megawatt was an international reservoir of intelligence information shared by the United States and other countries including NATO members and Israel.</p>
<p>The Washington Post said the FBI had opened an investigation to determine whether a senior U.S. government official had been passing highly sensitive information to the Israeli government.</p>
<p>The paper's sources said the investigation focused on U.S. officials who would have had access to the letter Christopher wrote to Arafat after successful negotiations to withdraw Israeli troops from most of the West Bank city of Hebron.</p>
<p>Israel's ambassador to Washington, Eliahu Ben Elissar, said on Wednesday political pressure on the Jewish state could be behind the news report at a time of stalled peace moves.</p>
<p>Relations between Israel and the United States, its main ally, were strained 12 years ago when Pollard, a Jewish U.S. naval intelligence officer, was caught passing information to Israel. He was jailed for life after pleading guilty.</p>
