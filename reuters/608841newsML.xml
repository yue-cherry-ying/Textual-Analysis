<p>Kazakhstan may meet its net grain harvest target of 14 million tonnes if the weather remains mild and farmers succeed in sowing at least 12 million hectares, a grains analyst said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;If the weather remains mild with temperatures not rising above their annual average and farmers sow to grains at least 12 million hectares, we may count on a net harvest of some 14 million tonnes,&quot; Galina Yergazina, analyst at Kazakhstan's Agro-industrial Exchange, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Sowing on Kazakhstan's vast steppes started around two weeks ago, but Agriculture Ministry officials declined to disclose the size of the total area to be planted this year.</p>
<p>Ministry spokesman Alexander Korablin said over three million hectares had been planted and that the total sown area would be known only in June, when the campaign ends.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot say what the total area sown to grain will be,&quot; he said. &quot;Many farms have started cultivating sunflower or turned to cattle breeding because this is more profitable.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year, Kazakhstan was hit by severe drought and gathered a disappointing 13.2 million gross tonnes of grain, or a net 11.6 million tonnes.</p>
<p>But analysts and officials said weather conditions this year were more favourable.</p>
<p>&quot;There is enough moisture in the soil and plants are well prepared for the summer heat,&quot; Korablin said.</p>
<p>&quot;The weather may be hot and dryish in eastern Kazakhstan this year, but we don't expect it to be as bad for crops as was last year's drought,&quot; Yergazina said.</p>
<p>But farmers face the usual shortages of combine harvesters, fuel and spare parts.</p>
<p>Korablin said agricultural machinery had fallen into disrepair over the past four years and 25 percent of the country's 80,000 combines were unusable.</p>
<p>However large its harvest, Kazakhstan will probably remain a large grain exporter, including to neighbouring Russia.</p>
<p>Yergazina said livestock numbers had fallen steeply and put annual domestic grain consumption at six million tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;I think official statements that Kazakhstan would export over five million tonnes this year are very realistic,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Even last year's poor harvest could not undermine grain exports.&quot;</p>
