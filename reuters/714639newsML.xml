<title>UK: UK warns Spain on Gibraltar as NATO summit starts.</title>
<headline>UK warns Spain on Gibraltar as NATO summit starts.</headline>

<p>Britain threatened on Tuesday to block Spain's full integration into NATO's command structure unless its military aircraft are allowed full use of the airport on the contested British colony of Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Speaking from Madrid as NATO leaders began a summit to decide on the enlargement of the western defence alliance, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook set conditions for Spain to become a fully paid up member.</p>
<p>&quot;Our case is that if Spain wishes to come fully into the alliance and into the integrated command structure, then it must behave as an ally when we want our military aircraft to go in and out of Gibraltar,&quot; Cook told BBC radio.</p>
<p>He said Spain was restricting the access of British military aircraft to the airport on Gibraltar, a rocky peninsula at the southern tip of Spain that dominates the western entrance to the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>&quot;Spain, at the moment, makes that very difficult because it does not provide proper air space for our military planes, or indeed our civilian planes, to take off there,&quot; Cook said.</p>
<p>Gibraltar passed to Spanish hands in 1462 and was seized by Britain in 1704. It was ceded by Spain in perpetuity under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 and became a British colony. Spain has claimed it ever since, generating regular tensions with London.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said on Monday that he hoped Spain would join NATO's military command later this year, but he admitted a number of obstacles would have to be overcome first.</p>
<p>One sticking point is Spain's insistence on a sub-regional Iberian command that would encompass all its territory, including the Canary islands.</p>
<p>But Cook said: &quot;We have never said, never recognised and do not recognise any probability of any Spanish sub-regional command having any direct command over Gibraltar. That's not on the cards.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked whether Britain would block Spain's integration into NATO's command structure without a deal over Gibraltar, he said: &quot;Yes, we can and yes, we will, unless there's an agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>Aznar hopes the Madrid summit will provide the impetus to settle the issue of Spain's integration by the end of the year.</p>
