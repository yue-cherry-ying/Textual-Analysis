<p>Italy's separatist Northern League leader Umberto Bossi has accused Pope John Paul of meddling in politics and misguiding the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Bossi, who clashed with the Church last year when he proclaimed independence for the northern &quot;Republic of Padania&quot;, said the Vatican had taken a step backwards under the leadership of the Polish-born Pontiff.</p>
<p>&quot;We're a long way from the times of Pope John XXIII, the great Lombard, who said the church's interest in politics was finished and it was time for people to busy themselves only with their consciences,&quot; he told reporters at his holiday home in northern Italy.</p>
<p>&quot;Since then, the Polish Pope has arrived, has taken the church and invested it much more with secular powers than with spiritual powers... Under him, the church has taken a step backwards.&quot;</p>
<p>Bossi said people in the wealthy north of Italy did not subscribe to calls for national unity which are broadly supported by the Church.</p>
<p>&quot;The faithful of Padania, of Bergamo, go to church with their green neckerchiefs (symbol of Padania),&quot; he said. &quot;They go and warn those who officiate: 'Don't try to sell us the racism and the colonialism of Rome'.&quot;</p>
<p>The Northern League, which has built its support on frustration with Italy's high taxes, central government bureaucracy and the slow pace of reform, won 3.7 million votes in the last general election.</p>
<p>It polled 30 percent in some northern strongholds, but failed to secure a balance of power in parliament, a defeat Bossi's critics says explains his secessionist agenda.</p>
<p>Italy has been a unified state only since 1870. Until then it was a patchwork of statelets ruled by popes, princes and foreign powers.</p>
