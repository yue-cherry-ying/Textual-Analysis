<p>Environmentalists on Sunday called Mexico's decision to ban the pesticide DDT within 10 years a bittersweet victory and a reminder that harmful pesticides are still widely used here.</p>
<p>They said the move was too little, too late, and doubted whether there are sufficient controls in Mexico to assure that produce is no longer bathed in dangerous chemicals.</p>
<p>Mexico agreed to gradually phase out DDT during a meeting in Pittsburgh on Friday of the Council of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, which was created under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>DDT, which is believed to cause cancer and is known to kill birds and other wildlife, was outlawed in the United States in 1973 but is still used widely in Mexico to kill malaria-carrying mosquitos and other insects in agriculture.</p>
<p>&quot;How is it possible that they've given us a term of 10 more years to continue dying?&quot; Maria Estela Gonzalez de Villarreal, Mexico City president of the Green Ecologist Party of Mexico, told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>&quot;I know that it is commonly used even though the whole world knows its dangerous and has consequences,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Officials with the Environment and Agriculture ministries were unavaible for comment over the weeekend.</p>
<p>The Mexican newspaper Uno Mas Uno reported that the Mexican delegation in Pittsburgh admitted that the United States and Canada pressured Mexico into the ban, and that Mexico would receive financial help from its NAFTA partners to phase out DDT.</p>
<p>Mexico's Group of 100 environmental organisation claims DDT is widely sprayed in Mexico City parks to kill mosquitos, harming children at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;More than anything it's a business for certain influential people with good contacts in the government,&quot; Homer Aridjis, Mexico's most prominent environemntalist and leader of the Group of 100, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He discarded the argument that Mexico is too poor to ban harmful pesticides, saying, &quot;There is always a social excuse here to justify negative things. Now we need more controls (on pesticides) in Mexico.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite his scepticism over Mexico's ability to curtail harmful pesticide use, Aridjis said the agreement in Pittsburgh was &quot;very important.&quot;</p>
