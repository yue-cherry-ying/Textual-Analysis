<p>At least one famous former champion thinks Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten can join him in tennis's hall of fame at the expense of Sergi Bruguera in Sunday's French Open men's final.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old Kuerten was not a name which meant much to John McEnroe a fortnight ago but the former Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion has seen enough at Roland Garros to suggest a carnival weekend in Paris is a distinct possibility.</p>
<p>According to McEnroe, Kuerten has &quot;got both the talent and the personality&quot; to emerge on top and the American also believes Bruguera's physically tough semifinal against Australia's Pat Rafter may have adversely affected his final prospects.</p>
<p>If there is one quality which Kuerten has displayed in abundance during the tournament it is stamina and Bruguera, still feeling his way back to form after the ankle ligament injury which disrupted him badly last year, could be vulnerable if the final goes the full distance.</p>
<p>There has never been a lower-ranked player in a French Open final but Kuerten, 66th in the world, also sees no reason why he cannot join Guillermo Vilas and Andres Gomez as South American winners in Paris.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll be nervous in the final but so will my opponent, even though he's won here twice,&quot; said Kuerten. &quot;It's like a dream for me but I'm not satisfied yet. I really want it more now. Why not? I'm just going to go on court and give it my best.&quot;</p>
<p>Kuerten's first win of his career happened in a challenger event in Curitiba, Brazil, just before he came to Paris. But his career has since gone into orbit.</p>
<p>He has already beaten recent former champions Thomas Muster and Yevgeny Kafelnikov but Bruguera's semifinal victim Pat Rafter believes the Spaniard will prove the toughest of the lot.</p>
<p>&quot;He uses so much top-spin and passes with a lot of depth. I thought I had one covered at the net and just clean missed it because it dipped so late,&quot; said the Australian.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a different type of player from Kuerten so I haven't offered him any advice. If I did, I'd stuff him right up.&quot;</p>
<p>Bruguera himself insists he is not yet back to the sort of form which won him his two French titles.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1993 and 1994 I was more relaxed. I was going for my shots and not thinking about things too much. I wasn't under much pressure but now it's different. I'm trying to come back, I have had so many problems and mentally it's more difficult.&quot;</p>
<p>On clay, though, he remains a force against anyone and if the 26-year-old from Barcelona wins the final only Bjorn Borg and Henri Cochet will have triumphed more often on Parisian clay.</p>
<p>&quot;If I'm not playing my best tennis, I still have more weapons on clay,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I can save matches without playing my best tennis. On hardcourt it's different.&quot;</p>
<p>Even so, like McEnroe, Bruguera has nothing but respect for the Brazilian who now blocks his path.</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing I know about him is that he's had the toughest draw in Paris. To beat Bjorkman, Medvedev, Kafelnikov and Muster you have to be playing consistently good tennis.&quot;</p>
