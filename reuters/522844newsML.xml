<p>India's United Front coalition on Saturday struggled to choose a leader to head a new centre-left government as right-wing Hindu nationalists urged the president to call snap elections.</p>
<p>Sharp differences cropped up among the United Front alliance's 15 parties over who should succeed caretaker Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, jeopardising efforts to form a government this weekend, politicians said.</p>
<p>&quot;Choosing a new prime minister is no joke,&quot; said Farooq Abdullah, chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir state and a United Front leader. &quot;That is the reason for the delay.&quot;</p>
<p>Sharad Yadav, a leader of Deve Gowda's Janata Dal party, said: &quot;It's a big decision. We can't take it in a hurry.&quot;</p>
<p>A string of contenders met United Front convenor Chandrababu Naidu, who was spearheading efforts to arrive at a consensus over who should lead the alliance and the nation.</p>
<p>On Friday, after the Congress party formally threw its support behind the coalition, United Front officials had said they were confident the alliance would select a new leader on Saturday and that a new government would be formed by Sunday.</p>
<p>President Shankar Dayal Sharma has indicated he would like a new government formed by Monday, when parliament reconvenes.</p>
<p>But splits quickly emerged between supporters of southern regional leader G.K. Moopanar, caretaker Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, and other contenders from the populous northern Hindi belt.</p>
<p>Senior United Front officials said they were confident a new leader would emerge. &quot;I can assure you the leader will be finalised by today,&quot; said Laloo Prasad Yadav, chief minister of Bihar state and one of the contenders for the top job.</p>
<p>Railway Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, another aspirant from the Janata Dal who associates said was losing interest in the prime ministership, said if no clear choice emerged from Naidu's informal talks, parliamentarians might have to vote.</p>
<p>The United Front's 15 parties have 178 votes in the lower house of parliament. The Janata Dal is its biggest component with 45 deputies, while three regional parties including Moopanar's Tamil Maanila Congress among them have 54.</p>
<p>Moopanar has been a front-runner in the race to succeed Deve Gowda, whose 10-month-old government fell on April 11 in a parliamentary vote of confidence.</p>
<p>A former Congress member, Moopanar has the backing of southern parties. But opposition from left-wing parties, suspicious of his ties to Congress, mounted on Saturday.</p>
<p>Emerging as a strong rival to Moopanar was Mulayam Singh Yadav, former chief minister of populous Uttar Pradesh state.</p>
<p>Yadav's backers said he would be able to lead the fight against the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) if, as many expect, the next government soon falls.</p>
<p>In the backdrop was caretaker Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, who supporters said could emerge as a consensus choice as he was respected and had no strong political enemies.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda was pushing a Janata Dal colleague from his home state of Karnataka, caretaker Human Resource Development Minister S.R. Bommai, United Front officials said.</p>
<p>BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee urged Sharma to call snap polls, which surveys show would bolster the BJP. The BJP leader said it would be immoral for Sharma to ask the United Front to form another government with the uneasy support of Congress.</p>
<p>&quot;A party may offer a helping hand to another. It cannot offer a helping leg,&quot; Vajpayee said.</p>
