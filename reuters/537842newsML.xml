<p>Twenty-three years after the Baalbek Festival of music, theatre and dance was halted by civil war, Lebanon is getting ready to revive what was once the Middle East's greatest annual cultural event.</p>
<p>From 1956 to 1974 the Baalbek Festival was one of the world's finest artistic spectacles and its absence since then has been a loss to music lovers all over the world.</p>
<p>May Carlos Arida, president of the festival committee, says the festival will resume on July 30 and her aim is eventually to recapture all its former glory.</p>
<p>&quot;The Lebanese public were very spoiled by the festival before the war and we hope to spoil them again,&quot; Arida told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Staged in Baalbek's immense acropolis, with the soaring columns of Roman temples framed against the snow-covered peaks of Mount Lebanon, the festival featured top international artists during its first 19 years and attracted spectators from all over the world.</p>
<p>CELLIST ROSTROPOVICH ON OPENING NIGHT</p>
<p>Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who performed at Baalbek in 1969, will reopen the festival by playing with the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France beneath the floodlit splendour of the great temples of Jupiter and Bacchus.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot tell you my joy, my emotion,&quot; said Arida, who has campaigned tirelessly for the festival, as she spoke of its revival.</p>
<p>&quot;I can hardly believe we are going to have Rostropovich and the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France with the temples of Bacchus and Jupiter illuminated behind them,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Before the war the Baalbek festival featured orchestral and chamber music, French and English theatre, classical and modern ballet, opera, jazz, Son et Lumiere and Lebanese and Arab folk singing and dancing.</p>
<p>The last festival lasted six weeks. Foreign tourists who arrived in cruise liners and chartered planes were among the 74,000 spectators who saw its nine spectacles and 32 performances.</p>
<p>The list of performers from 1956 to 1974 reads like a roll of honour of the greatest artists of the day.</p>
<p>Baalbek hosted the Royal Ballet with Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev, the Bolshoi Ballet, the Ballet Rambert, Maurice Bejart's Ballet du XXe Siecle and the Alvin Ailey City Centre Dance Theatre.</p>
<p>There was Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic, Kurt Masur and the Orchestre Gewandhaus de Leipzig, the New York Philharmonic, I Musici di Roma and the Amadeus Quartet and soloists like Rostropovich, Sviatoslav Richter, Wilhelm Kempff, Claudio Arrau and Jean-Pierre Rampal.</p>
<p>Jazz and pop fans flocked to see Ella Fitzgerald and Joan Baez, Miles Davis, the MJQ, Oscar Peterson, Dizzie Gillespie and Charlie Mingus.</p>
<p>A DREAM COMING TRUE</p>
<p>Arida, who has been president of the festival committee since 1973, told Reuters she never gave up hope during the 15 years of war when it could not take place.</p>
<p>Baalbek became a stronghold of Iranian Revolutionary Guards and the Shi'ite Moslem Hizbollah (Party of God), but each year Arida travelled over the mountains from Beirut, braving dozens of militia checkpoints, to visit employees of the Department of Antiquities guarding the acropolis.</p>
<p>Many of the Western hostages, who were kidnapped during the war by Moslem fundamentalist groups linked to Hizbollah, were held in Baalbek at some stage.</p>
<p>Arida also kept in touch with international artists like Rostropovich who played at Baalbek before the war and wanted to perform there again.</p>
<p>&quot;I never lost hope. All during the war we said that next year we will have the festival again,&quot; Arida said. &quot;We kept on having meetings of the executive committee and that helped to keep us going.&quot;</p>
<p>When the war ended in 1990 and the government in Beirut began restoring order, Arida and her committee visited President Elias Hrawi, honorary president of the festival, seeking authorisation to re-start it.</p>
<p>&quot;Each time we went to see him he said 'No, you can't do it this year.' But finally this year he told us to do it. He said 'This year you can do the festival. With the help of God, go ahead'.&quot;</p>
<p>NORMAL LIFE BACK TO BAALBEK, TOURISM BOOMING</p>
<p>The government has allotted funds for the committee and Arida believes there will be no problems in re-starting the festival.</p>
<p>&quot;There is an extraordinary change of attitude at Baalbek. It is as though nothing had happened there,&quot; she said. &quot;There is a fantastic calm and lots of tourists are going there.</p>
<p>&quot;The temple ruins are floodlit at night and it is an extraordinary sight.&quot;</p>
<p>She regrets that the committee lacks the time to organise a fullscale festival this year. There will be three spectacles with performances on seven days compared with six weeks in 1974.</p>
<p>&quot;But it takes one or two years to prepare a full programme and get famous performers to come. This year we have five months to prepare. What can we do?&quot; Arida said.</p>
