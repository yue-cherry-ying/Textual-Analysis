<headline>BASKETBALL-PURDUE'S FORTNER TO COACH U.S. NATIONAL WOMEN'S TEAM.</headline>
<dateline>WEST LAFAYETTE, Indiana 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>Nell Fortner, who coached Purdue to a share of the Big Ten title in her first year at the helm, was named head coach of the U.S. Women's National Basketball Team Programme on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Fortner was an assistant for the 1995-96 USA Women's National Team and a member of the 1996 gold-medal winning Olympic team staff.</p>
<p>&quot;This opportunity to serve as head coach for a United States team has been a dream of mine since I decided to become a basketball coach,&quot; said Fortner at a news conference at Purdue's Mackey Arena.</p>
<p>As USA National Team Programme coach, Fortner will be responsible for the training and coaching of the National Team for selected competitions and will be involved in the overall conduct of the women's competition programme.</p>
<p>&quot;Nell's experiences with the 1995-96 USA Women's National and Olympic teams, combined with her success this past year as head coach at Purdue, made her uniquely qualified to help us undertake this National Team Programme,&quot; said USA Basketball Executive Director Warren Brown.</p>
<p>The biggest tournaments Fortner will point to are the 1997 world championship qualifying tournament in Argentina, the 1998 world championship in Berlin, and the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.</p>
<p>Purdue returned only four players from the previous season, but finished 12-4 in the Big Ten to earn a share of the regular season conference title. Purdue advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament before being beaten in overtime by Old Dominion.</p>
<p>Fortner spent five seasons (1991-95) as an assistant with Louisiana Tech, who posted a 123-37 mark during that time.</p>
