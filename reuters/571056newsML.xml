<p>Indonesia's Moslem-based minority party has forecast a strong showing at this month's general election, partly due to help from disenchanted supporters of a rival party, the Antara news agency reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Ismail Hasan Metareum, head of the United Development Party (PPP), was quoted as saying a large number of supporters of ousted Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) leader Megawati Sukarnoputri would vote for the PPP during the poll on May 29.</p>
<p>&quot;Our vote-getting target could well be surpassed,&quot; Metareum said without elaborating.</p>
<p>The PPP and the PDI are battling the much-larger ruling Golkar party for 425 elected seats in the 500-member parliament. The rest of the seats are filled by the military, which does not vote.</p>
<p>Golkar, in power for the last 30 years under President Suharto, is seeking to push its share of the vote to more than 70 percent from the 68 percent it won at the last polls in 1992. The PPP won 17 percent and the PDI 15 percent.</p>
<p>Last year, Megawati was ousted from the PDI leadership by a government-backed faction and she along with her supporters have not been allowed to contest this month's elections.</p>
<p>Public support for the government-backed PDI faction has been low during the campaign after Megawati called on her supporters to boycott electioneering.</p>
<p>The PPP sent Mudrick Sangidoe, chief of the party branch in Solo, Central Java, to meet Megawati at her residence on Tuesday, PDI legislator and Megawati aide Soetardjo Soerjogoeritno told Reuters.</p>
<p>Sangidoe asked Megawati to allow her many loyalists in Solo to join the PPP, he said. Megawati, who was not available for comment, gave no commitment but appeared to approve the move, Soerjogoeritno said.</p>
