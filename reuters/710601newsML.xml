<p>Native American tribes are set to propose major changes to a controversial water project in southern Colorado that would slash the costs to the U.S. government by two-thirds, a tribal advocate said Monday.</p>
<p>The long-delayed Animas-La Plata project was originally priced at more than $740 million, with the federal government due to cover $500 million.</p>
<p>The new plan would cost a total of $290 million in federal, state and local contributions, said Christine Arbogast of lobbying firm Kogovsek and Associates.</p>
<p>The project was designed to pump water from the Animas River into a reservoir to channel water into the La Plata River in order to supply ranchers, industries, municipalities and Ute and Navajo tribes under a 1988 water settlement.</p>
<p>Critics have tried to kill the project over the last several years because of its huge price tag, its environmental impact, and because only one-third of the diverted water was due to go to the tribes.</p>
<p>Under the new proposal, Arbogast said two-thirds of the water would go to the tribes. But opponents said they believed the smaller plan would still damage the environment, and would give the tribes less water than first envisioned.</p>
<p>&quot;The tribes are not going to get as much water as originally promised,&quot; said Jill Lancelot, a lobbyist for Taxpayers for Common Sense, which has led the fight against the Animas-La Plata project.</p>
<p>Congress last year approved $9 million in funds that were meant to be used to help offset the expected damage from the project to elk habitat. That money went unspent, but the Clinton administration asked for an additional $6 million for the project for the 1998 fiscal year.</p>
<p>Senate and House subcommittees are set to outline their plans for water-project spending this week, but congressional aides, and environmental and taxpayer advocates said they did not know whether the bills would include new money for Animas-La Plata.</p>
<p>Arbogast said the tribes were announcing their proposal this week to ensure that opponents in the spending debate knew the Utes were now pushing a significantly smaller plan.</p>
