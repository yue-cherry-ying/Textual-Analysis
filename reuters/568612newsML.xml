<title>USA: Russian PGM exports to resume late May - Almaz US.</title>
<headline>Russian PGM exports to resume late May - Almaz US.</headline>

<p>Russia's platinum group metals (PGM) export agency, Almazjuvelriexport (Almaz), expects to resume exports of platinum and palladium in about two weeks, a spokesman for the U.S. branch of Almaz told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no question of maybe this time, the decree was signed on Monday and it usually takes a couple of weeks to obtain the export licence from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, so shipments should start around the end of May or maybe in June,&quot; said Max Belov, a spokesman for the U.S. branch of Almaz, based in Greenwich, Connecticut said.</p>
<p>Russian exports of platinum group metals have been suspended since December 1996 due to fiscal and administrative problems in Moscow.</p>
<p>Russia supplies about 60 percent of the world's palladium and about 25 percent of its platinum.</p>
<p>&quot;Spot market sales and contract sales should both begin again soon, but we are unable to confirm the size of the export quotas,&quot; Belov said.</p>
<p>&quot;The export quotas are a state secret and I do not even know them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The question of how much platinum group metals Russia will export in 1997 is the key to platinum and palladium prices which have risen sharply this year, as world stockpiles have been drawn down in the absence of Russian supplies.</p>
<p>Last year, Russian exports of palladium rose sharply driving the palladium price down to three year lows around $113.50 an ounce in December 1996, before the price recovered on the spot market to around $158.00 an ounce Thursday.</p>
<p>Wednesday in Moscow, Almaz deputy director Sergei Gorny told Reuters the export quota decree had been signed, though he was unable to estimate when supplies would resume.</p>
<p>Overnight, traders in Japan said they had heard from Almaz officials that representatives would visit Japan at the end of May to resume talks on the PGM export supply contract with Japan.</p>
<p>Japan and the U.S. are the world's two biggest consumers of PGMs which are used mostly in pollution control devices in automobiles and in semi-conductors in the computer industry. ((Clive McKeef, New York Commodities Desk, 212-859-1641))</p>
