<p>Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati warned Poland's parliament on Thursday that opposition to the country's NATO membership was growing as the goal drew nearer.</p>
<p>&quot;The leading opponent remains the Russian Federation, but objections and doubts are also visible in certain Western political circles,&quot; he said in his annual report to the house.</p>
<p>Rosati said Poland would have to stick coolly to its plans for entering the alliance, ensure the goal was not harmed by irresponsible campaigning for this year's parliamentary elections and argue well against opponents of NATO enlargement.</p>
<p>Poland hopes a document likely to be agreed between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation this month will clear the way for its entry process to begin.</p>
<p>But it is still concerned over opposition from within NATO countries, especially as the pact's enlargement will have to be ratified by parliaments of all 15 member states.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Poland's ex-communist President Aleksander Kwasniewski told a news conference he had been assured by Rudolf Scharping, head of Germany's opposition Social Democrats, that the party fully backed NATO's eastward enlargement.</p>
<p>This was important because the SPD might in future form a coalition with the Greens who had some doubts on this score, the president said after a meeting with Scharping.</p>
<p>Rosati named Poland's four foreign policy priorities as joining NATO in the next two years, a rapid start to European Union accession talks, developing the best possible relations with neighbouring countries and active regional Cooperation.</p>
<p>He said Poland could be one of the first new EU members, but its diplomats had a difficult job.</p>
<p>&quot;On one hand there must be a strong defence of Polish interests, especially in the area of competition and using the Union's aid instruments to help restructuring in Poland.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other, there must be clear signals to the EU member states proving our determination in aiming for rapid membership of that organisation,&quot; Rosati told parliament, which will debate his speech on Friday.</p>
<p>Touching on various planks of Polish policy in a speech which contained few surprises, Rosati laid special stress on flourishing ties with Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;A planned July meeting of the presidents, heads of government and foreign ministers will be a special, unprecedented event in the history of both countries, explicitly demonstrating the new character of mutual ties.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Relations with the United States remain our priority,&quot; Rosati said, stressing a need to improve Poland's image there.</p>
<p>He said keeping up an improvement in relations with the Jewish diaspora, helped by moves over restoring communal Jewish property in Poland and over preservation of the former Nazi German Auschwitz death camp, were important for U.S. links.</p>
<p>Rosati hailed the improvement in Polish-Ukrainian ties as a great achievement and important factor in Europe's stability.</p>
<p>But he made clear Poland's reservations about the actions of strongly pro-Russian President Alexander Lukashenko in the other neighbouring former Soviet republic, Belarus.</p>
