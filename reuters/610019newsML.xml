<text>
<p>Banque Audi shares rose $1 on the Beirut Stock Exchange for the third successive day on Friday, completing a 15 percent jump to $23 from $20 when it began a sudden surge last Tuesday.</p>
<p>Banque Libanaise pour le Commerce also rose to $16.5 from $16.375 and Bank of Beirut was unchanged at $3.5625.</p>
<p>Solidere A and B shares were unchanged at $10.50 (corrects from $10.25) and $10.75.</p>
<p>Of the four industrial stocks Ciments Libanais rose to $1.2813 from $1.25 and Ciments Blancs jumped to $5.1875 on trade of 200 shares from $4.75 when it was last traded on May 5.</p>
<p>Eternit was unchanged at $2 and there was no trade in Uniceramic. The LIBX bank index rose 1.75 percent to 143.96, the LISPI general index rose 1.51 percent to 88.54 and the BLOM general index rose 0.54 percent to 930.47.</p>
<p>Brokers cited market rumours of a big purchase of Banque Audi shares as the possible reason for its three-day surge, which surprised the market. They have also said the shares are following a rise by the bank's GDRs which have reached $24.25-$24.75 on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Ali Husseini of Middle East Capital Group, a Beirut-based finance and brokerage house, said Banque Audi's rise was pushing the market up.</p>
<p>Banque Audi shares have now risen 53 percent since listing in January.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think they are going to go down next week. There is still bid in the market. We might see them level off or rise slightly,&quot; Husseini said.</p>
<p>With Audi's P/E ratio against projected 1997 earnings now at 13.45, Banque Libanaise pour le Commerce was now looking a good buy at 10.24 after two or three weeks of consolidation after its rapid rise earlier this year.</p>
<p>&quot;The P/E ration of BLC looks very good value. I think the share will go up next week,&quot; Husseini said. &quot;Bank of Beirut is also well bid,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Total volume was just over 146,000 shares and value was $1,682,000.</p>
