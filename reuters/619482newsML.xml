<p>Hormone implants meant to control South Africa's growing number of elephants instead drive bull elephants wild with lust, New Scientist magazine reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The birth control implants keep the females in a continuous state of heat, according to conservationists who have been testing them out.</p>
<p>The elephant population in South Africa's Kruger Park has been growing with poaching under better control, and gamekeepers, unhappy with having to cull the elephants, thought they would try birth control.</p>
<p>But oestrogen implants modelled on human birth control methods backfired badly when tested in 10 cow elephants.</p>
<p>&quot;They were in this state of continual false oestrus, and the bulls would not leave them alone,&quot; Ian Whyte, the park's elephant specialist, told New Scientist.</p>
<p>&quot;When we tracked them from the air, we would find a cow on her own surrounded by up to eight bulls. That sort of thing, we feel, is not the way we want to treat the elephants.&quot;</p>
<p>The excited bulls also sometimes separated the cows from their babies.</p>
<p>The magazine quoted Jay Kirkpatrick, an expert in wildlife contraception at Zoo-Montana in Billings, as saying hormonal birth control was abandoned there in the 1970s because of its impracticality and the changes in behaviour it produced.</p>
<p>Instead, scientists are testing an anti-sperm vaccine that causes the female's body to reject sperm.</p>
