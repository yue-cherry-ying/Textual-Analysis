<p>Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said on Thursday he would meet Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino at the weekend to discuss deadlock over planned elections in the troubled Balkan state.</p>
<p>Dini also said he hoped to organise an international conference on Albania as part of an overall programme aimed at restoring stability to Europe's poorest country.</p>
<p>Albanian political parties have so far failed to agree on a new electoral law which is needed to open the way for a national ballot scheduled for the end of June.</p>
<p>&quot;We are working with direct contact to encourage all the parties to reach an agreement which will allow the elections,&quot; Dini said in a statement.</p>
<p>Italy is leading a 6,000-strong multinational force to oversee humanitarian aid deliveries in Albania, but Defence Minister Beniamino Andreatta warned on Wednesday that the troops would be withdrawn if elections were not held by June.</p>
<p>Dini said the electoral law had to guarantee adequate representation for all Albanian parties and urged a reorganisation of the security forces to ensure a fair vote.</p>
<p>He also backed Albanian President Sali Berisha's call for the disbandment of rebel committees which were set up in the south of the country in the wake of widespread rioting over failed pyramid savings schemes in February.</p>
<p>Fino has denied Berisha's accusations that his Socialist party has anything to do with the committees, and says they should be disbanded after a date is set for the elections.</p>
<p>Dini said he would bring up these issues at a meeting with Fino and other members of the Tirana government when they met in Rome on Saturday. He added that the Albanian delegation would then go for talks in Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;We are also thinking about holding a multinational conference on Albania which will signal the start of the process of stabilisation and the economic and financial recovery of the country,&quot; Dini said.</p>
<p>He said he hoped leading Albanian figures, European Union countries, international financial institutions and the United States would all attend the conference.</p>
<p>He gave no indication when it might be held, but said such a meeting would help restore confidence in Albania and persuade people to hand over weapons seized from army depots earlier this year when the country slid into near-anarchy.</p>
<p>Dini's comments came as European mediator Franz Vranitzky held talks in Tirana with Fino and Berisha over the disputed electoral legislation.</p>
<p>Fino has said his all-party government will adopt a new law by majority and warned that he would resign if parliament failed to approve the bill.</p>
