<p>The Venezuelan bolivar closed softer at 481.50/482.50 per dollar after the Central Bank mostly stayed away from a quiet session and benchmark six month TEM bill yields fell 123 basis points to 17.48 percent in Wednesday's auction, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Central Bank came in, but only a little. It gave a few small touches to keep the market calm. But few dollars were needed,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Venezuela's foreign exchange market is unusual in that the Central Bank is its largest single supplier of dollars, which blurs the difference between the Central Bank supplying liquidity and intervening.</p>
<p>Local business chamber Conindustria president Pedro Carmona also voiced concern Thursday that the bolivar was increasingly over-valued.</p>
<p>&quot;We calculate the bolivar is now around ten percent over- valued, a tolerable level ... but that could more than double by year end,&quot; Carmona told reporters after presenting Conindustria's first quarter of 1997 business confidence survey.</p>
<p>Venezuela continues to pursue an inflation-fighting strong bolivar policy, where the currency ostensibly floats between slowly depreciating bands set by Central Bank intervention.</p>
<p>Critics say the policy has left the bolivar increasingly over-valued with the exchange rate little-changed since price and currency controls were removed in April last year.</p>
