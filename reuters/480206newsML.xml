<p>Japan's domestic vehicle sales jumped in March ahead of a rise in the national sales tax, an industry official said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Japan's domestic vehicle sales rose 12.4 percent from a year earlier to 830,864 units in March, surpassing the previous record for that month of 788,880 units set in 1990.</p>
<p>Japan raised the consumption tax to five percent on Tuesday from the previous three percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Higher domestic sales in March were not only due to demand from people who did not want to pay the two percentage point rise (in the tax) but also from people replacing cars that were bought during the period of the bubble economy in the late 1980s and early 1990s,&quot; an official with the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said.</p>
<p>The official said he did not expect a drop-off in sales in April despite the onset of the higher tax. &quot;Sales in April are likely to post gains year-on-year because carmakers have substantial backlog orders and might have intentionally put off registering cars in March to avoid a sudden drop in and after April,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is still up in the air when domestic vehicle sales will decline (year-on-year) as a result of the increase in the sales tax. In 1989 when the first sales tax was introduced, people were upset about the implementation of the tax, but this time, people are relatively calm,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not clear whether there will be much of an impact,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The official said there were several factors that would help car sales such as the introduction of new models and low-priced versions of existing models, higher company bonus payments this spring and potentially huge car replacement demand.</p>
<p>The industry body said in March it expected domestic vehicle sales to be 5.36 million units in 1997-98.</p>
<p>It also said Japan's domestic vehicle sales in the year to March 1997 rose 7.6 percent from the previous year to 5.56 million units, the third successive year of gains.</p>
