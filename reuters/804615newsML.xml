<p>China could succeed this year in cutting its fiscal deficit by 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion), with individual income tax rising and stronger state firms generating higher taxes, state media said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Fiscal revenue was estimated to grow 17 percent to 861.9 billion yuan, while spending would increase by 14.7 percent to 907.4 billion yuan, said a report by the State Information Centre (SIC) carried in the China Daily Business Weekly.</p>
<p>That would cut the deficit to 45.5 billion yuan from the present estimate of 57 billion yuan, compared with a deficit of nearly 61 billion in 1996, it said.</p>
<p>The ratio of fiscal revenue to Gross Domestic Product was expected to crawl to 11.6 percent from 11.3 percent, it said.</p>
<p>However, Su Ming, deputy director of the Research Institute of Fiscal Science under the Ministry of Finance warned that the 10 billion reduction in the deficit could be overambitious.</p>
<p>He cited huge additional expenditures, including a wage increase for state employees and the cost of celebrations marking the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty on July 1 as well as higher export tax rebates as factors affecting the anticipated reduction.</p>
<p>China had said it wanted to balance its budget by the end of the century, although officials have now said this target is almost certainly out of reach.</p>
<p>In the first half, China's fiscal revenues grew by 29.9 percent year-on-year to 390.2 billion yuan, while expenditures increased 21.1 percent to 351.2 billion yuan, resulting in a 38 billion yuan surplus.</p>
<p>The increased stamp tax on stock trading, higher individual income tax payments, an increase in customs duties through elimination of certain holidays last year and higher taxes from improving state firms would boost revenues, the SIC said</p>
