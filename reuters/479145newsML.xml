<p>Bridgeport, Conn., which said Tuesday that it was one of 11 cities and towns to take advantage of a state offer to run its welfare programs, looks for the takeover to save it about $3 million a year.</p>
<p>Much of the savings were expected to flow from reducing the paperwork burden, for both Bridgeport and the state. Chris Duby, a spokesman for Mayor Joseph Ganim, said &quot;It's really an effort, in the end, to save a lot of administrative effort into the way welfare services are delivered.&quot;</p>
<p>Bridgeport has about 1,500 welfare recipients, down sharply from around 5,000, before the Ganim Administration started trimming the caseload by imposing work requirements.</p>
<p>The city has a budget of around $345 million and expects to finalize a pact for fiscal 1998 by the last week in May.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Gov John Rowland was not immediately available to comment on the welfare program, which was enacted by the legislature last year and was offered to 14 cities and towns. Other municipalities that were taking advantage of the state's offer included Hartford, New Haven, Stamford, Norwalk, Manchester, and Meriden, Duby said.</p>
