<p>Racal Electronics Plc, the defence to electronics group, confirmed on Tuesday that it is considering taking on an equity partner in its network services business.</p>
<p>Richard Poston, director of corporate communications, told Reuters it was one option being looked at but added it was too premature to comment on the potential value of an external investment.. &quot;We are looking at a number of options for the future,&quot; he said. &quot;One is whether to have a partner. We will analyse whether any partner would bring value.&quot;  </p>
<p>Racal Network Services is the seventh biggest provider of managed data network services worldwide and number two in the UK, with turnover of 270 to 280 million stg.</p>
<p>The group said it was seeking options to grow this business ahead of deregulation of the European Union's telecom services from 1998 onwards.</p>
<p>The scope for market growth at home is also considerable, with analysts predicting that it will expand by 20 percent a year.</p>
<p>Racal is believed to be searching for an equity partner because its current gearing remains high at 75 percent.  </p>
<p>Gearing was pushed ahead by the acquisition of the British Rail Telecoms (BRT) business in 1995 which gave the network services division a nationwide network and is seen as a key springboard for future growth.</p>
<p>Possible equity partners in the network services division could be telecoms groups including GTE Corp and Southwestern Bell of the U.S. and Mercury, a division of Cable and Wireless Plc, said the Financial Times newspaper on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The FT added that the investment could be in excess of 500 million stg.</p>
