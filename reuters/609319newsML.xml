<title>USA: U.S. cash crude prices retreat in low volume day.</title>
<headline>U.S. cash crude prices retreat in low volume day.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Cash crude prices in the U.S. declined over the course of a tepid, dull session ahead of the Memorial Day holiday on technically-inspired selling.</p>
<p>July West Texas Intermediate/Cushing wound out the week 20-25 cents lower at $21.55-65 a barrel.</p>
<p>The last trading day for June outrights saw outrights dip to a 35-40 cents discount against the new prompt July. June grade barrels moved at wide ranges in low volume.</p>
<p>Domestic cash grades strengthened on firmer CFDs, a narrowed Brent-WTI arbitrage and the closure of a key pipeline link connecting U.S. Gulf crude streams to the Capline system.</p>
<p>South Louisiana LOCAP pipeline operations were expected to resume sometime over the weekend, likely by Sunday. A leak was discovered Thursday, forcing the shutting in of some 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude throughput.</p>
<p>LOOP officials said force majeure measures would not be needed, as lost supply would be accounted for over the rest of the month.</p>
<p>For the day, Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James was talked late at five cents under to flat against July outrights, with only modest dealings.</p>
<p>Heavy Louisiana Sweet/Empire ranged around a 47-50 cents discount, and Midland/WTI was steady at 35-40 cents cheaper than July WTI/Cushing.</p>
<p>West Texas Sour/Midland was sold at $1.50 under, and talked at that value late in the session.</p>
<p>Eugene Island barrels barely moved around a $1.50-55 discount. July WTI/Cushing Postings Plus was at $2.00-05.</p>
