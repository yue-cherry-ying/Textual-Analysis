<headline>Italy details large third tranche ENI sale.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1997-06-07</dateline>

<p>The Italian Treasury said on Saturday it would offer a 12.5 percent stake in energy giant Eni at the forthcoming third tranche sale of company stock, in the biggest international share placement seen this year.</p>
<p>Treasury director general Mario Draghi told a news conference a further 1.9 percent of Eni capital would be sold-off in case of strong demand as part of a so-called &quot;green shoe&quot; arrangement.</p>
<p>Bookbuilding for the sale is due to kick off on Monday with a roadshow in Milan. The public retail sale runs from June 23-27 and the share price will be fixed on June 28.</p>
<p>If all the green shoe is taken up, the Treasury will be left with a 54.6 percent stake in the oil and gas group.</p>
<p>Draghi indicated that if there was huge demand for the third tranche placement, Italy might release more shares for sale, but added that the state would not drop its holding below the 51 percent threshold in this placement.</p>
<p>He said that at current market values, the sale was worth some 10 trillion lire, assuming the green shoe was fully tapped.</p>
<p>However retail investors will be offered at least a three percent discount to Eni's closing share price on June 27. They will also be offered one free share for every 10 held, so long as they keep their third tranche stock for at least 12 months.</p>
<p>The Treasury said a minimum 400 million shares will be offered to Italian retail investors through a public sale offer (OPV), with up to 25 percent of this reserved for Eni employees.</p>
<p>A further 300 million shares have been earmarked for Italian and foreign institutional investors outside north America. Some 150 million shares will be reserved for U.S. and Canadian institutions.</p>
<p>The minimum lot for the OPV will be 1,000 shares.</p>
<p>Eni has the biggest market capitalisation on the Milan stock exchange, the third biggest in Europe and the sixth biggest in the world.</p>
<p>Some 15 percent of the company was sold off in an initial placement in November 1995. The price was set at 5,250 lire per share and the Treasury raised some 6.3 trillion lire.</p>
<p>In October 1996, a further 16 percent was placed on the market at 6,910 lire per share, raising 8.74 trillion lire.</p>
<p>Eni shares closed in Milan on Friday at 8,739.</p>
<p>Italy's IMI and CSFB are global co-ordinators for the offer.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the third tranche offer, the Treasury is committed to not placing any more stock on the market for at least six months.</p>
