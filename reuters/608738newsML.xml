<title>LITHUANIA: Lithuanian nuclear plant safety shutdown possible.</title>
<headline>Lithuanian nuclear plant safety shutdown possible.</headline>

<p>Lithuania's huge Ignalina nuclear power plant could have to be shut temporarily if crucial safety measures were not implemented in time, the country's economy ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;It might be that unit one and unit two could be out of operation,&quot; economy ministry adviser Jonas Kazlauskas told reporters.</p>
<p>Ignalina's reactors are the largest of the infamous Chernobyl-style RBMK models operating in the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Efforts are under way to improve safety during routine maintenance periods after an international safety analysis report this year said extra safety measures needed to be taken.</p>
<p>&quot;These measures exceed 100, but we need to urgently implement six of the safety analysis report measures to start operation of unit one after routine maintenance,&quot; Kazlauskas said.</p>
<p>He said the measures include the completion of a draft of emergency procedures and the start of construction of a containment system to prevent the leakage of radiation.</p>
<p>&quot;It's possible that both reactors will not be working for some time if these measures are not implemented,&quot; Kazlauskas told Reuters. &quot;But we think this will not be the case.&quot;</p>
<p>Kazlauskas did not say when or how long Ignalina could be out of service.</p>
<p>Reactor number one is currently undergoing routine maintenance.</p>
<p>&quot;According to the former schedule, it should start back up on July 1, but we need to implement all six measures,&quot; Kazlauskas said. &quot;We think this maintenance could be prolonged for one or two months after July 1.&quot;</p>
<p>Reactor number two is expected to undergo routine maintenance after the first reactor is up and running, Kazlauskas said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy and Sweden's International Project on Thursday pledged $2 million to help upgrade safety at the plant, which supplies the small Baltic state with 85 percent of its electricity needs.</p>
<p>The plant, which is slated for permanent closure early next century, has been the scene of a number of incidents which have raised concerns about its safety.</p>
<p>The plant was closed briefly last August when a leak was detected in its cooling system. In November 1994, it was shut in response to a bomb threat.</p>
