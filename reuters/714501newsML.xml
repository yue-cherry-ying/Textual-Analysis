<p>Spain abandoned its historic ambivalence towards NATO and pledged to take a full role in the new command structure at the start of an alliance summit in Madrid on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, addressing leaders of the 15 other NATO countries at the opening session, said he was satisfied with progress made so far in negotiations on establishing a new sub-regional command in Madrid.</p>
<p>&quot;As you know, Spain decided to take the necessary steps for participating fully in the alliance's new command structure, in accordance with the decision taken by the Spanish parliament,&quot; Aznar said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have started to do this and will continue to do so. We view the progress made with satisfaction and I trust that everything will be completed as soon as possible,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>NATO was founded in 1949 but Spain only joined in 1982 under a centre-right government. Five months later, the pacifistic Socialist party came to power and froze further integration pending a referendum that was held in 1986.</p>
<p>By a narrow 52 percent majority, Spaniards said yes to NATO on condition they stayed out of the military structure.</p>
<p>While modern Spain had a strong anti-military tradition that made it difficult to embrace NATO, Spaniards were also sympathetic to French complaints NATO was American-dominated and Europeans should have a bigger say in the command structure.</p>
<p>But while France still continues to resist joining the military command, the Spanish parliament voted in November to integrate fully, with the stipulation that the country must remain free of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Just as the Socialists realised in 1982 that their participation in NATO was essential to securing a place in the European Union, Aznar knows full integration is another step towards putting Francoist isolationism behind and joining the ranks of states which will steer Europe into the 21st century.</p>
<p>&quot;I want Spain to share responsibilities and obligations, aspirations and ambitions with the strongest countries of Europe,&quot; Aznar said in newspaper interview at the weekend.</p>
<p>After a meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday, Aznar said there were still problems to be ironed out in the Spain-NATO talks but he hoped to make a final decision on joining the command structure by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Spain has demanded an Iberian sub-regional command in Madrid with control over all Spanish territory including the Canary islands and the north African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla as well as control over access to the Mediterranean through the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>
<p>One sticking point in the talks appears to be control over the waters between Spain's southern coast and the Canary islands in the Atlantic which NATO does not want ceded to Spanish control.</p>
<p>Clinton welcomed Spain's commitment to NATO on Monday but added the new command structure must be militarily defensible.</p>
