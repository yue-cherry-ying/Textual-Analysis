<p>Failed Republican presidential candidate Lamar Alexander, who is widely expected to run again in 2000, said he believes his party lacks a dominant voice in national affairs.</p>
<p>&quot;We seem to be a little uncertain about our mission,&quot; Alexander told reporters following a speech at an Iowa Republican Party fund-raiser in Des Moines Monday night.</p>
<p>&quot;Our party is sort of sitting around the campfire, wondering about a mission, looking for a leader. That's not all bad. It means a new generation of leaders are going to step up,&quot; Alexander said.</p>
<p>The former Tennessee governor and Education Department secretary in the Bush administration finished fourth in Iowa's February 1996 precinct caucuses and saw his popularity surge briefly in the crowded field before fading quickly in the 1996 race, won by eventual nominee Bob Dole.</p>
<p>&quot;Our party, nationally, is in transition,&quot; Alexander said. &quot;This is the first time since World War II that the national Republican party has not had a dominant leader. Ever since (President Dwight) Eisenhower, all the way through Bob Dole, we've always had somebody at the top.&quot;</p>
<p>Though he said it was too early for him to declare his candidacy for 2000, Alexander has laid the groundwork for a campaign and commissioned a survey of 400 Iowa Republicans earlier this month.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not too early to start setting the agenda, though. We need a conservative governing agenda for the national Republican party and I'm going to be right in the thick of helping to establish that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>If he does decide to run again, Alexander said he learned he would &quot;need to invest in an atlas of Iowa.&quot;</p>
