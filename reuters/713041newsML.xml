<p>Panama said on Monday it was sending a 1,000-strong police force to beef up security at its troubled border zone following reports of Colombian paramilitary groups crossing in search of guerrillas.</p>
<p>&quot;Panama does not have the personnel to guard the border,&quot; National Police spokesman Jose Zamora told Reuters.</p>
<p>The 1,000-man contingent will leave for the dense Darien jungle region Thursday to join the roughly 300 police already stationed along the 190-mile (300 km) frontier, Zamora said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a zone with many bandits and many criminals, it's an open zone and that is why we're acting now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Non-governmental organisations in the area warned recently that incursions by Colombian paramilitary and rebel groups were growing more frequent.</p>
<p>&quot;We note with deep concern that the armed conflict in Colombia is extending and each time entering more into Panama's territory,&quot; Romulo Emiliani, Roman Catholic bishop of the Darien region, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Emiliani said a column of more than 40 fighters from Colombia's right-wing paramilitary Peasant Defence Group of Cordoba and Uraba (ACCU) briefly seized the border village Yape on June 23.</p>
<p>&quot;Behind them, in the mountain, there was a contingent, awaiting their orders. They were checking up on the village, looking for guerrillas,&quot; Emiliani said.</p>
<p>Zamora said the frontier zone was sparsely manned and very difficult to control. He said the police stationed there carried mainly handguns with just a few M-16 machine guns.</p>
<p>Panama's constitution prevents the country from having a military. Instead it has a police force of about 17,000 under civilian control.</p>
