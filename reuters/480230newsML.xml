<headline>SAB SAYS MADE &quot;NO FORMAL BID&quot; FOR BBAG.</headline>

<p>South African Breweries Ltd (SAB), the world's fourth biggest brewer, said on Tuesday that it had made no formal bid for Austrian drinks firm BBAG.</p>
<p>Earlier BBAG said its majority shareholders had rejected a takeover bid by drinks giant SAB.</p>
<p>&quot;The controlling shareholders, who met today on short notice because of rumours in several media, have unanimously rejected the takeover designs by South African Breweries,&quot; BBAG said in a statement.</p>
<p>But SAB corporate finance and development director Malcolm Wyman told Reuters that his firm had never made any formal approach for BBAG.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no formal bid, no formal negotiations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Wyman said SAB had informally approached one of the controlling shareholders of BBAG about talks on a range of issues, one of which was the possibility of buying shares in BBAG's ultimate holding firm.</p>
<p>Wyman, who declined to name the shareholder, said SAB had found that the shares were not for sale. &quot;We have not made any takeover bid,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>BBAG, one of Europe's top ten brewers with wide interests in Eastern Europe, has a complicated holding structure that is effectively controlled by five families.</p>
<p>The families control a non-operative holding company, called Getraenke Holding (Drinks Holding), which through a series of further holding firms owns the majority stake in operative unit Brau Union.</p>
<p>SAB has recently expanded rapidly in Central and Eastern Europe, snapping up businesses in Poland, Hungary and Romania.</p>
