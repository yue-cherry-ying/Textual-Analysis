<headline>Vereinsbank sees timely sale of Deutsche BA stake.</headline>
<dateline>MUNICH, Germany 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Germany's Bayerische Vereinsbank AG said on Tuesday that it will sell its stake in the airline Deutsche BA as planned in July 1997, despite newspaper reports it would speed up the sale.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Bavarian bank denied a report in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung which quoted Juergen Weber, the head of Lufthansa AG, saying it would stop doing business with Vereinsbank if the bank did not sell its share in Deutsche BA.</p>
<p>Lufthansa is unhappy because Deutsche BA is 49 percent-owned by its rival British Airways.</p>
<p>A Deutsche BA spokeswoman said that she knew of no plans for Vereinsbank to get out of the contract before it ends in the middle of this year.</p>
<p>On top of the 49 percent British Airways stake, Commerzbank owns 19 percent, while Vereinsbank and Berliner Bank own 16 percent each.</p>
<p>The Deutsche BA spokeswoman said the airline was in discussions with the banks to see where things went from here, but there were no concrete findings as yet.</p>
<p>The airline hoped that the banks would stay on as shareholders, but a change in ownership structure was a possibility.</p>
<p>She denied that the banks had only a nominal role in the ownership structure, as they did not have any part in losses at Deutsche BA.</p>
<p>As the largest shareholder in Deutsche BA, British Airways is required by British law to carry the group's losses and is also responsible for the operation of the airline.</p>
<p>The group specifically denied reports that Vereinsbank would speed up the sale in advance of the liberalisation of air traffic on April 1, which allows airlines to offer unrestricted services in countries other than their own.</p>
<p>Up until now, German airlines could only offer unrestricted domestic flights within Germany.</p>
