<p>Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Thursday the Clinton administration was comfortable with the May 7 effective date announced by Republican tax writers for any capital gains tax relief.</p>
<p>&quot;...the announcement of the committee chairman seemed to us appropriate. If a capital gains bill is enacted this year we are comfortable with that as the effective date,&quot; Summers told CNBC business television.</p>
<p>He said details still had to be worked out but the amount of any reduction in the capital gains tax would be restrained to some extent by agreement not to cause any blowout in the later years of the 2002 balanced budget plan.  </p>
<p>Asked whether the economic assumptions of the budget deal were too optimistic, Summers said it seemed appropriate to revise upward tax revenues.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it (the budget pact) does reflect a bit of data that is significant for people which is that this year, like last year, tax collections have come in well above what economic models have predicted,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There was evidence the relationships usually used to model tax receipts had changed. &quot;So it may well be appropriate to revise upward forcasts of future revenue collections.</p>
<p>It was also reasonable to forecast falling interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;As it becomes clear that we really are moving into a durably balanced budget environment, I think it's reasonable to hope and expect that interest rates should decline.&quot;</p>
