<p>South Korean stocks closed higher in Saturday's half-day session on buying led by foreigners and off-shore funds, brokers said.</p>
<p>Investors ignored rumours that Tae Sung Machinery and Construction Co had defaulted on debt payments. Trading in Tae Sung shares has been suspended.</p>
<p>The composite index closed up 8.46 points, or 1.15 percent, at 746.89 after briefly dropping into negative territory.</p>
<p>&quot;Tae Sung rumours were ignored because hardships at the company had already been circulating and reflected,&quot; said Koh Kyung-bae of Hyundai Securities.  </p>
<p>The Korea Stock Exchange said Tae Sung was also rumoured to be planning to apply for court receivership. Officials at the company were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Brokers said shares in securities firms and big-name construction firms rose on buying by foreigners and off-shore funds managed by local investment firms.</p>
<p>The sub-index for securities firms was up 4.83 percent or 60.31 points to 1,307.94 points.</p>
<p>Brokers said Friday's release of current account deficit figures also boosted sentiment. The deficit narrowed to $1.04 billion in May from a $1.59 billion shortfall a year earlier.  </p>
<p>Brokers saw the market moving in a range between 720 and 760 points next week, with investors focusing on firms perceived to have enjoyed big earnings growth in the half-year to June.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no big rises or falls next week, but the market will instead move in a boxed range,&quot; said Koh Soon-shik of LG Securities.</p>
<p>September index futures closed up 1.4 points at 80.70 while the underlying KOSPI-200 index ended up 1.2 points at 77.53.</p>
