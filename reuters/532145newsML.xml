<text>
<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Mike Royko, whose commentaries appear in newspapers across the United States, was in critical condition on Wednesday after suffering a seizure at his home, a hospital said.</p>
<p>Royko, 64, was taken from his home in Winnetka north of Chicago on Tuesday night to nearby Evanston Hospital, which reported his condition as critical. He was moved Wednesday to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago.</p>
<p>The Chicago Tribune, where he is based, quoted his family as saying he apparently suffered an aneurysm.</p>
<p>Royko was recently released from a Florida hospital after suffering a stroke while on vacation there. He underwent surgery in Florida for an aneurysm, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Royko joined the Tribune in 1984, jumping from the rival Chicago Sun-Times. He had previously worked for the now defunct Chicago Daily News, beginning there in 1959. (Corrects career details)</p>
<p>He is the author of &quot;Boss,&quot; a book about the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, father of current Mayor Richard M. Daley. His satirical commentary has routinely skewered venal politicians, crooked policemen and inflated egos.</p>
