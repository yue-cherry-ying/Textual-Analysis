<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch shares end sharply down but off session lows.</title>
<headline>Dutch shares end sharply down but off session lows.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch shares ended sharply down on Tuesday, after hugging lower levels throughout the session in a reaction to the two successive drops in New York's Dow Jones index which had yet to be priced into the market.</p>
<p>&quot;While we had a couple of days off, the Dow lost over four percent. This is no more than a logical reaction,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>He said there had been no panic at the Amsterdam opening -- when the main index lost 5.70 percent to 698.72 points -- when selling orders from retail investors pushed the indices down.</p>
<p>Both the AEX and AMX recovered slightly later in the day.</p>
<p>While retail investors were mainly active on the selling side, some institutions were said to be bargain-hunting.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw some buying interest at lower levels coming from institutional parties, but it remained limited to the classical blue chips and was small-scale,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>He said a drop to 680 of the AEX would be needed in order to lure back the bigger buyers, while another dealer expected buyers to come back in around the 670 level.</p>
<p>Technical analysts earlier today indicated support at 700.</p>
<p>Volume was fairly low compared to the heavy price swings, dealers said. &quot;The market is waiting for clues,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is making phone calls and talking about the market, but there's a nervous emptyness as we don't know where we are going,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;(Bid and offer) spreads are wide enough for an elephant to walk through,&quot; another said.</p>
<p>Dutch clocks moved forward by one hour on Sunday as summer time started. Wall Street now opens when the Dutch market closes so Dutch shares are no longer affected by early U.S. trade.</p>
<p>&quot;If Wall Street continues to slide, we can only react tomorrow,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Dutch stocks in all sectors suffered heavy losses, with Polygram the only riser among AEX and AMX index stocks.</p>
<p>One dealer attributed the rise to speculation about possible announcements to be made at Wednesday's shareholders meeting. The stock gained 70 cents to close at 95.00 guilders.</p>
<p>ING, which is to release its 1996 results on Thursday, was most traded, shedding 3.80 to 70.10 guilders.</p>
<p>Road transport firm Frans Maas closed 2.5 percent or four guilders higher at 65.00 guilders as market players belatedly savoured 1996 results in line with the company's earlier forecasts and a positive outlook for 1997.</p>
<p>Despite a market holiday, Frans Maas reported a 36 percent rise in net profit to 24.4 million guilders last Friday.</p>
