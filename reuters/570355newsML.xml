<p>Emerging market debt prices were mostly lower across the board on Thursday but traders said Poland continued to outperform the rest of the market on news Wednesday that it bought back $1.69 billion of Brady debt.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been selling across the board and the only one that has performed extremely well and actually outperformed the U.S. Treasury is Poland and that is due to the buyback of their debt which was announced yesterday,&quot; said one trader at a European investment bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The rest of the market has distinctly underperformed the (U.S. Treasury) market,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Poland's discount bonds  POFLT024=RR extended gains scored in New York on Wednesday, rising 1/8 to 97-7/8 bid.</p>
<p>In the broader market, prices fell across the board due to a sharp correction in the U.S. Treasury market on Wednesday and renewed concerns about the U.S. interest rate environment.</p>
<p>Though few U.S. economic reports are due out in coming days, experts said market participants will continue to look to the U.S. Treasury market and try to gauge the direction of U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is a little shellshocked but the price action yesterday in New York has left prices lower and I think the market is just generally wary of trading before they get anymore direction from the U.S.,&quot; said Neil Lockwood, emerging market analyst at ANZ Investment Bank. Even though the economic fundamentals of certain emerging market countries have improved in recent months and are expected to continue, sources said the main focus has been on U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>&quot;Individual country fundamentals are very much taking a back seat to what is happening in the U.S.,&quot; Lockwood added.</p>
<p>Among the major Latin countries, traders said Brazilian Bradys were lower as players continued to take profits after scoring sharp gains earlier in the week on news that a controlling stake in mining Companhia Vale Do Rio Doce (CVRD) had been sold.</p>
<p>&quot;The heaviest hit has been Brazil. There has been healthy profit-taking in Brazil,&quot; said the first trader at the European investment bank.</p>
<p>Brazilian &quot;C&quot; bonds  BR8D14=RR extended losses in London, falling 3/8 to 76-3/8.</p>
