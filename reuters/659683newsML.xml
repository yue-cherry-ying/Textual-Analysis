<headline>EPA air standards options narrowing - offical.</headline>

<p>The Clinton administration said Friday it had narrowed its choices on setting new air quality standards amid rumors that the White House increased pressure on the Environmental Protection Agency to weaken its air standards proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;Although we're very close to resolving this issue, the final numbers have not been agreed on,&quot; an administration official said. &quot;There has always been a range available that would be considered, and it's entirely possible that there might be some changes within that range.&quot;</p>
<p>The EPA, White House economists and other agencies have been locked in talks for several weeks to decide whether to strengthen the pollution standards the EPA says are not tough enough to adequately protect public health.</p>
<p>Industry groups, backed by congressional Republicans and a number of midwestern and southern Democrats, contend that the new standards would cost industries and communities billions of dollars and yield little public health benefit.</p>
<p>Rumors swirled Friday among environmental and industry groups and Congress that White House officials had presented EPA Administrator Carol Browner a choice of either weakening the agency's preferred plan for a ground-level ozone standard, or its preferred plan for a small air particle standard.</p>
<p>&quot;We've heard you can have one or the other, but it's not a menu,&quot; a congressional source said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an ultimatum consisting of two impossible choices -- either you cut off your left lung or your right lung,&quot; an environmental source said.</p>
<p>&quot;Every proposal that we've heard about is 'we'll give you close to what you want on one, but not both.' The good news, as far as we've heard, is the administrator is holding firm,&quot; a source from another environmental group said.</p>
<p>He also said he felt the White House over the course of Friday backed off what had been perceived as an ultimatum or a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; proposal to Browner.</p>
<p>The impact of the proposed standards would change sharply depending on variables such as the allowed concentration of the pollutant, the duration of measurement, and the number of times an area can exceed the allowed concentration without violating the standard.</p>
<p>The sources said under the tentative White House options, the EPA could keep its proposed standard for ozone or smog, but allow higher concentrations of tiny air particulate matter or soot than it proposed.</p>
<p>Or the EPA could in effect weaken the current smog standard by lengthening the measurement time, but stick with its proposed soot rule, the sources said.</p>
<p>But several sources said they felt Browner's original proposal for both smog and soot was still a viable option, and that they expected Vice President Gore or President Clinton to step in soon to make a decision.</p>
