<p>Egypt's foreign reserves were about $19.1 billion at the end of December, 1996, Economy and International Cooperation Minister Nawal el-Tatawi was quoted on Saturday as saying.</p>
<p>Officials have said foreign reserves rose to $18.9 billion at the end of November, equivalent to more than 16 months of imports at 1995/6 levels, from $18.5 billion at end-June.</p>
<p>Bankers had attributed the rise in November mainly to central bank purchases of foreign exchange which has flowed into Egypt in the form of portfolio or direct investments.</p>
<p>Al-Ahram newspaper quoted Tatawi on Saturday as saying that Egypt's privatisation and trade liberalisation programme has achieved tangible progress.</p>
<p>She said the private sector contributed about 65 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the financial year ending June, 1996. &quot;The performance of the Egyptian economy has exceeded expectations,&quot; she was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>She said GDP was expected to grow 5.7 percent in 1996/7 compared to 4.9 percent growth in 1995/6.</p>
