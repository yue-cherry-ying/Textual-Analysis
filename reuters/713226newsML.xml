<headline>First Tennessee National settles student loan suit.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-07-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department said Tuesday a First Tennessee National Corp. unit agreed to pay $2.75 million to settle allegations it deceived the Education Department to get federal insurance on defaulted student loans.</p>
<p>Department officials said the settlement resolved a civil lawsuit that had been filed against the unit in Knoxville, Tenn., in 1994.</p>
<p>The suit claimed that First Tennessee Bank submitted false claims in 1987 and 1988 to receive federally guaranteed insurance payments under a programme that made low-interest loans to students at post-secondary schools.</p>
<p>According to the suit, the unit submitted fabricated collection histories to collect insurance on more than $1.3 million in loans and forged documents on more than $200,000 in other loans, department officials said.</p>
<p>First Tennessee Bank responded that it &quot;vigorously and unconditionally denies any wrongdoing with regard to any of its activities involving student loans.&quot;</p>
<p>The company admitted no liability and was not subjected to any disciplinary action, Lew Weems, president of First Tennessee Bank-Knoxville, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The litigation had become so protracted and burdensome, we decided it was in the best interests of our shareholders to settle,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The company's stock fell $1.125 to $48.875 on Nasdaq.</p>
