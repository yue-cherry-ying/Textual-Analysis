<headline>Veteran Czech Radio correspondent in London dies.</headline>
<dateline>PRAGUE 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>Karel Kyncl, a veteran Czech Radio foreign correspondent and author who received political asylum in Britain in 1983, died on Tuesday after a long battle with cancer, an official in the radio's head office told Reuters. He was 70.</p>
<p>Kyncl began his radio career during World War Two and then reported for the communist-era Ceskoslovensky Rozhlas (Czechoslovak Radio) from the United States and Asia.</p>
<p>He is widely remembered for telling Czechs and Slovaks of President John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963.</p>
<p>Kyncl was posted in New York throughout much of the 1950s and 1960s until he was recalled in the purges of journalists after the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, like many professionals sacked in communist purges, Kyncl eked a living doing odd jobs in Prague as a filing clerk in a hospital and as an ice cream vendor.</p>
<p>After emigrating to London, he reported at various times for BBC Radio, Voice of America, and for British publications including a magazine called &quot;Index on Censorship&quot;.</p>
<p>After the Prague Communist regime fell in 1989, Kyncl returned to Czechoslovak Radio as London correspondent and, after the split of the federation in 1993, worked for Czech Radio until his death.</p>
<p>His books included &quot;63 Days to Dallas&quot; about the Kennedy assassination, &quot;News of a Czech Citizen of Texas&quot;, &quot;My Britain&quot;, and a study of the Prague pro-democracy movement, &quot;On Charter 77&quot;.</p>
