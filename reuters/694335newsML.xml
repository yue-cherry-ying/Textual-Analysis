<p>Italian club Internazionale have signed Argentine midfielder Diego Simeone from Atletico Madrid, newspapers reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Inter paid the Spanish club 13 billion lire ($7.6 million) for Simeone, who signed a four-year contract to earn three billion lire a year ($1.75 million), Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper reported.</p>
<p>It said the deal was signed by the player's agent, Marco Franchi, with Inter officials late on Friday in Milan.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm happy about this deal. I had said I would only leave Atletico Madrid for a big Italian club,&quot; Gazzetta quoted Simeone as saying from Argentina, where he is on holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;Inter has winning potential. And that's why I had no doubts,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Simeone, who won the Spanish league title with the Madrid club, is seen as a replacement for England midfielder Paul Ince, who appears likely to leave Inter to return to Britain.</p>
<p>Gazzetta quoted Ince as saying Inter had allowed him to negotiate with any premier league sides interested in signing him, adding that Newcastle and Liverpool were the most probable destinations.</p>
