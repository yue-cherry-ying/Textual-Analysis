<title>USA: Emerging debt mixed, U.S. rate uncertainty cited.</title>
<headline>Emerging debt mixed, U.S. rate uncertainty cited.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>Emerging markets debt was mixed Thursday, with many issues posting modest gains in line with firmer U.S. Treasuries, market experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very choppy trading with very little customer flow,&quot; one trader said. &quot;The market's just wondering where it should be and where (U.S.) Treasuries are heading.&quot;</p>
<p>Brady debt yield spreads widened to Treasuries for nearly every country, traders said. Argentina widened about six basis points and Brazil perhaps two or three basis points, one said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Most of the retail we saw today was better selling,&quot; said another trader, adding that &quot;we saw a little bit more retail buying in Mexico.&quot;</p>
<p>After rising more strongly early, Mexico pars were up 3/8 at 72-1/4 bid late Thursday afternoon. The gains simply marked a rebound from Wednesday's losses rather than any fundamental improvement, traders said.</p>
<p>Brazil &quot;C&quot; bonds fell 1/4 to 76-1/4 bid. The market largely ignored news Brazilian port workers would continue their strike until paid their April wages, traders said.  </p>
<p>&quot;No one's focused on that for the moment -- maybe tomorrow,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>In other Latins, Argentina FRBs were up 1/2 at 92-1/2 bid, Peru PDIs were up 3/8 at 61-3/4 bid and Ecuador IEBs were unchanged at 87-3/4 bid.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe issues again were mixed. Russian debt suffered while Polish and Bulgarian bonds climbed.</p>
<p>Reversing their performance from the previous session, dollar-denominated Vnesh loans fell 3/8 to 83 bid and mark-denominated Vnesh plummeted 1-3/4 to 86-1/2 bid.  </p>
<p>&quot;Part of the reason Vnesh had risen as high as it did was that a proprietary position that had been short went flat and then went long,&quot; a trader explained.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of that buying was done by a Street player, and that guy turned around and has been selling,&quot; he continued.</p>
<p>Polish debt rose strongly the day after Poland said it had bought back $1.69 billion of Bradys, mostly Discounts.</p>
<p>Several analysts in London and New York said the country could receive a ratings upgrade in the next several months, possibly rising from its current appraisals of Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB-minus by Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
<p>Poland Discounts were up 1/2 at 98-1/4, and PDIs were up 3/4 at 83-1/4.</p>
