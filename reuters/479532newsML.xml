<p>The Indian government on Tuesday announced revised guidelines for external commercial borrowings by corporates, an official statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has announced the modified guidelines on ECB (external commercial borrowings) policies and procedures,&quot; the statement said.  </p>
<p>The government has decided to extend flexible terms for ECBs, currently available to power, telecommunications and railways, to roads, ports, industrial parks and urban infrastructure, it said.</p>
<p>Holding companies and promoters will be allowed to raise ECBs up to a maximum of $50 million equivalent to finance equity investment in a subsidiary company implementing infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>&quot;This flexibility is being given in order to enable domestic investors in infrastructure projects to meet the minimum domestic equity requirements,&quot; the statement said.  </p>
<p>Corporate borrowers who are able to raise long-term resources with an average maturity of 10 years will be allowed to use up to $100 million in ECB proceeds without any end-use restrictions.</p>
<p>For borrowers able to raise long-term resources with an average maturity of 20 years, the limit will be $200 million.</p>
<p>&quot;To be eligible for this purpose the debt instrument should not include any 'put' or 'call' options potentially reducing the stated maturities,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The total debt allowed through this window will be within the overall limit of the borrower's entitlement for ECB, it said.</p>
<p>The statement said corporate borrowers will be permitted to raise ECB to acquire ships and vessels from Indian shipyards.  </p>
<p>The government has also modified ECB rules for exporters.</p>
<p>&quot;Exporters will be permitted to raise ECB up to twice the average amount of annual exports during the previous three years subject to a maximum of $100 million without end-use restrictions,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The minimum average maturity will be three years for up to $15 million and seven years for the balance amount exceeding $15 million.</p>
<p>Corporates which have raised ECBs through bonds, floating rate notes and syndicated loans for the import of capital goods and services will be allowed to remit funds into India and use them, except in the stock market or real estate, until actual imports are made or for up to a year, whichever is less.</p>
<p>&quot;In case borrowers decide to deploy the funds abroad till the approved end-use requirement arises, they can do so as per the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) extant guidelines,&quot; the government said.</p>
<p>The objective of the revision in the guidelines is to give flexibility to investors in infrastructure and priority to exporters in accessing ECBs, it added.</p>
