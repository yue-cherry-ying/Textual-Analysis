<p>Chechen guerrilla Shamil Basayev, Russia's most wanted man, was named first deputy prime minister of Chechnya on Tuesday by the region's secessionist president, Aslan Maskhadov, Interfax news agency said.</p>
<p>Basayev, 32, was runner-up to Maskhadov in January's presidential election. As a guerrilla leader during the 1994-96 war against Russian troops he led a bloody hostage-taking raid on the Russian town of Budennovsk in June 1995.</p>
<p>Interfax said Basayev would deputise for Maskhadov, who also holds the post of prime minister, and deal with industry issues. Most of Chechnya's industry, much of it connected with oil refining, was destroyed during the 20 months of fighting.</p>
<p>Maskhadov named two other first deputy premiers, including spokesman Movladi Udugov, and three deputy prime ministers.</p>
<p>Maskhadov's military successes last summer prompted Moscow to agree to a ceasefire and pull its troops out of the mainly Moslem North Caucasus region. Negotiations are continuing on a lasting political and economic settlement. Maskhadov wants full sovereignty but the Kremlin wants to grant only broad autonomy.</p>
