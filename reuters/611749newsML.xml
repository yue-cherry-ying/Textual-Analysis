<p>South Korea's Finance and Economy Minister said on Friday the government would investigate moves by financial institutions to call in corporate debts or refuse fresh loans for no reason.</p>
<p>In a luncheon meeting with representatives of secondary financial institutions, Kang Kyong-shik said he would establish a special centre to hear companies' complaints of &quot;unreasonable&quot; demands by financial institutions.  </p>
<p>Kang criticised domestic financial institutions for moving too quickly to call in debts of companies rumoured to be in trouble.</p>
<p>Merchant banks in particular have been unwilling to shoulder any of the burden of troubled corporates, he said, preferring to shift the burden of helping companies stay afloat to banks.</p>
<p>Kang said this eagerness to act on rumours had triggered severe cash-flow problems among domestic companies, even though the money market had remained stable.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is forcing banks to undertake the entire responsibility of providing credit, which will lead banks to default in the long run,&quot; Kang said. &quot;This will cause a financial crisis and lead to serious economic trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>All financial institutions should get together voluntarily to work out an action plan, he said.</p>
<p>Kang asked secondary finance institutions to cooperate with a voluntary bank committee established in March to keep troubled corporates in business.</p>
<p>The current situation stemmed from financial institutions' &quot;excessively strict&quot; application of loan terms since the recent string of corporate failures, he said.</p>
<p>Kang urged secondary institutions not to drastically curtail credits on the basis of rumours or unsubstantiated information.</p>
<p>&quot;Financial institutions should notify companies one or two weeks in advance if they intend to stop extending fresh loans,&quot; Kang said.</p>
<p>When a company goes bankrupt its management know-how, trained personnel resources and external recognition would be lost, he said. &quot;This would create a great loss to the economy.&quot;</p>
