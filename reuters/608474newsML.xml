<p>European credit rating agency IBCA's decision to place its rating to Hungary with positive outlook should be the first step of a wave of upgradings, National Bank of Hungary (NBH) president Gyorgy Suranyi said on Friday.</p>
<p>IBCA, which currently rates Hungary at BBB-, announced earlier on Friday that it had placed Hungary's long-term foreign currency rating with positive implications.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that the other rating agencies will evaluate similarly what has happened in the recent period,&quot; Suranyi told Reuters.</p>
<p>One year ago, IBCA was the first international rating agency to grant Hungary an investment grade. Later in 1996 all major rating agencies followed the step.</p>
<p>IBCA said on Friday that Hungary's economic fundamentals were strong, the structural adjustment advanced well, aconomic recovery was underway and the external current account position was sustainable.</p>
<p>Suranyi said he was glad to hear IBCA's announcement, but he added that rating agencies usually followed the improvement of Hungary's judgement on international debt markets only with a very long delay.</p>
<p>&quot;I also hope that the time differential between the market's evaluation and the rating agencies' devaluation will somewhat shorten,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The judgement gf the market has been substantially more favourable for the past one and the half year than rating agencies',&quot; he added.</p>
<p>However, the upgradings would not be so important for Hungary this year than they were in 1996, Suranyi said.</p>
<p>&quot;The real difference is between investment and non-investment grade, and this breakthrough came last year.&quot;</p>
<p>Suranyi denied market talks that the NBH decided to launch soon 10 year dollar bonds of $300 million to $1 billion.</p>
<p>However, he confirmed that the NBH was considering tapping the international market with a benchmark bond.</p>
<p>&quot;If every condition is clearly favourable, we don't exclude that we will enter the market.&quot;</p>
<p>Suranyi confirmed reports of business daily Vilaggazdasag that the NBH had to extend its licence for issuing papers in the U.S. recently.</p>
<p>Along with the extension, the NBH also raised the limit amount to $1 billion by $250 million, sparking speculation on the market, the paper added.</p>
