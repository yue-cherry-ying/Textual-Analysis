<p>A coalition group calling for constitutional reforms in Kenya plans rallies across the country on July 7 to press for changes before general elections later this year.</p>
<p>The National Convention Assembly (NCA) -- which groups opposition parties, churches, human rights and civil society bodies and is based in the capital Nairobi -- made its call in a statement sent to Reuters on Saturday.</p>
<p>Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi's government has outlawed the rallies and pledged to stop them from taking place through all possible means.</p>
<p>The rally date, referred to as &quot;Saba Saba&quot; in Kenya, commemorates a similar rally in Nairobi seven years ago which turned violent. At least 20 people were killed as a campaign for a switch to multi-party politics gathered pace.</p>
<p>Moi reluctantly allowed the change to pluralism in December 1991 and won landmark elections a year later against an opposition splintered mainly along tribal and personal lines.</p>
<p>Last month security forces broke up a National Convention Assembly rally declared illegal by the government, sparking two days of rioting in the capital that left one person dead and dozens of shops and stalls looted.</p>
<p>Moi, aged 73 and in power since 1978, must call elections in 1997 pitting his ruling KANU party and the opposition.</p>
<p>The Electoral Commission said it had registered more than eight million people to vote in the elections that would be held this year, Daily Nation newspaper reported. The Commission has not yet set a date for the elections.</p>
<p>The deadline for registration of voters is June 30.</p>
<p>The opposition wants review or repeal of six laws including the Public Order Act, reviled as an instrument of suppression. It is also demanding greater access to state-controlled media.</p>
<p>The government has proposed replacing the Public Order Act with the Peaceful Assemblies Act. The opposition rejects such a change as too little, too late and insignificant.</p>
<p>Meantime, Roman Catholic orders suggested they were being persecuted by the government for joining in calls for constitutional reforms before elections.</p>
<p>In a statement issued on Saturday, they cited an attack at the residence of the Papal Nunciature in Nairobi last week in which at least three nuns were injured.</p>
<p>&quot;It was with shock and deep concern that we have learnt of the violent entry of three thieves into the convent home of the Sisters at the Papal Nunciature,&quot; said the Religious Superiors Conference and Association of Sisterhoods of Kenya.</p>
<p>The orders said that they noted a widespread pattern of violence and robbery against churches and convents, with little action taken by the authorities to protest or protect.</p>
<p>&quot;We wonder if silent approval is being given because of our church leaders' repeated calls for constitutional reform and civil education prior to the general elections,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>&quot;We wish to state here that despite the continual threats to our lives and property we feel compelled to support their call (for reforms) which we believe would provide an enabling environment for a free and fair election,&quot; the orders added.</p>
