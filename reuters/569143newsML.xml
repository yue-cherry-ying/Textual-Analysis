<p>The zloty firmed past resistance levels in early Thursday trade as foreign investors payed for fixed bonds bought at Wednesday's auction, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said that the central bank was likely to step in with a currency-buying intervention to knock the zloty down.</p>
<p>&quot;There is strong currency-selling pressure on the market as foreign clients enter Polish treasuries. The market expects the central bank should intervene to knock the zloty back down,&quot; said Jaroslaw Dryjski, dealer at Bank Slaski SA.</p>
<p>At 0930 GMT the zloty was at 2.57/2.54 percent from the parity rate, up from opening's 2.52/2.46 percent.  </p>
<p>It was at 3.1535/45 to the dollar, up from 3.1555/75 at opening and at 1.8405/10 to the mark, against 1.8410/20.</p>
<p>Foreign investors bought as estimated $200 million zlotys worth of fixed bonds on Wednesday, but some have already made forex tranactions ahead of the auction, dealers said.</p>
<p>On the money market one-day rates found support around 23 percent as Thursday's net cash inflow was partly offest by the central bank's 250 million zlotys 91-day NBP-bill offer with an overnight value date, dealers said.</p>
<p>Both O/N and tomorrow/next rates were virtually flat around opening levels at 23.00/23.20 percent by mid-morning.</p>
