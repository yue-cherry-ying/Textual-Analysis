<headline>US, Britain, France in African peacekeeping accord.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>The United States, Britain and France have reached an agreement on helping African states carry out peacekeeping missions, the French Foreign Ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>The ministry, however, gave no specific details about the accord of which, oddly, the Defence Ministry said it had no knowledge.</p>
<p>&quot;France, the United States and Britain have each pursued efforts in recent years to improve the peacekeeping capacities of African states,&quot; a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said other countries as well as various international organisations, including the United Nations, the Western European Union (WEU) and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), were involved in reinforcing international coordination.</p>
<p>&quot;Our three countries have just concluded an accord to promote this international coordination together and stimulate international community action in the framework of the UN and in association with the OAU,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim is, together with African states and other donor countries, to help African countries face up, together with the rest of the international community, to the crises which occur on the continent and generally to participate in UN peacekeeping operations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>France and the United States have made separate, rival efforts in the past three years to set up African peacekeeping forces, and there had been no indication that an agreement was at hand.</p>
<p>No further details about the accord, or where or when it was reached, were immediately available.</p>
