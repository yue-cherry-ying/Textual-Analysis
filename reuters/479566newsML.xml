<title>USA: Continental, pilots to open labor talks.</title>

<p>The union representing pilots of Continental Airlines Inc. and its sister company Continental Express plan to open talks with the airline on new labour pacts on Wednesday, the pilots said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Independent Association of Continental Pilots, which represents 4,000 Continental pilots and 1,000 Continental Express pilots, did not release contract proposals.</p>
<p>A union spokesman said the pilots expect the Houston-based airline to live up to an earlier pledge to avoid protracted talks on contracts that expire July 30 for the Continental pilots and Oct. 1 for the Continental Express pilots.</p>
<p>&quot;In keeping with the company's stated goal of achieving a contract quickly and without acrimony, we hope to see a prompt response on the substantive issues,&quot; the spokesman said in a statement recorded on the union's telephone news line.</p>
<p>Continental, the nation's fifth largest airline, emerged from bankruptcy in 1992 and is now recognised as one of the strongest domestic carriers. The airline posted record earnings of $319 million on revenues of $6.4 billion in 1996.</p>
<p>But Continental pilots earn about 35 percent less than their peers at the nation's five largest airlines, and about 15 percent less than the average wage of pilots at the top 10 airlines, industry sources said.</p>
<p>A Continental spokesman was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Continental's class A stock fell $1.25 to $30.50 on the New York Stock Exchange at mid-afternoon.</p>
