<headline>N.Irishman in court over London Docklands bomb.</headline>

<p>A man from Northern Ireland appeared in a top-security court in London on Saturday charged with a deadly bomb attack in the capital's Docklands district that ended the IRA's ceasefire in February 1996.</p>
<p>James McCardle, 29, was charged with two counts of murder and one of conspiracy to cause an explosion. He was remanded in custody until a full court hearing at which his lawyer said he would be denying the charges.</p>
<p>The Docklands bomb killed two people and marked the end of a 17-month ceasefire by Irish Republican Army guerrillas fighting to end British rule of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Police are already holding another Northern Ireland man in custody over the attack.</p>
<p>Security sources in Northern Ireland said McCardle was among seven people arrested a week ago in a raid on a farmhouse near Crosmaglen in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>McCardle made his brief court appearance a day after two small explosions and a series of suspected IRA bomb warnings paralysed rail and road traffic in northern England in what appeared to be the latest attempt by the guerrillas to disrupt Britain's May 1 election campaign.</p>
<p>Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew on Saturday condemned the perpetrators as thugs and criminals but said the campaign of disruption would not force Britain to &quot;bend the knee to violence&quot;.</p>
