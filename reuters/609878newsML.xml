<headline>US court reduces damages, GKN still appeals.</headline>

<p>A U.S. court has reduced damages awarded against Britain's GKN Plc in a case concerning a U.S. subsidiary but the engineering giant on Friday said that it was still appealing against the ruling.</p>
<p>The company said the U.S. district court in Charlotte, North Carolina, reduced damages against GKN's Meineke Discount Muffler Shops to $390 million from $600 million -- the largest commercial damages ever to be awarded against a British company in the United States.</p>
<p>The award had been in favour of Meineke's 2,500 U.S. franchises, who alleged that the auto-muffler retailer had mishandled and misappropriated millions of dollars charged to the franchisees for advertising. They first brought the case against GKN in December 1993.</p>
<p>GKN said in a statement it has &quot;very strong substantive and procedural grounds for appeal&quot;. The appeal process is expected to take around 18 months.</p>
<p>Shares in GKN jumped on the news and at 1000 GMT stood 21 pence higher at 10.05-1/2 pounds, their highest since late March and extending a rally from April 24's 13-month low of 905 pence.</p>
<p>&quot;The court ruling is exactly as anticipated,&quot; said Robert Speed, analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite. &quot;Why the stock is up on what is effectively just purely a maintenance of the status quo, I'm not sure.&quot;</p>
<p>Speed said the rally in defence stocks generally &quot;could well have something to do with (GKN's) share price movement&quot;.</p>
<p>GKN was seen benefiting from a report in the Independent newspaper that the UK government would not block sales of military equipment to Indonesia.</p>
<p>Indonesian orders include armoured vehicles made by GKN.</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that Foreign Office sources had said export licences granted in December would not be revoked, easing concerns of a general clampdown on military exports.</p>
<p>News of the damages award sent GKN shares down sharply when first announced in December and it suffered a setback last week on renewed concerns about legal action from Meineke franchisees.</p>
<p>At last week's annual meeting one franchisee said a group of franchisees excluded from GKN's legal settlement were preparing to file a lawsuit to be re-included in the class action.</p>
<p>&quot;That is unaltered by this decision,&quot; said Speed.</p>
<p>Just as GKN has been freed by the court ruling to launch an appeal against the overall judgement, so these franchisees, who signed waivers, could file a claim, he added.</p>
<p>In March, a federal judge in Charlotte -- the headquarters of Meineke -- tripled compensatory damages of $197 million awarded in December by a jury that found Meineke had committed breach of contract, negligence and fraud.</p>
<p>GKN said the reduced figure confirms the previous ruling and is within the 270 million pounds provision it made in its 1996 accounts to cover the judgement, interests and costs.</p>
<p>&quot;(This ruling) does not shut the door (on the issue) because clearly GKN is pursuing an appeal,&quot; Speed pointed out.</p>
