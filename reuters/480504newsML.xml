<p>Jakarta call money eased to 10.00/10.25 percent on Tuesday from 14.0 percent on the back of ample liquidity, dealers said.</p>
<p>One Japanese bank dealer said liquidity was ample following an early supply of 718 billion rupiah into the market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the amount is more than enough for an early month. Longer-term rates are also seen easing,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>One-week money was offered at 11.0/11.5 percent and three-month money at 13.5/14.0 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market could now focus on preparing for the new reserve requirement rate after being haunted by liquidity fears at the end of the 1996/97 fiscal year.</p>
<p>Banks have to meet the new reserve rate of five percent starting April 16.</p>
<p>The average overnight interbank rate on Thursday was 16.28 percent, compared with 16.40 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bond dealers said the market was slow after a four-day break, with some interest seen on Astra International II bonds.</p>
<p>One said buying interest helped boost Astra bonds' price by 25 basis points, but other prices were stable.</p>
<p>The yield of the benchmark PLN V/A bond remained at 14.625 percent at the last done price of 107.50 percent.</p>
