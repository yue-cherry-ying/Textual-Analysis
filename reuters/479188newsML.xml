<title>USA: CBOT soybeans end higher on USDA stocks correction.</title>
<headline>CBOT soybeans end higher on USDA stocks correction.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBOT soybean futures ended higher but off early limit gains after USDA corrected its soybean stocks figure, traders said.</p>
<p>USDA on Tuesday corrected its March 1 U.S. quarterly stocks figure to 1.056 billion bushels, 22 million bushels below the 1.078 billion bushels released on Monday. It cited a mathematical error in calculating Mississippi stocks.</p>
<p>The stocks cut augmented concern that U.S. soybean supplies will not last through August.</p>
<p>Soybeans fell off limit gains in early trade and commercials and locals were said to be sellers late.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people bought it on the opening in response to USDA's report but when it's all said and done, we're already trading these stocks numbers,&quot; said Bill Biedermann, director of research at Allendale Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;The cash market in the United States doesn't seem to be at all aggressive,&quot; he added. &quot;There's still negotiations with Brazil about possibly importing beans into the United States. The weather is pretty good. We've got a lot of (Allendale) customers who are going to start planting this week.&quot;</p>
<p>Soybeans closed 21-1/4 cents per bushel higher to unchanged with May up 19-3/4 at $8.75-1/2 a bushel.  </p>
<p>While the USDA correction overshadowed other factors, some floor sources pointed to news rains in Brazil had suspended loadings at Paranagua port. Traders cited speculation the delay would attract more export business to the United States, further straining already tight supplies.</p>
<p>A port spokeswoman said grains would be loaded sporadically, weather permitting, until the rains stopped.</p>
<p>Brazil was expected to export record amounts of soybeans this year but unreliable loading schedules could force some buyers to stick to U.S. supplies, traders said.</p>
<p>Brazil's harvest was 40 percent complete as of March 28, well ahead of the 27 percent average, according to Safras e Mercado.</p>
<p>The July/November spread tacked on 20-1/2 cents, premium July, adding to Monday's 20-cent move. The spread closed at $1.83-1/2, premium July.</p>
<p>ADM spread one million May/July at three cents and Cargill Inc spread one million May/July at 2-3/4 cents.</p>
<p>On the day, Cargill Inc sold seven million bushels May and three million July, LFG sold six million May and Dean Witter sold 1.5 million May and two million November, traders said.</p>
<p>Smith Barney bought five million July and two million May, Prudential Securities bought five million November and two million May and Cargill Investor Services bought two million May and three million July, floor sources said.</p>
<p>In options trade, Tradelink bought 400 May $8.00 puts at 1-1/2 cents. Refco Inc bought 500 May $8.75 calls at 44-3/4 cents.</p>
<p>Soybean volume was estimated by CBOT at 60,000 contracts, compared with Monday's actual volume of 57,123 contracts.</p>
