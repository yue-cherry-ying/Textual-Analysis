<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Tuesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Leading British blue chips shed 1.5 percent as Wall Street's vicious decline unnerved investors. And while the Dow recovered some ground, helping the FTSE 100 share index pare its losses at the end of the day, investors remained jittery about a further increase in U.S. interest rates and about the prospects for corporate earnings. The index finished 64.8 points lower at 4,248.1, the day's best level.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Shares plunged to one of their greatest one-day losses ever, as rattled investors stampeded to sell off their stocks in the wake of Wall Street's Easter tumble. The 30-share DAX ended the bourse session down 133.12 points at 3,295.93. Later on, its electronic counterpart the IBIS DAX index, ended the day at 3,281.46 points.</p>
<p>PARIS - Shares closed sharply lower, catching up with two big falls on Wall Street posted while Paris was closed for Good Friday and Easter Monday. The CAC-40 index ended 74.86 points or 2.82 percent lower at 2,581.82 after steadying near the close. It had reached a low of 2,556.15 during the day.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Shares ended with a slump of more than three percent on Wall Street's tumble in recent days and a shaky outlook. The all-share SPI ended down 90.02 points at 2,856.23.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks ended moderately lower on the first day of the 1997/98 financial year, as Wall Street's overnight tumble hurt global shares, while bank woes renewed worries about Japan's financial system. The 225-share Nikkei average shed 133.81 points or 0.74 percent to 17,869.59.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - The Hang Seng Index posted its ninth biggest point loss ever after fears of higher interest rates sent Wall Street stocks into a tailspin overnight and the local property outlook worried investors. The blue chip index plummeted 460.13 points, or 3.67 percent, to 12,074.19.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Stocks rode Wall Street's tattered coat-tails 2.9 percent lower, but ended a lightly traded day off their lows as brokers said sentiment remained resilient and the panic button untouched. The market's key All Ordinaries index ended down 70.1 points at 2,352.2.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Shares ended well down after enduring an early battering on the back of Wall Street's second successive heavy fall. The South African drop joined in a global rush of falling shares as major world financial markets followed New York's lead and share prices tumbled. The all-share index lost 132.4 points to 6,962.4 as industrials dropped 164.8 points to 8,174.6. The golds index ended down 9.3 points to 1,292.3.</p>
