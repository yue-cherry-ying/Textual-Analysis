<headline>UK women win prize for &quot;disarming&quot; Indonesian jet.</headline>

<p>Four British women were awarded an international peace prize on Wednesday for disabling a British military jet that they alleged would be used by the Indonesian government against civilian protesters in East Timor.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the causes of repression in Indonesia is the sale of arms by Britain, Germany, France, the United States and other countries,&quot; East Timor human rights activist Jose Ramos-Horta told the ceremony in the European Parliament as he presented the prize.</p>
<p>&quot;The action of these four women is an inspiration to all of us,&quot; the co-holder of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize added.</p>
<p>Horta on Monday appealed to the European Union and the United States to freeze weapons sales to the government of President Suharto, warning, &quot;From a strategic point of view, it is extremely dangerous to provide weapons to a dictatorship that is under challenge&quot;.</p>
<p>The four women were awarded the prize -- named after Nobel Laureate Sean Macbride -- by the Geneva-based International Peace Bureau (IPB), of which Macbride was a former president.</p>
<p>The women broke into a British Aerospace factory in Lancashire, north England, in January 1996 and attempted to disable a jet.</p>
<p>Andrea Needham, one of the four, told the ceremony that people in the West, who had freedom to speak out where the East Timorese people could not, had a duty to call their governments to account for supporting repressive regimes.</p>
<p>Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony of East Timor in 1975 in a unilateral act still not recognised by the United Nations.</p>
