<p>Youssef Boutros-Ghali, Egypt's newly appointed economy minister, is a 44-year-old Christian academic impatient to deregulate the Egyptian economy.</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali, nephew of former U.N. secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali and one of the youngest members in a mainly sexagenarian cabinet, has quietly promoted economic reform during his many years in the bureaucracy, and long before the term became all the rage with other officials.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to put an end to the predatory state,&quot; he once told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>The U.S.-educated Boutros-Ghali has advised the government about economic matters since 1986 and his appointment is expected to cheer the business community, who want Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri to further accelerate economic reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;He's very popular. He might not be playing a big part now but he certainly can play a big part,&quot; said Mohammed Abdallah, managing director at Intercapital securities house.</p>
<p>As a junior minister attached to Ganzouri's office, Boutros-Ghali's main task has been promoting Egypt to foreign investors. He has not had much executive power but has developed a reputation for intelligently supporting the government's line.</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali has called for more privatisation, more deregulation and more predictablity -- all demands voiced by foreign and local investors.</p>
<p>President Hosni Mubarak appointed Ganzouri and several other ministers in January 1996 with orders to speed up the country's flagging reform programme.</p>
<p>A year later, international investors are touting Egypt as an attractive emerging market, the economy has gained investment-grade ratings from Standard and Poor's and inflation for May is at a record low of 4.9 percent in May.</p>
<p>When other ministers were quoted in the government press as rejoicing over the Standard and Poor's &quot;vote of confidence&quot;, Boutros-Ghali was warning the state to watch for signs of overheating and that it must not rest on its laurels.</p>
<p>&quot;The vote of confidence puts on you an additional burden that you have to make sure that you maintain that confidence. If anything it has increased our resolve to forge on and make sure that they (the reforms) don't go off track,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali replaces Egypt's first woman economy minister, Nawal el-Tatawi, who was tipped as the cabinet member most likely to go.</p>
<p>She has had little impact on the economic reform programme, partly due to her ministry's lack of impact on decision-making. Analysts say that unless the government grants Boutros-Ghali more executive power, his hands could also be tied like Tatawi's.</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali graduated in 1974 with a degree in economics from Cairo University. He got a doctorate in the same subject from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1981 and then moved on to become a senior economist at the International Monetary Fund in Washington.</p>
<p>He briefly taught macroeconomic theory at the American University in Cairo before becoming a board member of giant state bank, the National Bank of Egypt.</p>
<p>He joined the Council of Ministers as head of the economic analysis unit in 1991 and was also adviser to the Central Bank governor until 1993.</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali was minister of state for international cooperation from October 1993 until January 1996. He was removed from this post in the Ganzouri cabinet and has been minister of state for economic affairs since then.</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali is a member of Egypt's Coptic Christian minority.</p>
