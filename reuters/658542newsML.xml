<p>The El Nino weather pattern forming in the southern Pacific raised concerns about drought in Indonesia on Thursday, but a local expert said he did not expect any serious damage to crops.</p>
<p>&quot;Temperatures are quite normal now in Indonesia, which is already experiencing the seasonal drought that will last through September or October,&quot; said Istiklal Amin of the agriculture ministry's Land and Agriclimate Research Centre.</p>
<p>&quot;While there is a need to be alert, until now there has been no indication (of an El Nino). What is happening now is quite a natural process due to a change in seasons.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Indonesia was affected by the El Nino effect in varying degrees in 1982, 1987, 1991 and 1994.</p>
<p>&quot;During those years, Indonesia's crop production was affected and we also had forest fires,&quot; he said. &quot;If crop production this year has been affected, it could be due to other natural factors rather than El Nino.&quot;</p>
<p>An official with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said on Tuesday warm ocean temperatures off the western coast of South America had triggered an El Nino weather pattern that could have a major impact on crop production around the world.</p>
<p>&quot;We do have an El Nino in progress,&quot; Vern Kousky, a research meteorologist with NOAA's climate prediction centre said.</p>
<p>An El Nino can affect global weather patterns for up to 18 months, depending on how soon ocean temperatures return to normal. The last major El Nino lasted from late 1991 to mid-1992, and a less severe one from 1994-95.</p>
<p>Kousky said the current El Nino was already leading to drier than normal conditions in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Indonesia's agricultural sector continues to be a major foreign revenue earner although the country has gradually been shifting emphasis to the industrial sector.</p>
<p>Indonesia is among the world's top producers of rubber, crude palm oil, coffee, cocoa and tea.</p>
<p>New York cocoa prices rose sharply higher on Wednesday due in part to the El Nino factor.</p>
<p>&quot;Fears that the developing weather pattern called 'El Nino' could produce damaging dry weather in key cocoa producing countries provided background support and could be a legitimate long-term factor,&quot; Prudential Securities analyst Arthur Stevenson said.</p>
<p>A senior Indonesian cocoa industry official said he was concerned over news of El Nino impacting production, especially with the main crop harvest under way.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be keeping a close eye on production levels in June and July to see if there has been any impact,&quot; he said. &quot;It is already getting difficult to get cocoa beans now.&quot;</p>
<p>Oesman Soedargo, chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters, said late on Wednesday production was expected to fall by 160,000 tonnes to 290,000 tonnes in 1997 from about 450,000 tonnes last year.</p>
<p>He blamed the shortfall on bad weather than affected the flowering and fruiting process.</p>
