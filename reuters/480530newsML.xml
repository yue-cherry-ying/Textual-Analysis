<p>Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Yasuo Matsushita said on Tuesday that the merger agreement between two Hokkaido banks announced earlier in the day would contribute to restoring confidence in Japan's financial system and to the stability of the system.  </p>
<p>Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd, Japan's 10th-largest commercial bank, and the smaller regional bank Hokkaido Bank Ltd said earlier on Tuesday that they plan to merge in April 1998.</p>
<p>Matsushita said in a statement that the merger was expected to lead to an improvement in customer services and also contribute to invigorating the economy further in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank of Japan highly evaluates this decisive judgment made by the two banks and also believes this will contribute significantly to the stability of, and restoration of confidence in the Japanese financial system,&quot; Matsushita said in the statement.  </p>
<p>The central bank had been told that the merger plan was initiated voluntarily by the two banks and agreed on with the objective of the newly merged bank further developing a strong mangerial base while adapting to the nation's &quot;Big Bang&quot; financial reforms, the statement said.</p>
