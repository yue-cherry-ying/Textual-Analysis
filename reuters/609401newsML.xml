<p>The city and county of Denver, underwriters and bondholders reached an agreement to settle class-action lawsuits alleging securities fraud in the sale of Denver International Airport bonds, attorneys said on Friday.</p>
<p>Under the proposed settlement, underwriters Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co, Interra Financial Inc unit Dain Bosworth, Piper Jaffray Inc and Lazard Freres &amp; Co would pay $4.5 million to settle with Denver International Airport bond purchasers, attorneys said.  The city of Denver would pay nothing under the settlement, attorneys for Denver said.  </p>
<p>Denver attorney Daniel Muse said city officials were &quot;relieved that this is over.&quot;</p>
<p>Attorneys said underwriters agreed to settle the case because the cost of litigation was higher than the payout to settle the dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;It's done and it's over,&quot; Lehman Brothers spokesman Chris Cosentino said.  He declined further comment.</p>
<p>The other firms declined to comment.</p>
<p>The bondholder lawsuits were filed over two years ago against both the underwriters and the city and county of Denver.  </p>
<p>The suits involved $3 billion of tax-exempt bonds issued to construct the $5 billion Denver International Airport.</p>
<p>The lawsuits charged that officials knew, but failed to disclose, problems with its state-of-the-art baggage handling system.  The problems triggered an 18-month delay in the airport's opening and a downgrade of the bonds' ratings.</p>
<p>The delays prompted a Securities and Exchange Commission probe of the airport bonds.  But last October, the SEC told the city of Denver it had been cleared.  </p>
<p>The proposed settlement still requires court approval. It could take the agreement 60 to 90 days to work its way through the courts completely.  Once approval were finalized, the class-action lawsuits would be dismissed in their entirety.</p>
<p>Bondholders' lawyer Sherrie Savett declined to comment.</p>
<p>Denver's attorneys said the settlement was &quot;vindication.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The city believes that there was no liability and certainly no damage suffered by any of these investors, and the city never did anything wrong in connection with the sale of these bonds,&quot; said Denver attorney James Lyons. &quot;We believe the settlement is a complete vindication of that position.&quot;</p>
