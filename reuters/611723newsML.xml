<title>SINGAPORE: Asia Product Swaps - Gas oil steady but bearish.</title>

<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Singapore gas oil swaps were steady at midday on Friday but sentiment was bearish amid high stocks in Singapore and unconvincing support at just above the $25.00-per-barrel mark in the physical market, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Gas oil is holding its own this morning but the fundamentals are bearish because of the high stocks in Singapore,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>June gas oil swaps were last quoted unchanged from Thursday at $25.00/$25.20 per barrel, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Singapore middle distillate stocks for the week ended May 21, consisting jet fuel, kerosene and gas oil, hit an at least three-year high of 10.345 million barrels, up 1.381 million barrels from the previous week, Singapore's Trade Development Board said.</p>
<p>Barely two months ago, middle distillate stocks were at an at least three year low at 4.953 million barrels.</p>
<p>Traders said the high stocks were a reflection of the large arbitrage cargoes that remained unsold in Singapore.  </p>
<p>In the physical market, on average between seven to 10 offers were heard looking to sell about 1.5 million barrels of gas oil for June lifting.</p>
<p>On Thursday, three 150,000-barrel cargoes traded at between $25.10 and $25.20 per barrel on a free-on-board (fob) Singapore basis, down 20 cents from Tuesday's traded level.</p>
<p>The jet fuel/gas oil spread or regrade extended its recent slide in the face of strong selling pressure as refiners looked to the spot physical market to offload their product amid poor enduser demand from the region.  </p>
<p>June regrade was last quoted at minus 40 to minus 20 cents, about 5 cents lower than Thursday.</p>
<p>Fuel oil swaps also edged down slightly as buying interest was capped at the $103.50-per-tonne mark--a level where two 20,000-tonne cargoes traded on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Traders said the weaker market was due to bearish fundamentals with little incremental demand seen from the local bunker market and China.</p>
<p>June was last quoted at $100.50/$102.00 per tonne, down about 25 cents from Thursday, brokers said.</p>
