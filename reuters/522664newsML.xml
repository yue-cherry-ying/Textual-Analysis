<title>ARMENIA: Armenian, Azerbaijan accuse each other of attacks.</title>

<p>Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other on Saturday of shelling border villages in which people were killed and wounded.</p>
<p>The Armenian Defence Minsitry said in a statement Azeri artillery shelled a village in the Taush district for four hours, wounding two villagers and one Armenian officer.</p>
<p>It said Armenian border troops returned fire.</p>
<p>The Azeri Defence Ministry, in a statement published by Itar-Tass news agency, said unspecified number of people were killed and wounded by artillery and firearms fire from the Armenian side.</p>
<p>There was no independent confirmation of both reports.</p>
<p>The latest clashes, lasting for over a week, were the worst since a 1994 ceasefire ended a protracted territorial dispute involving Armenia, Azerbaijan and Azerbaijan's breakaway of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
<p>Predominantly Armenian-populated Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan in late 1980s and thousands of people died in years of fighting over the region.</p>
<p>More than 20 percent of Azerbaijan's territory, including Karabakh, is now controlled by separatist forces. Baku says this amounts to occupation of its territory by Armenia proper.</p>
<p>Armenia says it was not a formal party in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Karabakh, but it gave its ethnic kin strong moral and military support and Karabakh leader Robert Kocharyan is now the Armenian prime minister.</p>
<p>A long lasting settlement has become crucial for Azerbaijan as it prepares to exploit off-shore oil deposits which will make the former Soviet republic a major world oil player.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said on Friday Ter-Petrosyan and Azeri President Haydar Aliyev held a telephone conversation in which they expressed concern over the new fighting.</p>
<p>Interfax said each side had reaffirmed their commitment to the ceasefire and had ordered their troops to &quot;obey it very strictly.&quot;</p>
<p>The International Commitee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement issued in Geneva on Saturday that Azerbaijan has unilaterally freed five detained Armenians who were then flown to Yerevan, Armenia from Baku, Azerbajijan.</p>
<p>The latest release follows a swap on April 5 when 10 detainees were freed. Azerbaijan released six Armenian civilians and Armenia released four Azerbaijani military personnel.</p>
<p>On April 16 one detainee was released by Azerbaijani authorities and transferred to Russia, ICRC said.</p>
<p>&quot;The ICRC is encouraged by these developments and is confident that they are part of an accelerating process which will now lead to the freeing of the 10 military personnel currently being detained and regularly visited by the ICRC in Baku and Stepanakert/Khan Kendi,&quot; ICRC said in a statement.</p>
<p>The three releases follow a joint appeal by France, the United States and Russia, which co-chair the Minsk Group or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).</p>
<p>The prisoners were taken during fighting over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave.</p>
