<p>South Korea's Finance Minister on Friday fired a warning shot at financial institutions that contribute to the problem of bankruptcy rumours by moving too quickly to call in debts.</p>
<p>In a luncheon with officials of non-bank financial institutions, Kang Kyong-shik said the government would investigate those institutions that refuse fresh loans or call in corporate debts without good reason.</p>
<p>He also said he would establish a special centre to hear companies' complaints of &quot;unreasonable&quot; demands by lenders.</p>
<p>Kang's comments turned around the stock market, hit by company failure jitters on Friday morning. The stock index closed up 6.15 points at 730.53, after falling to an intraday low of 715.53 prior to Kang's remarks.</p>
<p>But economists were unimpressed.</p>
<p>&quot;The government needed something to extinguish a fire fed by crisis rumours that would have erupted in June,&quot; said Hwang Min, economist at Shinhan Research Institute, an affiliate of Shinhan Bank &quot;But I'm wondering how binding this will be.&quot;</p>
<p>Kang criticised financial companies for moving too quickly to call in debts of firms rumoured to be in trouble following the collapse of Hanbo Steel Co in January and Sammi Steel Co in March.</p>
<p>Since then, four industrial conglomerates, or chaebols, including sixth-ranked Ssangyong Group, have acknowledged liquidity problems and pledged to restructure.</p>
<p>Kang said lenders' eagerness to act on rumours had triggered severe cash-flow problems among domestic companies, even though the money market had remained stable.</p>
<p>The current situation stemmed from financial institutions' &quot;excessively strict&quot; application of loan terms since the recent string of corporate failures, he said.</p>
<p>Kang said all financial institutions should get together voluntarily to work out an action plan.</p>
<p>Merchant banks in particular have been unwilling to shoulder any of the burden of troubled corporates, preferring to shift the burden of helping companies stay afloat to banks, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is forcing banks to undertake the entire responsibility of providing credit, which will lead banks to default in the long run,&quot; Kang said. &quot;This will cause a financial crisis and lead to serious economic trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>Local media said merchant banks had called in 2.3 trillion won ($2.58 billion) worth of debts since April. A finance ministry official said the institutions had reduced their credits by 230 million won in April from a month ago.</p>
<p>Merchant banks, with smaller capital bases, typically extend short-term loans with little or no collateral.</p>
<p>Kang urged non-bank institutions not to drastically curtail credits on the basis of rumours or unsubstantiated information.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really a shame that the government has retreated from its deregulation policy,&quot; said Jun Sung-in, economics professor at Hongik University. &quot;It will be a temporary remedy, which cannot solve the real problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Economists said Kang's unexpectedly strong remarks indicated the bail-out committee set up by financial institutions in April had not been working smoothly.</p>
<p>Joined with some reluctance by merchant banks, the committee has agreed to defer debt payments and extend new credit to keep troubled companies in business. So far, Jinro and Dainong groups have been promised a bail-out.</p>
<p>&quot;The birth of the bail-out committee was wrong from the beginning,&quot; said Jwa Seung-hee, president of the Korea Economy Research Institute. &quot;Kang's plan is another bad move.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said the committee encouraged companies to take on more debts as it said it would intervene only in cases where a company's debt exceeded 250 billion won.</p>
