<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index posted its ninth biggest point loss ever on Tuesday after fears of higher interest rates sent Wall Street stocks into a tailspin overnight and the local property outlook worried investors.</p>
<p>The blue chip index plummeted 460.13 points, or 3.67 percent, to 12,074.19. The slide came on the back of a 157.11 point fall in the Dow industrials on Monday to 6,583.48.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of nervous investors concerned over the future of interest rates,&quot; said Miles Remington, a sales trader at SocGen-Crosby Securities. &quot;People are very nervous about buying given the belief that Wall Street has further to go.&quot;  </p>
<p>Turnover was HK$9.06 billion versus HK$8.96 billion last Thursday. The market was closed on Friday and Monday for Easter.</p>
<p>Property stocks took the biggest hit, hurt by both fears that the United States had embarked on a series of interest rate tightenings after raising rates last week and worries that the Hong Kong government may intervene further to curb rising property prices after moving last week to increase supply.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything has just rolled into one,&quot; said Remington.</p>
<p>Shares in Cheung Kong slumped HK$4.50 to HK$63.75 and Sun Hung Kai Properties tumbled HK$3.50 to HK$78.50.  </p>
<p>Henderson Land fell HK$3.25 to HK$61.00 and New World Development dropped HK$2.10 to HK$39.70.</p>
<p>Alex Tang, head of research at Yamaichi International, said the stocks were oversold and property developers should not find their bottom lines affected by the government's move last week to increase the supply of flats.</p>
<p>The government said it would extend the presale period for private flats and said developers would have to put presale flats onto the market within six months of the date of consent.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of them have already booked most of the profit for this year,&quot; said Tang.  </p>
<p>He said the Hang Seng Index should hold around current levels. &quot;We have been banking on this support level at 12,000 and now we are focusing on what happens tonight on Wall Street.&quot;</p>
<p>Remington said the blue chip index would probably test below the 12,000 point level and could possibly fall to around 11,800 points before finding support.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there is a little bit further downside,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Shares in HSBC Holdings finished on a loss of HK$5.00 at HK$175.00 and Hang Seng Bank fell HK$3.75 to HK$76.25.</p>
