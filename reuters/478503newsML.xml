<p>Zimbabwe will launch a new phase of economic reforms by May designed to win IMF backing and restore suspended balance of payments support, Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He told Reuters in Addis Ababa the International Monetary Fund and Zimbabwe were still at odds over Zimbabwe's large budget deficit but measures were being taken to address &quot;that sticking point&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The IMF visited my country and we have held positive discussions on measures to improve our economy. Further consultations are going on,&quot; Murerwa said on the sidelines of a conference of African finance ministers.</p>
<p>&quot;Measures have been thought out to address the sticking question of a large budget deficit. But our economy is alive and well,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said gross domestic product growth was 8.1 percent in 1995/96 and forecast slower growth of about 5.0 percent in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Murerwa said Zimbabwe had no misunderstandings with the IMF and was anxious to see a resumption of balance of payments support, which was suspended about two years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that aid resumption can come soon. Both sides have shown good intentions in the discussions and we would be happy to see a speedy conclusion of the negotiations,&quot; Murerwa said.</p>
<p>He said Zimbabwe was working on a programme of &quot;home-grown and unique economic reforms&quot; which he hoped would win the backing of the World Bank and the IMF.</p>
<p>The reforms to be launched in a month included measures to streamline and strengthen fiscal policy, further privatisation and public service reform.</p>
<p>He would not say how many civil service jobs would be cut or which public companies Zimbabwe planned to sell first.</p>
<p>Murerwa said a new trade agreement with South Africa to replace one which was signed in 1964 and expired two years ago was expected &quot;very soon&quot; but he did not say when.</p>
<p>He said South Africa and Zimbabwe had already agreed on tariff reductions on several sectors, including textiles, and that South Africa was not an obstacle to the treaty.</p>
<p>&quot;There already is an agreement. It is really just a matter of time before the trade treaty is signed. I cannot put a date to it but it will be very soon,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said Zimbabwe was not very impressed by a new international debt initiative that aims to reduce total debt for the most indebted and poorest countries on the globe.</p>
<p>He said a six-year track record of economic reform success was too long and eligibility criteria were suspect.</p>
<p>&quot;With the current criteria, there aren't many African countries that qualify. Zimbabwe does not and no southern African country does,&quot; he said.</p>
