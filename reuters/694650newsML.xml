<p>French carmaker Renault said after a board meeting on Saturday it had decided to go ahead and close a Belgian factory employing around 3,000 workers, despite heavy government and trade union pressure to consider alternatives.</p>
<p>The group announced the decision in a statement issued after a meeting called by chairman Louis Schweitzer to decide the fate of the Vilvoorde assembly plant near Brussels on the basis of an independent report into the plans to shut the factory on July 31.  </p>
<p>The statement said the report by an outside consultant concluded that cutting working time at the Vilvoorde plant, instead of closing, was not a viable alternative.</p>
<p>&quot;The chairman indicated that the procedure with a view to closing the plant in 1997 will be pursued,&quot; it said, without giving further details on timing.</p>
<p>Schweitzer said talks with trade unions would continue on a plan which would include compensation and offers of employment to Vilvoorde workers at other factories in France, it said.</p>
<p>The company would also ensure that some form of industrial activity was continued at Vilvoorde by Renault or its business partners, creating &quot;around 400 jobs&quot;. It would also do all it could to find a buyer willing to devote the site to automobile business.</p>
