<title>RUSSIA: Leading Russian poet Okudzhava dies in Paris.</title>

<p>Russian poet and singer Bulat Okudzhava, whose dissident lyrics once filled stadiums with fans, has died aged 73, Russian media reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Television and radio stations led morning news broadcasts with reports that Okuzhava died late on Thursday at a hospital in suburban Paris.</p>
<p>He was especially influential in the 1960s and 1970s, but his simple melodies and moving lyrics, accompanied typically by the strumming of an acoustic guitar, attracted generations of fans.</p>
<p>Love, war and everyday life were all the focus of Okuzhava's lyrics.</p>
<p>In one of his songs about Moscow's most famous streets, he sang: &quot;Ah Arbat, my Arbat, you are my melody, you are my Fatherland, you are my joy and sorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Half Georgian and half Armenian, Okudzhava was long out of favour with communist authories, but won approval of reform- minded authorities in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>In December 1994 he won the 10,000 pound ($15,000) Russian Booker literary prize, but did not attend the award ceremony because of poor health. He was also named a member of President Boris Yeltsin's council on culture and art.</p>
<p>In recent years he developed heart problems and kept a low public profile. He had heart surgery in the United States several years ago, and in August last year he suffered a heart attack.</p>
<p>Tass quoted his wife Olga as saying he died &quot;from the psychological stress of loneliness&quot;.</p>
