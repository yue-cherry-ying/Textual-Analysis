<p>Pakistan's parliament re-established its supremacy and may end perennial power struggles between the president and prime minister with the passage of a key bill on Tuesday, analysts said.</p>
<p>The constitutional amendment bill strips the president of powers to sack governments and appoint armed forces chiefs and provincial governors.</p>
<p>&quot;Today is the beginning of real democracy in this country,&quot; National Assembly (lower house) speaker Ilahi Bakhsh Soomro said.</p>
<p>The move, announced overnight by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, undoes clauses of the controversial Eighth Amendment, a relic from the rule of General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq from 1977 to 1988 and used by presidents to sack four prime ministers in the past eight years.</p>
<p>&quot;Finally, politicians have the confidence to assert themselves and I hope this signals the restoration of parliamentary supremacy,&quot; said Shirin Mazari, former head of the department of defence and strategic studies at Islamabad's Quadi-i-Azam University.</p>
<p>&quot;This should be a clear message now to the president (Farooq Leghari) that he should take a back seat because that is where he belongs in a democracy,&quot; Mazari said about the powers Pakistani presidents have enjoyed for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Analysts have often said the bane of political system in Pakistan was the tussle for power between the presidency and the premiership and the political influence of the armed forces, which have ruled Pakistan for 24 years in the past half-century.</p>
<p>&quot;The parliamentary system does not give room to have such a tussle because the prime minister in a parliament is really supreme,&quot; Mazari said.</p>
<p>Supporters of the Eighth Amendment had always argued that the power to sack a government by the president was a barrier against the martial law.</p>
<p>&quot;I think these powers should have not been there from the very beginning. It is a fallacious argument to say that it was a safety valve against martial law,&quot; Hussain Naqi, a senior newspaper columnist, said.</p>
<p>Analysts said a Council for Defence and National Security (CDNS) recently created by Leghari under his own chairmanship to further curtail the powers of a prime minister should also end.</p>
<p>The council, bringing together armed forces chiefs and senior ministers, gave the military its first formal say in government.</p>
<p>&quot;The next step should be the end of CDNS, because now it has become an anomaly, because it is headed by the president and while the president has been restored as a figurehead now, what is the point of having a CDNS,&quot; Mazari asked.</p>
<p>&quot;CDNS should also go. It is a civilised society and this supra-constitutional body is not required at all,&quot; Hussain Naqi said.</p>
<p>Zia, who introduced the Eighth Amendment as part of a bargain to end martial law, used it to sack his own hand-picked prime minister Mohammad Khan Junejo in May 1988 before being killed in a mysterious plane crash.</p>
<p>Bhutto was sacked first by then president Ishaq Khan in 1990 and then by Leghari last November. Sharif was sacked by Ishaq Khan in 1993.</p>
