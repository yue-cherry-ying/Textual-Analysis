<p>Flamboyant Russian nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky scuffled with two television reporters on Thursday after he was denied access to a World War Two commemoration attended by President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>Zhirinovsky, who once threw a glass of juice at Boris Nemtsov, now a first deputy prime minister, was furious after presidential bodyguards barred him from a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</p>
<p>Television footage showed Zhirinovsky push a woman violently into his car and eyewitnesses said he also tangled with a cameraman. Both worked for Russian television stations.</p>
<p>In the past the leader of Russia's extreme right Liberal Democratic party has also scuffled on the floor of parliament.</p>
<p>Zhirinovsky, a member of the lower house of parliament, is immune from prosecution because of his parliamentary status.</p>
<p>But Itar-Tass news agency quoted Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov as saying he would open an investigation into the incident, which took place on the eve of celebration marking the end of World War Two.</p>
<p>Zhirinovsky complained in a statement released by his office that presidential guards had denied him access to the tomb, but he did not mention the fight with the two reporters.</p>
