<headline>German DAX led higher by autos at bourse start.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>German shares edged up in early trade on Friday but were not seen staging any major rally with holidays due in the U.S. and Britain on Monday dampening trade and making significant dollar movements unlikely.</p>
<p>The DAX-30 blue-chip share index gained 13.68 points, 0.38 percent, to 3,593.10 early on, with June DAX futures pushing a little further ahead to 3,604.5.</p>
<p>Car giant Volkswagen gained 25.0 marks to 1,152 marks, pushing through a technical resistance point of 1,150, while Mercedes-maker Daimler was up 1.15 marks to 133.10. Dealers said there had been buy recommendations in the sector.</p>
<p>Dresdner Bank, Germany's second largest bank, gained 80 pfennigs to 62.60 marks as it said it was optimistic for full-year results and dividend after a 10 percent rise in first quarter profits.</p>
<p>Earlier, it denied media reports it was interested in taking a stake in Postbank, the state-owned bank currently tied to the postal system.</p>
<p>Software firm SAP was a shade weaker in early IBIS electronic trade on what dealers said was continued concern over allegations of insider trading, despite a statement from state prosecutors Thursday clearing 71 SAP staff of any suspicion.</p>
<p>In bourse trade, its preference shares lost 50 pfennigs to 320.0 marks.</p>
