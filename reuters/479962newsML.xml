<p>The Troy, N.Y., Supervisory Board sees improvements in the city's fiscal health and might finish its task in two years, the Albany Times Union said in its Tuesday edition.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope two years from now we're out of here,&quot; state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who serves as the board chairman, was quoted as saying. &quot;We think they are slowly moving on the right track.&quot;</p>
<p>The board approved a contract for financing the final closure of the landfill and settlements with the city school district over delinquent taxes and the Civil Service Employees Association to either reinstate or pay restitution or to place on preferential hiring lists some 47 city workers fired by the former administration in October, 1993, the paper said.</p>
<p>The 40-acre landfill will be closed with as much as $7.2 million in money from the state Environmental Facilities Corp., with part of the cost likely to be offset by up to $2 million in expected aid for distressed cities.</p>
<p>Troy ended 1996 with a fund balance of just over $800,000, and cut its debt service to 17 percent of its $36 million budget from 25 percent, Mayor Mark Pattison told the paper.</p>
<p>The city ended the year with a surplus even though it overspent its transportation budget by $260,000, mainly due to a blizzard and flooding. Also, the city got $500,000 more in sales tax revenues than it had expected, the mayor said.</p>
