<p>Israeli and Palestinian experts will meet in Cairo on Sunday as a result of talks on Friday between Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa announced the arrangements on Saturday after Arafat briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on his latest contacts with the Israelis.</p>
<p>The Israeli adviser gave Arafat new Israeli ideas to break the deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian talks, he added. The Sunday meeting will discuss &quot;important points connected with the peace process, including settlements&quot;.</p>
<p>Moussa did not name the Israeli adviser or the experts who will take part in the Cairo meeting, which an Egyptian representative will attend as an observer.</p>
<p>Egypt has been mediating between Israel and the Palestinians in an attempt to revive negotiations, suspended since Netanyahu decided in March to go ahead with a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Egyptian minister declined to say if he saw the agreement to meet in Cairo as a positive development. &quot;I think one must refrain from commenting...We must wait to see what comes out of the meeting of experts tomorrow,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What's been put to President Arafat now is some Israeli ideas. One mustn't go into details because that is the right of the Palestinian side, which has its known positions on the (Israeli) settlement policy,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Asked if the meeting in Cairo could be the prelude to a meeting between Arafat and Netanyahu, he said: &quot;So far there are no other steps proposed, apart from the meeting,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that tomorrow's meeting at the level of experts will produce some benefit for the sake of the issue,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Arafat arrived in Cairo from Gaza on Saturday morning and officials said he was leaving later in the day for Jordan.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources said on Friday Egypt and the Palestinians were working on a five-point plan which includes a freeze on any change in the status of Jerusalem and a ban on Jewish settlement of the West Bank for &quot;a sufficient period&quot;.</p>
<p>In return the Palestinians would give a firm commitment to address Israel's security demands, they added.</p>
<p>But the sources said the gap between the two sides remained very wide, especially over Jewish settlements. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to reverse a decision to build 6,500 homes for Jews on the site in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear how the new Israeli ideas fitted in with Egyptian-Palestinian proposals.</p>
<p>Moussa said on Thursday it was premature to talk of any openings on the Israeli side, particularly since the Jewish state this week outlined a vision for peace in which Palestinians are largely sidelined.</p>
