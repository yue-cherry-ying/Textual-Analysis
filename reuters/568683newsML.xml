<p>Rick Pitino called his latest challenge as new head coach and president of the Boston Celtics a dream come true and promised to restore the most storied franchise in NBA history to the championship level.</p>
<p>The former Kentucky coach was officially introduced to the media at a news conference at the Fleet Centre Thursday after accepting an astonishing 10-year, $70 million offer that will make him the richest coach in professional sports.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a dream come true for me to be the head coach of such an incredible institution,&quot; said Pitino, who began his college coaching career 19 years ago in Boston and is acutely aware of the Celtics history.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to coach one of the greatest traditions in all of sports and what a tremendous honour that is for me,&quot; he said, while sitting under the Celtics' 16 NBA championship banners.</p>
<p>Pitino stepped down as basketball coach at Kentucky on Tuesday to take over a team that has fallen on hard times. The Celtics, which won its last championship in 1986, finished with the worst record in the NBA this season.</p>
<p>But the 45-year-old Pitino has earned a well-deserved reputation for turning around the fortunes of every team he has coached.</p>
<p>He took over a scandal-ridden programme at the University of Kentucky that was reeling from NCAA-imposed probation and built it back into National Champions in 1996.</p>
<p>Pitino, who led Kentucky back to the NCCA championship game again this year, also made winners out of Boston University and Providence at the college level.</p>
<p>And he did wonders for the New York Knicks in his first stint as an NBA head coach, taking a struggling club and turning it into a division winner in two years, before deciding to return to college ball at Kentucky in 1989.</p>
<p>&quot;I will work harder than coach Auerbach has ever seen any individual work to represent him in the best light possible to bring this organisation back to the championship level,&quot; promised Pitino, with a nod to Celtics Vice Chairman Red Auerbach, who as coach and team official was responsible for much of the team's great success over the years.</p>
<p>Pitino, who was courted for the post by Celtics' legend Larry Bird, said he hoped Bird would reject an offer to become head coach of the Indiana Pacers and remain with the Boston organisation.</p>
<p>&quot;Larry Bird epitomises Celtic pride and I'd like him to come in as general manager,&quot; Pitino said. &quot;I'd like him to evaluate, scout, be around the guys and help us win.</p>
<p>&quot;We'd love to see him not coach, but if that is something he wants to do ... it's really fun to grow old in a hurry,&quot; Pitino joked.</p>
<p>&quot;If he would want to coach ... I'm sure he would do an outstanding job,&quot; Pitino said of Bird.</p>
<p>Pitino takes over a team that is short on talent and long removed from the Celtics' championship traditions. But he gave certain assurances of the players he will put on the court next season.</p>
<p>&quot;They will be in best shape of their life, they will play better defence then they've ever played, they will have fun doing it ... and we'll make sure that all understand what it is to put that jersey on.&quot;</p>
<p>The charismatic Pitino, who turned down many other NBA coaching offers in recent years, including a lucrative deal that would have given him part ownernship of the New Jersey Nets last year, mentioned some of the former Celtic greats with whom he will be able to share ideas, pointing out Hall of Famer John Havlicek at the crowded news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;For me just to look around and see these gentleman just brings a twinkle to my eye, how lucky I am,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;So I'm thankful to be here, I'm honoured, I can't wait to get started,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish practice was tomorrow.&quot;</p>
