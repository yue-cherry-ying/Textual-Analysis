<p>With aid to developing countries declining throughout the world, U.N. officials said on Monday that stopping the downward slide was crucial to next week's Earth Summit.</p>
<p>&quot;There in fact has been a decline in support for development cooperation,&quot; Nitin Desai, an undersecretary-general for sustainable development told a news conference. &quot;A commitment is needed to reverse that.&quot;</p>
<p>As the fifth anniversary of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro approaches, about 70 heads of state or government will come to the United Nations, beginning on June 23, to set new targets on environment and development.</p>
<p>These range from conserving fresh water supplies, chemical pollutants, examining new sources of energy, stopping the decline in fish stocks and preserving forests.</p>
<p>World leaders are bound to come up with some initiatives -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, for example, is expected to propose Bonn as the site for a world U.N. environmental centre. But so far few financial commitments have been forthcoming.</p>
<p>By far the most contentious issue of the summit is what many call the broken promises at Rio by rich states, which recognise they are the world's chief polluters. They were to make available new resources to developing countries so economic growth could be integrated with ecological goals.</p>
<p>Instead direct aid has declined to an average of 0.27 of the gross domestic product among industrial states compared to 0.33 percent in 1992. And increasing private investment is concentrated in a small number of countries, Desai said.</p>
<p>Rich states were to increase their contributions gradually to 0.7 percent of the GDP to development assistance to raise $125 billion annually until the year 2000 of the $600 billion needed for poor nations.</p>
<p>Consequently, at preparatory conferences for the summit, many developing countries blocked initiatives on a variety of environmental proposals until there was progress on financing.</p>
<p>&quot;If you are worried about the environment, it can't be done simply by environmental actions,&quot; Desai said. &quot;What it requires is actions at the heart of development and economic policies.</p>
