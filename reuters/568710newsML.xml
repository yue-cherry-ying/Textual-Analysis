<p>Spanish soccer coach Javier Clemente is expected to extend his contract with the national side until 2000, according to reports in the Spanish media on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope the players like the news. In other areas there will be a variety of opinions,&quot; said the notoriously controversial Clemente in the sports daily 'Marca' on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Spanish Football Federation on Thursday confirmed that the matter would be reviewed at a meeting on Friday, and that the formalities of the extension would then be finalised.</p>
<p>Clemente's side lost to Italy in the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Cup, but, penalty shoot-outs apart, have been unbeaten since.</p>
<p>Spain qualified without loss for Euro '96 and were only eliminated after losing to hosts England on penalties in the quarter-finals, a game many commentators felt they deserved to win.</p>
<p>Clemente's side are favourites to win their World Cup qualifying group after following up a 2-0 home win over chief rivals Yugoslavia with a 1-1 draw in Belgrade last week.</p>
