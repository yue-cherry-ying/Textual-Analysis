<p>Politicians campaigning for June 2 federal elections capitalised on Thursday on a revelation by a former Quebec separatist leader that he intended to take the province out of Canada despite promising the contrary.</p>
<p>The remarks by Jacques Parizeau, ex-Premier of the French-speaking province, cut straight to the issue of the credibility of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, which sought to distance itself from his remarks.</p>
<p>To Canada's other main parties, they proved an unexpected, energising gift.</p>
<p>&quot;This could have a very big impact,&quot; the Liberal Party government's point man on Quebec, Stephane Dion, told a news conference.</p>
<p>Parizeau was Quebec Premier and leader of the separatist campaign in a 1995 referendum on whether Quebec should become sovereign after making an offer of partnership with the rest of Canada. Voters narrowly rejected sovereignty.</p>
<p>In his memoirs, excerpted in Le Soleil newspaper on Wednesday, he said he would not have waited to negotiate with the rest of Canada but would have declared independence within days.</p>
<p>The disclosure suddenly made Canadians take notice of the Bloc Quebecois campaign slogan &quot;Parole de Quebecois&quot;, which translates roughly as &quot;That's the word of a Quebecker.&quot; In other words, &quot;trust us&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I deeply believe that Quebeckers deserve the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,&quot; Prime Minister Jean Chretien told a Wednesday night rally in Quebec City.</p>
<p>On Thursday Chretien said it proved the Liberal government had been right to go to the Canadian Supreme Court to rule on the legality of a unilateral declaration of independence.</p>
<p>Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe conceded: &quot;It's not good for the sovereigntist movement, and what's not good for the sovereigntist movement is not good for the Bloc.&quot;</p>
<p>Conservative leader Jean Charest, a rival of Chretien's in the federal campaign but united with him in the goal of keeping Canada united, asked: &quot;How much can you really trust what the sovereigntist leaders are telling you?&quot;</p>
<p>Dion charged that Parizeau's real goal was straight sovereignty and he had agreed to include an offer of partnership in the referendum question only to increase his chances.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a trick,&quot; Dion declared through a translator. &quot;It was a recipe for disaster. It was a recipe for chaos both in Quebec and across Canada.&quot;</p>
<p>Quebec has always had a hard core of francophone separatists but also many &quot;soft sovereigntists&quot; who want more power for Quebec but are uneasy about losing the privileges of being part of Canada.</p>
<p>A new poll published in the newspaper La Presse on Thursday showed Chretien's Liberals, who trailed the Bloc by 33 to 49 percent in the last election in 1993, now tied at 39 percent apiece in Quebec in the June 2 election race.</p>
<p>The SOM poll sampled 980 people from May 2-7, before the Parizeau remarks were disclosed, and carried a margin of error of 3.63 percent 19 times out of 20.</p>
<p>The Bloc Quebecois was the official opposition in the last Parliament. It cannot launch a new referendum itself, but its strength in Ottawa is important in keeping the separatist movement alive.</p>
<p>Parizeau is expected to meet reporters when he officially unveils his memoirs next Monday -- keeping the issue prominent ahead of televised debates among the party leaders that evening and on Tuesday.</p>
