<p>Jakarta stocks ended up on Friday on the back of minor buying in blue chips despite unfounded rumours of unrest in the capital on the last day of the general election campaign, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Rumours of riots in Jakarta affected market sentiment since morning. Some investors used this opportunity to buy some blue chip counters,&quot; a broker with a European firm said.</p>
<p>The Jakarta Composite Index closed 4.43 points, or 0.68 percent, higher at 658.52 points. Gainers led losers by 45 to 42, with 82 counters unchanged. Total turn-over was estimated at about 326 billion rupiah.  </p>
<p>&quot;Sentiment on secondaries was dampened by fears of violence in the city. Many local investors were just squaring their positions,&quot; another broker with a local firm said.</p>
<p>Blue chip counters such as Semen Gresik, Telkom and cigarette maker Sampoerna were among the targets of buyers, brokers said.</p>
<p>Cement maker Semen Gresik rose 150 rupiah to 5,550 rupiah on 1.3 million shares despite the company announcing weak first quarter net profit of 35.42 billion rupiah against 41.20 billion rupiah in the year-ago period.  </p>
<p>&quot;Previously the market consensus was net profit will be about 33 billion rupiah. So this announcement gave a small boost to sentiment,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>Small property firm Bhuwanatala was the most active stock with about 11.3 million shares traded at an unchanged price of 675 rupiah. Brokers said it was linked to recent reports of the company's restructuring plans.</p>
<p>Another property firm, Mas Murni, was also active on talk that it was a target of a take-over bid, brokers said.</p>
<p>Glass makers Mulia Industrindo and Asahimas Flat Glass were also active on speculation, brokers said.</p>
