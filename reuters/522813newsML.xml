<p>Germany's ruling coalition and the opposition traded accusations on Saturday about the government's ambitious tax reform plan, foreshadowing more tense talks when the two sides meet again next week.</p>
<p>&quot;The Christian Democrats/Christian Social Union and Free Democrats' tax plans threaten the recovery of the east,&quot; said Oskar Lafontaine, head of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), in an opinion piece for Sunday's Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper.</p>
<p>Lafontaine said the tax reforms would create an annual financing gap of 56 billion marks ($32.5 billion) which would have to be financed by state and local governments.</p>
<p>&quot;None of the 16 German states can absorb such deficits. For the east German states, the Kohl government's tax plans are a catastrophe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition and the SPD agreed to meet again on Wednesday to discuss Finance Minister Theo Waigel's plan to cut 30 billion marks in taxes after little progress was made at last Tuesday's talks.</p>
<p>Waigel's package is designed to increase investment and cut high unemployment. Its timing is critical as the government scrambles to trim its budget deficit to meet the strict entry criteria for European monetary union.</p>
<p>But the SPD can block most tax measures through its control of the upper house of parliament.</p>
<p>The SPD says it wants the government to cut labour insurance charges by two percentage points from July to improve jobs prospects.</p>
<p>The government agreed to make a one-point cut, but only if the SPD gives its full backing to its tax plans. Waigel also says the reduction should go hand-in-hand with reforms to state pensions, health and jobless schemes.</p>
<p>Christian Wulff, the Christian Democrat leader in the state of Lower Saxony, urged the government to stick by its plans and not give in to the SPD's &quot;tactical demands&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In the fight about the tax reform the tone is getting ever sharper, but that is not a solution,&quot; Wulff said in the newspaper Bild am Sonntag.</p>
<p>&quot;To follow Lafontaine's wish and first negotiate new tax increases and increased expenditures and later possibly discuss the larger tax reform would be a catastrophe.&quot;</p>
<p>Bavaria premier Edmund Stoiber, a member of Waigel's Christian Social Union, lashed out at suggestions that Germany's mineral oil tax could be raised to help to reduce social security contributions.</p>
<p>Waigel said two weeks ago he would be willing to cut social scurity contributions by about one point and finance this by raising indirect taxes.</p>
<p>To raise the mineral oil tax by some 15 pfennigs &quot;which would be about equal to a one percentage point increase in the value added tax&quot; would be &quot;problematic for the economy&quot; Stoiber said in an interview in next week's edition of the newsmagazine Focus.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;An increase in the VAT tax to offset a cut in social security contributions would improve our competitiveness and improve job security because labour would become cheaper.&quot;</p>
