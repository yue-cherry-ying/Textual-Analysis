<headline>INTERVIEW - CNA Life open to acquisitions.</headline>

<p>The new head of CNA Financial Corp's life insurance subsidiary on Tuesday said the company would consider acquisitions, international expansion and new relationships with banks as ways to enhance its operations.</p>
<p>CNA Chief Financial Officer Peter Jokiel was named president of CNA Life on Tuesday, replacing Jack Kettler, who resigned on March 1.</p>
<p>Kettler's resignation followed a company inquiry into harassment allegations by two female employees.</p>
<p>A replacement for Jokiel has yet to be named.  </p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters, Jokiel, 49, said his first priority was maintaining and then building on CNA Life's current operations, most of which are based in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
<p>Then he will &quot;try to figure out how to not only maintain what we've already built over the past several years, but enhance its value and its potential profitability, and its contribution to the overall CNA organization,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will accomplish that through a variety of factors, on the product front, on the distribution front, as well as looking at potential acquisition opportunities,&quot; Jokiel said.  </p>
<p>Potential acquisition candidates that would &quot;bring something strategic to the CNA Life operations in the form of product distribution or servicing capability clearly would be more attractive to us than those who just added more to what we have,&quot; Jokiel said.</p>
<p>He said he did not have an acquisition timetable but instead would &quot;continually look at the opportunities that present themselves in the marketplace.&quot;</p>
<p>The company is taking a hard look at changes under way in the distribution of insurance, including electronic sales and new sales relationships with banks.  </p>
<p>However, Jokiel said he expected most banks to avoid taking over insurers and attempting to underwrite the insurance products themselves.</p>
<p>CNA Life also may consider expanding its international operations, Jokiel said.</p>
<p>Several U.S. life insurers have actively expanded outside the United States in the last year or two in pursuit of faster-growing markets.</p>
<p>CNA Life currently has just one operation outside the United States, a Chilean life and annuity company. Jokiel said he would consider expanding elsewhere.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not averse to opportunities outside of the United States and we are exploring them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But, he said, &quot;we will be very careful because we want to make sure we really understand the climate that we're going into, particularly from a geopolitical sense.&quot;</p>
<p>Although CNA's only foreign operation is in Latin America, &quot;I would not close ourselves to opportunities in either the European area or the Pacific Rim,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>CNA life companies are among the 25 largest life insurers in the United States.</p>
