<headline>Bombay shares end higher in day of political drama.</headline>

<p>Blue chips at Bombay exchanges closed near the day's highs on Tuesday as domestic funds and some foreign players bought on dips during a day of wild swings wrought by the country's political crisis, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a lot of buying by local institutions at lower prices,&quot; said Sanjeev Choithani, chief dealer at brokers Pashupati Advani. Buying was seen after the Bombay index on Monday suffered its fourth largest plunge ever of 310 points.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's 10-month old minority coalition government faces a confidence vote by April 11 after the Congress party on Sunday withdrew its crucial support.  </p>
<p>&quot;Our basic view is that the budget will remain intact,&quot; said Ajit Dayal, managing director of Quantum Financial Services which advises foreign and domestic clients. &quot;By and large there'll be no changes.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts pinned hopes on parliament passing the 1997/98 (April-March) budget regardless of the political crisis. &quot;There might be minor changes but we're hopeful the budget will go through,&quot;said Vinay Motwani at brokerage KBS Capital Management</p>
<p>The ruling coalition needs the support of lawmakers from the Congress party or the main opposition, Bharatiya Janata Party to ensure passage of the budget.  </p>
<p>&quot;The budget would not be possible before the confidence vote,&quot; BJP vice-president K.R. Malkani told Reuters. &quot;I don't see how Congress or the BJP will agree with that.&quot;</p>
<p>But it could be considered later, Malkani said. &quot;The government has to approach us then we can consider the matter,&quot; he said. &quot;Let them convene a meeting. Let them do it properly,&quot; BJP president L.K. Advani told Reuters at the party office.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's United Front alliance said the coalition was exploring ways of ensuring passage of the budget before the test vote. &quot;We are making an effort,&quot; spokesman Jaipal Reddy said.</p>
<p>The NSE index rose 0.30 percent at 971.15 provisional close.</p>
