<p>A contingent of unarmed soldiers from China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) will arrive in Hong Kong on Monday in advance of the territory's return to Chinese rule on July 1, the government said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The party of 40 soldiers will come into Hong Kong by road through the territory's land border with China, it said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The PLA advance personnel will be in uniform but will not carry arms,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;Led by Major General Zhou Borong, (they) will arrive in Hong Kong at 1 p.m. (0500 GMT) via the Lok Ma Chau crossing.&quot;</p>
<p>Britain and China previously announced an agreement that 40 PLA personnel will be stationed in Hong Kong from April 21 to prepare facilities, logistics and communications for the garrison that will replace British troops on July 1.</p>
<p>On that day Hong Kong will revert to Chinese sovereignty, ending over 150 years of British colonial rule.</p>
<p>The PLA advance guard will have no defence or security role and their work will not affect the British troops who will garrison Hong Kong up to the handover at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>After the handover Hong Kong has been promised a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years except in areas of defence and foreign affairs.</p>
<p>Up to late on Friday, British and Chinese spokesmen had been reluctant to confirm the arrival of the troops on Monday.</p>
<p>The government statement said the soldiers would arrive in eight vehicles bearing Hong Kong number plates and would go through immigration and customs clearance, and would declare articles they bring with them under normal procedures for visitors.</p>
<p>A pro-China newspaper on Saturday however quoted a Hong Kong customs official as saying a special entry channel would be reserved for the advance party.</p>
<p>&quot;The customs department on that day will arrange a special channel for them, to facilitate their entry,&quot; the official was quoted by the Wen Wei Pao newspaper as saying.</p>
<p>The party will proceed to the Prince of Wales barracks on Hong Kong island beside the territory's harbour where they will be greeted by Commander of the British Forces, Major General Bryan Dutton, the statement said.</p>
<p>In marked contrast to political negotiations, the transfer of defence responsibilities, which has involved direct contacts including rugby matches between the two armies, has been one of the smoother facets of the transition to Chinese rule.</p>
