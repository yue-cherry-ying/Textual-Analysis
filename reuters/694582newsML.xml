<p>The Bank of Italy slightly loosened its tough monetary policy on Friday, cutting the official discount rate to the lowest level for almost 22 years on the back of steadily falling inflation.</p>
<p>The bank said in a statement it would reduce the discount rate to 6.25 percent from 6.75 percent, effective Monday, and at the same time also trim the fixed term advances (Lombard) rate by 50 basis points to 7.75 percent.</p>
<p>The fourth rate cut in less than 12 months was welcomed by politicians, unions and businessmen, who had been urging Bank of Italy governor Antonio Fazio for weeks to ease the cost of borrowing and thus help stimulate Italy's sluggish economy.</p>
<p>But there was also mild disappointment that having waited so long, the cut was so modest.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly the Bank of Italy governor is keeping us on a leash,&quot; Prime Minister Romano Prodi told reporters after hearing news of the cut.</p>
<p>The Bank of Italy indicated that the reduction was made possible by recent falls in inflation, with preliminary data pointing to the consumer price index (CPI) dropping to a 30-year low of 1.4 to 1.5 percent year-on-year in June.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last few months, inflation has been shown a steadily contained trend, in line with the objectives for 1997 and 1998,&quot; the Bank said in the statement.</p>
<p>However the bank also said that the government must keep budget and incomes policy on track to guarantee the future stability of the lira.</p>
<p>The Bank of Italy is believed to be especially keen to see Prodi stick to his promise of introducing a thorough reform of the welfare state, in particular of the generous state pensions system, in the 1998 budget.</p>
<p>The centre-left government has been desperate for action on interest rates to help reduce the cost of servicing Italy's huge public debt and thus boost the country's bid for a place in planned European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>The Treasury says it saves 20 trillion lire ($12 billion) a year in interest costs for every full point fall in the discount rate, once the cut has worked its way into the system.</p>
<p>&quot;This (cut) is a sign that our cleaning up of the Italian economy is continuing and is believed in. It brings us ever closer to our goal of monetary union,&quot; Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said in a statement.</p>
<p>Prodi told reporters he thought Italian inflation was now close to &quot;absolute stability&quot; and made it clear he expected more rate cuts in the months ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;Slowly but surely the discount rate will reach similar levels to those seen in other European countries,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Italian discount rate is now at its lowest level since September 1975, when it stood at 6.0 percent, but is still higher than virtually all other leading economies, with the exception of Britain.</p>
<p>It has fallen from 9.0 percent in less than a year, after three previous reductions, in July and October 1996 and most recently last January.</p>
<p>With inflation falling sharply since the start of the year, many analysts had expected swifter monetary easing, and there was some surprise that having decided to move, Fazio had not been more aggressive.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was looking for more than a half point cut, I think we'll have to wait until autumn for another similar one,&quot; said Mario Noera, chief economist with Deutsche Bank in Milan. ($1 = 1,699 lire)</p>
