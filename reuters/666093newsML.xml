<p>BSkyB chief executive Sam Chisholm has earned a reputation as one of the fiercest and most effective operators in the TV industry in a long career in Australia and Britain.</p>
<p>New Zealander Chisholm, 57, who suffers from asthma, announced on Tuesday that he was stepping down from the company at the end of the year on medical advice.</p>
<p>Chisholm's drive and vision have turned BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is the largest shareholder, into one of the world's most successful pay TV companies over the past seven years.</p>
<p>When Chisholm took the job in 1990, BSkyB was losing 14 million pounds ($23 million) per week. Last year it made a profit of 315 million pounds and is now one of Britain's 20 largest companies.</p>
<p>That success has made Chisholm a very rich man, his salary package topping 3.8 million pounds last year.</p>
<p>A short, stocky figure, the pugnacious Chisholm was dubbed &quot;the most feared man in television&quot; by the Australian press during his 15-year reign as head of the country's Nine Network.</p>
<p>There are few signs that age has mellowed him.</p>
<p>Journalists at news conferences asking what he regards as foolish questions are greeted with a blunt brush-off, accompanied by a withering stare.</p>
<p>He is reputed to deliver stinging rebukes to errant BSkyB executives. He drives his staff hard, telephoning them at all times of the day and night but earning the respect of those who can take the pressure.</p>
<p>Chisholm started out as a salesman for Johnson's floor wax before graduating to the Nine Network, then owned by Kerry Packer, in Melbourne in 1963.</p>
<p>Chisholm, who is married and has a daughter, worked his way up to the post of managing director at Nine in the 1970s. Under his leadership, Nine established a long-running dominance of Australian television.</p>
<p>His fierce commitment to his job was underlined in an interview with Britain's Guardian newspaper last month. He explained how fellow BSkyB executives often join him on holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;Because there is so much unfinished business, because this is a job you have to give your whole life to and it's never out of your mind,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He put his success down to hard work and a meticulous attention to detail.</p>
<p>&quot;The guy who wins in TV is the one who makes the least mistakes,&quot; he told the Guardian.</p>
<p>&quot;...It is basically a business where you have to rely on all the things you have learned from it, and pay extraordinary attention to detail, detail, detail. That makes good television - 99 percent perspiration and one percent inspiration.&quot;</p>
