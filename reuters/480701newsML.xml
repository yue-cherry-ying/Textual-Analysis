<p>French shares opened sharply lower on Tuesday after two days of deep losses on Wall Street, with the CAC-40 blue-chip index starting 2.69 percent lower.</p>
<p>At 0808 GMT, the index was down 75.49 points, or 2.84 percent, lower at 2,581.19 while the April futures contract was 77.50 points lower at 2,580.50.</p>

<p>The French market was closed on Friday and Monday for Easter holidays when the Dow Jones index lost 297 points in two sessions.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a very agitated market. All my phones are ringing constantly,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not too worried,&quot; said another. &quot;We had a range of 2,500 to 2,700 for the market and we are still in that range, be it nearer to the bottom&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Shares in glassmaker Saint-Gobain were down 2.23 percent at 833 francs. Chairman Jean-Louis Beffa said he expected a 1997 increase in net income of at least 20 percent after a four percent increase in 1996 net attributable profit to 520 million francs.</p>
