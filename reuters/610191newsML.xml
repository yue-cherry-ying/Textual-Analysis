<p>Danish share prices closed higher on Friday boosted by rising demand in late trading and positive trends in the rest of Europe, with dealers seeing more moderate gains on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The share market recovered after Thursday's fall and the Dow Jones decline thanks to late advances. We did less well than the rest of Europe but we should see modest gains again early next week,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index closed 0.44 point up at 166.36 while the KFX June future rose 0.50 point to 166.25 with 207 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.</p>
<p>Demand for Tele Danmark rose at the end of the day and the same applied for Novo Nordisk, with the former share closing five crowns up at 330 and the latter putting on a single crown only to end the week at 705.</p>
<p>Moeller paper put in a mixed performance on top of a volatile week with major gains, with the D/S Svendborg share dropping 5,000 crowns to finish at 345,000 and its twin D/S 1912 finishing off at an unchanged 235,000.</p>
<p>Overall turnover for the day was 928 million crowns.</p>
