<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan drafts rules for investments in China.</title>
<headline>Taiwan drafts rules for investments in China.</headline>

<p>Taiwan has drafted a new set of criteria which may be used to regulate the level of local investment in rival China, economics officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The criteria were drafted by a group of scholars and experts at the request of the economics ministry, and we might use them to screen our indirect investment in mainland China in the future,&quot; an Investment Commission spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;But before we use them, we would first seek consensus from government officials, businessmen and lawmakers,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The criteria would help determine if a Taiwanese investment in a Chinese industry, and the possible transfer of necessary technology, would in the long run hurt similar industries in Taiwan, the official said.</p>
<p>The criteria would also set a ceiling on the amount of investment in China, which the official said would affect mostly larger Taiwan firms. He declined to give further details.</p>
<p>Taiwan, which has banned direct contact with China since the end of a civil war that split them in 1949, has been concerned that its economy may become overdependent on China.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 Taiwan firms have invested an estimated US$30 billion in China since an unofficial thaw in bilateral relations begain in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Indirect trade with the mainland has become a major source of trade surplus for Taiwan since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>On Friday, Taiwan's parliament also approved revisions to the Taiwan-mainland relation act to grant a three-month grace period for local firms making unauthorised investment in China, encouraging them to report such activities.</p>
