<headline>S.Africa stocks drift to end after early battering.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG</dateline>

<p>South African shares ended well down after enduring an early battering on the back of Wall Street's second successive heavy fall, dealers said.</p>
<p>The South African drop joined in a global rush of falling shares as major world financial markets followed New York's lead and share prices tumbled.</p>
<p>On Monday heightened concern about the outlook for U.S. interest rates sent New York stocks down for the second straight session. The Dow industrials tumbled 157 points to 6,583. The drop came after a 140 point slide on Thursday.</p>
<p>South Africa's all-share index lost 132.4 points, or 1.87 percent, to 6,962.4 as industrials dropped 164.8 points, or 1.98 percent, to 8,174.6.</p>
<p>Dealers said that there had been little bargain-hunting at lower levels and this explained why share prices had not been able to build up any recovery after the early fall. All market eyes will now be on Wall Street's performance overnight.</p>
<p>U.S. analysts have predicted a short-term rally, but in the longer term see the overall correction going down to around 6,400/500.</p>
<p>South Africa's gold shares initially fared better and offered some stubborn resistance to the market's downward trend. However, a renewed bout of jitters on the bullion price tweaking below $350 an ounce sent them down in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The golds index ended down 9.3 points to 1,292.3.</p>
<p>Trade on the day was marred by an electrical power failure at around 0900 GMT that saw business suspended for about an hour and also crashed the bourse's phone lines and personal computers. However, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange was at pains to point out that its JET equities trading system had not been at fault.</p>
<p>Trading resumed at around 1030 GMT and dealers said the halt had had little effect on the day's trade as most orders had been placed early in the morning.</p>
