<title>USA: Alabama judge accepts Kennedy &quot;Courage&quot; award.</title>
<headline>Alabama judge accepts Kennedy &quot;Courage&quot; award.</headline>

<p>An Alabama judge said he has faced three death threats since he made a controversial order regarding a copy of the Ten Commandments that led to his being named the recipient of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award Thursday.</p>
<p>Circuit Court Judge Charles Price, whose order that a tablet bearing the Ten Commandments must be modified or removed from a courtroom sparked protests, accepted the award from the assassinated president's two children, Caroline Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr.</p>
<p>Price said at a ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston that the award has encouraged him at a time when he has faced widespread criticism in Alabama because of the stand he took on the U.S. Constitution's requirement for the separation of church and state.</p>
<p>&quot;I respect people of faith, for I am one of them,&quot; Price said. &quot;As a judge, however, and as a principled human being, I will do what is legal and right.&quot;</p>
<p>As many as 25,000 protesters including Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed and Alabama Gov. Fob James rallied in Montgomery against Price's decision in early April. Alabama has appealed Price's decision to the state Supreme Court.</p>
<p>He &quot;risked both his present elected office and his future judicial or public service career by this courageous but widely and bitterly criticised action,&quot; Caroline Kennedy said.</p>
<p>Price noted that some past recipients of the award, given annually to an elected official who made a principled decision contrary to popular opinion, have not been re-elected.</p>
<p>Re-elected to his third six-year term in 1996, he said he had no fears of being defeated because of his decision on the Ten Commandments case. &quot;I have no fear of re-election,&quot; he said. &quot;The people of the county, they know me.&quot;</p>
<p>The award, named after President Kennedy's Pulitizer Prize-winning book &quot;Profiles in Courage,&quot; is presented annually on Kennedy's birthday. Past recipients have included Representative Henry Gonzalez of Texas, former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker and former Alabama Representative Carl Elliott.</p>
