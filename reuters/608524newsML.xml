<headline>Sterling steady in light, late European trade.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Sterling was steady in afternoon Europe, but down from earlier highs against the mark and dollar as trading geared down for the UK and U.S. holiday weekend.</p>
<p>Traders said dealing was relatively quiet and position-squaring on the pound's tumble over the last two days took it higher from morning lows.</p>
<p>But with no UK data today and the holiday weekend afoot, technical factors took over.</p>
<p>&quot;It still looked pretty bearish this morning but it held around 2.7420 marks, a significant chart level,&quot; said a German bank dealer. &quot;But the bounce has been held at another chart point around 2.7650.&quot;</p>
<p>By afternoon trade, sterling/mark traded at 2.7547/57, up from early lows of 2.7422 but still shy of late Thursday's 2.7670/80 marks.</p>
<p>Sterling/dollar was also firmer at $1.6286/98, also up from earlier lows but still down from $1.6337/47 Thursday.</p>
<p>Recent concerns in the market that Bank of England Governor Eddie George may not be re-appointed at the end of his five-year</p>
