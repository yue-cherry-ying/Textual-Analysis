<p>Hydro-Quebec said on Thursday it had issued invitations to about 15 telecommunications firms to apply to form a company with the provincially owned electricity utility to manage some of its telecommunications services network.</p>
<p>It said the move was aimed at adding value to the networks, which are used to transmit administrative data and for telephony and were worth about C$175 million.</p>
<p>Hydro-Quebec said the networks accounted for 18 percent of its telecommunications assets but were not used to transmit data essential for the operation of the power grid. It said it planned to keep these latter networks under its control.</p>
<p>Companies interested in a partnership had one month to respond to the request for proposals, it said.</p>
<p>The new company would supply telecommunications services to Hydro-Quebec, its partners and a new group of customers it hoped to develop, specifically wholesalers seeking transmission capacity.</p>
<p>This would allow Hydro-Quebec to cut the investment and operating costs of its existing telecom services network and to share in the profits of the new company. It was also expected to create jobs.</p>
<p>Hydro-Quebec said it had begun discussions with employees and union representatives on terms for lending and transferring staff to the company. It had given itself until the end of the year to reach a deal with its partners and announce the founding of the company.</p>
