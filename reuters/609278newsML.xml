<headline>SEC, Justice Dept probe San Francisco muni banker.</headline>
<dateline>SAN FRANCISCO 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are investigating prominent San Francisco investment banker Calvin Grigsby for &quot;possible improprieties&quot; in the municipal bond business, according to a report filed with the SEC.</p>
<p>In the filing, Grigsby, who is now president of the California investment banking firm Grigsby &amp; Associates, detailed the federal investigations and described how the probes and the subsequent publicity hurt his business.</p>
<p>The Miami Herald newspaper reported last September that the FBI videotaped a meeting in which Grigsby and a Dade County, Florida, commissioner discussed alleged kickbacks in connection with a Dade bond deal.</p>
<p>Several news organizations later reported that the SEC was also investigating Grigsby.</p>
<p>According to the report filed with the SEC by Grigsby's firm and dated December 27, Grigsby is under investigation by the Department of Justice and the SEC for &quot;possible improprieties in obtaining municipal bond financing transactions.&quot;</p>
<p>The SEC filing was first reported by the San Francisco Examiner newspaper on Thursday.</p>
<p>Grigsby said the SEC had obtained a formal investigation order that allows the agency to issue subpoenas and conduct a confidential probe. The report said the SEC had issued subpoenas and obtained records from Grigsby's firm, governmental agencies and other sources.</p>
<p>Grigsby said the Justice Department, in connection with a grand jury, had also issued subpoenas for records.</p>
<p>These investigations prompted the National Association of Securities Dealers to review the company's &quot;business practices,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;The company is unaware that these investigations produced credible evidence of material wrongdoing by it or its employees, and therefore, believes that charges or claims will not be brought against it or its employees arising from these investigation,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Grigsby said publicity from the investigations have had a &quot;material effect&quot; on his company, formerly named Grigsby Brandford &amp; Co Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;Subsequent to September 30, 1996, the company ceased operations at 10 of its 12 national offices with the exception of New York and San Francisco and has reduced its staff substantially,&quot; he said in the filing.</p>
