<p>The unexpected appearance of an outside bidder in the auction of Russia's seventh-largest oil producer has raised the possibility of something long dreamed of in Russia's murky business environment -- a fair fight.</p>
<p>But mounting evidence that two groups controlled by well-connected businessmen are competing for a 51 percent stake in Sibneft has not convinced many analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;It might be the start of real competition in FIGs (Russia's Financial Industrial Groups), but I would doubt it,&quot; said MC Securities director of oil and gas Stephen O'Sullivan. &quot;They are not used to competition.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia's third largest bank by assets, Uneximbank, headed by a former first deputy prime minister, appears to be making a lightning raid on presidential confidant Boris Berezovsky, whose NFK company holds 51 percent of OAO Sibirskaya Neftyanaya Kompaniya (Sibneft).</p>
<p>At high noon on Monday, bidding for the stake will close to investors willing to pay at least $200 million dollars, and NFK company, which is arranging the auction and may have links to larger powers of the land, will rule which bids are fair.</p>
<p>O'Sullivan put the total value of the Sibneft group, which includes a controlling stake in oil producer Noyabrskneftegaz , whose share price has rocketed to $11.00 from about $6.50 at the start of the year, at roughly $500-$600 million.</p>
<p>But Berezovsky's group has not yet submitted a bid in the Sibneft auction, pushing raised eyebrows even higher.</p>
<p>It won the stake to hold in trust in a 1995 shares-for-loans scheme, which gave well-connected Russian investors management rights to major companies in exchange for loans to the faltering federal treasury.</p>
<p>A number of the mortgaged stakes have been auctioned recently. Winners, who paid prices roughly equivalent to the value of the original loan, widely seen as below market value, are believed by analysts to be linked to the mortgage holders.</p>
<p>&quot;This is Russia,&quot; said O'Sullivan. &quot;You haven't seen serious bidding in other auctions, and I wonder why Sibneft would be different... but again, is it a real bid, is there some agreement involved?&quot;</p>
<p>The State Duma lower house of parliament, upset by the loans-for-shares scheme and alleged bargain basement sale of Russia's industrial crown jewels, will discuss the results of privatisation on May 23.</p>
<p>&quot;An enormous amount of material has been collected, basically of a criminal character,&quot; Communist speaker Gennady Seleznyov told reporters.</p>
<p>Berezovsky's company could still disqualify the bid by Uneximbank (Oneksimbank in Russian), headed by Vladimir Potanin.</p>
<p>Bidders were required to deposit funds with Berezovsky's allied bank and are also required to have a 13 percent stake in a virtually untraded oil company unit, a restriction Uneximbank says it can get around.</p>
<p>&quot;If you read the rules carefully, the conditions are either to have the stake or pay (Sibneft) money for it,&quot; Uneximbank spokesman Modest Kolerov told Reuters. &quot;We expect it all to be worked out after the tender, if we win it.&quot;</p>
<p>A Sibneft spokesman said the bank's bid would be well over the starting price, which would be a surprise in itself.</p>
<p>Last minute disqualifications are not unknown, as Uneximbank knows. The bank organised and won loans-for-shares auctions for stakes in oil company SIDANKO and metals group Norilsk Nickel.</p>
<p>It disqualified a rival in both 1995 tenders.</p>
<p>But Berezovsky's reluctance to bid in the Sibneft auction may be strategy -- no disqualification will be necessary if there are not enough bidders for the auction to take place.</p>
<p>For an auction to be validated under Russian law, there must be two qualifying bids -- a failed auction would leave the oil company with its present holder.</p>
