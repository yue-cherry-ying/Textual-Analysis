<p>European high sulphur fuel prices drifted lower on Friday in thin business while low sulphur was steady to weaker with supplies limited in the prompt period, traders said.</p>
<p>Poor bunker demand and aggressive selling by one refiner in Rotterdam pushed high sulphur barge prices down $1 to sit at $80/$81 fob a tonne, the bottom end of the last two months' range.</p>
<p>Solid flows of Russian cracked fuel from St. Petersburg have begun to weigh on the ARA barge market, traders said, while refinery run cuts were unlikely to ease the pressure of over-supply for some time.</p>
<p>A cargo of M-100 with a high 1.3 percent water content was heard sold to a trader for $79.50 cif on Friday. Up to seven other M-100 cracked cargoes were due in the ARA region by the middle of next week, while one vessel was already prompt and being reoffered because off-grade, dealers said.</p>
<p>Low sulphur was supported on Thursday by one bid in the market at $97 fob a tonne from a trader but there was no prompt supply available to meet it. Next cargo seen was first decade June.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very easy to bid high when you know the cargo is not there but I think the bidder would actually buy at that number if the material was there,&quot; said one supplier.</p>
<p>Traders disagreed over whether the $97 number was intended to push up quotes or in line with reality. June swaps were no higher than $96.25/$96.75 and the recently low sulphur physical has lagged behind paper and shown no signs of outstripping it.</p>
<p>The $97 bid went away later on Friday another potential buyer was heard looking for top-up material to take to the United States.</p>
