<p>The House Thursday passed a bill that would allow juveniles as young as 13 to be tried as adults for violent crimes and drug offences over the objections of the Clinton White House.</p>
<p>The bill, approved 286-132, would only apply to federal crimes, which account for a small percentage of overall offences. But supporters said it was needed to encourage states to also try violent juveniles as adults.</p>
<p>&quot;In America today no population poses a greater threat to public safety than juvenile criminals,&quot; said Representative Gerald Solomon, a New York Republican. &quot;Teen-agers account for the largest portion of all violent crime in America. Older teenagers -- ages 17-19 -- are the most violent of all age groups.&quot;</p>
<p>The bill was written mainly by majority Republicans, who have made it one of their top legislative priorities.</p>
<p>The White House said President Clinton's proposed juvenile crime bill was better because it combined enforcement and prosecution with prevention and intervention programmes.</p>
<p>&quot;H.R. 3 (the Republican bill) is neither comprehensive nor balanced. Therefore, the administration opposes House passage of H.R. 3,&quot; the White House said in a statement.</p>
<p>The bill authorises $1.5 billion over three years to help states fight juvenile crime.</p>
<p>But the White House said the bill should include a requirement that firearms dealers provide a child-safety lock with every gun that was sold. It also wanted funding targeted to hire prosecutors to focus on gang-related crimes and greater flexibility for prosecutors in trying juveniles as adults.</p>
<p>A similar bill is pending in the Senate. Attorney General Janet Reno said she would work with members of both chambers to improve the final version.</p>
<p>&quot;And we look forward to working with the House and Senate as this bill goes on through both houses, goes to conference to come up with the best strategy possible, and to make sure that it is fully and effectively funded,&quot; Reno said at her weekly news conference.</p>
