<headline>Russian Duma to mull oil production sharing in April.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>Russia's Natural Resources Minister said on Tuesday the State Duma lower house of parliament would probably consider a new draft list of oil and other reserves open for production-sharing agreements in two to three weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;I think a motion will be introduced on to the Duma floor most likely somewhere in the second half of April, around April 15-20,&quot; Viktor Orlov told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said a Duma working committee would meet this Thursday to agree the criteria for including reserves on the list and then take about a week to compile the list itself.</p>
<p>Communist and nationalist opposition parties in the Duma have delayed approving the list, which is crucial to the implementation of an existing law on production-sharing, along with several other amendments.</p>
<p>Last month the Duma blocked a scheduled vote on the list, which Orlov said now comprises 49 reserves out of an original 127 chosen by the government last year.</p>
<p>The Duma is expected to halve that number, fuelling fears among potential foreign investors that reserves not on the list will require separate approval from parliament.</p>
<p>But Orlov said that reserves which are not included in the final list might be eligible for inclusion on a rolling basis in subsequent lists.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has proposed a list of 49 possible agreements, but at the same time it confirms all 127, calling them 'prospects' for inclusion in future lists,&quot; Orlov said.</p>
<p>Foreign investors will not have the right to sign production-sharing agreements involving reserves which have not been included on the list, he added.</p>
