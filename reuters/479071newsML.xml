<p>The U.N. World Food Programme planned to double its appeal for aid to North Korea after recent inspections found the potential for starvation &quot;on a massive scale,&quot; one programme official said on Tuesday,</p>
<p>&quot;As a result of our trip, we have decided to double our appeal to 200,000 metric tons of food and to increase our caseload to include all children under six in the country,&quot; Michael Ross, a member of the program's inspection team, said.</p>
<p>In visits to Pyongyang and three southern agricultural counties on March 15-18, inspectors found signs that even the most marginal mechanisms to deal with two consecutive years of crop-killing floods were breaking down. Children were malnourished and many were stunted while the populace in general was living on rations of 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of rice per day, or about one bowlful.</p>
<p>People survived on this rice, plus stores of dried vegetable leaves, ground corncobs and ground sweet potato stalks, Ross said. Small irregular farm markets had formerly provided some food but most have closed as surpluses have dwindled.</p>
<p>In Rinsan, Pyongsan and Unpa counties, which Ross called North Korea's southern &quot;breadbasket,&quot; he said, &quot;It hasn't reached the point where people are starving to death.&quot; But if government rice rations end as expected this month, &quot;given the extremely poor condition of the population at large you're going to see starvation ... quite rapidly on a massive scale.&quot;</p>
<p>Ross could not confirm a report that thousands may have died of starvation in northern sections of the country because his program's inspectors have not been granted access there. &quot;There's a growing body of evidence to suggest that things in the north may be far worse than in the south,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said one sign of this was a report that northern hospitals were filling with people complaining of stomach pains and internal bleeding, apparently caused by ingesting tree bark. &quot;What they're doing is stripping bark from trees, boiling it and eating it and tearing up their guts.&quot;</p>
<p>The Pyongyang government has recently given approval for an inspection of the north, Ross said, adding that a World Food Programme team hoped to make the trip in a week or two.</p>
<p>The program's appeal for 200,000 metric tons of food aid is still far below the 2.3 million metric tons that may actually be required, Ross said.</p>
<p>&quot;The North Koreans tell us that they can probably scrape together about 1 million tons ... (But) they're still going to be well over 1 million tons short of food this year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In Seoul, South Korea's Red Cross said it will send more than $1 million worth of food and vegetable seed to North Korea on Thursday, the second aid shipment in a week.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns applauded this move, calling it &quot;an important humanitarian step, which we hope will contribute to redress some of the very urgent and clear food problems in North Korea itself.&quot;</p>
<p>South Korea has made several goodwill gestures recently in an apparent bid to lure the North to proposed peace talks among the two Koreas, China and the United States.</p>
<p>The talks, jointly proposed by President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young-sam last April, are aimed at securing a peace treaty to replace a truce that ended the 1950-53 Korean War and left the two Koreas technically at war.</p>
<p>Seoul has ruled out large-scale food aid until Pyongyang agrees to the talks; both Seoul and Washington have said substantial food aid cannot be a precondition for the four-way talks, but that the subject could come up at the peace table.</p>
<p>Ross said he was aware of the &quot;political realities&quot; of the situation in North Korea: &quot;I've never seen a more highly politicized human disaster than this one.&quot;</p>
