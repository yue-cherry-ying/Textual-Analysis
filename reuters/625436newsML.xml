<title>USA: Neil Young cuts finger, postpones Europe tour.</title>
<headline>Neil Young cuts finger, postpones Europe tour.</headline>

<p>Folk rocker Neil Young pulled out of a European tour on Friday after cutting his finger, the second rock icon this week to cancel appearances in Europe.</p>
<p>The Canadian-born Young, 51, was forced to pull out of the tour after cutting his left index finger slicing a ham sandwich a few days ago, his publicist Bob Merlis said.</p>
<p>Legendary singer-songwriter Bob Dylan called off a European tour this week because of an infection that a source close to his family said produced swelling around his heart.</p>
<p>Young's doctor ordered him to put his guitar aside so the cut can heal properly, Merlis, of Reprise Records, said.</p>
<p>Young and his band, Crazy Horse, were set to start a 16-country tour on June 9. Merlis said Young was expected to heal in time for the North American H.O.R.D.E tour, which starts in mid-July.</p>
<p>&quot;He should be able to make that as long as he follows doctor's orders,&quot; Merlis said. Organizers hope to reschedule the European tour in the fall.</p>
