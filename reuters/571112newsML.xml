<p>Indonesia recently bought a Handy-sized cargo of optional origin soymeal from South America and is said to be looking for at least 50,000 tonnes more of meal, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe they bought one cargo of meal for June shipment,&quot; a dealer for a commodity house in Singapore said.</p>
<p>&quot;The deal makes sense,&quot; a trader for U.S. commodity firm said. &quot;Easily, the Indonesians should be looking to pick up 50,000 tonnes more of meal. They need to fill up those positions.&quot;  </p>
<p>The price paid by the Indonesian buyer was not immediately available, dealers said.</p>
<p>But South American meal was being quoted by the trade at a US$30-$50 discount to U.S. meal, which was quoted in Southeast Asia between $383-$385 a tonne C&amp;F for June/July shipment.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody is looking at U.S. meal. We're going to ship South American meal,&quot; a dealer said. High protein meal from the U.S. was being quoted by regional dealers as high as $400 a tonne C&amp;F for June/July shipment.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Indonesians are looking for meal at around $315 to $320 (a tonne). They should be going for at least two more cargoes,&quot; a dealer with a European trading house said.</p>
<p>Other buyers around the region were said to be looking to fill up open positions for soymeal and soybeans, but are discouraged by the current high futures prices in Chicago.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is looking for cargo, but they're waiting for prices to come off. It's just waiting, waiting and waiting,&quot; a trader added.  </p>
<p>The spot May contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) hit a contract high on Wednesday of $303 a ton against the previous high of $300 a ton on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the grains market, the region was quiet with the trade waiting for word on whether buyers in the Philippines would complete negotiations to buy 75,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat.</p>
<p>&quot;One group is looking for 35,000 tonnes while another group is close to clinching a deal for 40,000 tonnes. They see wheat prices going up so they want to lock in their prices now,&quot; one trader in Manila said.  </p>
<p>The corn market was quiet with the Malaysians having put on extensive coverage while the Thais sat it out.</p>
<p>Moslem holidays in Malaysia and Indonesia will probably keep the trade quiet over the next day or two.</p>
<p>&quot;It should be quiet for now,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Malaysians are pretty comfortable at the moment with the stocks they have. Nobody wants to do anything today and I don't think that will change,&quot; another trader said.</p>
