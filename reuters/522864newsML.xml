<p>India's caretaker Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral appears to be the likely choice to lead the United Front coalition and a new centre-left government, the Press Trust of India said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The news agency said there were &quot;indications that the External Affairs Minister, Mr I.K. Gujral, was the likely choice&quot; to succeed caretaker Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda at the head of the 15-party alliance.  </p>
<p>United Front leaders were meeting in the capital to select a new leader. An announcement was expected at about 1500 GMT.</p>
<p>Gujral was waiting in a nearby guest house where he was summoned earlier in the day by Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu, who has spearheaded the search for a new leader, alliance officials said.</p>
<p>Farooq Abdullah, chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir state, told reporters as he entered the United Front meeting that there would be no deputy prime minister, the Press Trust of India said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, there were reports that caretaker Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav would be named deputy prime minister.</p>
