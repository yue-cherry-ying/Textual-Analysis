<p>Three teenagers bled to death from &quot;inhuman&quot; torture after being arrested in 1978 for the attempted murder of a government official, an Ethiopian court heard on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A prosecution witness told the court in the capital Addis Ababa that 35 people were arrested suspected of attempting to murder Captain Legesse Asfaw, a top official in the Marxist &quot;Dergue&quot; regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam, who was ousted from power in May 1991.</p>
<p>The witness was one of those detained by Mengistu's revolutionary guards and was released in 1983 after languishing in prison for nearly five years.</p>
<p>&quot;All of us were subjected to inhuman and severe torture at the interrogation centre,&quot; the witness said.</p>
<p>&quot;Three of the suspects, who were in their teens, died of bleeding after the torture -- one was sleeping near me and died as I was trying to dress his wounds ...&quot; said the witness, aged 65 and a former teacher, who cannot be identified under court orders.</p>
<p>He was testifying at the trial of 71 former Dergue officials accused of genocide and crimes against humanity. They face the death penalty if found guilty.</p>
<p>Twenty-five of the accused, including Mengistu who is exiled in Zimbabwe, are being tried in absentia.</p>
<p>The witness said he lived in Disrict 24 of Addis Ababa and was a friend and neighbour of Legesse's family.</p>
<p>He said he was jailed because Legesse's mother told her son the witness was plotting with other members of an opposition Marxist group to kill Legesse.</p>
<p>The Ethiopian government has charged a total of 5,198 with war crimes, aggravated homicide and genocide. Of these, 1,200 are suspected of involvement in Mengistu's 1970s &quot;Red Terror&quot; against opponents.</p>
<p>The trial was adjourned until Thursday.</p>
