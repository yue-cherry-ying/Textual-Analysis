<p>World number one Pete Sampras faces a tricky first round at the French tennis Open next week against local hero Fabrice Santoro, one of the most successful players on clay this season.</p>
<p>The American, hoping to win the only Grand Slam event still to elude him, had by far the worst draw of all the men's seeds on Friday.</p>
<p>A semifinalist here last year, Sampras has failed to win a match on clay this season. He had to pull out of the World team Cup in Duesseldorf this week with a strained thigh.</p>
<p>Against Santoro, Sampras, whose only big tournament win on clay came in Rome in 1994, will face a tough test. The Frenchman has played his best tennis ever this season on the surface with wins over two former Roland Garros champions, Thomas Muster and Sergi Bruguera, in Monte Carlo and over Chile's Marcelo Rios in Prague.</p>
<p>If Sampras should beat the 24-year-old Santoro he could then face another difficult obstacle in Spaniard Francisco Clavet, a losing finalist in Estoril this season.</p>
<p>World number two Michael Chang has what should be an easier start, against a qualifier in the first round, but could run into Bruguera in the round of 16.</p>
<p>Reigning champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia also looks reasonably safe in a part of the draw where Briton Tim Henman, Australian Mark Philippoussis and Frenchman Cedric Pioline look the most serious threats. The Russian meets Czech Martin Damm in the first round.</p>
<p>Another seed pulled out of the tournament on Friday, following American Todd Martin and Germany's Boris Becker. Sweden's Thomas Enqvist, ranked ninth in the world, withdrew with an unspecified injury.</p>
<p>Two intriguing first-round ties pit Spain's Alberto Berasategui, losing finalist here in 1994, against Ukraine's Andrei Medvedev and American Jim Courier, winner in 1991 and 1992, against Sweden's Magnus Larsson.</p>
<p>If he wins, Courier could meet seeded Spaniard Felix Mantilla in the second round.</p>
<p>Despite a tricky first-round tie against Morocco's Karim Halami, eighth-seeded Spaniard Alex Corretja, the winner in Estoril and Rome this year, has had the luck of the draw with six qualifiers in his section.</p>
<p>In the women's draw world number one Martina Hingis of Switzerland could meet Russian hopeful Anna Kournikova as early as the third round.</p>
<p>Former number one Monica Seles of the U.S. could also clash early on with compatriot Venus Williams, another promising teenager.</p>
