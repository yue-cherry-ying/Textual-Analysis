<p>ICI Australia said on Thursday it was aiming to sell the 62.4-percent stake held by its parent Imperial Chemical Industries Plc some time in July.  </p>
<p>Asked if the company would be looking to sell the shares in more than one tranche, ICI Australia managing director Warren Haynes said: &quot;Clearly, we would like to do it (the sale) in one tranche, but it depends on market condtions -- that could result in all of them (shares) going in the July offering.&quot;</p>
<p>Haynes said ICI Australia was looking at a partial share buyback as one of its options.  </p>
<p>Haynes said the break with ICI meant that ICI Australia was likely to introduce new products into Australia and also move into some Asian business areas which had previously been seen as the domain of the parent company.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking for instance at some of our chlorine products into Asia and we are doing a survey in Vietnam and Indonesia,&quot; Haynes said.</p>
<p>ICI Australia already markets explosive and adhesive products in Asia. &quot;This will give us the opportunity to take more business into Asia and perhaps establish our own network there,&quot; Haynes said.  </p>
<p>At 12.15 p.m (0215 GMT), ICI Australia shares were A$1.164 weaker at A$11.28 on turnover of 227,693 shares.</p>
