<headline>NY precious metals end mixed, silver perks up.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>New York precious metals ended mixed on Friday, with only silver settling higher after an early upside breakout from its recent tight ranges.</p>
<p>Dealings ended about an hour early ahead of Memorial Day weekend with the markets shut Monday when London metals markets will also be closed due to a U.K. public holiday.</p>
<p>COMEX silver was boosted by funds who moved into the market early, at the same time to trigger buy stops and prompt a run up, dealers said.</p>
<p>July silver settled 6.0 cents firmer at $4.738 an ounce, traded $4.78 to $4.65.  </p>
<p>&quot;It was more like a raid on the petty cash tin. It's not a trend,&quot; a bullion trader said. Volume in silver was thin.</p>
<p>Others believed there was some divestment from the platinum group metals and into gold and silver because the white metals looked tired and overbought.</p>
<p>COMEX gold was initially boosted by the strength in silver, but was unable to cling to its early modest advance and ended lower, down 10 cents in the June contract at $344.40 an ounce, traded $344.30 to $341.80.</p>
<p>Mid-afternoon bullion was quoted at $342.35/$342.85.</p>
<p>COMEX gold and silver volume was estimated at 25,000 and 10,000 lots respectively.</p>
<p>Palladium opened limit down $6.00 and was able to pare much of the losses by mid-session, but then weakened again to end $4.65 lower at $170.70 an ounce in the June NYMEX contract. June was traded $169.35 to $173.00.</p>
<p>Platinum also opened sharply weaker, but successfully pared most of the losses by close to end 60 cents weaker at $388.40 an ounce in the July NYMEX contract, traded $389.00 to $384.00.</p>
<p>&quot;People are speculating that the Russians will deliver metal soon,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Russian officials said 1997 exports of platinum group metals would resume imminently and volumes for the year would be in line with 1996 levels despite the late start to shipments.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the cost of borrowing platinum, or lease rates, have not come down since a sharp hike Thursday, an indication of continued tightness in physical supply, dealers said.</p>
<p>Palladium lease rates also remain high.</p>
<p>The weaker yen was also said to have dampened white metal prices as much of global purchases are in the Japanese currency.</p>
