<text>
<p>CHATSWORTH, Calif., April 1 - Dycam Inc Tuesday said its ability to continue as a going concern may be in doubt if it is unable to raise additional funds.</p>
<p>In a statement, the company said it has also been advised by the American Stock Exchange that it has fallen below listing guidelines and it may be delisted.</p>
<p>Earlier, Dycam reported a loss for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 1996, of $594,000, or $0.19 a share, compared with a loss of $245,000, or $0.08 a share, a year ago. Revenues fell 25 percent to $372,000.  </p>
<p>During the fourth quarter of 1996, Dycam discontinued sales of several older product lines and approximately $155,000 was allocated for excess and obsolete inventory.</p>
<p>For the full year, Dycam lost $1.3 million, or $0.42 a share, versus a loss of $1.4 million, or $0.43 a share a year ago. Revenues for the year rose to $2.5 million from $1.7 million. The company said attributed the losses to higher amortization of leased camera assets, lower margins on standard product sales, continuing investment in research and development, selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of goodwill.  </p>
<p>Additionally, inventory write-downs and reserves of approximately $171,000 were taken during 1996 for discontinued camera products.</p>
<p>The company believes its existing cash balances, the payments due under an intercompany loan, payments of the accrued license fees and receivables from the sale of &quot;Forever Yours&quot; and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through September 1997, after which time it may be required to raise additional capital.  </p>
<p>The ability of the company to raise additional funds and ultimately achieve positive operating cash flow is uncertain, and, therefore, this raises doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;Although Dycam has established capabilities in the design of digital cameras and related systems and in integrating digital photography with specialized software to create imaging solutions, the sales and deployment cycles for custom digital camera products have taken longer than expected,&quot; Dycam President and Chief Executive Officer John Edling said.</p>
<p>&quot;Additionally, many new general-purpose digital camera products were released to the market in 1996, and while Dycam's unit sales of such products increased substantially in 1996, increased competition has reduced margins.</p>
<p>Dycam designs and develops digital camera and associated hardware and software products primarily for use with personal computers.</p>
