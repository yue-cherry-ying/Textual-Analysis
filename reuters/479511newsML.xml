<p>Sri Lanka stocks were stable at the close on Tuesday with investors focusing on a wide range of shares of companies expected to benefit from low cost of borrowings, brokers said.</p>
<p>The all share index closed 0.86 points higher at 638.40 with price gains and declines running neck and neck, they said. Ceylon Glass Co rose one rupee to 23, Hayleys three to 210. Tokyo Cement fell 1.25 rupees to 56.75.</p>
<p>&quot;It is good to buy before corporate results for the quarter ended March 31 start flowing out in about five weeks time,&quot; said Derendra Abayaratna, fund manager of Century Growth Fund.  </p>
<p>Corporate results in the first three months of this year should be an improvement over 1996 year ending figures, which have served to take the market to current levels, he said.</p>
<p>Turnover was 49.5 million rupees on turnover of 1.4 million shares.</p>
<p>&quot;If not for a lack of sellers, turnovers will be far higher, because investors are focusing on a wider range of shares after the recent reserve ratio cut,&quot; said a broker at John Keells.</p>
<p>The Central Bank last week cut the reserve ratio by two percentage points to 12, on top of a one percentage point cut in January, in a bid to improve market liquidity and keep cost of corporate borrowings low.</p>
