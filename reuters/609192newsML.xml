<headline>ISDN to help make up traditional revenue fall - NTT.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp said on Friday that it expects revenues from its traditional phone business to fall this business year, but added that the decline would be partially offset by higher revenues from its ISDN digital phone service.  </p>
<p>NTT president Junichiro Miyazu told a news conference that the company expects its ISDN revenues to increase to 341 billion yen in the year to March 31, 1998, up 114 billion yen from last year.</p>
<p>Despite higher access-charge income and increased traffic, NTT's revenues from its traditional analog telephone business dropped by 18.1 billion yen in 1996/97 because of rate cuts and intensified competition, he said.</p>
<p>Miyazu added that NTT expects this revenue to fall by a further 36.5 billion yen in the current business year.</p>
<p>He also said that NTT plans 100 billion yen of capital investment in overseas projects this business year.  </p>
<p>Miyazu said NTT plans to study details of its restructuring plan for about a year after the bill on the restructuring is passed by parliament next month.</p>
<p>He also said that the firm wants to send executives to work at its units as part of a strategy to strengthen group-based management.</p>
<p>NTT announced earlier on Friday that it had sent one of its executive vice presidents to work as a vice president at its mobile phone unit NTT DoCoMo.</p>
