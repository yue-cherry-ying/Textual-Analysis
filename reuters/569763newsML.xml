<p>Halliburton Energy Services said it purchased a 26 percent ownership interest in Petroleum Engineering Services for undisclosed terms.</p>
<p>The Halliburton Co subsidiary said this development is a further strengthening of the alliance between the two organizations announced last September for the development and delivery of intelligent well completion systems.  Sometimes called &quot;smartwells,&quot; these new completion systems can help oil and gas companies reduce operating expenditures and enhance hydrocarbon recovery through improved reservoir management, it said.  </p>
<p>Headquartered in Aberdeen, Scotland, Petroleum Engineering Services is a leading provider of specialist well completions and intervention products, services and solutions.</p>
<p>&quot;This investment is a major step forward for the PES group,&quot; said Petroleum Engineering Chairman Larry Kinch. &quot;It will provide the financial platform and access to the global infrastructure we need to expand our business worldwide.&quot;</p>
<p>Halliburton Energy Services President Zeke Zeringue said this investment &quot;helps assure alignment with PES in our cooperative effort to continue to bring leading-edge technologies to the emerging intelligent well market. We believe that smartwell technology will revolutionize well completions in the industry.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Baker Hughes Inc and Schlumberger Ltd said they had agreed on marketing of the initial phase of Intelligent Completions Systems, which will integrate pressure, temperature and flow sensors with downhole flow control devices, enabling oil companies to remotely reconfigure their well completions without the need for costly interventions or workovers.</p>
<p>This is one of the alliances outlined in an agreement Schlumberger and Baker Hughes announced in September 1996.</p>
