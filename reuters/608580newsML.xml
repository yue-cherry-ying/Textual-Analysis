<title>UK: IPE Brent pares losses in quiet pre-holiday market.</title>
<headline>IPE Brent pares losses in quiet pre-holiday market.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Brent pared earlier losses on Friday as gains in NYMEX crude futures gave the market some support, but traders said there was very little going on in the pit ahead of a long weekend in Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>July Brent was trading three cents lower at $20.15 a barrel at 1501 GMT, having traded as low as $20. June gas oil was $1.50 off at $177.50 a tonne.</p>
<p>Traders said moderate gains in NYMEX crude and gasoline futures had helped IPE Brent off its earlier lows, but added the market was fairly inactive.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of shouting but not too much going on,&quot; said one trader. &quot;There's hardly any paper out there.&quot;</p>
<p>The trader said open interest decreased by 10,000 lots on Thursday, giving him the impression that a lot of players had already squared positions ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p>The IPE and NYMEX will be closed on Monday due to Britain's Spring Bank holiday and the United States' Memorial Day holiday.</p>
<p>Despite the dearth of paper and pre-holiday atmosphere, traders said there was still room for price swings in the final hours of trading.</p>
<p>Traders said the expiry of June products options on NYMEX could stir the market up later on.</p>
