<headline>Turkey says wants more trade with Iraq.</headline>

<p>Turkish State Minister Ahmet Cemil Tunc said his government had made efforts to end the mandate of a U.S.-led air force patrolling northern Iraq and wanted to increase trade with Baghdad to $4-5 billion a year.</p>
<p>&quot;Probably it is not necessary to remind here of the efforts by the (Turkish) government to end the mandate of the (allied) forces in Turkey,&quot; Tunc said at the start of talks with Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rasheed.</p>
<p>Baghdad has been urging Ankara to end the mandate of the U.S. and British force which polices a no-fly zone in northern Iraq to guard Kurds against possible attacks by Iraqi armed forces.</p>
<p>Turkey's Islamist-led government made only cosmetic alterations, such as a name change, to the south Turkey-based force last year despite Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's election pledges that his party would scrap it after coming to power.</p>
<p>The Turkish parliament has renewed the mandate of the force.</p>
<p>Tunc also said his country was ... &quot;seeking to improve trade with Iraq to reach four to five billion dollars per year.&quot;</p>
<p>He did not give the present figure.</p>
<p>The minister said Iraq's oil-for-food deal with the United Nations was a ... &quot;means to improve trade between Iraq and Turkey but it was not enough&quot;.</p>
<p>The deal, which went into effect on December 10, allows Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to buy urgent needs of Iraqis, suffering from stringent trade sanctions imposed after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Turkey has a contract to lift 75,000 barrels per day of Iraqi crude. Ankara is also selling to Iraq under the pact, pulses and vegetable oil.</p>
<p>Tunc said his government was also increasing cross-border trade with Baghdad. Hundreds of Turkish trucks currently cross into Iraq every day carrying vegetables, fruits and processed food.</p>
<p>&quot;Concerning cross-border trade, there are serious steps to improve that,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said he would discuss several projects with Iraqi officials including a railway line between the two countries.</p>
<p>The Turkish minister arrived in Baghdad on Monday on the invitation of Rasheed, who was in Ankara in December.</p>
