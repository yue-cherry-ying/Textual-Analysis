<p>Eight children plunged to their death on Saturday when a basket snapped from a crane during an exhibition of firefighting techniques in the Baltic state of Latvia, the interior ministry said.</p>
<p>At least 21 other people were injured, seven seriously, in the accident in the small town of Talsi, 100 km (60 miles) northwest of the capital Riga, a ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Criminal negligence was involved and we will launch a criminal investigation...the people in charge let over 20 people climb into the basket, which was far too many,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He added that the government planned to hold an extraordinary session on Sunday morning to examine the circumstances surrounding the accident in which the basket fell 20 metres (65 feet) as a crowd of around 1,000 watched in horror.</p>
<p>Much of the firefighting and rescue service equipment in the states of the former Soviet Union is old and worn out and cash-strapped local governments lack the funds to buy replacements.</p>
