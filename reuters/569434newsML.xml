<title>SINGAPORE: Asia Product Swaps - Fuel oil up on possible demand.</title>
<headline>Asia Product Swaps - Fuel oil up on possible demand.</headline>

<p>Singapore fuel oil swaps rose late afternoon on Thursday on expectations of fresh buying interest in the local physical market within the next few days, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are buying the market up because they think there's going to be a new round of physical purchases soon,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Fuel oil swaps were steady with May last quoted at $101.25/$102.00 per tonne, up from Wednesday's $100.00/$101.00, brokers said.</p>
<p>May traded earlier in the day at $101.00, they said.</p>
<p>Traders said the rise in prices was partly based on the perception by some that the market would be bidded up in the coming days to coincide with the arrival of a large cargo from the Gulf.</p>
<p>Others said that the reduced export program from the Middle East to Singapore will also add to the bullish sentiment.</p>
<p>Most Middle East exports have scaled back their exports to Singapore in May/June due to high domestic demand.</p>
<p>Traders said that regional supplies were also tight due to the scheduled shutdown of several crude units in South Korea and Japan during the May/June period.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no barrels available from South Korea for May lifting,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Gas oil swaps extended its early day listless trading as prices drifted sideways.</p>
<p>May gas oil swaps were last quoted $25.30/$25.40 per barrel, largely unchanged from Wednesday, brokers said.</p>
<p>June was also steady at $24.90/$25.00. June traded earlier in the day at $24.85, they said.</p>
<p>The May/June spread is narrowing in line with the flat physical market with the backwardation now valued at about 45 cents with 50 cents traded on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The jet fuel/gas oil spread or regrade edged down on market expectations of sustained selling from refiners in the face of weak enduser demand.</p>
<p>June regrade was last quoted at 40/50 cents down from Tuesday's 50/60 cents, brokers said.</p>
