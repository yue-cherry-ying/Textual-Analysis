<p>The U.S. long bond inched lower in London on Tuesday but the short end of the curve was resilient as the market sized up the chances of further gyrations when Wall Street comes in, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;This week's a big week,&quot; said Graham McDevitt, head of bond research at Paribas Capital Markets in London. &quot;NAPM and nonfarm payrolls will pretty much set the tone for the economy for the next few weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>McDevitt said the key was the short end, where yields have risen some 60 basis points over the past several weeks but now have a bid tone amid a flight down the curve.</p>
<p>&quot;With stocks the way they are it's going to be quite an uncertain week,&quot; said a broker at a French bank in London.</p>
<p>U.S. equities tumbled for two consecutive sessions as the long bond yield pushed above seven percent and the market took fright at the possibility of more U.S. interest rate rises.</p>
<p>The long bond at 1030 GMT was at 94-03,04 to yield 7.10 percent, versus 94-06 bid in Tokyo and 94-04 in New York.</p>
<p>A trader at a Japanese bank in London added that bills were looking expensive after the short end recently rallied.</p>
<p>Two-year paper held onto Tokyo gains, trading at 99-22,23 for a 6.42 percent yield. It finished in New York at 99-21,22 on Monday.</p>
<p>The National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) report for March is due at 1500 GMT and is forecast to show a slight increase to 53.6 from 53.1.</p>
<p>&quot;Going forward if the Dow Jones takes another hit today, there should be a bit more of a bid to the short end,&quot; McDevitt said, adding that highlighted the prospect for curve steepening.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 157 points on Monday after a 140-point decline on Thursday.</p>
