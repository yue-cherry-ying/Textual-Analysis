<headline>BASEBALL-STEINBRENNER FACES SANCTIONS OVER ADIDAS LAWSUIT.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner could be facing his third suspension from Major League Baseball for filing a lawsuit over objections to his team's $95 million marketing deal with adidas.</p>
<p>&quot;This time George has really gone too far,&quot; an unidentified high-ranking baseball official told the New York Daily News. &quot;He's going to get himself suspended again.</p>
<p>&quot;By suing baseball and defying both the major league and agency (marketing) agreements, he's made himself a pariah within baseball.&quot;</p>
<p>Taking a page from Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, who enraged NFL officials and fellow owners by cutting his own multi-million dollar marketing deals against league policy, the Yankees and the adidas sports apparel company announced a 10-year agreement on March 4.</p>
<p>The deal with adidas drew immediate protest from other owners on the grounds that it undermined baseball's ability to sign marketing deals on a national basis.</p>
<p>Claiming that his fellow owners conspired to prevent him from implementing the lucrative deal, Steinbrenner and adidas filed a lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Tampa, challenging baseball's antitrust exemption, even though teams and owners, as part of the Major League Agreement, are prohibited from suing the commissioner's office.</p>
<p>Thursday's newspaper account said acting commissioner and Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig was &quot;outraged&quot; over the lawsuit, which seeks an injunction against baseball and triple damages as determined by a jury.</p>
<p>Steinbrenner is currently a member of the 10-member Executive Council that has ruled Major League Baseball since owners forced out the last real commissioner, Fay Vincent.</p>
<p>At the very least, Steinbrenner is likely to be thrown off the Executive Council as a result of his legal challenge.</p>
<p>The council is scheduled to meet Tuesday in Chicago, at which time Steinbrenner's status and the lawsuit will be discussed.</p>
<p>The Executive Council has ordered the Yankees to stop selling T-shirts with adidas logos and to stop the Yankees ground crews from wearing adidas logos on their work uniforms.</p>
<p>Baseball's Agency Agreement stipulates that baseball and its properties division are the exclusive brokers for all marketing deals involving uniforms, caps and such merchandise, and that the clubs would share equally in the proceeds.</p>
<p>The suit charges fellow owners of &quot;collaborating in a merchandizing cartel that favours the weak teams.&quot;</p>
<p>Russell Athletic Corp. currently has the rights to manufacture all major league uniforms. However, the value of Russell's deal would be diminished without the Yankees, one of the most recognisable teams in all of sports.</p>
<p>Steinbrenner has had several run-ins with baseball brass over the years and has twice been banned -- once in 1974 for making illegal campaign contributions for President Richard Nixon and again in 1990 for his involvement with a known gambler.</p>
