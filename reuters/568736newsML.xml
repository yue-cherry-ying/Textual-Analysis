<p>He said all the bills were taken up at a 22.44 percent yield, up from 20.99 percent at the last auction on Tuesday, adding that other rates were also being quoted firmer in sympathy, though there was not much active traded.</p>
<p>Discount houses were indicating to sell treasury bills at 22 percent on the secondary market from Wednesday's 20.5 percent, while call money edged up two percentage points to 20 percent.</p>
<p>NCD bills redeemable after 30, 60 and 90 days were being bought at 23 percent from 22 and sold firmer at 22.5 percent compared to 21.5 percent.</p>
<p>Bankers acceptances were at 22.25 and 22 percent (buying and selling respectively) from 20.75 and 20.25 percent, in a market which opened with a slight surplus of Z$34.9 million from a previous Z$32.7 million shortage.</p>
