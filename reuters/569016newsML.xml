<p>Ghana is feeling the pinch of a diesel shortage which entered its 10th day on Wednesday, mining and port officials say.</p>
<p>Gold mining companies, a key economic sector, say the shortage has affected production, albeit not greatly.</p>
<p>Stevedore companies say transport of goods to and from the main port of Tema had slowed with trucks queuing for hours for fuel.</p>
<p>Public transport has been seriously disrupted. Residents say food prices are rising in remote parts of the country.</p>
<p>The shortage is an indirect result of the closure, since January, of the Tema Oil Refinery for expansion work. Ghana has had to import all petroleum products since then.</p>
<p>A refinery official said in April that the work would finish on time at the end of Q2.</p>
<p>&quot;All the gold mines as well as the manganese mine in the Tarkwa area say that the diesel shortage is affecting their operations,&quot; John Bentum-Williams, Chief Executive of the Ghana Chamber of Mines, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no diesel to get our containers out of the port,&quot; the managing director of one of the main shipping agents in Tema told Reuters. Another shipper said he still managed to get goods transported to and from the port but with increasing delays.</p>
<p>The ministry of mines and energy said a cargo of 30,000 tonnes of diesel would arrive between May 8 and 9.</p>
