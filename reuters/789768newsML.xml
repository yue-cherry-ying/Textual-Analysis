<headline>Holbrooke spurns Karadzic proposal on trial.</headline>

<p>U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on Friday ruled out a proposal from former Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic, an indicted war criminal, that he be tried within Bosnia under international supervision.</p>
<p>Calling Karadzic's proposal &quot;bizarre and totally unacceptable,&quot; Holbrooke told CNN the former Bosnian Serb leader could expect no special deals.</p>
<p>&quot;That is out of the question. He has got to be brought to justice,&quot; Holbrooke said in an interview from Belgrade after talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
<p>The Bosnian Serbs' wartime president is rarely seen in public but his heavily-armed guards are a fixture in Pale, the town where he maintains his headquarters just outside Sarajevo.</p>
<p>In an interview published in the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung on Friday, Karadzic said he might be willing to face trial in Bosnia -- where the local Serb judiciary is largely controlled by the ruling nationalist party he once led.</p>
<p>Holbrooke, who has gone to the former Yugoslavia on a mission to shore up fraying peace, said his talks with Milosevic were part of &quot;three steps forward&quot; posted recently in implementing the 1995 Dayton peace accords.</p>
<p>These include a deal worked out with Bosnia's Serb, Croat and Moslem leaders to parcel out key ambassadorial appointments equitably, an agreement on telephone area codes in the country, and a NATO decision to treat military police in Bosnia just like soldiers.</p>
<p>&quot;They will be treated absolutely identically to other forces. If they misbehave, they will be so treated.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if this meant that NATO forces could move closer to capturing Karadzic, Holbrooke indicated this was possible.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not going to even say that the two are directly related, but these paramilitary police are in all three factions and NATO will implement this in an evenhanded way. Karadzic is an indicted war criminal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Holbrooke, who was expected to threaten Milosevic with economic sanctions unless the Yugoslav leader lived up to his commitments under the Dayton accords, said he believed the United States would not give up its efforts in Bosnia.</p>
<p>&quot;My own view has always been clear and I think the president shares this view. We have a mission in Bosnia, we're gonna get it done. We're not going to walk away and let this go down the drain.&quot;</p>
