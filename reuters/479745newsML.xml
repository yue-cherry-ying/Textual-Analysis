<title>UK: Princess Diana &quot;distressed&quot; after scuffle.</title>
<headline>Princess Diana &quot;distressed&quot; after scuffle.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain's Princess Diana said on Tuesday she was &quot;distressed&quot; to have been caught up in a street scuffle after asking a passer-by to snatch film of her from a photographer's camera.</p>
<p>The Sun newspaper carried three pages of pictures showing Diana, wearing a long black coat and trainers, apparently first remonstrating with a photographer and then standing by as another man thrust him against a wall.</p>
<p>A statement from the princess's office said she had been the victim of media harassment and manipulation and she hoped that a new law would give her more protection.</p>
<p>&quot;Once again the Princess of Wales has been harassed by a photographer. Once again this itself has become the subject of inaccurate press comment.</p>
<p>&quot;The princess hopes that the recently-passed Protection from Harassment Act will give greater protection to people such as herself who are the victims of this kind of distressing intrusion into their private lives.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sun said Diana, the world's most photographed woman, had turned on the cameraman after he snapped her leaving a gym in London on Monday and demanded that he hand over the film.</p>
<p>Diana was shown talking to a stranger who asked if she needed help and then apparently standing aside as the two men fought in the public street over the camera.</p>
<p>Police confirmed a confrontation had taken place but said no complaint had been made and they were not investigating the matter.</p>
<p>Photographer Brendan Beirne, told the Sun; &quot;I am stunned she (Diana) did not step in and stop it. It was outrageous. She knows I am not a stalker or a threat. I have taken photographs of her for 10 years.&quot;</p>
<p>Diana has cut down drastically on public appearances since her divorce last August from heir to the throne Prince Charles.</p>
<p>Monday's scuffle was not the first time the princess has clashed angrily with paparazzi photographers who make a living by following her on her daily round of health clubs, chic restaurants and exclusive clothes shops.</p>
<p>Last year she succeeded in getting a court order against another freelance photogapher whom she accused of harassment.</p>
