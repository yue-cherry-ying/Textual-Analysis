<p>Moroccan Finance Minister Mohammed Kabbaj, presenting the 1997/98 draft budget to parliament, expects the economy to grow by up to 3.0 percent this year, the official MAP news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Kabbaj, speaking before the 333-seat Chamber Representatives, was quoted by MAP as saying: &quot;The 1997/98 draft budget was prepared on the basis of a forecast of GDP growth up to 2.0 to 3.0 percent this year and strong growth in 1998.&quot;</p>
<p>The draft was earlier approved by a ministerial meeting presided by King Hassan II, MAP said.</p>
<p>&quot;The government also expects an inflation rate of 4.0 percent in 1997 against 3.0 percent in 1996, due to an expected increase of households consumption,&quot; MAP quoted Kabbaj as saying.  </p>
<p>A copy of the draft law, which was obtained by Reuters, showed the state total budget rose to 126.7 billion dirhams ($13.5 billion) in the 1997/98 fiscal year compared with 117.1 billion dirhams ($12.4 billion) in 1996/97.</p>
<p>The 1997/98 total state receipts stand at 114.3 billion dirhams compared with 107.7 billion dirhams in the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>&quot;The budget deficit stands at 12.4 billion dirhams in 1997/98 fiscal year, up from 9.4 billion dirhams in the previous period,&quot; the ministry said.</p>
