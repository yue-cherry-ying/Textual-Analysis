<p>British discount supermarket chain Kwik Save Group Plc said on Thursday that like-for-like sales in the first seven weeks of the second half were down six percent but said an increase in underlying gross margins had continued from the first half, offsetting the effect of lower sales.</p>
<p>The company said pretax, pre-exceptional profits in its first six months to March 15 were 44.8 million pounds, compared with 44.2 million a year earlier, and paid out an unchanged interim dividend of 5.95 pence per share.  </p>
<p>&quot;Kwik Save is six months into a three-year programme for change and we are making good progress,&quot; chief executive Graeme Bowler said in a statement, adding that &quot;our determination to achieve steady and successful transformation remains absolute&quot;.</p>
<p>Kwik Save said in November it would close 107 stores as part of a radical shake-up of its strggling discount chain. It has launched an own-label range and is aiming to improve price and quality of it goods.</p>
<p>The company, which has been squeezed between discounters and leading supermarket groups, said it aimed to increase own-label Kwik Save brand sales to 20 percent of total sales.</p>
<p>Kwik Save added that during the second half, it would introduce more new store formats, upgrade product ranges and develop a further tranche of own-label products. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717 ($ = 0.616 British Pounds)</p>
