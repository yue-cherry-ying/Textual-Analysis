<p>Winter flooding in Ohio will cause farmers to plow under or destroy some soft red winter wheat acreage, but the abandonment will be confined to areas that produce little wheat, state crop extension agents said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had some pretty decent stand losses, but it is still so wet that guys haven't been able to get in the fields,&quot; said Jeff Fisher, an extension agent in Pike County.</p>
<p>Flood damage to wheat acreage is expected to be the greatest in the area running from Cincinnati in the southwest to Marietta, Ohio on the West Virginia border, agents said.  </p>
<p>Most of the state's wheat crop escaped damage because it is grown in northwestern Ohio where there was no flooding, crop observers said.</p>
<p>Fisher estimated Pike County's total wheat acreage loss because of flooding at 25 percent, but said losses statewide would be minimal.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as effect on the total (Ohio) wheat picture, it's not going to have much effect,&quot; Fisher said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has forecast Ohio's winter wheat crop at 1.250 million acres, down from 1.400 million a year ago.  </p>
<p>&quot;For sure there are going to be some stands plowed under, but it is not going to be as bad as last year,&quot; said Howard Siegrist, extension agent in Licking County in central Ohio.</p>
<p>Siegrist said because the weather this winter had been relatively mild, abandoned stands would account for less than five percent of the state's total crop.</p>
<p>&quot;We lose stands because of freezing and thawing in February and March, and those conditions have not really been a factor so far this year,&quot; Siegrist said.  </p>
<p>Dave Samples, an extension agent in south central Ohio agreed and said that there had been little of the destructive &quot;heaving,&quot; or thawing and freezing of wheat. He expects few plow-downs in his area.</p>
<p>&quot;In my travels through several counties, I've not seen that (plowed-down) occur,&quot; Samples said. &quot;We did have some siltation (build-up of silt), but in most cases, it was not enough to warrant plow-down.&quot;</p>
<p>Crop observers said the soft red winter wheat crop could compensate for the late fall planting if Ohio sees warm and dry weather in the near term.</p>
<p>&quot;With favorable weather in the next couple of weeks, the wheat crop could really catch up,&quot; Siegrist said.</p>
