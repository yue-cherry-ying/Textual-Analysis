<p>Britain's new Labour government is unlikely to tamper with the broad sweep of their predecessor's reforms of the gas industry although the tone of change may alter, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>New energy minister John Battle held his first meeting today with the regulators of the gas and electricity sectors, Clare Spottiswoode and Stephen Littlechild, a Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly they will want to look at the introduction of deregulation in the domestic market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't expect anything to change,&quot; said Julian Kennedy, of consultants Wood Mackenzie. &quot;I guess any new government would be equally keen to see competition and price saving flow through to consumers.&quot;</p>
<p>But he also believed there may be some change to the way the industry is regulated, possibly following the United States model of an advisory committee rather than an individual regulator.</p>
<p>But &quot;as far as the general flow of competition, I wouldn't expect major changes,&quot; he said. &quot;New Labour is very competition and market oriented.&quot;</p>
<p>James Ball of consultants Gas Strategies believed Labour will introduce a change of emphasis.</p>
<p>&quot;The big difference is that while the Tories (Conservatives) talked about the consumer, they believed competition would automatically favour the consumer. Labour is much more consciously pro-consumer, it will look at competition and the consumer and service,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>This may mean slowing down the pace at which the country is opened for competition.</p>
<p>So far two pilot areas have opened up - in Devon, Cornwall and Somerset last April, and in Kent, East and West Sussex, Dorset and Avon in February and March this year.</p>
<p>The DTI produced a revised timetable in March under which the rest of the country would be opened up in six monthly stages, starting in October with Scotland and the North East of England.</p>
<p>&quot;Where there's rapid paced experiments as in gas they might slow them down to a more sensible pace,&quot; said Ball. &quot;I doubt they'd push the pace as the Conservatives did.&quot;</p>
<p>He also anticipated some possible difficulty in relations between gas regulator Ofgas and the new government.</p>
<p>He believed that the last government cynically chose areas for the pilot schemes which were Conservative marginal constituencies, &quot;although consumers in their droves voted against them.&quot;</p>
<p>He said this was &quot;a cynical move in which Ofgas participated, and I'm not sure they start as friends.&quot;</p>
<p>But he thought a change of emphasis from pure competition to a blend of competition and consumerism would benefit all users.</p>
<p>&quot;The church of competition is closed down because Labour doesn't worship at it,&quot; he said. &quot;It likes it, it just doesn't worship at it.&quot;</p>
<p>Sue Slipman, Director of the Gas Consumers Council (GCC), also believed consumers will receive more support and attention.</p>
<p>&quot;John Battle said before the election, and has reiterated since, his commitment for consumers to be put at the heart of regulation,&quot; she said. &quot;Competition has been favoured to the exclusion of consumers in a number of areas -- the assumption has been that competition will sort it all out.&quot;</p>
<p>She added that the GCC believed Ofgas has sometimes been too soft on companies which are new entrants to the domestic retail market.</p>
<p>&quot;There's clearly been a lot of leeway on the basis of opening a competitive market and allowing companies to learn before coming down like a ton of bricks,&quot; she said, pointing out that marketing techniques have caused controversy, and that on issues of transferring a consumer's supply from one company to another &quot;Ofgas has been somewhat complacent.&quot;</p>
<p>At Ofgas there was no change of direction as the regulator waits for decisions taken by the new minister. &quot;As far as Ofgas is concerned we are just proceeding as normal,&quot; said a spokesman on Thursday.</p>
