<title>RUSSIA: Kremlin says U.S. is &quot;jealous&quot; over NATO deal.</title>
<headline>Kremlin says U.S. is &quot;jealous&quot; over NATO deal.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-04-19</dateline>

<p>Moscow said on Saturday the United States was just &quot;jealous&quot; when it reacted coolly to the agreements over NATO expansion plans reached by the leaders of Russia and Germany earlier this week.</p>
<p>&quot;Even in international affairs there is a place for jealousy,&quot; President Boris Yeltsin's press secretary, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, told Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>NATO and Russia are locked in a bitter dispute over plans by the Western alliance to allow former Warsaw Pact states in Eastern Europe to apply for NATO membership. Russia says it would endanger its security.</p>
<p>Both sides are trying to reach an agreement on a charter defining relations between Moscow and NATO before a July NATO summit which would extend the first invitations.</p>
<p>The charter, which will give Moscow the right to close consultations with NATO on European security, is designed to compensate Russia for the absorption of its former allies into the Western alliance.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said in Germany on Thursday after talks with his friend, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, that Russia and the Western defence alliance would sign the charter agreement on May 27 in Paris.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials have said the NATO-Russia agreement was anything but concluded and expressed puzzlement that the Russian leader had acted as if a signing ceremony was definite.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky also told Interfax Yeltsin had not made any concessions to Kohl.</p>
