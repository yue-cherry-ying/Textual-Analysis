<p>Shares in glass-maker Saint-Gobain fell heavily on Tuesday, reflecting concerns over weak prices, analysts said after a company presentation .</p>
<p>&quot;There was a message of prudence for the 1997 year. I think that is having an effect and analyses are being revised downward, which is what I am doing,&quot; said a broker.</p>
<p>Chairman Jean-Louis Beffa told analysts this morning that prices in Europe were weak and Saint-Gobain would find out in the second half whether the trend would continue. The shares were down 4.46 percent at 814 francs at 1423 GMT, while the market was down 3.07 percent.  </p>
<p>There was a message that estimates for the current year should &quot;take account of the effect of prices in Europe, which is tied to the fact that growth is not very strong,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>But it was possible Saint-Gobain could change its cautious outlook in the course of the year, he added. In any case there should be a catch-up in 1998 if weak prices held throughout this year, he said.</p>
<p>A forecast 20 percent jump in profit for the 1997 year was tied to a one-off capital gain of 900 million francs on the sale of Cise to Bouygues.</p>
<p>Another analyst said he was taking the comments on weak prices as a &quot;profit warning&quot;.</p>
