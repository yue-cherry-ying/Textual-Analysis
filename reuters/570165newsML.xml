<p>Wall Street stocks are expected to head lower with bonds at the start of trading Thursday after the Dow tumbled 140 points yesterday.</p>
<p>Analysts blame the decline on the bond market and the fact that the long bond yield is again inching higher.  They expected to see further weakness at the start today.</p>
<p>&quot;We are up 830 points in less than a month.  The laws of gravity come into effect,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, analyst at Prudential Securities.  &quot;Bonds are the gatekeeper for stocks. When yields fall, stocks are up.  Now yields are rising again.&quot;  </p>
<p>Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments, said the market could sell-off 40 to 60 points right at the start and restest the 7,000 mark on the Dow.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the market is overbought and that we will get back to 7,000. Maybe today,&quot; Cardillo said. &quot;Then we should have a bounce next week when the bond market focuses on retail sales which will be key.&quot;</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Dow gave back almost all of its gains from Monday and Tuedsday.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index Futures contract for June was down 6.75 at 810.90.  </p>
<p>Tokyo stocks ended nearly flat on Thursday after the key index teetered around the 20,000 barrier for most of session.</p>
<p>The 225-share Nikkei average was 12.91 points or 0.06 percent higher at 20,061.81. June Nikkei futures were down 20 points at 20,060.</p>
<p>In London, the FTSE 100 index was down 11.6 at 4525.9.</p>
<p>U.S. shares were at a virtual standstill there on Thursday as most European institutional investors took the day off in observance of the Ascension Day holiday.  </p>
<p>The dollar fell sharply in late Tokyo trade on comments from Ministry of Finance senior official Eisuke Sakakibara that it is possible the yen may strengthen, based on its movements over past year, and it could strengthen to 103 yen to a dollar. The comment set off dollar sales, including hedge sales from trust banks and probably life insurers, which in turn triggered consecutive waves of stop-loss selling.</p>
<p>In Europe, the dollar was pinned beneath 124 yen, and above 171 marks, stabilizing after an early slump.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries were lower, with the long bond down 8/32 to yield 6.98 percent.  </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street writes that shareholders of Nine West Group, until recently a Wall Street darling, learned Tuesday that the company is under investigation by the SEC.  But some investors are asking why they were kept in the dark as the company's shares fell sharply over the last several weeks.</p>
<p>The New York Times Market Place writes that it's a question whether Nine West has a bigger problem with accounting or investor relations.</p>
