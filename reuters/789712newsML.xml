<p>Nicaragua, one of the 30 states that recognise Taipei instead of its arch-rival Beijing, on Saturday pledged to support Taipei's bid to join the United Nations.</p>
<p>&quot;The Republic of China is a free, democratic sovereign nation, it deserves to be given proper recognition by the world,&quot; visiting Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman, through a translator, told reporters before ending his five-day state visit.</p>
<p>&quot;Nicaragua will never change its firm support for the Republic of China's participation in the United Nations and other international organisations,&quot; Aleman said.</p>
<p>Taipei and Beijing have been arch-rivals since a civil war split them in 1949.</p>
<p>Beijing, which views the island as a renegade province and reacts fiercely to any move to recognise or seat Taiwan, took over China's U.N. seat in 1971 when Taipei was expelled from the United Nations.</p>
<p>In exchange for Nicaragua's backing, Taiwan would offer technical assistance and other cooperation to help Nicaragua's development, a joint communique signed by Aleman and Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui said.</p>
<p>Lee has accepted Aleman's invitation to visit Nicaragua, but no exact date has been set.</p>
<p>Aleman's visit was closely followed by a similar visit by Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, who was scheduled to arrive in Taiwan late on Saturday.</p>
<p>Costa Rica, Nicaragua and a handful of other countries recently proposed a discussion on granting Taiwan U.N. membership during a General Assembly session in September.</p>
<p>China had prevented similar proposals from winning inscription on the U.N. agenda for four consecutive years.</p>
<p>President Lee would embark on a two-week tour to central American nations in September.</p>
<p>Lee in 1995 made a private, but high-profile visit to the United States that prompted an angry Beijing to launch months of intimidatory war games and unarmed missile tests near Taiwan to warn the island against independence.</p>
