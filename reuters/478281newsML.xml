<p>Andreas Herzog is praying that the good side of Austria's Jekyll-and-Hyde pysche surfaces on Wednesday night in their crucial World Cup qualifier against Scotland.</p>
<p>The golden boy of Austrian football is the player national coach Herbert Prohaska is pinning his hopes on to plunder precious points from the group four leaders in front of 50,000 fervent fans at Celtic Park.</p>
<p>But Herzog, who plays his club soccer in Germany with Werder Bremen, insists that the only thing you can count on with Austria is their total unpredictability.</p>
<p>&quot;On our day we are capable of beating anyone in Europe -- but on a bad day we can lose to just about anyone too,&quot; said the 28-year-old playmaker who will win his 58th cap.</p>
<p>Austria come to Glasgow -- where they have not won in four visits since a victory in a friendly in 1950 -- four points behind Scotland but with two games in hand.</p>
<p>Scotland pulled clear at the top on Saturday when they beat Estonia 2-0 at Kilmarnock and coach Craig Brown will be looking to build on that success.</p>
<p>There are fitness doubts over Darren Jackson, Colin Hendry and Paul McStay but Brown is certain to welcome back John Collins after suspension forced him to miss the Estonia game.</p>
<p>Austria were deflated by last week's 2-0 friendly defeat at the hands of Slovenia, currently bottom of group one without a point from their opening three qualifiers.</p>
<p>However, Prohaska's team have also managed a very impressive 1-0 away win over Sweden in their qualifying campaign. They also beat the Czech Republic in a friendly last summer just before the Czechs went to Euro 96 where they eventually finished runners-up.</p>
<p>But Herzog fears for Austria because of the way they failed to qualify for last June's finals in England.</p>
<p>&quot;We beat the Republic of Ireland 3-1 in Dublin to give ourselves a great chance of qualifying, then we lost our next game in Latvia,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Scotland posed a lot of problems when they came to Vienna last August and drew 0-0. To drop two points right away put us under pressure. We then recovered by winning in Stockholm but I think the Scottish team is better than Sweden.&quot;</p>
<p>Prohaska says he will adopt the same attacking approach as the one which paid off against the Swedes.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoever wins this match will be favourites to win the group. We won't set out to draw -- you must always set out to win -- but if we do draw I'll be satisfied.&quot;</p>
<p>Austria's only real fitness worry is over Rapid Vienna striker Peter Schottel who is receiving treatment but is expected to play.</p>
<p>Line-ups to be announced.</p>
