<p>Intel Corp plans to boost its investments in China and introduce its latest technology to the country, which has one of the world's fastest-growing computer industries, Intel's chief said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Intel, the world's largest chip maker, is building a factory in Shanghai. The $100-million venture is expected to start production in early 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;We would hope to continue to expand that manufacturing operation as time moves forward,&quot; Intel president and chief operating officer Craig Barrett told reporters at a briefing to mark the China launch of the Pentium II processor.</p>
<p>Intel has not yet received approval for a second stage of investment in China, but future investments would be around the same level as the Shanghai factory, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will continue to invest in both technology and manufacturing capability here in China, as well as bring the latest in technology to local computer manufacturing companies and software operations,&quot; Barrett said.</p>
<p>Shanghai was among several world cities chosen by Intel for the launch of its Pentium II in recognition of the growing market for computers in China, he said.</p>
<p>Pentium II is faster and more powerful than the company's earlier Pentium Pro processor with enhanced performance for multi-media applications, company officials said.</p>
<p>In China, nine personal computer manufacturers have announced they will use the new processor, including Great Wall Computer Corp. Group and Legend Group, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the Chinese computer industry) is one of the fastest growing on a relative basis of any in the world, fuelled by the latest in technology and increasingly fuelled by local companies -- as opposed to multi-nationals -- serving the market,&quot; Barrett said earlier in a speech.</p>
<p>However, China currently invests less than 0.5 percent of its gross domestic product in information technology, as opposed to three to four percent in countries with more developed computer markets, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that this rate of investment has a lot of possibility to increase in the future, which I think is a suggestion that the personal computer market here will get even stronger as we move forward,&quot; Barrett said in the speech, which was carried live on the Internet.</p>
