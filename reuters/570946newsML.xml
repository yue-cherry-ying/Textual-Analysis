<headline>Thai fin official says April exports up 5 pct.</headline>

<p>Thai exports in April rose five percent from the same period last year while exports in the first four months of 1997 rose one percent year-on-year, the secretary to the finance minister Phongsathorn Siriyothin said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Phongsathorn did not give details, saying the figures were preliminary and were based on data from the customs department. The economic data that is considered official normally comes from the Bank of Thailand.</p>
<p>The January-April trade deficit narrowed 20 percent from the year-earlier period, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The sales of high-end products such as electronics and auto parts improved while the value of agricultural exports dropped,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand forecast exports this year will rise around 7.7 percent, although some private analysts said the growth could be lower due to both structural and cyclical adjustments.</p>
<p>Thailand's trade deficit narrowed to a preliminary 21.7 billion baht ($834.6 million) in February from 39 billion baht in January.</p>
<p>The fall was caused by the sharp drop in imports and not an increase in exports, the government said.</p>
