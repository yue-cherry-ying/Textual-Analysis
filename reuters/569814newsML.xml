<headline>INSIGHT - US T-bond futures seen hesitant near term.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. Treasury bond futures are likely to be hesitant to make big moves in either direction in the near term, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>Dan Busiel, a vice president at First Chicago Futures, said the bounce in June T-bond futures from early lows this morning could be a sign the market's widely anticipated correction to last week's gains might be a slow process.</p>
<p>&quot;I did anticipate we'd have another move down to the 108 handle, but now I'm starting to doubt because today's price action has been pretty good,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>June T-bonds were up 6/32 at 109-16/32 in late morning trade after dipping to a low of 108-30/43 earlier.</p>
<p>Still, Busiel said he expected the contract to test 108-11/32 before probing new highs, possibly on a friendly reading in next week's retail sales and inflation data. The 108-11/32 support represented the 50-percent retracement of the rise from the April 11 bottom of 106-12/32 to last Friday's 110-10/32 high.</p>
<p>Overall, Busiel said the market should have a slightly positive bias going into the May 20 Federal Open Market Committee meeting.  </p>
<p>Stewart Taylor, president of Taylor Consulting, saw a slightly negative bias, although he also expected the relatively narrow seesaw trading to continue for a while.</p>
<p>He said the underlying trend was still down and that a recent buildup in open interest at higher levels would probably be a drag.</p>
<p>For the next few days, however, he said he would tend to be a buyer on weakness toward support at 108-26/32 to 109-00 and a seller on bounces toward the 109-29/32 area.</p>
<p>&quot;The thing that concerns me the most is the general level of open interest,&quot; Taylor said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The big rise really leaves the market vulnerable...since most of the open interest was accrued when the market was moving higher,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Open interest in June T-bond futures increased by 2,249 contracts to 487,389 on Wednesday, according to preliminary figures released by the CBOT. T-bond open interest for all months totalled 563,816 contracts at the end of Wednesday, up 1,475 on the day.</p>
<p>Taylor said the next major move would probably be to the downside but the market needed a catalyst to break out.  </p>
<p>He said the &quot;prime suspects&quot; for such a catalyst were the Commodity Research Bureau index and the dollar.</p>
<p>The CRB index, up 1.06 point at 247.67 in late morning trade, has been behaving favorably for bonds lately, he said, but the dollar may have put in a top with its weakness this week after a two-year uptrend.</p>
