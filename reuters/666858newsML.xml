<title>ISRAEL: Palestinians plan first census in December.</title>
<headline>Palestinians plan first census in December.</headline>
<dateline>AL-BIREH, West Bank 1997-06-17</dateline>

<p>Palestinians will conduct a census in the West Bank and Gaza Strip later this year, the first population count under Palestinian self-rule, an official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;President Yasser Arafat has ordered that the census be conducted before the end of this year,&quot; Hassan Abu Libdeh, director of the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), told a news conference in the West Bank town of al-Bireh.</p>
<p>&quot;The population and lodging count is an act of sovereignty in every respect,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A political controversy may arise when the Palestinians begin the population count some time in December. Abu Libdeh said the census will cover all Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, including Arab East Jerusalem, which Israel regards as part of its capital.</p>
<p>He said about $7 million had been allocated for the census, most of which came from donor countries. About 4,500 Palestinian field workers will conduct the house-to-house survey, he said.</p>
<p>The last population count was conducted by Israel after it captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Abu Libdeh said the PCBS does not recognise the Israeli survey nor a previous population count by Jordan in 1962 as complete census.</p>
<p>The PCBS estimates that in 1996, 2.5 million Palestinians lived in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
