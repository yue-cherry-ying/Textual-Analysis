<p>A Cuban law published on Saturday makes it illegal for Cubans to rent living space to foreigners with temporary visas without registering those tenants with the island's immigration authorities.</p>
<p>The law, published in the official newspaper Granma, said landlords who fail to register their foreign tenants were liable to fines.</p>
<p>The registration law implemented other legislation from May that legalised rentals by Cubans to foreigners who were temporary residents and that established the rate of taxation for landlords.</p>
<p>Prior to the laws, private rentals were not sanctioned by Cuban law although the government revealed almost a quarter of foreign business executives and tourists were renting rooms or apartments from individual Cuban families.</p>
<p>Under the new laws, the high rate of taxation has discouraged many would-be landlords, obliging the foreign tourists and temporary residents to rent rooms at more expensive government hotels or apartments and to rent houses through a government agency.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s Cuba's revolutionary government nationalised all hotels and apartment houses although families were allowed to maintain ownership of the dwellings in which they lived.</p>
<p>In moves that liberalised the economy over the past five years, foreign investors have been encouraged to establish joint enterprises with the Cuban government for building and managing hotels and tourist resorts.</p>
<p>The new law announced on Saturday will allow immigration and law enforcement authorities to know the whereabouts of all foreigners in the country.</p>
