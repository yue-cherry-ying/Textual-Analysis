<p>VJESNIK</p>
<p>- Croatia will start issuing government bonds to its citizens entitled to compensation of property confiscated during the Yugoslav communist regime from January 1, 2000. The bonds will be paid every six months in the next 20 years.</p>
<p>- Croatian kuna has been introduced in Eastern Slavonia, but 600,000 Yugoslav dinars converted into kuna fell short of the planned four million. Local Serbs seem to have boycotted the conversion, exchanging dinars for German marks instead.</p>
<p>-The main point of the agreement struck by the Croatian government, UNHCR and UNTAES is the reciprocal return of Croatian and Serb refugees to Eastern Slavonia and former Serb Krajina, respectively.</p>

<p>- A new Airbus A320 plane will join the Croatia Airlines fleet in early June.</p>
<p>- Parliament approved a law against money laundering.</p>

<p>- The Varazdin over-the-counter market will have electronic trading within a month, says its director Marijan Cingula.</p>
