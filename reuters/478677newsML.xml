<dateline>TIRANA 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Prime Minister Bashkim Fino made his first visit on Tuesday to Albania's rebel-held south since insurgents seized control of the region last month.</p>
<p>Reporters said Fino arrived by helicopter in the rebel-held stronghold of Gjirokaster, 30 kms (20 miles) from the Greek border and was welcomed by local leaders.  </p>
<p>Fino was greeted by rebel leaders and heavily-armed guards from Gjirokaster and Tepelene to the north. He shook hands with Gjoleke Malaj, who is the rebel boss in Tepelene.</p>
<p>Fino told reporters he was in the region to meet &quot;legal representatives of local power and public order&quot; and he barred the rebels from closed-door talks with the elected officials.</p>
<p>Elected officials have remained in the region but the south has been controlled by rebel-run Committees of Public Salvation since the army was driven out and munitions depots looted in early March.</p>
<p>Fino's office said he would accept requests by the rebel leaders and their committees to meet separately.</p>
