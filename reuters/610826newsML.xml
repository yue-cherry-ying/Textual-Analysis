<p>Taiwan's central bank issued T$3 billion in two-month negotiable certificates of deposit on Friday at an average yield of 5.482 percent, a central bank official said.</p>
<p>The range of the bids was between 5.400 and 5.500 percent.</p>
<p>Demand totalled T$3.8 billion.</p>
<p>The central bank repeatedly issued NCDs during a sustained stock rally in March and April, a move widely seen as aiming to keep a lid on the loose liquidity that many experts said had been fuelling what was then a sizzling stock market.  </p>
<p>The central bank has confirmed that it was responding to the liquidity sitution but denied that it was acting directly in response to the stock market bull run.</p>
<p>The stock market has entered a consolidation in May, with daily turnover plunging to less than half of the record levels set during the big first-quarter rally.</p>
