<p>Angola, emerging from 20 years of civil war with a new unity government sworn in last month, has embarked on a new battle for economic stability, Planning Minister Emanuel Carneiro said on Friday.</p>
<p>The country was now making progress in reining in rampant inflation and planned to step up a privatisation programme, he told Reuters during a Southern Africa investment conference.</p>
<p>&quot;Our new combat front will be the stabilisation of the macro-economic situation in Angola,&quot; Carneiro said.</p>
<p>&quot;The underlying principle is the withdrawal of the state from enterprises. The way is now open for privatisation.&quot;</p>
<p>The poverty-stricken country says it needs the continued support of the global community to achieve its goals. But doubts remain in the West as to how deep-rooted the reforms are.</p>
<p>Much will depend on a visit by the International Monetary Fund to Angola next week to assess the country's economic reform programme before implementing a $75 million three-year emergency programme agreed last year.</p>
<p>If the IMF visit is successful the World Bank is ready to clear over $250 million in loans.</p>
<p>Carneiro said the government already had evidence to show its conservative economic policies were working.</p>
<p>Inflation, which peaked at 12,000 percent a year at one stage, has fallen dramatically with prices in the four months to April increasing only six percent, a sharp improvement on a year ago when when monthly inflation was running at 84 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We are expecting inflation to be under 30 percent by the end of 1997,&quot; Carnerio said.</p>
<p>However, while the inflation picture is clearly improving, some economists say the latest monthly data may exaggerate the position since the government owes civil servants up to six months in back wages, which threatens to push inflation up again.</p>
<p>On privatisation, Carneiro said the government had already sold off dozens of small to medium-sized enterprises and would be widening the programme in future.</p>
<p>But there are no plans at present to sell-off Sonangol, the state oil company responsible for much of Angola's export earnings whose accounts the IMF is keen to scrutinise.</p>
