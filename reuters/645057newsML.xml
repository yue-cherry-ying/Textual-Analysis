<p>Benny The Dip finally set the record straight for the Gosden family on Saturday with a spine-tingling victory in the Epsom Derby.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd only say to my old man somewhere up there that we finally got it right,&quot; John Gosden said after fulfilling a lifelong ambition with his emotion-charged victory.</p>
<p>For his father, trainer Towser Gosden, was forced by ill health to give up training just a year before his Charlottown won the 1966 Derby.</p>
<p>&quot;It was very difficult for father as his health failed him. It's a funny old story. He said:'I've had enough. I can't do justice to my horses.' He packed it in and left,&quot; Gosden recalled.</p>
<p>&quot;He worked closely with Gordon Smyth who trained Charlottown and he stood in the winner's circle and I can see him now. It was probably a very fulfilling moment with a very devout feeling for him,&quot; Gosden said.</p>
<p>Towser Gosden, who had trained the colt with such skill as a two-year-old, died shortly after Charlottown's big race victory.</p>
<p>So there was no doubting the emotion in John Gosden's voice when he said after Benny The Dip's last-gasp triumph: &quot;This one is for him.&quot;</p>
