<p>Lawmakers reviewing the landmark tobacco settlement turned their attention Wednesday to warehouse loads of confidential documents charting cigarette makers' actions over four decades.</p>
<p>Minnesota Attorney General Hubert &quot;Skip&quot; Humphrey, who has broken with 40 other state attorneys general to oppose the deal, urged a Senate panel to get those secret papers before accepting a settlement he lambasted as a &quot;Trojan Camel.&quot;</p>
<p>Several lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee also called for the industry to make the documents public. &quot;No immunity (from future lawsuits) without full disclosure,&quot; said Vermont Sen. Patrick  Leahy, the senior Democrat on the panel.</p>
<p>Committee Chairman Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, said he would like to see the documents and would consider using Senate subpoena powers to help Humphrey. &quot;My goal here is to get at the facts,&quot; Hatch said.</p>
<p>But, talking to reporters later, Hatch said that obtaining documents would not be a prerequisite for passing legislation that would be required to turn the $368.5 billion settlement into U.S. law.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no question that many believe that the cigarette companies have been lying all these years, and I think there's much evidence for that. I don't need 33 million documents to tell me that,&quot; Hatch said.</p>
<p>Humphrey, speaking separately to reporters, disagreed. &quot;Nobody knows what we're finding out, nobody, other than the companies themselves,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Under the proposed settlement, the industry would pay $368.5 billion over 25 years and curtail advertising and marketing. Some of the money would go to anti-smoking programmes and to reimburse states for treating patients with smoking-related diseases.</p>
<p>In its second hearing on the settlement, the committee heard from Humphrey, four lawyers who helped reach the settlement and two constitutional experts. No cigarette industry attorneys took part in this hearing, one of several the panel has scheduled.</p>
<p>Hatch tried to focus on the civil litigation aspects of the pact. It would settle current class actions and bar future ones against cigarette makers. Individuals could still sue, but such cases are difficult to mount, and damages from all cases would be limited each year.</p>
<p>Asked which liability questions concern him the most, Hatch replied, &quot;All of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Several congressional panels have jurisdiction over aspects of the settlement, but so far only the Senate Judiciary Committee has held hearings. Hatch has ordered congressional lawyers to draft legislation based on the settlement pact, noting it would be a working document and not a bill he plans to file.</p>
<p>State officials are also drafting a legislative proposal, which they hope to complete by Sept. 1. Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore, an impassioned defender of the settlement, said he has &quot;several Democrats and Republicans&quot; who are willing to introduce the legislation in Congress.</p>
<p>Moore, who attended but did not testify Wednesday, told reporters that if Congress tinkered too much or delayed too long, the carefully assembled deal could collapse.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a little frustrating to watch the wheels of Congress continue to spin in this process because for 40 years they haven't done anything&quot; to control tobacco, he said.</p>
