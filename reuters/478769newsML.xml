<p>Brazil's banking landscape has been redrawn virtually overnight after Anglo-Asian financial mammoth HSBC Holdings Plc bought out its Brazilian partner in a bid to lead the country's retail banking industry, analysts said.</p>
<p>With its $1.0 billion acquisition of Banco Bamerindus do Brasil SA, HSBC has made a major commitment to Latin America's biggest economy and will probably force local competitors to rethink future expansion plans, analysts said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Banks will have to review their strategies to compete with the new player,&quot; said Gilberto Nobre, vice-president at Banco Excel Economico, a bank which itself has shaken the competition with its aggressive approach to clients.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll bet that at every meeting, at every bank, across the country on Monday, executives sat down to debate how they would face up to their new competitor,&quot; Nobre said.</p>
<p>Under a deal announced Wednesday by Bazil's Central Bank HSBC assumed 10 billion reais of the former Bamerimdus' assets and liabilities and estabilished a new bank under the name of Banco HSBC Bamerindus SA.  </p>
<p>The new bank, a fully HSBC owned subsidiary, opened for business on Monday, and has already announced plans to expand its network to 1,500 branches from the current 1,206.</p>
<p>Analysts said HSBC will probably shake up Brazil's conservative retail banking sector.</p>
<p>&quot;For the first time a large bank with recognized international experience in retail banking is entering the Brazilian market,&quot; said Erivelto Rodrigues, analyst at Austin Asis banking consulting firm.  </p>
<p>Rodrigues pointed out that at an estimated $400 billion, HSBC's total worldwide assets are nearly equivalent to all of Brazil's bank assets.</p>
<p>Analysts said HSBC will force Brazilian retail banks to invest in new cost-effective services to keep abreast of the latest in international banking technology.</p>
<p>Caught offguard by HSBC's surprise entry into the market, board members at some of Brazil's most-firmly established banks said they were well-prepared to face the new competition.  They said the country's banking sector can only win with the presence of the Anglo-Asian bank.  </p>
<p>&quot;HSBC is undoubtedly a strong competitor...In the medium term, HSBC will contribute to make the market more agile,&quot; said Roberto Setubal, president of Banco Itau SA, Brazil's second largest private bank.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, Brazilian banks have undergone a brutal transformation, which was triggered by the three year-old stabilization plan which slashed inflation and eliminated the banks' almost risk-free profits.</p>
<p>Several small, and even some large and traditional, financial institutions were forced to close doors or merge in an effort to survive.  </p>
<p>For the banking industry, the positive side of the anti-inflation program was an increase in the average Brazilian's purchasing power.</p>
<p>Economists estimate around 30 million people have crossed the poverty line since the launch of the Real Plan, increasing demand for credit and banking services.</p>
<p>&quot;Those new consumers are the banks' new target,&quot; Excel Economico's Nobre said.</p>
<p>Analysts also said HSBC opened doors for new foreign banks to invest in Brazil.</p>
<p>&quot;The HSBC move is likely to lead other foreign financial conglomerates to think over opportunities in the Brazilian market,&quot; said Itau's Setubal.</p>
<p>Opportunities may come with the upcoming privatizations of state banks like Banerj and Credireal.</p>
