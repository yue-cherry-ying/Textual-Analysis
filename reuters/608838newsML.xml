<p>Lithuania's Tauras Bank said on Friday it had liquidity problems and borrowed 4.3 million litas on Thursday from the Bank of Lithuania.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Bank of Lithuania confirmed to Reuters that Tauras bank borrowed another 10.25 million litas in March from the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Tauras Bank has temporary liquidity problems,&quot; a spokeswoman for Tauras Bank, Rita Mikailiene, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The bank has repaid 873,000 litas already,&quot; Mikailiene added.</p>
<p>The Lietuvos rytas daily quoted financial analysts as saying that Tauras Bank, Lithuania's eighth largest bank, had experienced liquidity problems for the past few months.</p>
<p>The assets of Tauras bank decreased to 184 million litas from 237 million litas in the first quarter of 1997 and deposits dropped to 139 million litas from 159 million litas, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Lietuvos Rytas also reported that Tauras Bank's loan portfolio declined to 104 million litas from 137 million litas and the capital of the bank went down to 22.5 million litas from 26.9 million litas at the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p>Tauras Bank recently registered its new 40 million litas share capital issue with the country's securities commission and started the distribution since May 15 with no priority right to current shareholders.</p>
<p>&quot;We are about to finish negotiations with the foreign investors and the president of the bank, Genadijus Konopliovas, guarantees that the whole issue will be successfully distributed at the beginning of June,&quot; Mikailiene said.</p>
<p>Tauras Bank posted 10.6 million litas net profit in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We had no profit in the first quarter of 1997,&quot; Mikailiene said, although she declined to give specific figures.</p>
