<p>The head of Poland's ruling ex-communists on Monday proposed a nationwide referendum on abortion at the same time as parliamentary elections this year.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be sensible to hold it with the parliamentary elections because at some stage we will have to resolve this issue,&quot; social democrat Jozef Oleksy told private Radio Zet.</p>
<p>The abortion issue divides Poland into almost equal camps and is especially controversial now, as Pope John Paul, who views abortion as killing, is on a visit to his homeland.</p>
<p>The ruling Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), in which Oleksy heads the core party, and other liberal or leftist groups in parliament last year eased the previous anti-abortion law.</p>
<p>Last week Poland's Constitutional Tribunal ruled that the new law, allowing abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy for women who cannot afford a child or have personal problems, clashed with constitutional guarantees of the right to life.</p>
<p>This means parliament must tighten the law again within six months, unless supporters of easier abortion can muster the two-thirds of votes needed to overturn the tribunal ruling -- which is unlikely in this parliament or the next.</p>
<p>The ex-communists, calling the tribunal ruling politically-inspired, want a referendum. The Church and its allies say moral questions cannot be settled this way.</p>
<p>Holding the vote alongside elections might lead to wider participation than in a May 25 referendum on a new constitution, which passed narrowly but with less than a 40 percent voter turnout.</p>
<p>Campaigning for the elections, due later this year, pits the ex-communists against Solidarity Election Action (AWS), a pro-Church alliance of rightist parties led by the Solidarity trade union.</p>
<p>The two groupings are neck and neck in opinion polls, each with backing of between 20 and 30 percent.</p>
<p>If adopted, the referendum suggestion could increase the profile of religious issues in the election campaign.</p>
<p>Oleksy said it was up to the Church whether the polls appeared to be a fight between itself and the political left.</p>
<p>The Church enjoyed great authority among Poles as a champion of human rights during the communist era, but many Poles believe it now seeks too much influence on public life.</p>
<p>Some of the ex-communists set out to appeal to voters with strongly secular views while others, including President Aleksander Kwasniewski, say they want to lower tensions over such issues.</p>
