<p>Some of Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists voiced concern on Saturday that their campaign might provoke a Chinese response when Beijing regains control of this British colony in less than three days.</p>
<p>&quot;I am worried about our slogan 'Topple one-party rule',&quot; said a participant in a public forum held by the Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China.</p>
<p>&quot;How will the Beijing government treat us after the handover? What will they do to us?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>More than 100 people packed a fenced-off pedestrian area, surrounded by political cartoons and other mementos from Hong Kong's democratic movement.</p>
<p>&quot;The pro-democracy movement in China in 1989 resulted in mass killing. Do we want to see more people massacred in Hong Kong?&quot;, another participant asked.</p>
<p>The British Union Jack will be lowered at midnight on June 30 and China's red flag will rise, symbolising a new era under Communist rule.</p>
<p>&quot;The democratic movements are not stirred by just several activists, but the majority of the people...We can neither stop them nor rush them,&quot; said Szeto Wah, the Alliance leader.</p>
<p>&quot;Some say we can get what we want if we kowtow to the Chinese authorities, but we will end up letting them dictate our every move,&quot; Wong Yuk Man, editor of the Mad Dog Daily, said to loud applause.</p>
<p>Other participants expressed concern over self-censorship among the local media.</p>
<p>&quot;The media seem to be emphasising celebrations and ignoring the dissenting voices,&quot; said another participant.</p>
<p>Szeto, a prominent member of the pro-democracy movement, said this was because Beijing has many subtle ways to censor the local newspapers.</p>
<p>He said this included withholding advertising or blocking their investments in mainland China.</p>
<p>&quot;China is a shark, we are just a shrimp,&quot; he said. &quot;But we are a poisonous shrimp, and if the shark swallows us it will vomit to death.&quot;</p>
