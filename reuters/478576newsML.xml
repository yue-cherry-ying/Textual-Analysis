<p>Czech software and data processing company PVT a.s. shares are a &quot;sell&quot; as the firm has not been able to replenish revenue after finishing one huge state order, analysts said in a Reuters poll.</p>
<p>They said PVT's future depends on finding new long-term business now that its role as provider of computer technology for the massive Czech privatisation programme is over.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite partial success in finding new orders we consider the share price to be overvalued,&quot; said Leos Jirman, of Delta Securities.</p>
<p>The stock closed unchanged on Tuesday at 2,900 crowns, giving some respite from a huge fall which brought shares down from the 4,700 crown level at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>The voucher-based privatisation scheme's services, which comprised the computer processing of millions of share orders for citizens, were PVT's main source of revenue through 1995.</p>
<p>The company posted a net loss of 16 million crowns in 1996, after a 532 million net profit in 1995, on sales falling to 1.6 billion crowns from 2.5 billion.</p>
<p>Equity analysts put the fall in earnings in line with investments into new projects.</p>
<p>&quot;The company attempts to prepare new projects, but their start-up demands enhanced expenditure,&quot; said Jirman.</p>
<p>Analysts forecast PVT to swing back into profit this year, but they warn that profit figures would not be comparable with the voucher privatisation era.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect revenues to exceed two billion crowns, with profit of 150 million,&quot; said Lindsay Ashford of Zivnostenska Banka.</p>
<p>Among new potential revenue, PVT is a subcontractor as part of a consortium which recently won a 1.3 billion crown tender for a Czech army information system.</p>
<p>PVT has also launched itself as an Internet service provider, has participation in an insurance company and a pension fund and has a small stake in the consortium which operates one of the Czech mobile telephone networks.</p>
<p>It also is bidding to operate a universal securities clearing house which is expected to be established to register transactions on the equity and fixed income markets. The winner in the tender should be announced by the end of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;An important factor, which will affect profitability of the company, is the success, or failure, in the clearing house tender,&quot; said Patria Finance's Jana Tuckova.</p>
<p>The surveyed analysts said the stock would have to drop at least a further 100 crowns to 2,800 to become attractive.</p>
<p>&quot;For a long-term investment, it can be considered a buy in case the price falls at least to 2,800 crowns&quot; said Karel Vojacek of Expandia Finance.</p>
<p>Analysts also noted the issue was illiquid, a disadvantage which could be solved if the government privatisation agency, the National Property Funds, goes ahead with the earlier announced plan to sell its 11 percent stake.</p>
