<p>A Chinese company hit by U.S. sanctions on Friday said it had had some dealings with Iran, but denied it had exported chemical weapons components to Tehran.</p>
<p>&quot;We exported some products to Iran in the past,&quot; an official of the Jiangsu Yongli Chemical Engineering and Technology Import/Export Corp said by telephone from China's eastern city of Nanjing.</p>
<p>The official declined to reveal what the exports were, but insisted that they were not related to chemical weapons.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not chemical products... We never exported chemical weapons-related material to Iran before,&quot; said the official, who declined to give his name.</p>
<p>The United States was a major export market and the company's losses would be huge as a result of the sanctions, he said but declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on Jiangsu Yongli and its parent company, Nanjing Chemical Industries Group, because it believes they transferred chemical weapons components to Iran.</p>
<p>The United States also slapped sanctions on five Chinese citizens -- Liao Minglong, Tian Yi, Chen Qingchang, Pan Yongming and Shao Xingsheng -- and a Hong Kong company, Cheong Yee Ltd.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong company remained a mystery. It is not listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange and is not found in public telephone directories.</p>
<p>Hong Kong authorities declined to comment.</p>
<p>In Washington, the U.S. State Department said there was no evidence the Chinese government was involved in the transfers, which involved chemicals and other technology that could be used in chemical weapons.</p>
<p>But there was also no evidence to suggest that the Chinese government had complied with U.S. requests for it to halt the transfers, the State Department said.</p>
<p>U.S. officials accuse the sanctioned parties of transferring to Iran glass-lined chemical processing equipment and three dual-use chemicals, thionyl chloride, diamethylamine and ethylene chlorohydrine.</p>
<p>The sanctions bar any trade between the United States and the listed parties for at least one year.</p>
<p>It marked the first time Chinese entities have been penalised under the U.S. Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, although individuals and companies in other countries have had sanctions imposed.</p>
<p>China had several times stated publicly its commitment to the Chemical Weapons Convention and its opposition to the development of chemical weapons by any other country.</p>
<p>The sanctions were imposed after U.S. President Bill Clinton announced he would renew for one year Most Favoured Nation trade benefits for China, something Beijing keenly desires but which is also drawing fire in the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>Members of Congress have been increasingly critical of the Clinton administration for pursuing improved ties with China despite concerns about Beijing's arms cooperation with Iran.</p>
<p>Congress has also been critical of China's human rights record, trade surplus and its policies towards Hong Kong amid fears that rights will be eroded after the British colony reverts to Chinese rule on July 1.</p>
