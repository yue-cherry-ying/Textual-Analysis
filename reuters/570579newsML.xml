<p>A high-ranking San Francisco police officer was found dead in his car Wednesday, police said, apparently of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>
<p>Captain Thomas Petrini, 49, was found in his vehicle in the parking lot of the police department's firing range, police said. He had just finished his shift.</p>
<p>Police spokesman Lt. David Robinson declined to give details of the shooting, saying it was under investigation. But he said: &quot;There was nothing to indicate a homicide.&quot;</p>
<p>News reports said Petrini committed suicide.</p>
<p>Petrini, a 27-year police veteran, had risen to deputy chief but was demoted to captain last year in a department reshuffle. At the time of his death, he was in charge of the staff services division.</p>
<p>Colleagues were shocked by his death.</p>
<p>Robinson said Petrini had a distinguished career and was a well-respected officer. &quot;This is a tragedy for all of us, he will be sorely missed. It's tough to lose one of our own under any circumstances, particularly in this manner.&quot;</p>
<p>Police officers said they knew of no reason why Petrini would take his own life. He was survived by a wife and two children.</p>
