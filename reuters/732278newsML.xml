<p>More than 80,000 children under six in North Korea are severely malnourished and some have already died of starvation, an aid worker said on Wednesday, warning of widespread famine in the hermit state.</p>
<p>&quot;They all admit that children are dying of hunger,&quot; Kathi Zellweger, director of international cooperation for the Hong Kong branch of the international aid agency Caritas, said in an interview after visiting the Stalinist state.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a marked deterioration since my last visit in April,&quot; she said, when she warned that the country was sliding into famine. &quot;The situation is getting very serious. It is alarming.&quot;</p>
<p>Grain warehouses were empty, hospitals did not have enough food to feed patients and children and the elderly were the most vulnerable to malnutrition.</p>
<p>No food was being distributed unless a shipment of international aid arrived and the shortages had forced the government to abandon its system of rations twice a month.</p>
<p>In western Anbyon county, one official said the government had ordered people to drag out distribution of food for as long as possible because they could not guarantee when the next supplies would arrive, Zellweger said.</p>
<p>She described state nurseries in which thin and listless children with hollow cheeks and lifeless eyes stared at visitors, some toddlers were too weak even to stand.</p>
<p>&quot;These are pictures like I'm used to seeing from Africa but not from Asia,&quot; she said. &quot;We saw children where I knew if no help is forthcoming in the next few weeks, those children will not survive.&quot;</p>
<p>Of the 2.6 million children in North Korea, the government described 80,000 as severely malnourished. That was more than double the estimated number last April, she said.</p>
<p>A further 200,000 were moderately malnourished and 520,000 were slightly undernourished.</p>
<p>In Anbyon county, one to two children were dying each month in each of the county's 35 nurseries, officials told Zellweger.</p>
<p>A similar toll was suffered in other regions, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen children where I think if no help is coming forward within the next few weeks then we will lose these children,&quot; Zellweger said.</p>
<p>A day earlier, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) warned in Rome that North Korea's harvests in late October would still not yield enough grain to lift the threat of famine.</p>
<p>Although North Korea was unlikely to suffer devastating floods such as those in 1995-96 that left the country sliding into starvation, the next harvest in October would fall well short of self-sufficiency levels, the FAO said.</p>
<p>Zellweger said North Korea now feared that drought this year could damage the crops, with summer rains already late.</p>
<p>&quot;They are eating whatever they think is edible,&quot; she said, describing watery soups and noodles made of powdered grass mixed with a little flour.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel if the situation continues in the way it goes now, people will be too weak to harvest,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>International aid agencies were estimating a food deficit of 800,000 tonnes up to the end of the harvest, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is impossible that such an amount will go in,&quot; Zellweger said. &quot;It is clear that the next three months are going to be crucial.&quot;</p>
<p>People were growing food on every patch of soil, she said.</p>
<p>She described food growing on balconies of apartment blocks and along railway tracks. &quot;People are not sitting back waiting for help, they are struggling to make the best out of a difficult situation.&quot;</p>
<p>The World Food Programme (WFP) said on Tuesday it had received around 75 percent of the $45.7 million aid it asked for last week and WFP director Catherine Bertini said severe malnutrition was on the rise in North Korea.</p>
