<headline>UK's Thatcher says Labour is &quot;boneless wonder&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher joined the May 1 election campaign on Tuesday with a scathing attack on the &quot;boneless wonder&quot; of the revamped opposition Labour Party.</p>
<p>Thatcher, who has in the past expressed admiration for Labour leader Tony Blair, said there was no parallel between her achievements as leader of the Conservative Party and what Blair had done to revolutionise Labour.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole of Mr Blair's strategy in creating the boneless wonder that calls itself New Labour is to reassure the electorate in its illusion. But illusion it remains,&quot; she wrote in the Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p>The hard-hitting article was Thatcher's first contribution to the election, in which the Conservatives are tipped by opinion polls to be swept out of office after 18 years in power.</p>
<p>Her intervention will be a boost for Prime Minister John Major, who has often been criticised by Thatcher and who is struggling to get his message across against a background of financial and sexual scandals surrounding several Conservative MPs.</p>
<p>Thatcher, prime minister for 11 years until she was ousted by her own party in 1990, said Labour had turned its back on its beliefs and adapted its policies to the requirements of pundits and pollsters.</p>
<p>&quot;Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery...But imitations are still fakes,&quot; she wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;It is what drives a man -- or woman -- that decides how he or she will react in the turbulent and perilous tasks of national leadership,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>&quot;That is why the alleged parallel between what Mr Blair has done for the Labour Party and what I and others of like mind did for the Conservative Party is false,&quot; she added.</p>
