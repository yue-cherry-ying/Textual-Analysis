<p>The dollar ended a volatile week on a quiet note Friday, closing lower against other major currencies in thin, pre-holiday trading, dealers said.</p>
<p>A looming three-day holiday weekend in the two largest foreign exchange markets -- the United States and Britain -- and an early Friday close in most U.S. asset and derivative markets subdued trading volume and activity, dealers said.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to 115.65 yen by the close from 116.13 on Thursday and fell to 1.6930 marks from 1.6945.</p>
<p>Stealing the spotlight was a sudden overnight drop in the Australian dollar, which shed over a full cent on news of an unexpected cut in official Australian interest rates.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia surprised the markets by chopping 0.5 percentage point off the official cash rate, the fourth cut since last July, pushing the rate to 5.5 percent -- its lowest since August 1994.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar closed at $0.7670, down from $0.7775 at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>The dollar showed little reaction to remarks overnight from Japanese Ministry of Finance official Eisuke Sakakibara, who was interviewed by French newspaper Le Monde.</p>
<p>Sakakibara said that a rise in Japan's discount rate should be expected by the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;The discount rate is currently very low. If it rises by 0.5 percent, it will be at 1.0 percent, which remains low. A move on such a scale should be expected in the coming year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He also noted, however, that he did not believe the Bank of Japan would raise rates before it was sure of a solid economic upturn.</p>
<p>Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp., agreed with Sakakibara and said he expects official Japanese interest rates to be hiked sometime this summer.</p>
<p>&quot;Economic growth is clearly gaining some momentum. Economic conditions are better than a lot of people realise in Japan right now and that should lead to higher interest rates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The first round of French parliamentary elections take place this weekend. Analysts said victory for the ruling centre-right coalition -- the expected outcome -- would bolster the dollar against the mark as the French franc should respond favourably. But a left-wing win could hurt the U.S. unit as dealers buy marks.</p>
<p>&quot;With the French elections this weekend, there is some anticipation that there may be a risk that the Socialists will get in. People have bought short-dated options that give them the right to own marks,&quot; said Russell LaScala, chief dealer at Citibank.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a good risk-reward, low premium, high return option,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the dollar fell to 1.4033 Swiss francs from 1.4150 francs and the British pound recovered from Thursday's sell-off to end higher at $1.6347 from $1.6240.</p>
<p>The dollar gained to Canadian $1.3747 from C$1.3733.</p>
