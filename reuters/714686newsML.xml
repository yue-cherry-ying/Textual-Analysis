<p>Three demolition workers were taken to hospital and nearby buildings were evacuated after an explosion and fire at a building site in central Sydney on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Fire brigade officials initially feared a gas main had been ruptured, but said later the workers had broken an underground fuel storage tank in the building's basement.</p>
<p>Firefighters pumped high-pressure foam into the basement to control the blaze, and said there was no danger of a further explosion.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to be under control. They are still pumping foam ito the basement,&quot; a fire brigade spokesman said.</p>
<p>An ambulance official said the three workers suffered burns to their face and hands, and one suffered airway burns after breathing in hot fumes from the explosion.</p>
