<p>The White House on Tuesday refused to help resolve issues delaying a tobacco settlement, saying it was up to the parties to reach a deal in their multi-billion dollar legal battle.</p>
<p>&quot;Broadly stating, they know exactly what our position is on fundamental issues related to protecting kids from tobacco use. I don't think there's any question that they know that they've got to meet that test,&quot; White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.</p>
<p>Talks between tobacco industry representatives and state attorneys general who are suing the industry to recoup the costs of treating diseases allegedly caused by smoking have been going on since early April.</p>
<p>Sources said Monday that some negotiators hoped to have a proposed settlement to the White House as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday. But McCurry said the parties still seemed at odds on &quot;issues related to liability and damage payments.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't resolve those issues for them,&quot; McCurry said. &quot;We can't render any kind of final verdict on a settlement until we see it.&quot;</p>
<p>Deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsey, who is perhaps President Clinton's closest aide, has been monitoring the tobacco talks. Two key negotiators, Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore and plaintiffs lawyer Dick Scruggs, met with White House staff Monday afternoon to provide an update on progress.</p>
