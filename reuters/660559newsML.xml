<p>The head of the Lamb of God religious cult was sentenced on Thursday to 45 years in prison for ordering the murders of three former sect members who were shot to death in Texas in 1988.</p>
<p>Aaron LeBaron, 28, who became the sect's high priest after his father's death, was convicted in February on murder-for-hire, racketeering and civil rights charges in the orchestration of nearly simultaneous murders of the defectors in Houston and Dallas.</p>
<p>&quot;His father created a monster called the Church of the Lamb of God, but Aaron LeBaron gave that monster direction,&quot; Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Shelby said after the sentence was handed down in a Houston federal court.</p>
<p>In a &quot;blood atonement&quot; for leaving the cult, Mark Chynoweth and his brother Duane Chynoweth were shot to death in Houston, and Edward Marston was killed in Dallas.</p>
<p>Lamb of God members, following teachings that founder Ervil LeBaron laid out in a 510-page creed, believed anyone leaving the cult had to be killed before believers could inherit God's kingdom on Earth.</p>
<p>Aaron LeBaron was captured last year near the cult's colony in northern Mexico. Prosecutors are still searching for his half-sister Tarsa LeBaron, the final family member alleged to have participated in the murders who is still at large.</p>
