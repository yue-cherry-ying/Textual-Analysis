<p>Russia should continue to subsidise the agricultural sector, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Thursday while on a tour of one of Russia's top grain-growing regions in southern Russia.</p>
<p>He said the sector, still cash-starved and struggling to raise enough credits, should receive as much budget money next year as this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Our task is not to reduce 1997 levels (of financing the agricultural sector),&quot; he was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying.</p>
<p>The government has tried to reduce farmers' dependence on Soviet-era state handouts, sharply reducing the level of cheap credits it was prepared to advance and encouraging farmers to work with commercial banks instead.</p>
<p>Just 2.7 trillion roubles ($465 million) were budgeted for the farm sector in 1997, a tiny fraction of the 16.1 trillion originally budgeted before the total was slashed.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin said a draft tax code for 1998 would not wholly favour the development of agriculture.</p>
<p>&quot;He said that this question in particular was discussed during his recent meeting with President Boris Yeltsin,&quot; Interfax reported.</p>
<p>Russia is overhauling its cumbersome tax structure, and the lower house of parliament State Duma began looking at the draft before the summer recess started.</p>
<p>&quot;This problem must be solved during discussions on a tax code,&quot; Chernomyrdin said.</p>
<p>He said this year's grain harvest would be higher than in 1996, although not everything was going smoothly because the weather was not helping farmers gather the crops.</p>
<p>Late rains in key growing regions to the south of Russia have slowed the progress of the campaign, industry officials have said.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun forecast the 1997 net grain harvest at 80 million tonnes earlier this week, from 69.3 million in 1996.</p>
