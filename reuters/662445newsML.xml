<p>- Sen. Dale Bumpers, an Arkansas Democrat who is a friend and political ally of President Clinton, said Saturday he would not seek election to a fifth term.</p>
<p>&quot;I confess to an agonizing ambivalence about the decision and will probably suffer the torment of that ambivalence for the rest of my life. But intellectually it's right for me,&quot; Bumpers said, his voice cracking with emotion.</p>
<p>Bumpers said he was frustrated by his inability to influence legislation as a member of the minority party in the Senate and with bills being motivated by politics.</p>
<p>&quot;Many bills are crafted to achieve maximum political benefit and little else,&quot; he complained.</p>
<p>Clinton said Saturday he had talked to Bumpers &quot;several times&quot; about his decision.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm personally disappointed, but I understand,&quot; Clinton told reporters in San Diego.</p>
<p>In a written statement, the president praised Bumpers and said he would be missed.</p>
<p>&quot;I have known and admired Dale Bumpers for over 25 years. He was a great governor and he has been a great senator for the people of our native state and the entire nation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will miss his courage to stand against the tide, his vision and his eloquence. Hillary and I wish him and Betty all the best. We will miss him. So will the Senate. So will America,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>Bumpers was a strong favourite to win re-election despite its drift toward Republican candidates in recent years.</p>
<p>Immediate speculation regarding potential candidates for his Senate seat centred on Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Republican who unsuccessfully challenged Bumpers in 1992, and state Sen. Fay Boozman, another Republican.</p>
<p>Potential Democratic candidates include Arkansas Attorney General Winston Bryant and state Sen. Mike Beebe.</p>
<p>Bumpers was a political unknown in 1970 when he unseated Republican Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller. Four years later he defeated veteran Sen. J. William Fulbright in a Democratic primary and easily won election to the first of his four terms in the Senate.</p>
<p>Bumpers is regarded as a liberal in an increasingly conservative South. He consistently voted in favour of abortion rights and last month opposed legislation to prohibit partial birth abortions. He has also spoken against a constitutional amendment to make burning the U.S. flag illegal.</p>
<p>But Bumpers is considered a fiscal conservative. He frequently opposed large government spending programmes while criticising tax cuts he says will mainly benefit the wealthy. He has long opposed an amendment to balance the budget.</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Kerrey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, paid tribute to Bumpers as &quot;a champion for America's working families.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dale Bumpers has served as a fearless leader of the Democratic Party in times of peril and in times of triumph,&quot; Kerrey said. &quot;He reminds us that we are elected to uplift the family by protecting jobs, keeping streets safe, giving our kids a quality education and providing affordable health care.&quot;</p>
<p>Kerrey said he fully expected the seat vacated by Bumpers to remain in the Democratic column.</p>
