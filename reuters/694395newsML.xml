<p>Despondent after four months of raging violence, Albanians are pinning their hopes for the future of their impoverished Balkan country on help from the West.</p>
<p>Living in constant fear of the armed gangs that roam the south of the country, people in this coastal town have all but lost hope that Sunday's election will end their troubles unless Western nations back them with soldiers and money.</p>
<p>&quot;Only Europe can help us, by supporting a fairly elected government and then sending economic help,&quot; said Thoma Lula, a young waiter. &quot;Good politics are in the stomach.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarande's residents live in fear and its economy lies in tatters since the outbreak in March of a revolt prompted by the collapse of shady pyramid investment schemes.</p>
<p>President Sali Berisha, who is campaigning hard to keep his Democratic Party's large parliamentary majority, was forced to call the snap election after penniless investors looted army weapons stores and plunged Europe's poorest country into anarchy.</p>
<p>Locals say the 7,000-strong Italian-led multinational force, hurriedly assembled and dispatched in April to help secure a fair election, is too little, too late.</p>
<p>Italian and Romanian troops stationed in Gjirokaster, 60 km (40 miles) inland, drive through Sarande in their armoured vehicles only when escorting election monitors.</p>
<p>&quot;This is one of the main rebel towns in the south. Why wasn't a foreign force stationed here?&quot; asked Telemak Llacana, the official in charge of the nearby Butrint archeological site and amphitheatre.</p>
<p>He said that only the presence of foreign soldiers and observers at every polling station would secure a fair election. Monitors from the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) say that is impossible.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be touring all electoral centres but there are not enough people to monitor the vote all day long,&quot; OSCE monitor Michael Klinger told Reuters.</p>
<p>Last year's national election was criticised by international monitors for fraud and intimidation, but Berisha continued to ignore pressure by Western nations to repeat the poll.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did they continue to support his corrupt government after they saw how he rigged the election,&quot; Llachana asked. &quot;They are to blame for supporting Berisha, the man who destroyed our country.&quot;</p>
<p>His view echoed that of many Albanians who attribute the desolation of their largely agricultural country to recent governments and foreign powers rather than 45 years of isolation imposed by Stalinist dictator Enver Hoxha.</p>
<p>Berisha, a darling of the West in the early 1990s for his fledgling market economy reforms, is largely blamed by southern Albanians for the crash of the pyramids, which swallowed up their money and hopes for prosperity.</p>
<p>After the violence erupted in March, the economy came to a halt. Shops and banks have been raided and boarded up and factories and farms deserted.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard that there will be a Marshall Plan for Albania -- this would be good,&quot; Lula said, referring to the U.S.-backed aid programme to get Western Europe back on its feet after World War Two.</p>
<p>&quot;Europe should help restore peace after the election. I understand that they don't want to die for Albania but at least they could send us experts to train us in police work.&quot;</p>
