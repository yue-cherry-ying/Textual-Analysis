<p>The Australian dollar finished Friday out of favour and at three month lows after the Reserve Bank sprang a surprise rate cut on the market.</p>
<p>The 0.5 point cut took the official cash rate to a 34-month low at 5.5 percent which, incidentally, exactly matched the U.S. Fed funds rate. The sudden removal of the dollar's rate prop saw it sink a cent from the opening and, although it found some support around US$0.7670, dealers feared worse to come.</p>
<p>&quot;Yields are everything and now for the first time since the dollar was floated (in 1983) you don't get any money for holding the AUD,&quot; said Andrew McGill, a trader at Chase Australia.  </p>
<p>By 5.00 pm (0700 GMT) the dollar was nursing a grudge at US$0.7680/85, its lowest level since mid-February, having fled from the US$0.7770/75 held ahead of the RBA's announcement.</p>
<p>It had already tumbled from US$0.7830/35 overnight on press reports the RBA was considering an easing following domestic wages data released on Thursday.</p>
<p>Indeed, the bank justified its move on exactly that point, saying its assessment was the current pace of growth of labour costs had shown sufficient moderation over the medium term to permit a further easing of policy. Much of the market, however, had not thought the data so decisive and were unprepared.  </p>
<p>&quot;We made the mistake of listening to the RBA,&quot; said one aggrieved dealer. &quot;Only a couple of weeks ago the bank was saying there was no economic benefit in a cut. Now we get one, inconclusive, wage figure and bang goes our yield buffer.&quot;</p>
<p>The final figures on March quarter wages released Thursday showed annual average weekly earnings growth revised to 4.3 percent from 4.6 percent, putting it back below the bank's danger zone of 4.5-5.0 percent.</p>
<p>Others thought the cut well justified given Australia's low inflation and high unemployment rate which showed the economy had plenty of scope to grow faster without risking prices.  </p>
<p>&quot;Like the U.S. we're engaged in a learning experience about growth and inflation these days,&quot; said Bruce Freeland, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank. &quot;But it's clear the economy can grow above potential for some time without danger.&quot;</p>
<p>That should be a comfort to bond investors, and thus the dollar, over time but to the average forex speculator a day was eternity and short term differentials meant everyting.</p>
<p>&quot;For the first time in 13 or 14 years short term rates are down at the same level as those in the U.S. and the relative risk/reward of investing in Australia has probably diminished somewhat,&quot; said Citibank chief economist Stephen Koukoulas.  </p>
<p>Indeed, since a U.S. hike has been priced in for some time, Australian market rates out to two years were already beneath comparable U.S. rates. That in turn saw rates on forward A$ contracts hit highs not seen in a decade.</p>
<p>On the futures market the September 90-day bank bill contract soared 40 basis points to 94.42, implying a rate of 5.57 percent. In contrast the SIMEX three month Euro-dollar contract was at 93.95, implying the market expected U.S. rates to rise to around 6.05 percent by September.</p>
<p>&quot;If U.S. rates rise we'll be in uncharted territory and some sort of A$ weakness has to be likely,&quot; said CBA's Freeland.</p>
