<p>PepsiCo International has applied for the voluntary liquidation of local bottler New Age Beverages (NAB), just three years after it made a high-profile return to South Africa, Business Report said on Friday.</p>
<p>The liquidation application was confirmed on Thursday by Pule Pule, NAB's corporate and public affiars manager, the paper said.</p>
<p>PepsiCo holds 25 percent of the shares and local black business owns eight percent. The rest is held by African-American investors.</p>
<p>Pule said the company had been experiencing a severe financial crisis for a long time and had asked its African-American investors to pump in more money, to which they had agreed.</p>
<p>But, as a part of the agreement, the investors required that other shareholders be involved.</p>
<p>Standard Bank Investment Corp Ltd was approached for a loan of 300 million rand by tHe African-American investors, but it required a guarantee.</p>
<p>PepsiCo declined to provide this, the paper said.</p>
<p>Pule said the differences betweeen the bank and PepsiCo had cost them the company. He said PepsiCo's decision not to provide surety came as a shock.</p>
<p>In the absence of any further help from either PepsiCo or the African-American investors, the &quot;company had decided to close shop,&quot; Pule said.</p>
