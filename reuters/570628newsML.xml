<p>Italy's long suffering small shareholders lost out once again this week in a complex deal linking the nation's largest quoted retailer Rinascente and France's Auchan, analysts and traders said.</p>
<p>In the complex deal unveiled on Tuesday, the Agnelli family company IFIL will place its 40.5 percent Rinascente stake into a joint IFIL-Auchan company, while privately-owned Auchan will pay one trillion lire for a share in the new group which will be 51 percent IFIL owned and 49 percent by Auchan.</p>
<p>&quot;Legally the deal is watertight as control of Rinascente has not changed hands, but the minority shareholders have no control over the situation,&quot; said one Milan-based analyst.</p>
<p>Minority shareholders watched helplessly as the deal agreed on Tuesday knocked around ten percent from the stock.</p>
<p>The Franco-Italian link-up has commercial sense but the minority shareholders in Rinascente will stump up the bill in the shape of a 780 billion lire ($460 million) capital increase, while Auchan has no need to make an offer to buy their shares.</p>
<p>Rinascente will buy Auchan's Italian retail and property assets for 530 billion lire and launch the capital increase in shares and bonds for 780 billion lire to pay for the purchase.</p>
<p>The deal will cost Auchan a net 470 billion lire to massively increase its presence in Italy, while for Rinascente it will bring in a European partner with great expertise to help improve its lacklustre trading performance, analysts said.</p>
<p>Rinascente shares suspended on Tuesday ahead of the deal, fell 8.25 percent on Wednesday and were off 1.93 percent at 8,420 lire by 1330 GMT, while IFIL shares faired better rising Tuesday and Wednesday and were largely in line with the Milan stock market on Thursday, off 1.11 percent at 5,145 lire.</p>
<p>With IFIL still controlling the new company with 51 percent, Italian stock market authority Consob ruled there was no need for Auchan to launch a bid for Rinascente. For IFIL, the attraction of the deal is that it could mean exchanging a poorly performing Italian investment for a European investment.</p>
<p>&quot;Operationally the deal makes a lot of sense, especially linking both group's DIY operations where the sector is showing good growth in Italy,&quot; said Italian equity analyst Marie-Christine Keith at HSBC James Capel in London.</p>
<p>Analysts said Rinascente is essentially an Italian operation with experience in clothing and non-food from early this century, but it has quickly moved into food, and they say here its performance could be improved by Auchan's expertise.</p>
<p>The deal brings together Auchan's four Italian commercial centres with Rinascente's 25 centres in Italy -- these centres often contain a hypermarket and a home improvement store -- and combined sales should almost reach nine trillion lire in 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Auchan gets a big lift in Italy. IFIL puts its investment in safe hands, but the Rinascente's small shareholders will pay for this,&quot; said another Milan-based analyst.</p>
<p>Italy's small shareholders have had a tough time in recent year from many complex deals ignoring their interests such as the now-failed SuperGemina deal in late 1995 which planned to link Gemina, the old Ferruzzi Finanziaria empire and some Fiat controlled companies without consulting the small shareholders.</p>
<p>&quot;This new deal is very much a typical Italian job with the big players in Italy dictating the terms, and the small shareholders following,&quot; said one share dealer in Milan.</p>
<p>The influencial Milan merchant bank Mediobanca was advising IFIL on the deal, while IFIL's major investment remains its stake in industrial group Fiat. ($1=1,692 lire)</p>
