<p>Two Palestinians died in explosions in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday in what the Israeli army called separate suicide attacks aimed at killing Jews.</p>
<p>Palestinian police could not confirm whether the two men had blown themselves up deliberately.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas denied it was behind the explosions and accused Israel of ordering the blasts to sour relations between Hamas and Yasser Arafat's self-rule Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>Five Palestinians in a taxi were wounded in one of the blasts.</p>
<p>The body parts of the presumed bomber were scattered over the road.</p>
<p>&quot;There were two suicide bombers,&quot; said an Israeli army spokesman. &quot;There were no injuries to Israeli forces. There are a number of Palestinian injuries.&quot;</p>
<p>Israeli military sources said one of the dead men wore a suicide bomb belt, and the other wore the uniform of the Palestinian police.</p>
<p>A senior Palestinian security official said police were trying to identify the dead men in an attempt to &quot;clear the ambiguities&quot; surrounding their deaths.</p>
<p>Earlier, other Palestinian police officials had said that a man with five kg (11 lb) of explosives on his back blew himself up on the side of the road at 7 a.m. about two km (1.5 miles) from the Jewish settlement of Netzarim south of Gaza City.</p>
<p>&quot;We doubt that they were suicide bombings and we are checking the two explosions. No Israelis were in the area and there are no holes in the ground,&quot; Gaza police commander, Major-General Abdel-Razik Majaida, said.</p>
<p>In the second blast about two km (1.5 miles) from Kfar Darom near the Palestinian refugee camp of Deir al-Balah, the presumed bomber was also standing beside the road, Palestinian police said, adding the five Palestinians were wounded in this explosion.</p>
<p>In the past both Jewish settlements have been the focus of Palestinian attacks.</p>
<p>Hamas official Sayed Abu Musameh blamed Israel for the blasts.</p>
<p>&quot;This bombing was done by the Israeli intelligence and its (Palestinian) collaborators in an attempt to create an internal problem between the Islamic movement and the Palestinian Authority,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Last month Hamas claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv in which three Israeli women were killed.</p>
<p>In a separate incident on Tuesday, Israeli police said a Palestinian ran into a policeman with his car at an Israeli roadblock near the West Bank Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba. They said the policeman opened fire, wounding a passenger. Palestinians said he later died. Clashes erupted nearby.</p>
<p>Israeli-Palestinian relations have plunged into crisis since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu broke ground on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem last month. Israeli soldiers have clashed for 13 straight days with stone-throwing Palestinian protesters in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Both explosions occurred at about the time Israeli children leave the two nearby Jewish settlements on buses for school, Jewish settlers said.</p>
<p>There was no explanation why the two explosions occurred when they did, far from any Israeli soldiers or civilians.</p>
<p>Israeli radio stations suggested that two suicide bombers had mistakenly blown themselves up before their intended time.</p>
<p>Jewish settlers in the area said a PLO police outpost near the Netzarim explosion was unmanned at the time of the blast.</p>
<p>They claimed this showed there was collusion between the Palestinian Authority and the planners of the explosion.</p>
