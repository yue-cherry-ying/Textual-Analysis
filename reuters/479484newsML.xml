<p>India, fresh from upbeat peace talks with Pakistan, said on Tuesday it must resolve a domestic political crisis before resuming substantive negotiations with Islamabad.</p>
<p>A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the two nations' foreign ministers would meet during or after a ministerial conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) next week in New Delhi.</p>
<p>But the diplomats will not attempt to press ahead with peace talks which resumed last week after a three-year standoff.</p>
<p>The four days of talks in New Delhi ended on Monday with a pledge by the two neighbours' foreign secretaries to meet again in Islamabad.</p>
<p>The two sides, which have fought three wars since independence in 1947, released a joint statement saying the talks had been &quot;frank, cordial and constructive&quot;.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry spokesman said the foundation had been set for more progress. &quot;Given the atmosphere, there is sufficient ground for further substantive discussions at whatever level in the near future,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Foreign policy analysts said the outcome of the latest talks was encouraging but the diplomats had been unable to set dates for a subsequent meeting partly because of political uncertainty surrounding Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's government.</p>
<p>&quot;It is better that this hiatus be put behind us before substantive discussions take place,&quot; the Foreign Ministry spokesman said. &quot;Let us put this political crisis behind us.&quot;</p>
<p>Deve Gowda on Sunday lost the pivotal support of the Congress party in parliament and must call a vote of confidence by April 11.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral will meet his Pakistani counterpart, Gohar Ayub Khan, in the Indian capital next week, but the focus of their discussion will be on the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), the spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a tete-a-tete, and exchange of views,&quot; he said. &quot;The main focus will still be on NAM.&quot;</p>
<p>Foreign ministers from more than 100 nations which are members of the NAM are scheduled to meet on April 7-8.</p>
<p>Gujral has invited Khan to remain in New Delhi for two days after the NAM meeting, but the Pakistani foreign minister has not yet responded to the invitation, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Radio Pakistan quoted Khan on Tuesday as saying his proposed meeting with Gujral might be postponed because of the political crisis in India.</p>
<p>The radio quoted him as saying Sharma's decision to ask Deve Gowda to call a vote of confidence &quot;might cause some deadlock in the talks&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not surprising that he would take this view,&quot; the Indian Foreign Ministry official said.</p>
<p>On Monday President Shankar Dayal Sharma asked Deve Gowda to prove his majority in the lower house of parliament by April 7.</p>
<p>But after the prime minister pointed out that his government would be hosting NAM foreign ministers that day, the president extended the deadline to April 11.</p>
