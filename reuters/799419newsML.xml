<p>Scientists at the U.S. National Institutes of Health announced on Thursday they had discovered a new gene linked to the growth of some breast cancers.</p>
<p>The gene appeared to be present in abnormally high levels in the tumor cells of most breast cancer patients, they reported in Science magazine.</p>
<p>&quot;We think this gene is probably part of the engine that drives the growth of some breast cancers and we're trying to understand how that works,&quot; Dr. Jeffrey Trent wrote.</p>
<p>Together with colleagues at NIH's National Human Genome Research Institute, Trent found the gene, which they call A1B1 (amplified in breast cancer-1) by searching the long arm of chromosome 20 for genes which were elevated in breast cancer.</p>
<p>&quot;We suspect that this one is a particularly important part of the wiring system in the breast cancer cell that transmits the signal from steroids like estrogen that says 'grow,'&quot; they said.</p>
<p>Although the finding is too new to have an immediate impact on breast cancer therapies, the scientists said they expected further study of the gene to help reveal the biology of tumor cells, especially those responsive to steroid hormones.</p>
<p>This group of diseases includes not just breast and ovarian cancer, but prostate cancer as well.</p>
