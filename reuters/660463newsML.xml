<headline>Committees let states contract out welfare programs.</headline>

<p>House committees moved Thursday to let states hire private firms to administer food stamp and Medicaid programmes for the poor, overturning White House policy.</p>
<p>As part of legislation to implement a five-year balanced budget deal, the House Agriculture and Commerce Committees voted to give states new authority to contract out what has been a government function.</p>
<p>Further, Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee, in draft budget legislation to be unveiled Friday, suggest a 10-state pilot programme to test the concept. The bill, which is subject to change, would also approve a pending Texas project.</p>
<p>Texas officials want to hire a private company to administer many social programmes in an effort to cut costs and consolidate services as they reform their welfare system.</p>
<p>The White House rejected the state's plan to contract out Food Stamps and Medicaid because they were not included in a new welfare law. Texas officials charge the administration acted at the behest of government employee unions, worried about job layoffs.</p>
<p>The Commerce Committee voted 27-20 to let states hire companies to determine eligibility for Medicaid benefits.</p>
<p>Many Democrats on the panel voted against the proposal, calling it a major change in the programme that provides health care for poor, elderly and disabled Americans.</p>
<p>&quot;Private companies are accountable to their shareholders ... not the taxpayers. I have some concern about someone making a determination for eligibility who may be getting a (financial) benefit for disqualifying&quot; prople, said Gene Green, a Texas Democrat.</p>
<p>Wisconsin Republican Scott Klug argued his state could save at least 20 percent by using private firms. States and the federal government would still set programme rules.</p>
<p>The agriculture panel voted 24-19 to let private firms administer part of the food stamp programme. The provision was part of a larger bill allocating $1.5 billion for job training for Food Stamp recipients and exempting some able-bodied individuals from tough new limits on aid.</p>
<p>Food stamps are the major U.S. anti-hunger programme, helping more than 20 million poor people a month buy groceries.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had absolute, total opposition to do anything&quot; from the White House, said Representative Charles Stenholm, Texas Democrat, in explaining why congressional action was sought.</p>
<p>In a related move, the draft Finance Committee bill does not include all the protections for disabled legal immigrants called for under the budget deal, although it goes farther than a House-drafted measure.</p>
<p>A landmark welfare law signed last year ends federal benefits to most legal immigrants this summer. President Clinton won concessions in the budget pact to &quot;fix&quot; the law.</p>
<p>Under the budget plan, legal immigrants in the United States by Aug. 22, 1996, who were either on the rolls because of disability or became disabled in the future could receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid.</p>
<p>Immigrants receiving SSI benefits because they were elderly and impoverished would have been cut off.</p>
<p>Under the Finance plan all legal immigrants -- including the elderly poor -- receiving SSI on Aug. 22, 1996, could continue to get aid. Some, but not all, legal immigrants in the country on that date, but not on the rolls, would not be eligible for assistance if they became disabled in the future.</p>
<p>The House plan does not cover immigrants who become disabled in the future.</p>
