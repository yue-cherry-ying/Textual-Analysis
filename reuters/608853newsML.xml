<p>Russia's State Duma lower house of parliament voted on Friday to delay considering government plans to cut, or sequester, budgeted spending this year until the government provides further information on its its proposals to raise additional revenues.</p>
<p>Deputies voted 321 for the delay and 11 against. They also voted to drop discussion of the government's sequestration bill from Friday's agenda. The sequester was to have been presented by First Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Petrov.  </p>
<p>Duma deputies, who had proposed bills on doubling money supply and dropping the requirement on the government to propose its sequester plans to the Duma, agreed to withdraw the bills from Friday's agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;The government must submit its measures on the revenue side fo the budget,&quot; Duma Budget Committee Deputy Chairman Yuri Voronin told the house. &quot;Only after that can we reasonably look at the question,&quot; the Communist Party deputy said.</p>
<p>The bill calling for more information on the government's plans effectively puts discussion of the sequester back until at least June, as the Duma is in recess next week. Its next session is June 4. The Duma required the government to submit details of new revenues by June 1.</p>
<p>Under the current budget law the government must submit proposals on sequestering, or cutting, spending to the Duma if revenues fall below 90 percent of budgeted levels in a quarter. Revenues in the first four months of this year were only 65 percent of budgeted levels, but spending was also cut back to 70 percent of plan. The government is proposing cutting budgeted spending by 108 trillion roubles and raising budgeted revenues by 30 trillion.</p>
