<p>Zimbabwean police said they would on Friday hand over to the attorney general a docket of at least nine allegations of sexual offences said to have been committed by former president Canaan Banana.</p>
<p>Confirming a report by the official Herald newspaper that Banana faced at least nine charges of sodomy and homosexuality, both illegal in Zimbabwe, police spokesman Mario Dube told Reuters: &quot;The docket should be at the attorney general's office sometime today&quot;.</p>
<p>He declined further comment on the issue.</p>
<p>The Herald quoted acting police commissioner Philip Mhike as saying the nine allegations came from information volunteered by the people affected. Mhike was unavailable for further comment.</p>
<p>Police have been investigating Banana, 61, -- who was largely ceremonial president for seven years up to 1987 -- since February after an ex-police aide alleged in court that Banana had raped him.</p>
<p>The former aide, Jefta Dube, was sentenced in February to 10 years in jail for the 1995 fatal shooting of a fellow policeman who goaded him by calling him &quot;Banana's wife&quot;.</p>
<p>Dube told the court then that his homosexual subjugation by Banana had made him depressive and an alcoholic, and judge David Bartlett ruled that Dube had diminished responsibility.</p>
