<p>Croatia's Iva Majoli joined the select list of teenage French Open champions on Saturday as Swiss prodigy Martina Hingis dismally failed to live up to her status as the best women's player in the world.</p>
<p>The 16-year-old Swiss sensation was thrashed 6-4 6-2 by the ninth-seeded Majoli, the lowest-seeded player to win the French title in the Open era, in a bizarre final at Roland Garros which raised more questions than it answered.</p>
<p>No-one could deny that Majoli rose to the biggest occasion of her life, but the 19-year-old from Zagreb was the first to agree her opponent was barely recognisable as the player who had previously recorded 37 straight victories this year.</p>
<p>Hingis, who became the youngest grand slam champion this century when she won the Australian Open title in January, received treatment on court late in the second set when she feared cramp was about to set in.</p>
<p>She had already disappeared to the bathroom for several minutes at 3-2, but afterwards simply blamed tiredness and Majoli's determination for her below-par dispay.</p>
<p>&quot;I was tired and didn't have the concentration I usually have,&quot; she said, attempting to explain why she had allowed one of her best friends on the tour such an easy path to her first major title.</p>
<p>&quot;My running is usually my best part but today it just didn't work. It's a little frustrating to lose in the final but my career doesn't end right now.&quot;</p>
<p>Hingis eventually emerged from the locker-rooms looking pale, but won only three more points in the match as Majoli became the sixth-youngest player to win the French title and the first from Croatia.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't feel that bad, but I wasn't sick, I just felt pretty hot,&quot; Hingis revealed, adding that she was still feeling the effects of minor knee surgery which followed her horse-riding accident in April.</p>
<p>&quot;No-one appreciated what hard work it was to get here after surgery. It was a wonder that I could compete at this tournament at all. I'm going to take the next two weeks off. I've had enough tennis matches for the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>A lengthy women's doubles semifinal on Friday also took its toll, but the suspicion will linger that Hingis might have treated her opponent too lightly after beating Monica Seles in the semifinals. When Majoli began to prove her wrong, Hingis found to her horror that her own game had deserted her.</p>
<p>Majoli, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Seles other than the fact she plays right-handed, could have broken earlier than the seventh game of the first set and hit with increasing power from the baseline as she wrapped up victory in 79 minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel so normal...maybe it'll hit me tomorrow that I've won Roland Garros,&quot; laughed Majoli, who was voted the most promising player on the WTA Tour as long ago as 1993. &quot;I've always dreamt about being on the centre court and maybe winning it and today I did.</p>
<p>&quot;She didn't play her best match today but my plan was to keep her moving and concentrate on my serve. Today everything just worked and I guess God helped me a little bit.&quot;</p>
<p>Ironically, it was Majoli's health which had looked most in doubt this week as she struggled to shake off a cold which affected her in the semifinals against South African Amanda Coetzer.</p>
<p>She was less than impressed when Hingis marched off for her extended bathroom break -- &quot;I was thinking 'Does she really have to go to the bathroom now?'&quot; -- but kept her composure sufficiently to claim the winners cheque for $654,115 as well as the trophy from ex-champion Chris Evert.</p>
<p>By then, Hingis had recovered sufficiently to make a giggling speech in which she told Majoli to &quot;watch out&quot; in future.</p>
<p>&quot;I won 37 straight matches and you're the only one who's beaten me, so watch out,&quot; she said. Majoli, who will rise to fifth in the world ranking next week, jokingly apologised, but was soon planning her victory party with family and friends.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to have dinner and, after that, we're just going to send home the older ones and party on,&quot; she smiled. It could almost serve as a metaphor for the women's game where 20-year-olds are practically veterans. Hingis will surely have other chances to rejoin the winners' circle.</p>
