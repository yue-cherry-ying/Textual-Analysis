<p>Florida's Metro-Dade County government filed suit against Fiscal Operations Inc seeking to recover $24 million in unpaid debt from the company, which operates the cargo cranes at Port of Miami, Mayor Alex Penelas said.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed Monday, also seeks to recover millions of dollars of seaport revenues that were allegedly spent on luxury cars, lingerie, jewelry, Super Bowl tickets, golf tournaments and other items unrelated to the seaport.</p>
<p>The suit also seeks to end the county's contract with the firm, which runs thorugh 2002.</p>
<p>Penelas said the firm had breached its contract with the county and failed to honor its fiduciary duties.</p>
<p>&quot;Fiscal Operations has betrayed the public trust and we will make every effort to recover the $24 million that is owed to the people of Dade,&quot; Penelas said.</p>
<p>Fiscal Operations is owned by Calvin Grigsby, president and CEO of San Francisco bond firm Grigsby &amp; Associates. He could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday.</p>
<p>Grigsby is under investigation by the FBI as part of the Operation Greenpalm probe of public finance corruption in the Miami area. He has not been charged with anything and has denied wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Fiscal Operations has operated the port's cargo cranes since 1972. The $24 million it owes to the county comes from deferred rent, a 1972 loan to buy new cranes, plus interest.</p>
<p>After the Greenpalm probe came to light, the county went to court in May to force the firm to turn over its financial records. County auditors said the records showed seaport revenues were used for questionable expenses, including campaign contributions to county commisisoners and maintenance of Grigsby's yacht.</p>
<p>Grigsby said previously that the expenses were paid with revenues Fiscal Operations was entitled to keep and not with public money.</p>
<p>Publicity about the expenditures prompted the resignation of seaport Director Carmen Lunetta, who was responsible for approving the company's budget.</p>
<p>The seaport has a $22 million deficit but has borrowed money from the county general fund to keep operating. The prot has worked out a plan to repay the money to the county while undergoing a $120 million expansion.</p>
