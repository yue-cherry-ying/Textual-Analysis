<p>Russia plans to sell around one percent of national power company Unified Energy System (UES) this year to raise around 220 billion roubles ($38.4 million), a senior privatisation official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Alexander Zhigach, head of the regional coordination department in the State Property Committee, Russia's privatisation ministry, told Reuters the stake was part of a series of sell-offs planned this year.</p>
<p>An outline of privatisation plans for this year, issued by his department, calls for revenues of 1.55 trillion roubles from selling shares in RAO Yedinaya Energeticheskaya Sistema Rossii (UES).</p>
<p>But Zhigach said the sale of 8.49 percent of UES late last year had already raised 1.332 trillion roubles, which had been credited to this year's budget.</p>
<p>&quot;We will sell a small packet of shares of around one percent this year for the remaining sum,&quot; Zhigach said.</p>
<p>The state currently owns a little over 52 percent of the company, UES's director for asset management Alexander Lopatin told Reuters.</p>
<p>It must retain ownership of 51 percent until March 31, 1998.</p>
<p>The plan issued by Zhigach's department listed the following privatisation revenues to be raised this year through sales of state-owned shares by the State Property Committee and Russian Federal Property Fund:</p>
<p>					billion roubles</p>
<p>    UES (power utilities)	    1,550</p>
<p>    Rosgosstrakh (insurance)	   190</p>
<p>    Svyazinvest (telecoms)	   2,200</p>
<p>    Rosneft (oil/energy)		 700</p>
<p>    Russky Dizel (machine-building)   50</p>
<p>Total privatisation revenues this year, including sales and renting of real estate, will be 6.53 trillion roubles, it said.</p>
<p>The government previously had announced plans to sell 49 percent of Svyazinvest, 1.5-2.0 percent of UES and 50 percent of Rosgosstrakh, as well as stakes in several oil companies, this year.</p>
