<title>USA: Country music's Carl Perkins in Tennessee hospital.</title>
<headline>Country music's Carl Perkins in Tennessee hospital.</headline>
<dateline>MEMPHIS, Tenn. 1997-06-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Carl Perkins, the rockabilly legend who wrote &quot;Blue Suede Shoes,&quot; was reported in stable and satisfactory condition on Tuesday at a Memphis hospital where he is undergoing tests.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Baptist Memorial Hospital said the 65-year-old entertainer was admitted on Sunday for tests but declined to release any information beyond his condition.</p>
<p>Local broadcasters said Perkins was being examined for a blocked carotid artery. Such arteries in the neck and head supply blood to the brain and a blockage can lead to a stroke.</p>
<p>Perkins, who survived throat cancer four years ago, sold more than 2 million copies of &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; when he wrote and recorded it on the Memphis-based Sun label four decades ago. Elvis Presley recorded it later and sold millions more.</p>
<p>He was awarded the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; for the song and with Chuck Berry is considered a founder of modern rock guitar.</p>
<p>Perkins also wrote the Johnny Cash classic &quot;Daddy Sang Bass.&quot;</p>
