<p>Slovenian President Milan Kucan said on Saturday he had decided to put forward his candidacy in a presidential election due by the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;My candidacy is confirmed and it will be filed officially in the necessary time,&quot; Kucan told a news conference during a two-day meeting of eight central European heads of state on Slovenia's Adriatic coast.</p>
<p>Political analysts said Kucan looked certain to win office again in the second presidential election since Slovenia declared independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991.</p>
<p>&quot;Opinion polls show he enjoys a lot of respect and support among people and I can hardly imagine that any political party would be able to come up with a candidate that could endanger his victory,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>No other candidate has yet put in a bid for the election which must be held by December.</p>
<p>One recent opinion poll showed Kucan would receive about 56 percent support if the elections were held this month.</p>
<p>Kucan, 56, won his first five-year term by clinching an unbeatable 64 percent of the vote in the first round of elections in December 1992, beating off a challenge from seven other candidates. A second round was not needed.</p>
<p>A lawyer by profession, Kucan was elected president of the republic of Slovenia in 1990 when it was still part of federal Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The constitution allows a candidate a maximum two terms as president. Kucan has argued his presidency up to independence cannot be counted because Slovenia's new constitution came into force after he became head of state, but his political opponents may challenge the point.</p>
<p>In 1990, Kucan was quick to distance himself from his communist roots -- he had been head of the Slovenian Communist Party -- stressing the need for change and political pluralism. He left the reformed communist party in 1992 when he declared his candidacy in the first presidential election.</p>
<p>Kucan is regarded as the captain of Slovenian nationhood, winning huge respect for his calm during a 10-day war against Yugoslav federal forces in June and July 1991.</p>
<p>He has been named Slovenia's most popular politician in nearly all opinion polls in the past five years.</p>
<p>He took over as Slovenian communist chief in 1986 breaking out of an ideological strait-jacket to encourage small-scale private enterprise and an unofficial political opposition.</p>
<p>He resisted pressure from authorities in Belgrade, the army and from hardline Slovenian communists to crack down on growing criticism in student magazines and among intellectuals.</p>
<p>He is of a generation of politicians who did not ride to power on the coat-tails of the late Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, who died in 1980.</p>
