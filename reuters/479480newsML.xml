<headline>Fund buying props up Delhi shares hit by politics.</headline>
<dateline>NEW DELHI 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>Sustained buying by domestic financial institutions propped up Delhi share prices on Tuesday after a sharp decline of the previous session triggered by recent political developments, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Delhi Stock Exchange's sensitive index closed 12.27 points higher at 725.48 points. The index had dropped 7.27 percent on Monday.  </p>
<p>Monday's fall in share prices was triggered by the Congress party's decision on Sunday to withdraw its crucial support to the ruling United Front government.</p>
<p>&quot;The recovery in share prices was mostly attributed to huge purchases by state-owned financial institutions which entered the ring with a view to avert any major fall,&quot; said Vijay Aggarwal of brokers Mass Financial Services.</p>
<p>News that the government would try to ensure parliamentary approval of the 1997/98 (April-March) budget before a confidence vote in Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, due by April 11, helped to lift share prices.</p>
<p>&quot;End of settlement period at the National Stock Exchange forced speculators to square their positions and helped lift share prices,&quot; said Sanjay Mittal of brokers S.R.M. Securities.</p>
<p>The Delhi bourse closed at 4:45 p.m. (1115 GMT), one hour later than usual, to keep in line with the extended NSE trading session, officials said.</p>
<p>Trade was halted at the NSE after it developed a technical snag minutes before the close.</p>
<p>Reliance Industries rose 3.05 rupees to 261.80 on buying by domestic financial institutions, brokers said.</p>
<p>TISCO gained 2.60 rupees to 163.00 rupees.</p>
<p>Bajaj Auto edged up 14.10 rupees to 914.10.</p>
<p>TELCO increased 15.85 rupees to 358.00.</p>
<p>Larsen and Toubro climbed 7.40 rupees to 204.50 on domestic fund buying.</p>
<p>ITC quoted 5.15 rupees higher at 366.50.</p>
