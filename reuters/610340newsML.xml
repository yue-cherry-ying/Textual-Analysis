<p>The rate at which the Irish pound enters a single European currency will &quot;not necessarily&quot; be its central Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) rate of 2.41 marks, Irish Minister for Finance Ruairi Quinn said on Friday.  </p>
<p>&quot;My intention would be that Ireland would join at a rate that meets the needs of the Irish economy in the fullest sense of the word,&quot; Quinn said in the text of a speech he delivered in Dublin.</p>
<p>&quot;At the present time, clearly, the prospect of the existing central rate being used would suggest a lower rate than the market rate, but there are a lot of positions in between those two and we will be looking at all those intermediate positions to see what is in the best interests of the Irish economy.&quot;  </p>
<p>The Irish pound has come under heavy speculative attack twice in the last month because of a market conviction that it is likely to join a single currency in 1999 at its central rate of 2.41 marks, well below its current level.</p>
<p>It dropped seven pfennigs in a torrid trading session at the end of April, provoking a surprise half-point interest rate rise on May 1. On Wednesday the punt came under attack again and plunged more than four pfennigs.</p>
<p>Irish economists say an implied forward rate of 2.41 marks in January 1999 equates to a spot rate of about 2.50 marks now. At 1018 GMT, the punt was trading at 2.5650 marks.</p>
<p>&quot;No decision has been taken yet with regard to the exchange rate at which we will join,&quot; Quinn said.</p>
<p>&quot;Our exchange rate policy remains unchanged,&quot; he said. &quot;It is, as I restated back in March 1995, to ensure that the Irish pound trades comfortably within the ERM band.&quot;</p>
<p>The punt climbed to the top of the ERM grid in 1996 and has remained there ever since, at times more than 10 percent above its central rate.</p>
<p>But as the conviction has grown in the market that ERM central rates will be the eventual conversion rates for EMU and that Ireland will be part of the single currency, the punt's position has looked increasingly precarious, analysts say.</p>
