<p>American rock star Bob Dylan called off a European tour after being admitted to a hospital suffering from a potentially life-threatening disease, his publicists said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Media reports here said the 56-year-old singer/songwriter was hospitalized in New York but a spokeswoman for Dylan in New York said her office did not know where he was being treated or what his condition was.</p>
<p>&quot;This past weekend, Bob Dylan was admitted to hospital suffering from severe chest pains. His condition has been diagnosed as histoplasmosis, a potentially fatal infection which creates swelling in the sac which surrounds the heart,&quot; Dylan's London publicists said.</p>
<p>Dylan will remain in the hospital until his doctors are confident his condition has improved, they added.</p>
<p>In New York, his publicists said they hoped he would be well enough to go through with a U.S. tour slated for August.</p>
<p>The singer was due to perform in Ireland, Britain and Switzerland during the summer tour. Van Morrison, who was to appear with him in London June 7, said he would still perform.</p>
<p>Dylan recently completed a swing through Canada and the Northeast and last appeared in Los Angeles this month.</p>
<p>He released his first album in 1962 and is considered the most influential songwriter of his generation, with such classics as &quot;Blowin' in the Wind,&quot; &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin,&quot; &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues,&quot; &quot;Like a Rolling Stone,&quot; and &quot;Tangled Up in Blue.&quot;</p>
