<p>Effects of a week-long South African sugar strike on production were minimal, but if the strike went on for more than two weeks there could be problems, a sugar industry spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>About 4,000 milling and refining workers in KwaZulu-Natal province have downed tools to demand a 20 percent wage increase.</p>
<p>Illovo Sugar Ltd and Tongaat-Hulett Ltd have offered 10.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;If the strike has had any effect (on overall production) it is marginal. There are plans on management's side to make up lost production in the long crushing season that is still ahead of us,&quot; sugar industry spokesman Bheki Sibiya told Reuters.</p>
<p>He declined to give any figures for lost production or cost to the industry.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a huge issue at this stage, but if the strike goes on for longer than two weeks it could become a problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Industry sources have said about 83,500 tonnes of cane per day was being lost but they could not put a value on the figure.</p>
<p>The strike has come in the middle of the milling season which began in April and ends in December.</p>
<p>Monday's talks between five unions representing the workers and the companies were inconclusive, but representatives were &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; that Tuesday's talks would be more fruitful, Sibiya said.</p>
<p>A trade union official said on Tuesday it was essential for the talks to continue in attempts to resolve the wgae impasse.</p>
<p>&quot;We are all feeling the pinch now and it is important that we all come to the table and look at strategies to resolve this dispute,&quot; Food and Allied Workers' Union spokesman Zwile Zulu told Reuters.</p>
<p>The current season's production has been estimated at 2.5 million tons with 48 percent being exported for the 1997/98 season, rising from 44 percent in the 1996/97 period.</p>
<p>Overall exports earnings are expected to be 1,462 billion rand which was an increase of 271 million rand over last season.</p>
