<title>USA: CME lumber ends up sharply, July up limit.</title>
<headline>CME lumber ends up sharply, July up limit.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Limitless May CME lumber futures ran up for a gain of over $19 per thousand board feet before ending sharply higher while July ended up the daily $10 limit on short covering and buy stops, traders said.</p>
<p>Lumber closed $16.80 to $5.10 per tbf higher with May up most at $399.50 and July up limit at $394.50 per tbf.</p>
<p>Reports of increased cash lumber trade prompted short covering support from the start and lack of selling during late morning resulted in prices running up sharply. Buy stops stops added to general commission house and local buying, traders said.</p>
<p>The market also appeared oversold after recent losses and turned technically up on the rally, they said.</p>
<p>However, cash sources noted that there was no confirmation of higher sales in the cash market. This was also noted by options traders who cited no synthetic in July despite the limit gain in futures. This could indicate that the market was uncertain if cash was actually trading any higher, they said.</p>
<p>Rolling of long May contracts into July provided early strength in July before prices ran up in both months. One trader also said there was talk of labor unrest in Canada, but nobody in the pit knew where the rumor started.</p>
