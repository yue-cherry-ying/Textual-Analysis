<p>Last week's budget deal was muddied on Thursday by confusion over tax cut provisions, as Republicans and Democrats resorted to quibbling over what the agreement had actually included.</p>
<p>House budget and tax leaders cast doubt upon whether the pact had specified $35 billion in education tax credits over five years sought by President Bill Clinton for college tuition.</p>
<p>A House Budget Committee paper aimed at clearing up misconceptions about the May 2 agreement said: &quot;The plan makes no commitment to a specific $35 billion for education initiatives.&quot;</p>
<p>The budget agreement provided for a gross $135 billion tax cut over five years offset by $50 billion in tax increases for a net tax cut of $85 billion over five years.</p>
<p>House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer stirred the uncertainty further by saying in a CNN interview: &quot;I really am not sure what they agreed to ... in all of the written material that we've been given by our leadership it does not specify a $35 billion amount.&quot;</p>
<p>That sparked fury among Democrat leaders, who viewed the comments as reneging on an agreement that had taken many weeks of delicate negotiations to work out.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the problem we've got is that the other side is trying to rewrite and change what our negotiators thought was agreed to and they're putting the rush on the product,&quot; House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri said.</p>
<p>Archer, a Texas Republican, asked later about the education tax credit confusion, said: &quot;What, if anything, occurred, occurred in a conversation with our leaders and the president. I don't know what it was.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;I intend to get as much education tax relief as I can in the tax bill.&quot;</p>
<p>House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi had agreed to the education tax credit in a telephone conversation with the White House last week, Gingrich's spokeswoman Christina Martin said. Republican leaders agreed to include Clinton's education tax credits in tax legislation to a level as close to $35 billion as possible, she said.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin came to Capitol Hill to talk about the tax issues, but would not comment on the dispute.</p>
<p>A House Democratic aide said Rubin told lawmakers the administration was surprised by Archer's comments and was trying to &quot;get back on track&quot; to what the administration thought were firm commitments in the budget deal.</p>
<p>Democrats also attacked the effective date set by the Republican chairmen of the tax-writing committees for any capital gains tax cut.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said the May 7 proposed date had not been part of the budget agreement reached last week and that it was too early to tell whether that would be the date in the final tax cut bill.</p>
<p>&quot;I am concerned with some of these pronouncements by the chairs of the Finance and Ways and Means Committees that they have already determined that much of the tax legislation is going to be retroactive. That certainly wasn't in the (budget) agreement,&quot; Daschle said.</p>
<p>Archer said it would be disruptive to financial markets if investors believed the date could be changed. Asked in a CNBC television interview if the date was firm, Archer said, &quot;I think people can rely on it.&quot;</p>
