<p>British supermodel Naomi Campbell was admitted to hospital in the Canary Islands on Sunday after taking what a hospital official described as a drug overdose.</p>
<p>But the 26-year-old model's lawyers denied Campbell had overdosed and insisted she had been rushed to hospital after an allergic reaction to antibiotics.</p>
<p>Officials at the hospital on the Spanish island of Gran Canaria said the 26-year-old model was treated in the intensive care unit in the early hours of Sunday, but had made a steady recovery and could soon be discharged.</p>
<p>&quot;Naomi Campbell is in a stable state and may soon be discharged, perhaps this evening or Monday morning,&quot; said a spokeswoman at the hospital in the island capital Las Palmas.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Campbell told local media at the hospital that she would be released on Monday and flown to Paris.</p>
<p>A hospital official earlier said Campbell had been admitted into intensive care after some kind of &quot;overdose&quot;. The hospital would not reveal further details of her condition but local media reported that the catwalk model had taken sedatives.</p>
<p>However, another spokesman for Campbell, Jonathan Goldstein of law firm Olswang, ruled out any kind of overdose.</p>
<p>&quot;Ms Campbell is perfectly well and fully recovered and will be leaving hospital later today. She wishes to make it clear that there is absolutely no foundation whatsoever to the story that she had taken an overdose,&quot; he said in a statement issued to Britain's Press Association news agency.</p>
<p>Local media reported that Campbell had arrived on the island on Friday on the same plane as her boyfriend, 28-year-old flamenco dancer Joaquin Cortes.</p>
<p>At around 0200 GMT on Sunday she was taken semi-conscious from her five-star hotel in Las Palmas to the Nuestra Senora del Pino hospital, officials said.</p>
<p>Local media said the catwalk model had earlier had an argument with Cortes, who is in Gran Canaria with his hugely successful &quot;Gypsy Passion&quot; dance show.</p>
<p>Residents at the luxury hotel, where Campbell and Cortes had been staying in separate rooms, had reportedly complained about a heated conversation between the two.</p>
<p>Hotel staff said Campbell had appeared extremely nervous after the discussion and had taken some form of medicine, local media reported. The hotel would not comment on the reports.</p>
<p>Cortes arrived at the hospital on Sunday afternoon dressed in black to visit the supermodel, who commands tens of thousands of dollars for a morning's work.</p>
<p>He spent several hours at the hospital and left later to star in his hit show at a local theatre.</p>
<p>The long-haired flamenco star, dubbed &quot;sex on legs&quot; for his steamy dancing, has been linked to Campbell for several months.</p>
<p>But gossip magazines recently reported that the Spanish dancer had broken up with Campbell and was pictured with another woman on holiday in the southern resort of Marbella.</p>
<p>His &quot;Gypsy Passion&quot; show is thrilling audiences across Europe and North America with erotic dancing which blends flamenco, ballet and jazz.</p>
