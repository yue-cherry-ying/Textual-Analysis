<p>A Texas death row inmate attempted to kill himself by slashing his throat and a wrist with the blade of a disposable razor on Tuesday, one day before his scheduled execution, a prison spokesman said.</p>
<p>David Lee Herman, a former stockbroker convicted of the 1989 shooting death of a topless nightclub worker, was rushed to Huntsville Memorial Hospital after cutting his throat in two places and slitting his right wrist, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Herman, 39, told prison officials he broke a razor apart to get the blade out, then flushed it down a toilet in his death row cell after cutting himself shortly before dawn.</p>
<p>&quot;He told the warden that he had been planning this for some time and that he was doing it to take the attention away from himself,&quot; prison spokesman Larry Fitzgerald said.</p>
<p>After he was treated, Herman was taken back to death row and placed in an isolation cell to begin his death watch, a routine that includes around-the-clock observation by prison guards during the days leading up to an execution.</p>
<p>He was convicted of murder in the December 1989 shooting of Jennifer Burns, 21, during a robbery of the Lace topless nightclub in Arlington, Texas, where he had worked as a manager two years earlier. After forcing Burns and two coworkers into the club's office, Herman stole $20,000 from a safe and shot all three. The other two survived the attack, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Herman is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection shortly after 7 p.m. EST (midnight GMT) on Wednesday at the state prison at Huntsville, about 45 miles (75km) north of Houston.</p>
<p>Prison officials said they could not recall another attempted suicide by a death row inmate in the days leading up to an execution.</p>
