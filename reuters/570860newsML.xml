<p>Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Ian Macfarlane said on Thursday there would be no economic gain from another cut in official interest rates given revised central bank expectations that the economy could grow by four percent through calendar 1997.  </p>
<p>Macfarlane was asked at a parliamentary hearing why, given low inflation and still high unemployment, another rate cut could not be delivered.</p>
<p>Macfarlane said the RBA was taking a long-term view of economic management, adding: &quot;Our view is that we are playing..the long run, we do believe we are going to have four percent growth over '97, we do believe that that will continue, and we don't believe we will gain anything by having another movement at the moment.&quot;</p>
<p>The RBA last cut the official cash rate in December 1996, the last of three reductions of 50 basis points each.  </p>
<p>The cash rate now stands at 6.0 percent and Macfarlane earlier told the committee that the full impact of the reductions was yet to be felt.</p>
