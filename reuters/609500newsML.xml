<p>Italy's largest bank, San Paolo di Torino, said on Friday its public share offering had been three times oversubscribed and hailed the operation as &quot;a complete succcess.&quot;</p>
<p>The Turin bank was offering a total of 220 million  ordinary shares or a stake of 26.96 percent in the operation which began on Monday and ended on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The global offer of shares in Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino Spa ended today with complete success,&quot; the bank said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the offer period the total demand for the public sale offer (OPV) and the offer to institutional investors was more than 760 million shares,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>There were more than 400,000 applications for the public offer, including from San Paolo employees, for more than 460 million shares, while in the institutional offer 400 investors requested more than 300 million shares.</p>
<p>The final price for the offer will be announced on Saturday but analysts' calculations estimate it will be 10,434.45 lire ($6.25) per share.</p>
<p>The bank has said the final price would be the lower of two alternatives: a maximum price of 10,850 lire per share announced last week or the official price on the closing day of the offer, with a discount of 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>The official price on Friday was 10,702 lire and with the discount becomes 10,434.45 lire, analysts said.</p>
<p>San Paolo has said that in addition to the initial 220 million shares on offer there would be a &quot;green shoe&quot; extra allocation of 33 million shares for institutions if the issue were to be oversubscribed.</p>
<p>While the amount originally destined for the public offer was a minimum of 70 million shares, with 20 million reserved for San Paolo employees, the bank said the definitive allotment had yet to be made.</p>
<p>San Paolo is controlled by a foundation, Compagnia di San Paolo, which has already conducted a private placement of 20 percent of the bank to a core of stable shareholders. That operation brought the foundation's stake down to 45.6 percent and the public offer takes it below 20 percent.</p>
<p>This is the second public offer made by the banking group. It sold a 35 percent stake in 1992.</p>
