<p>U.S. Treasury bond implied volatilities softened Friday as the underlying futures drifted lazily into the three-day holiday weekend.</p>
<p>Light trading characterized the session in both options and futures as activity wound down before Monday's Memorial Day holiday.</p>
<p>The interest rate pits closed early, with bond trading ending at 1210 CDT (1710 GMT) at the Chicago Board of Trade and Eurodollars at 1200 CDT (1700 GMT) at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  </p>
<p>Implied volatility for July bond options slipped to 7.65 percent at session's end, declining 0.1 point from the opening and down from 7.80 percent at Thursday's close. September fell to 8.30 percent from its previous close at 8.35 percent.</p>
<p>Options activity tapered off after the opening bell, when a Wall Street dealer firm sold 2,000 September 106-00 bond puts, floor traders said. Other large dealer transactions were a sale of 1,000 July 106-00 puts and another sale of at least 500 July 109-00 calls.  </p>
<p>June bond futures settled 4/32 higher at 109-06 after sketching out a tiny eight-tick range on the day.</p>
<p>Eurodollar volatilities also slumped as the futures traded quietly, with December ending 1.5 basis points higher at 93.725 after trading between 93.745 and 93.715.</p>
<p>September Eurodollar volatility slid 0.4 point to 8.8 percent and December fell 0.3 point to 10.7 percent. In the mid-curves, short-dated June volatility shed 2.0 points to 13.0 percent, while July was steady at 15.5 percent.</p>
