<p>U.N. transitional authorities in Croatia's last Serb enclave said on Tuesday security for elections there would be increased after Serbs pelted candidates of President Franjo Tudjman's party with eggs and bricks.</p>
<p>The April 13 vote in Eastern Slavonia will coincide with countrywide regional elections and set in motion the return of the enclave to central government rule by July, six years after a Serb minority waged war against Croatian independence.</p>
<p>Monday's Serb mob attack on the first attempted campaign rally in Eastern Slavonia by Tudjman's HDZ party underlined lingering ethnic animosities but the local U.N. Transitional Authority (UNTAES) said only fringe extremists were involved.</p>
<p>&quot;We will redouble our security efforts to ensure such incidents do not recur,&quot; said Philip Arnold, spokesman for UNTAES which had to rescue the Croats from the fusillade and whisk them out of the enclave in armoured vehicles.</p>
<p>&quot;We're very sorry it happened but we emphasise that this was a tiny, extreme group of frustrated and ignorant people,&quot; he said of the 300-odd Serbs who ambushed the HDZ candidates in a street in Vukovar, the enclave's war-devastated main town.</p>
<p>&quot;The opposite side of the coin is that almost 100,000 Serbs in the region (more than half the population) have obtained Croatian citizenship documents and well over 60,000 have registered to vote,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>HDZ campaigners and Croatian journalists who accompanied them on their visit from the other side of the UNTAES-enforced truce line were bombarded with eggs and bricks from a crowd about 10 metres (33 feet away).</p>
<p>About a dozen Serbs broke through a cordon hastily created by U.N. Transitional Police (TPF), a force comprising Serbs and Croats, and smashed windows in the HDZ bus but no injuries were reported aside from a few bruises from projectiles.</p>
<p>Western diplomats said the Serb protest was probably orchestrated by ultra-nationalists who plan to leave for nearby Serbia before Eastern Slavonia's &quot;reintegration&quot; in Croatia.</p>
<p>&quot;The protest was to give the impression that conditions are too chaotic to carry out reintegration and elections cannot be held in an orderly manner,&quot; said one. Serb hardline chieftain Goran Hadzic addressed the crowd in solidarity afterwards.</p>
<p>Vojislav Stanimirovic, the relative moderate heading the only Serb party in the elections, went on local television to say the attack was &quot;not the way to defend Serb rights&quot; and urge his people to stick to the democratic process.</p>
<p>Campaigning had been free of disturbances until Monday. Croatian opposition parties have appeared without incident while the Serbs' new party recognises Croatian sovereignty and seeks only minority guarantees.</p>
<p>Zagreb has pledged extensive rights to the Serbs, including ministerial posts and a proportional presence in local police.</p>
<p>But many Serbs doubt Croat sincerity, fearing persecution once U.N. troops leave this later this year, and at least 20 percent are likely to flee the enclave's handover. That group would include Serbs facing arrest for war crimes against Croats.</p>
<p>HDZ leaders and the HDZ-dominated media quickly denounced Monday's attack and criticised UNTAES for not ensuring the safety of Croatian candidates running in Vukovar.</p>
<p>But the only people likely to vote HDZ there were Croat war refugees who have not moved back into Eastern Slavonia yet.</p>
<p>Western monitors said HDZ strategists may have invited an incident to dramatise unrepentant Serb hostility to Croatia's independence from Yugoslavia and rally Croats around the ruling party as a result, offsetting widespread pre-election apathy.</p>
