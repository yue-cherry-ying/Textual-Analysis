<p>Indian call money was quoted at 0.5-1.0 percent at close on Friday, the reporting day for banks, against Wednesday's close of 4.75-5.0 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>The money market was largely inactive on Thursday as banks in the commercial centre of Bombay and some other centres were closed for a local holiday.</p>
<p>Dealers said little business was done on Friday as borrowing on reporting days increases reserve requirements for the next fortnight.</p>
<p>They said three-day money was quoted in a 3.0-5.0 percent range during the day.</p>
<p>Dealers were unsure of the opening rates for Saturday and gave estimates ranging from 5.0 percent to 6.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not clear what rates call money will open tomorrow,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank. &quot;We have to wait and see.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said prices of government securities were mixed in light trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices were largely steady but trade was extremely thin,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;I think action will pick up after Wednesday's bond auction.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India auctions 30 billion rupees of three-year federal government securities on May 28.</p>
<p>Dealers said traders were waiting for the yield at the auction as well as outflows towards subscription to the auction. This would help in taking a view on interest rates and liquidity, they said.</p>
<p>The 13.50 percent 1997 stock traded on Friday at 101.79 rupees against its last traded 101.95, the 13.50 percent 1998 rose to 103.05 from 103 and the 12.69 percent 2002 was traded between 100.27 and 100.32 against 100.30, dealers said.</p>
<p>Among treasury bills, the April 24, 1998 bill traded at yields between 9.35 and 9.4 percent against last yield of 9.4, the October 10, 1997 bill was unchanged at 8.5 percent while the February 27, 1998 bill yielded 9.15 percent against 9.2, dealers said.</p>
