<p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Gary Stern said the U.S. economy appears positioned for well-balanced growth in the coming year, though he noted tight labor markets and creeping wage growth.</p>
<p>&quot;The economy appears well-positioned for another year of balanced growth,&quot; said Stern in a speech to a Minneapolis Fed community conference.</p>
<p>But Stern reiterated a commonly-held Fed position that monetary policy must be geared toward future economic events and look past current conditions.  </p>
<p>&quot;If you wait until everybody agrees that there is a serious inflation problem, you're going to find it's very hard to deal with that problem and you're going to pay probably a high price in terms of economic performance,&quot; said Stern.</p>
<p>That pre-emptive approach to fighting inflation justified the Fed's quarter-point hike in the federal funds rate last Tuesday, Stern added.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this action has the promise of sustaining the kind of positive economic times we have enjoyed for some time now,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Scattered U.S. labor shortages and mild wage inflation also help explain the Fed's need to tighten credit at last week's meeting, Stern continued.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think there's much question that many labor markets are very tight, you can see that by the measured unemployment rates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dwindling labor supply has already begun to boost Americans' wages, Stern noted.</p>
<p>&quot;As a matter of fact, you do see some upcreep there. So there has been some acceleration of wages. Now, I'm not suggesting that's bad. I'm simply stating that as a fact,&quot; the regional Fed president added.</p>
