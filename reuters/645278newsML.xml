<headline>Taiwan to issue T$3 bln NCDs on Saturday.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-06-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Taiwan's central bank said on Saturday it would issue T$3 billion in one-month negotiable certificates of deposit later in the day.</p>
<p>Bids would close at 10.30 local time (0230 GMT), a central bank official said.</p>
<p>During a sustained stock rally in March and April, the central bank repeatedly issued NCDs, a move seen as aiming to keep a lid on the loose liquidity that many experts said had been fuelling what then was a sizzling stock market.  </p>
<p>The central bank has confirmed that it was responding to the liquidity sitution but denied that it was acting directly in response to the stock market bull run.</p>
<p>The stock market entered a consolidation in May, with daily turnover plunging to less than half of the record levels set during the big first-quarter rally. It began to rebound since May 30, with turnover also slowly recovering.</p>
