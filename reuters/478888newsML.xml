<p>Japan's major manufacturers grew slightly more positive about business conditions in March, according to a closely watched Bank of Japan (BOJ) survey released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The BOJ's quarterly corporate survey, or &quot;tankan&quot;, showed that the diffusion index for large manufacturers rose to plus two in March from minus three in the previous survey in November.  </p>
<p>The index represents the percentage of firms expecting business to improve minus those which expect it to worsen. The higher the number, the more optimistic the outlook.</p>
<p>Economists, who had forecast a rise to between minus two and plus two, said, however, that the improvement in the key index would do little to prompt a tightening of interest rates. The tankan is seen as an important indicator of monetary policy.</p>
<p>The central bank has kept rates at historically low levels since September 1995 when the official discount rate was cut to 0.5 percent in a bid to kick the economy out of recession.</p>
<p>Economists said although the economy was recovering, uncertainty created by tax increases from April 1 meant the BOJ was unlikely to move toward tightening credit for the next three months at least and probably not until the first quarter of 1998.</p>
