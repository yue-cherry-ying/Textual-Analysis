<p>Two-thirds of Poles want the parliament, dominated by ex-communists, to approve a treaty with the Vatican signed in 1993, a survey carried out by the private PBS polling agency showed on Saturday.</p>
<p>The survey, conducted on April 12-13 for the daily paper Rzeczpospolita, showed that 66 percent of Poles wanted the treaty, which regulates church-state relations, ratified by legislators, compared with 55 percent support in a similar poll in May 1996.</p>
<p>The parliament has refused to ratify the treaty, signed by a previous pro-Catholic centre-right government, saying that it risked giving the church undue influence.</p>
<p>According to the survey, 18 percent of Poles were opposed to the treaty and 16 percent were undecided. In last May's poll, 24 percent were against and 21 percent had no opinion.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted among a representative sample of 1,030 adult Poles.</p>
