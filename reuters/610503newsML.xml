<p>Westpac Banking Corp said it would not be announcing a lowering of its interest rates today in response to the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) move to drop official interest rates on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We won't be announcing anything today but we will be announcing something soon,&quot; a spokeswoman from the bank told Reuters.</p>
<p>But the spokeswoman said the bank could not say exactly when a reduction would occur.</p>
<p>Earlier the RBA cut the official interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 5.5 percent from 6.0 percent.  </p>
<p>Of the four major Australian banks, Westpac has been the only one not to immediately lower its rates.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank of Australia was the first bank to react, lowering its standard rate by 35 basis points to 7.2 percent and its no frills rate to 6.7 percent from 6.95 percent.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd and National Australia Bank have both said they would cut their standard mortgage rate to 7.2 percent from 7.55 percent.</p>
