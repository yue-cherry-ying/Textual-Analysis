<p>Sony Corp's earnings forecast for the current business year that began on April 1 was &quot;conservative&quot;, Sony's financial director Sumio Sano told a news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, Sony forecast a group net profit of 160 billion yen in fiscal 1997/98, up 15 percent from the year before.</p>
<p>Sony said its 1997/98 earnings forecast was based on an assumed currency rate of 115 yen to the dollar, versus 112 yen to the dollar in 1996/97.  </p>
<p>&quot;We have made conservative estimates because we don't want to make any downward revisions later,&quot; Sano said, when asked whether Sony expects slower profit growth during the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>Sano also said Sony's group interest-bearing debt was cut by 201.9 billion yen in 1996/97 to 1.43 trillion yen as of the end of March 1997.  </p>
<p>Sano attributed the decline in Sony's debt to the benefits of the weaker yen and to holders of Sony convertible bonds converting those bonds to stock as Sony's share price rose.</p>
<p>Sony plans group capital investment of 350 billion yen in fiscal 1997/98, up from 298.08 billion yen in 1996/97. Of that amount, Sony's group capital investment in semiconductor production facilities will total 70 billion yen in 1997/98, up from 50 billion yen in 1996/97, he said.</p>
<p>Group research and development spending will also rise, reaching 300 billion yen in 1997/98 versus 282.57 billion yen in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Depreciation costs will rise to 310 billion yen in 1997/98 from 266.53 billion yen in 1996/97.  </p>
<p>Sano said Sony expects global sales of its minidiscs to grow 72 percent in 1997/98 to 2.5 million units.</p>
<p>He added that the company's rate of return on equity was 10.6 percent at the end of March.</p>
