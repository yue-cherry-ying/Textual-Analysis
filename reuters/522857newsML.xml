<p>Caretaker Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda once said there were better leaders for his post but many compatriots considered him the right man at the right time.</p>
<p>He was thrust into power after winning a parliamentary vote of confidence in June 1996, ending several weeks of political turmoil following inconclusive general elections in the world's biggest democracy.</p>
<p>On April 11, he resigned after being soundly defeated in another crucial vote of confidence in his minority government, triggered by a key ally's shock decision to withdraw support last month.</p>
<p>And on Saturday, he announced that outgoing foreign minister Inder Kumar Gujral would succeed him as the head of the centre-left United Front coalition and prime minister.</p>
<p>Sixty-three year old Deve Gowda became India's third prime minister in a month when he was sworn in last June by President Shankar Dayal Sharma. But he did not let the promotion go to his head.</p>
<p>With some deft footwork, he managed to hold together for longer than some people believed possible a 13-group coalition ranging from social democrats to communists.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that there are better leaders in our Front,&quot; Deve Gowda told The Week magazine after being named prime minister. &quot;I am not the most competent man.&quot;</p>
<p>He won the job almost by default after an octogenarian communist was tripped up by his own party and a right-wing Hindu nationalist fell short of a parliamentary majority.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda is cut from different cloth than his predecessors, a reflection of India's rapidly changing political culture where regional interests and lower castes are flexing their muscles.</p>
<p>A southern leader from peasant stock, Deve Gowda contrasts with the northern, urban, upper caste Brahmins who have dominated Indian politics since independence in 1947.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a born fighter,&quot; Deve Gowda said. &quot;Throughout my life I have swum against the current. I am a self-made man. I represent the poor.&quot;</p>
<p>He had never held office before in the federal capital, New Delhi, and speaks little Hindi, the dominant language in the north.</p>
<p>&quot;He is a very representative product of the previously marginalised India which is now in the majority,&quot; said Ashis Nandy, of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies.</p>
<p>&quot;I find him very refreshing.&quot;</p>
<p>Haradanahalli Doddegowda Deve Gowda's most distinguishing biographical feature is perhaps his rural roots.</p>
<p>His father tilled a modest one-acre (0.4-hectare) plot of land in the southern section of Karnataka state. The family is from the Vokkaliga community, a group of farmers from an intermediary Hindu caste who wield power in the region.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda helped his father grow cereals on the farm, but also went to school and earned a degree in civil engineering.</p>
<p>Since 1962, when he was elected to the Karnataka state assembly, Deve Gowda has been a full-time politician.</p>
<p>&quot;I have worked in the field, wearing a vest and shorts. We have lived in a hut sleeping on a potato sack and covering ourselves with another sack,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda likes to be called a son of the soil and is a member of the socialist Janata Dal party. But he is no enemy of industry or money.</p>
<p>&quot;His heart beats for the rural poor but that does not mean he is anti-rich,&quot; said D.M. Nanjundappa, deputy chairman of Karnataka's planning board.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda impressed a U.S. business mission led by the late commerce secretary Ron Brown, who visited Karnataka in 1994 after Deve Gowda was named chief minister for the second time.</p>
<p>In Brown's presence, the state leader expressed unambiguous support for a big power project led by U.S. firm Cogentrix.</p>
<p>Later he aggressively pursued protesters who ransacked a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, owned by U.S. food giant Pepsico Inc, in Karnataka's capital Bangalore. The protesters opposed the entry of foreign multinationals into India.</p>
<p>A vegetarian and a teetotaller, Deve Gowda is married and has four sons and two daughters.</p>
