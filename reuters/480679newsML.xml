<p>Here are the highlights of stories in the Danish press on Monday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>POLITIKEN</p>
<p>---German companies and banks are poised to invest up to 25 billion marks in building and construction projects in the Copenhagen-Malmo region in the next decade and have set up a special investment firm. A fixed rail-road, tunnel-bridge link is currently under construction over the narrow sound between Copenhagen and Sweden's third biggest city Malmo for completion by the millenium, creating a new economic hub at the mouth of the Baltic.</p>
<p>BERLINGSKE TIDENDE</p>
<p>--Only 10-20 percent of Danish industry supports the creation of special jobs for the handicapped and disabled, as urged by the government. Four percent of firms have set up such posts without public subsidies, with the same amount doing so with government aid, a Social Institute survey shows.</p>
<p>DET FRI AKTUELT</p>
<p>--Thorleif Krarup, chairman of Denmark's Bankers' Association, fears that the current collective wage negotiations which are unleashing annual wage increases of around two percent are a tad too high, threatening Danish export competitiveness and the current account surplus, risking forcing the government to tighten fiscal policy.</p>
<p>JYLLANDS-POSTEN</p>
<p>--Danish industry, notably meat, machinery, furniture and clothing firms, expect an improvement in exports this year due to better economic growth in foreign trading partners' economies. In the meat industry, 88 per cent of companies questioned for a Danish export barometer survey, said they expected exports to rise during 1997's second quarter with only one percent negative about prospects.</p>
<p>BORSEN</p>
<p>--When France Telecom enters the Danish market for mobile phones next December absorbing 200 technical staff, an acute shortage of telephone engineers is expected in Denmark, sparking spiralling wages.</p>
