<p>The Florida judge hearing a flight attendants' class-action lawsuit against tobacco firms said Monday he did not expect talks between cigarette makers and state attorneys general to affect the trial and said he was disinclined to stop it because of outside events.</p>
<p>Dade County Circuit Judge Robert Kaye made his comments after a motion by Susan and Stanley Rosenblatt, attorneys for the plaintiffs in the case, that he issue an order that a settlement between government officials and tobacco companies not affect the class-action lawsuit, known as Norma Broin vs. Philip Morris Cos. Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't intend to do anything yet with this because there isn't anything to do (yet). We will proceed as we are proceeding,&quot; Kaye said.</p>
<p>He did not rule on the motion but indicated he did not feel the talks would affect the trial, which completed eight days of jury selection Monday.</p>
<p>By late Monday afternoon, attorneys had considered about 190 potential jurors out of the initial pool of 250. Only 49 of the 190 who had been considered during the almost eight days of jury selection were placed in the pool from which a jury will eventually be picked to hear the landmark case.</p>
<p>Because each of the sides can exclude 27 jurors, a pool of more than 60 will be needed to seat a six-member panel plus alternates.</p>
<p>The attorneys general, the highest ranking legal officers of each state, and the tobacco industry have been negotiating since early April.</p>
<p>In Washington, sources close to the talks said state attorneys general were optimistic they could present the White House with a tobacco settlement proposal this week.</p>
<p>Kaye also said there could be constitutional problems with using a settlement agreement such as the tobacco pact being discussed to bar others from going to court.</p>
<p>Tobacco industry attorneys responded that the motion was an attempt by the Rosenblatts to gain attention in the media. Tobacco lawyers have repeatedly asked the judge to limit publicity about the case.</p>
<p>In the Broin case, the Rosenblatts represent a nationwide class of about 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants seeking as much as $5 billion in damages from nine tobacco companies and industry groups for illnesses they attribute to breathing secondhand cigarette smoke on U.S.-based passenger jets.</p>
