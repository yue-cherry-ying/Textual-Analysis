<p>South Korean oil refiners are betting on China to consume much of their surplus this year, while at the same time casting around for new markets in Southeast Asia, industry sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Local refiners have expanded their sales abroad after a flurry of plant expansions last year and a slowdown in domestic demand.</p>
<p>&quot;Our major export market is China and will continue to be China,&quot; said a trader at Yukong Ltd, South Korea's largest oil refiner.</p>
<p>&quot;As long as China is there, there will be demand. We have no worries,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>South Korea's oil products exports surged 86 percent to 35.4 million barrels in the first two months of 1997 against 19 million barrels a year before, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said.</p>
<p>For the whole of 1996, exports rose 30 percent to 159.8 million barrels from 122.8 million in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Imports have dropped following capacity expansion, but exports, on the other hand, have risen sharply,&quot; said an official at the Korea Petroleum Association.</p>
<p>South Korea's refining capacity jumped to 2.44 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.82 million at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>Last year, Hyundai Oil Refinery Co added 200,000-bpd refining capacity, Yukong 200,000 bpd and LG-Caltex Oil Corp 220,000 bpd.</p>
<p>&quot;China's demand is huge,&quot; said Yong Han, an energy analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities. &quot;China's economy is growing fast, which translates into higher demand. But it doesn't have enough refining capacity yet.&quot;</p>
<p>South Korea's oil products exports to China rose by 59 percent to 37.3 million barrels in 1996, according to figures from the Korea Petroleum Development Corp.</p>
<p>Local refiners have now become a major competitor for Singapore, particularly in the China market.</p>
<p>&quot;We have an advantage over Singapore as far as China is concerned,&quot; said the Yukong trader. &quot;We are closer to most of China and can offer an average of 30 cent discount per barrel.&quot;</p>
<p>Refiners in Singapore said the South China market was still open for competition, but conceded they had lost market share in North China to South Korea.</p>
<p>They are counting on growing regional demand to absorb South Korea's surplus production.</p>
<p>Industry sources said local refiners would keep tapping other countries in the region, such as Japan and Southeast Asian nations.</p>
<p>&quot;Asia will remain the main target for South Korean exporters because of its strong demand, lack of refining capacity and low delivery costs,&quot; said Han of Jardine Fleming.</p>
<p>Local refiners sold 72.6 million barrels of petroleum products to Japan in 1996, up 63 percent from a year ago and 12.3 million barrels to Thailand, up 142 percent.</p>
<p>Industry sources said Singapore would hold tightly to its traditional markets in Indochina, Indonesia and the Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>Singapore was closer to those markets and could offer cheaper freight rates.</p>
