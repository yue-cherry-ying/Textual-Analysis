<p>World champion Tommi Makinen was poised for his third win of the season on Friday when he ended the second leg of the Argentina rally with a 61-second lead over title rival Colin McRae.</p>
<p>The Mitsubishi driver from Finland,, who started the day with an eight-second advantage over his Subaru opponent, saw his lead cut to five seconds at the end of the 12th stage.</p>
<p>However, an unbeatable time on the next stage gave him a lead of 22 seconds.</p>
<p>From then on, Makinen slowly edged out an advantage on the twisty mountain roads that suited his car perfectly, with the fastest time on four out of the remaining five stages of the second day.</p>
<p>McRae, aware that he crashed out of last year's event when chasing Makinen in similar conditions, was content to maintain his second spot, especially after suffering differential problems on stage 14 and a power steering failure on stage 16.</p>
<p>Spaniard Carlos Sainz, the only other main championship contender, was still in third place in his Ford, but one minute 57 seconds adrift of Makinen at the end of the second leg.</p>
<p>Briton Richard Burns in the Mitsubishi was the first high-profile retirement of the event when he dropped out of fourth position on the 16th stage with a broken rear suspension.</p>
<p>Finn Juha Kankunnen retired his Ford before the start of the 17th stage when a broken front-suspension slowed him down enough to go over his allocated time limit on the road section.</p>
<p>Both retirements were caused by the conditions on the run from the midway service point which were particularly rough.</p>
<p>&quot;What has surprised me is just how rough the rally is,&quot; said Ford team director Malcolm Wilson. &quot;I think there is more damage to the underneath of the cars than we would expect on either the Safari or Acropolis rallies.&quot;</p>
<p>Swede Kenneth Eriksson, the winner of this year's Swedish Rally, was promoted to fourth place with the retirement of Burns and Kankunnen, while Finn Marcus Gronholm in the Toyota moved up to fifth place.</p>
<p>The final leg of the event leaves Cordoba early on Saturday morning and sees the teams head south for the final five stages over 81.20 kms before finishing in the city base in the afternoon.</p>
