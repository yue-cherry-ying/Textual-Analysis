<p>Seagull Energy Corp said it is enjoying continuing success in an active development drilling program in the Arkoma Basin of western Arkansas.</p>
<p>Within a radius of about 30 miles generally to the east of Fort Smith, Seagull has successfully completed nine natural gas development wells since the beginning of 1997, four of which tested natural gas at rates in excess of 6 million cubic feet daily, it said.</p>
<p>Particularly noteworthy was the Armbruster 3-5 drilled to 9,500 feet in Logan County.  </p>
<p>This well tested natural gas from the Middle and Lower Hale sands at a rate of 19.8 million cubic feet daily, believed to be one of the highest test rates for an Arkansas gas well in recent times.</p>
<p>The company said the cumulative flow rates recorded in tests of the nine successful wells was slightly in excess of 50 million cubic feet daily.</p>
<p>The successful wells are being tied into production facilities promptly, with the Armbruster 3-5 scheduled to be flowing before the end of May, Seagull said.</p>
<p>This well is a stepout of more than three miles from the nearest correlative production in the Lower Hale.</p>
<p>Further drilling is anticipated following seismic surveys in the area, where Seagull has increased its leasehold position recently by more than 4,000 net acres.</p>
<p>Seagull has a working interest of about 55 percent in the Armbruster 3-5 and various interests averaging more than 50 percent in the other development successes.</p>
