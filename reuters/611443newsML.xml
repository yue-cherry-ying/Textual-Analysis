<p>The outlook for Japan's economy remains unclear despite its recovery, and the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) basic policy is to deal with the situation carefully, Jiji news agency BOJ Deputy Governor Toshihiko Fukui as saying on Friday.  </p>
<p>&quot;Although the economy is on a recovery track, the economic outlook is still unclear,&quot; Fukui was quoted as saying at a meeting of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's policy research council. &quot;The basic policy (of the BOJ) is to cautiously deal with this (situation). In this regard, the central bank's stance has been consistent.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about a request made by Rengo, Japan's largest labour group, to raise the discount rate, Fukui said he had told Rengo that he sympathised with the group to a certain extent, but also told the group that it should give consideration to the economic situation of entrepreneurs and smaller enterprises.</p>
