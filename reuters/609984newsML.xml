<p>Rentals group Thorn Plc,, whose shares have fallen from favour since its split from music giant EMI last year, is expected to report flat profits when its publishes its first annual results since the demerger next Wednesday.</p>
<p>Thorn, owner of Radio Rentals in Britain and Rent-a-Center in the United States, warned in January that profits this year would be broadly the same as last year's pro forma equivalent of 170.7 million stg.</p>
<p>The company said its fourth quarter performance would suffer from lower sales volumes over Christmas, particularly in the U.S., where there was a general softening in the electricals retail market over the holiday season.</p>
<p>Retail analysts said the one of the key worries about the group was whether there was a viable future for its rentals business in the United States.</p>
<p>In January, Thorn reported a five percent drop in U.S. like-for-like sales for the nine months to end December 1996. The U.S. accounts for around 40 percent of total group sales.</p>
<p>In Britain, Thorn has embarked on restructuring and cost cutting by closing about 90 Radio Rental stores and shedding jobs. But at the same time it is expanding its no-frills Crazy George rental stores.</p>
<p>The shares, which started life at 408 pence in August last year, have sunk as low as 154 pence. They were 154 pence, down 2.5 pence at 0936 GMT Friday.</p>
<p>Despite the steep fall, analysts considered the stock was still expensive. But some suggested the prospect of a near 11 percent dividend yield could prove an attraction.</p>
