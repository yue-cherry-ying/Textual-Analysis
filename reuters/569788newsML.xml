<p>U.S. spot propane prices stayed steady in moderate midday trade on Thursday, finding support from NYMEX futures and short covering that outweighed bearish propane inventory data, players said Thursday.</p>
<p>The monthly Energy Information Administration report late Wednesday showed the largest build in April since 1993.</p>
<p>Stocks climbed 6.1 million barrels to 32.2 million as of April 30, which is 7 million barrels above year-ago levels.</p>
<p>&quot;The report is bearish but crude and products kept propane up,&quot; said a U.S. Gulf trader. Another player in the Conway, Kansas, hub added that some short covering in the material also helped keep this home heating fuel and petrochemical stock from weakening.</p>
<p>NYMEX oil prices and gasoline both rallied early Thursday on technical strength and talk of refinery snags in the Gulf.</p>
<p>&quot;If crude falls, then I think our market will come down,&quot; added the Gulf trader.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an international source said a U.S. Gulf terminal will be taking delivery shortly of a 40,000 tonne cargo of propane from Algeria's state-owned Sonatrach.</p>
<p>Another cargo of at least 30,000 tonnes is also scheduled for arrival at the same terminal from Sonatrach around June 16.</p>
<p>In the U.S. Gulf, spot propane traded at 35.00 cents and 34.75 cents. Conway, Kansas, hub material swapped hands at 35.75 cents.</p>
<p>Normal butane prices stayed largely steady although isobutane gained ground in catch up to normal's rise earlier in the week.</p>
<p>A Conway isobutane deal was done at 46.00, a half cent above Wednesday.</p>
