<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>NYMEX gasoline sharpened its rally Thursday afternooon as talk of refinery snags in the U.S. Gulf pushed gains above technical resistance and triggered buy stops.</p>
<p>At 1417 EDT, June gasoline was up 1.58 cents a gallon at 62.60 cents after rising as high as 62.90 cents. Prompt gasoline broke trendline resistance at 62.55 cents extending from the high March 19 through the high May 1 on the June chart.</p>
<p>&quot;We got a lot of fund buying now after we hit some stops above 62.50. It's a news driven market,&quot; said a New York gasoline dealer, adding &quot;Gasoline seems to have found its bottom, and we now have some believers.&quot;</p>
<p>Traders said gasoline may be finally starting its traditional spring rally after the market all but gave up on such a possibility as gasoline prices have lagged the oil complex throughout April.  </p>
<p>Gasoline typically rallies in the spring in anticipation of the summer driving season, but a surplus of crude has weighed on oil prices generally since late February.</p>
<p>On Wednesday and Thursday gasoline woke from its slumber on talk that operations snags at Amoco's Texas City, Texas refinery and Conoco's Lake Charles, Lousiana refinery shut gasoline making units at the plants.</p>
<p>Conoco and Amoco officials declined comment.</p>
<p>June heating oil was 1.27 cents a gallon higher at 54.35 cents while June crude stood 58 cents a barrel higher at $20.20.</p>
<p>Prompt crude rose as high as $20.38, breaking a trendline that extends from the high January 31 through the high March 19 on the daily spot chart, sparking technical buying.</p>
<p>&quot;The next key level of resistance is in the 20.50 area. If we can get comfortably above that, then I will start to be convinced that things are turning around,&quot; said Bob MacMinn, president of petroleum consulting firm MPAS Inc in Toronto.</p>
<p>Since April 21, prompt crude has tested and failed four times to break resistance that lies between $20.50 and $20.60, making it captive to a $19.50 to $20.50 range since then.</p>
