<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said on Thursday progress was being made in tobacco settlement talks but that real disagreements remained and that it was not clear whether these could be resolved.</p>
<p>&quot;They have reported to us through (White House aide Bruce) Lindsey that they are in fact making progress...but they have some very real disagreements and it's not clear whether those disagreements are going to be resolved,&quot; McCurry told reporters.  </p>
<p>The White House is monitoring the talks through Lindsey, one of the president's closest advisers, and would have to bless any agreement that might be reached.</p>
<p>On Wednesday a source close to the talks said attorneys general involved in the discussions expected to reach an agreement with cigarette companies next week.</p>
<p>Asked if there was any prospect for an imminent settlement, McCurry replied: &quot;Not that I've heard.&quot;</p>
<p>A total of 34 states have sued the tobacco industry to recoup Medicaid health care costs of smokers.</p>
<p>The top legal officers of some of those states, along with plaintiffs' lawyers handling class action cases and members of the health community, began negotiating a settlement with the tobacco industry in early April.</p>
<p>Although the industry has made some concessions in the health care area, a key hurdle remains in finding a plan that would give cigarette companies some certainty about damages they would have to pay without depriving individuals of their right to sue the tobacco industry.</p>
