<headline>Slovenia shares slip, pushed down by BTC.</headline>

<p>Slovenia's SBI index ended marginally lower on Friday, driven lower by a four percent fall in warehouse and shopping centre operator BTC.</p>
<p>&quot;Outlook of our market is really sad -- turnover is low and I don't think it'll get much better once foreigners return, because they will remain cautious regarding the stability of our market,&quot; said Karmen Cerar, a trader at brokerage Poteza.</p>
<p>The SBI index fell 0.37 percent or 4.87 points to 1,318.47. This week the blue-chip index firmed 1.55 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Next week prices are likely to move by a maximum one percent on similar volumes as this week,&quot; Cerar said.</p>
<p>The Bank of Slovenia earlier this year blocked foreign investment, forcing international portfolio investors to open special share trading custodian accounts at one of the country's 14 fully licensed banks.</p>
<p>Since then the SBI index has dropped by over 20 percent and average daily volume has fallen over 75 percent.</p>
<p>The first accounts are expected to be opened in June.</p>
<p>Traders said foreign buyers may refrain from trading as long as parliament does not ratify the EU association accord, signed in June last year.</p>
<p>&quot;If the accord is not signed prices could fall deeper than ever before,&quot; Cerar added.</p>
<p>Last week the parliament postponed the ratification to allow more time for political parties to reach a broader agreement on the issue.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Court is expected to say next week whether the ratification of the agreement was in line with the constitution.</p>
<p>Overall four shares fell, eight rose and one was flat, while 15 were untraded. Turnover fell to 55.1 million tolars from 66.0 million.</p>
<p>BTC was the most active and the leading decliner, falling four percent to 14,400 tolars on volume of 1,000 shares for total turnover of 14.6 million tolars.</p>
<p>Traders said BTC was down on profit-taking after last week's gains when BTC announced plans to seek fresh capital in order to finance new investment.</p>
<p>Food maker Droga was the biggest gainer, rising 2.50 percent to 28,700 tolars on volume of 182 shares, for total turnover of 5.1 million tolars.</p>
<p>Traders attributed the rise to expectations of a dividend payout.</p>
