<p>The top United Nations official in Croatia said on Thursday he was &quot;profoundly disturbed&quot; by conditions in former rebel Serb areas where local officials were making life difficult for remaining or returning Serbs.</p>
<p>Jacques Klein, U.N. administrator of the last Serb enclave in Croatia which reverts to government rule soon, warned that the return of Croat war refugees there depends on a reciprocal repatriation of Serbs to areas now back under Croatian control.</p>
<p>Croatia is keen to return up to 100,000 of its refugees to Eastern Slavonia. The region now hosts some 120,000 Serbs, about half of them refugees from other ex-rebel areas, known as Krajina, that the Croatian army recaptured in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;It really is a simple equation. How can Croatian displaced persons come back here if we can't get these people (Serb refugees) out of here and back where they belong,&quot; Klein, a U.S. diplomat, told local U.N. radio, monitored in Zagreb.</p>
<p>Minority Serbs rebelled against Croatia's drive for independence from federal Yugoslavia in 1991 and set up their own state of Krajina, comprising three smaller enclaves, from which they expelled most non-Serbs.</p>
<p>Klein visited the old Krajina last week after U.N. reports about continued abuse of human and civil rights of Serbs who had stayed on or have recently returned to reclaim their property, most of which was burnt, destroyed or confiscated.</p>
<p>&quot;What I saw did not impress me at all. I saw a lack of administrative assistance and lack of control on the part of Croatian officials (there) and I was profoundly disturbed,&quot; Klein said.</p>
<p>Local government officials, he said, were devising &quot;Machiavellian schemes&quot; to hinder the Serbs in what was meant to be routine registration of their cattle or tractors, or were delaying providing electricity and clean water.</p>
<p>After the visit, Klein held an urgent meeting with nationalist President Franjo Tudjman on Tuesday to &quot;alert him to the problems&quot;.</p>
<p>He said Tudjman was &quot;somewhat appalled when I related my experience. I believe he wants the process of peaceful reintegration (of Eastern Slavonia) to work. He wants to lead Croatia into Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately he doesn't always have an administrative establishment that is supporting his policy... He needs government officials to do their jobs, to do what the hell they're paid for,&quot; Klein said.</p>
<p>He said the U.N. Transitional Authority in Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES), supported by some 5,000 peacekeeping troops, had done its part in laying the groundwork for the area's return to Croatian rule on July 15, when UNTAES' mandate expires.</p>
<p>&quot;We've done our part. We're ready to move people. It's now up to the Croatian government and its officials to make that a reality...They're the people that need to get their act together and do their job,&quot; Klein said.</p>
