<headline>NY precious metals end mixed in lackluster trade.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures ended mixed Tuesday, on moderate volumes, with the complex still not displaying much sense of direction, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some more fund liquidation in COMEX silver futures led COMEX gold futures lower early Tuesday, but some trade and fund buying helped gold to recover and end higher,&quot; North American Equity Services COMEX floor trader, John Geraghty, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold just doesn't seem to want to go back below $350,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>COMEX April gold entered its delivery period Monday, leaving June gold as the active contract.</p>
<p>COMEX June gold ended up 70 cents an ounce at $354.80, after trading a $352.20-355.00 range. Estimated total volume was 30,000 lots, while open interest fell a further 4,770 lots Monday to 151,569 contracts, the lowest since last September.</p>
<p>Support was seen around $351.00 in the June contract, with resistance around $355.00.</p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold ended quoted $351.70/20, compared to the London afternoon fix Tuesday at $350.00, and Monday's New York close around $350.70/20.</p>
<p>After two days of sharp falls, U.S. stock and bond markets were steadier Tuesday, despite a rise in the in the U.S. March NAPM index to 55.0, the highest level since February 1995, and despite a rise of 2.3 percent in U.S. February construction spending, the largest rise since March 1996.</p>
<p>But the U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate rise last week was seen neutral for gold. Higher interest rates eased inflation concerns and increased the cost of holding gold, but the sell-off in the equities market provided some support for precious metals, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;No exciting news here - gold prices picked up although we continue to see a trading range of $335-390 for the rest of the year,&quot; Salomon Brothers analyst Peter Dell'Orto said.</p>
<p>Gold equities mostly held above Mondays lows also, after the the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's widely followed .XAU index fell to its lowest level since early 1995 Monday.</p>
<p>Canadian mining junior Bre-X, found some support Tuesday, but on such huge volume that trading overloaded the Toronto Stock Exchange's computer.</p>
<p>Bre-X trading resumed Tuesday, after the stock crashed to a low of $2.25 last Thursday, from Wednesday's close at $15.50, after news its Busang gold find may have been seriously overestimated.</p>
<p>COMEX May silver ended down 7.00 cents at $5.010 an ounce, after slipping below $5.000 to a session low at $4.965 for the first time since mid-February.</p>
<p>Funds were net long COMEX silver by 10,871 lots as of March 25, according to the latest CFTC data, but open interest has picked up in the last few trading days, suggesting some shorting may now be occurring, as silver gives back most of its gains of the past two months, analysts said.</p>
<p>COMEX silver open interest rose 2,101 lots Monday to 91,324 contracts.</p>
<p>In the platinum metals group, Tuesday was first notice day for NYMEX April platinum.</p>
<p>July platinum closed up $3.90 an ounce at $376.90, with open interest rising Monday for the first time in several weeks, now the April/July rollover is well-advanced.</p>
<p>NYMEX June palladium was up $3.95 an ounce at $152.95.</p>
<p>In news Tuesday Russian Natural Resource Minister, Viktor Orlov, said he was unaware when stalled palladium and platinum shipments to Japan might resume.</p>
<p>Disruptions to Russian supplies, concern about the low level of Russian stockpiles, and rising auto demand for PGMs has been behind a sharp rally in prices in the first quarter this year.</p>
