<p>Eighteen people were killed and 31 injured in a plane crash on Saturday on the Indonesian island of Belitung, officials and news reports said.</p>
<p>The official Antara news agency said a Merpati Nusantara Airlines twin turbo-prop aircraft with 52 passengers and five crew crashed short of the Buluh Tumbang airport on Belitung, 400 km (250 miles) north of Jakarta at about 7:53 a.m. (0053 GMT).</p>
<p>Antara quoted the spokesman of the South Sumatra provincial administration in Palembang as saying 18 had died. However an official at the hospital gave a lower figure.</p>
<p>&quot;Forty-six people were admitted to hospital. Fifteen have died,&quot; a doctor at the Belitung general hospital told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still observing them and we do not yet have information on how many are seriously injured or have medium or light injuries,&quot; he said, adding that 11 people were not injured.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears there were only people from Jakarta and Belitung, but the data on the victims is not yet complete,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Antara said the dead included the pilot and a stewardess.</p>
<p>Search and rescue officials in Jakarta said the cause of the crash was not yet known. But they said the plane, which was on a flight to Belitung from Jakarta, had broken into three sections upon impact.</p>
<p>Antara quoted the South Sumatra provincial administration as saying Transport Minister Haryanto Dhanutirto had already carried out an initial examination at the site of the accident.</p>
