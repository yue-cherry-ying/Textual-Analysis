<p>A leading Kuwaiti opposition parliamentarian was recovering in hospital on Saturday a day after unidentified gunmen shot him and his wife.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank God Abdullah al-Naibari is doing well,&quot; a relative told Reuters.</p>
<p>Gunmen ambushed the car of the fierce government critic on Friday as he drove back to Kuwait City from a beach near the southern border with Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Naibari was hit in the jaw and shoulder by bullets while his wife suffered a superficial bullet wound near her left shoulder. Both are being treated at the Adan Hospital, south of Kuwait City.</p>
<p>Diplomats said Western embassies in the tiny Gulf Arab state were assessing the security situation, especially the American and British missions.</p>
<p>William Cohen is due to make his first visit to Kuwait as U.S. Defence Secretary in mid-June while British Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett is expected to come to Kuwait on June 23.</p>
<p>&quot;Each (attack) event is studied in search of a pattern,&quot; said a Western diplomat. &quot;As of yet there appears to be no pattern or indication who was behind the attack&quot;.</p>
<p>Diplomats said both visits were expected to take place on schedule.</p>
<p>Officials told Reuters two cars were involved in the attack on Naibari, 61, who underwent surgery late on Friday. His vehicle was sprayed with bullets.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a scare tactic,&quot; said a Western diplomat. &quot;They want to shut him and other MPs up. He has been very strong in his attacks on the so called 'thieves of public funds'&quot;.</p>
<p>Several MPs, of various affiliations, said the attack was politically motivated by what they called the enemies of democracy whose interests were damaged by parliament's relentless questioning about the country's vast oil wealth and lucrative arms deals.</p>
<p>They did not name anyone. Parliament's Saturday session is expected to be dedicated to debates about the attack. The government has condemned the shooting and promised to conduct an intensive inquiry to secure the arrest of the gunmen.</p>
<p>Kuwait, which controls about 10 percent of the world's proven oil reserves, is the only one of the six conservative Sunni Moslem-ruled Gulf Arab states with an elected parliament.</p>
<p>Fellow liberal MP Sami al-Munayes said: &quot;It is a battle between right and wrong and defending the people's rights.&quot; He urged the government &quot;to strike with an iron fist, with deeds and not words,&quot; at all forms of corruption.</p>
<p>Naibari played a key role in parliamentary efforts to combat what the opposition described as graft and mismanagement of state funds. He was also among leaders of a movement demanding the restoration of parliament dissolved in 1986.</p>
<p>General elections were held in 1992, more than a year after a U.S.-led military coalition ended Iraq's seven-month occupation of Kuwait.</p>
