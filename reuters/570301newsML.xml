<headline>Analysts keep faith in BTR's restructuring.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>BTR Plc shocked investors on Thursday as it issued its fourth profit warning in three years, but analysts say the group is still on track to shake off prolonged underperformance.</p>
<p>BTR said earlier first-half profit will be hit by the strong pound and weak markets in Australia and Germany.</p>
<p>The warning shows BTR's restructuring is taking longer to bear fruit than investors had hoped for, but analysts said they could not think of an alternative strategy to revitalise BTR quicker.</p>
<p>&quot;The indications still are that they are progressing,&quot; said Andrew Mitchel at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>&quot;This (the profit warning) does not necessarily mean that anything has gone wrong with the restructuring,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>BTR is currently in the final stages of selling off its underperforming units, while boosting core activities such as its valves, packaging and certain automotive operations.</p>
<p>The overhaul was started by Ian Strachan, who became chief executive early last year. Strachan has already issued two profit warnings since he took over, but still enjoys full analyst support.</p>
<p>&quot;He is going the right way. It is just a matter of how quickly he is going to get where he wants to be,&quot; said Geoff Allum at Henderson Crosthwaite.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Strachan said the pound would trim about 35 million pounds off first-half operating profit if the currency stays at its current high levels.</p>
<p>Excluding the currency effect, profit would still be &quot;somewhat&quot; lower because depressed economies in Germany and Australia.</p>
<p>The big profit hit from these markets abroad was the biggest surprise to analysts, who had already anticipated a strong adverse currency impact.</p>
<p>But analysts took heart from BTR's comment it expected underlying performance to improve in the second half of 1997.</p>
<p>Their conviction that the group was on the right track was further strengthened by BTR's separate announcement that it would buy a unit of GEC-Alsthom NV. GEC-Alsthom in turn acquires BTR's Mirrlees Blackstone unit.</p>
<p>The move marks BTR's exit from diesel engine manufacturing, while boosting its industrial motors and gear drives operation.</p>
<p>&quot;BTR needs to globalise more and that is what it is doing,&quot; said Allum. &quot;The strategy in itself sounds fine, the problem is that the market has a limited amount of patience,&quot; he added.</p>
