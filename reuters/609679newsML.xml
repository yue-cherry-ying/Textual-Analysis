<p>Storms lashed coastal Bangladesh on Friday and slowed a disaster-relief battle four days after a cyclone made over a million people homeless, with a feared deathtoll of nearly 1,000.</p>
<p>Strong winds and heavy rain blasted Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar resort and nearby islands in the Bay of Bengal in a lower-key rerun of Monday's devastating impact.</p>
<p>Officials said a 75 kph (45 mph) rainstorm swept areas still recovering from the cyclone that had killed at least 105 people.</p>
<p>But some 750 fishermen missing at sea since Monday have yet to return, raising fears they might have drowned.</p>
<p>&quot;We are becoming increasingly concerned over the fate of nearly 750 fishermen still missing,&quot; Kabir Ahmed, leader of the Mechanised Fishing Boats Association in Cox's Bazar, said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Some 50 fishing boats have remained unaccounted for from Cox's Bazar Sadar Union area alone,&quot; the union's administrator Mohammad Kefayetullah said.</p>
<p>Cox's Bazar residents and islanders told reporters that most affected areas had been without relief supplies till Thursday while electricity lines were still down.</p>
<p>The state-run Dainik Bangla newspaper reported on Friday that diarrhoeal attacks in the cyclone-battered areas had already killed 14 people.</p>
<p>Officials in Chittagong and Cox's Bazar denied any outbreak of diarrhoea in the wake of the cyclone.</p>
<p>&quot;Scattered incidents of diarrhoeal attack are very common in many areas during this time of the year. People are not very health conscious and they sometimes drink water from derelict sources and eat rubbish (which cause the disease),&quot; one Cittagong health official said.</p>
<p>Jawadul Karim, press secretary to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, told reporters on Thursday that 105 people had so far been confirmed to have died in Monday's 220 kph (125 mph) cyclone.</p>
<p>He put the number of people affected at nearly 2.5 million, most of them made homeless. Karim said about 10,000 people were injured and over 600,000 houses damaged.</p>
<p>The U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs in Geneva said on Wednesday the cyclone had killed at least 200 people. Officials in the stricken areas earlier put the death toll at least 121.</p>
<p>Low-lying Bangladesh is prone to devastation from cyclones. The country's worst storm in 1991 killed at least 138,000 people and left millions homeless.</p>
<p>The government on Thursday asked for international help to build more cyclone shelters in coastal areas to minimise deaths from future storms.</p>
<p>&quot;We have told international community that we need help for building 2,000 more shelters in cyclone prone areas,&quot; Foreign Secretary Farooq Sobhan told a news conference in Dhaka.</p>
