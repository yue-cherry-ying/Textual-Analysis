<p>Sudan reacted calmly on Tuesday to recent criticisms of its human rights record.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Ali Osman Mohammad Taha told a news conference in Cairo that the country's record was improving and was better than those of many countries in the region.</p>
<p>He did not challenge the substance of the reports, which alleged that torture is widespread and that the Sudanese authorities have used violence against trade unionists.</p>
<p>The minister, referring to a recent critical report by the U.N. Human Rights Commission, said: &quot;The report in its general contents represents a step that is relatively better than the reports which came out in previous years.</p>
<p>&quot;If we look at the accusations against Sudan, compared with those against many other states in the region, we will find that Sudan, given the wars it is living through,...is in a much better position than many of the countries.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Those who try to exploit the principles of human rights to put political pressure did not find anything to reinforce what they have said about Sudan on previous occasions,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The minister attributed the relative improvement to what he said was Sudan's policy of allowing human rights organisations to visit the country and see the facts on the ground.</p>
<p>In one report issued last week, a committee of the International Labour Organisation denounced violence against trade unionists -- including murder, disappearances, and intimidation -- in Colombia, Nigeria and Sudan.</p>
<p>A separate report by the U.N. special rapporteur on torture, listed Sudan among 29 countries where he said torture was a fairly extensive problem.</p>
