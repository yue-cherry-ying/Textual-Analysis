<p>The force may have been with News Corp so far this year but more earthly dangers await Rupert Murdoch's global media empire, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>News Corp announced on Thursday a 34 percent rise in net profit before abnormals to A$376 million (US$293 million) in the three months to March 31, driven largely by Fox Television and Fox Film's re-release of the Star Wars movie trilogy.</p>
<p>Net profits after abnormals were A$330 million, up from A$77 million in the same period last year.</p>
<p>British newspapers and BkyB also produced significant profit contributions, while News' book publishing amd Australasian newspaper and pay television were the main drags on profit, News said.</p>
<p>But the results received a lukewarm reception from the market. News' shares ended at A$6.01, off five cents on the day.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, it's not all good news for News,&quot; said one Melbourne analyst.</p>
<p>Murdoch last year predicted that News could achieve a 20 percent profit rise for the year to June 30, 1997, a forecast not borne out by first-half results. Net profit before abnormals for the first nine months was 17 percent up at A$1.11 billion.</p>
<p>A Sydney-based analyst estimated News would report a net profit of A$1.64 billion before abnormals for the full year.</p>
<p>&quot;They are probably going to achieve (the 20 percent profit growth),&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Other analysts said the third quarter profit was not enough to make them change their forecasts.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall, the result is at the higher end of market expectations but it's not enough to get people excited,&quot; a Melbourne-based analyst said.</p>
<p>Filmed Entertainment revenues rose sharply to A$1.138 billion from A$584 million, although its operating income had a more modest rise from A$82 million from A$63 million in the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>Analysts, however, say the film arm will return to earth in the last quarter and early in the next financial year because of two big-budget disaster movies -- &quot;Volcano&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Volcano&quot;, about an eruption in Los Angeles, reportedly cost about US$100 million to make but had a cumulative gross of US$27 million to May 5.</p>
<p>The release of &quot;Titanic&quot;, reputedly the most expensive movie ever made, has been pushed back past the traditional U.S. opening date of July 4.</p>
<p>&quot;Titanic won't affect them this year but Volcano will be a loss-maker,&quot; a Melbourne analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no way film will be the same next year.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said investors were still wary of investing in News Corp until it sorts out its U.S. satellite TV business American Sky Broadcasting (ASkyB).</p>
<p>Uncertainty surrounds News Corp's ASkyB plans following its tie-up with Echostar Communications Corp. The venture has run into several problems since the deal was announced in February.</p>
<p>&quot;The prevailing issue remains ASkyB and until that issue is resolved satisfactorily it is going to remain a big problem for them,&quot; a Sydney analyst said.</p>
