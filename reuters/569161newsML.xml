<p>Colombia's chief prosecutor, a popular anti-drug and corruption fighter who nearly toppled President Ernesto Samper, has resigned to launch a bid for the presidency, judicial officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Supreme Court president Didimo Paez said Prosecutor-General Alfonso Valdivieso's &quot;irrevocable&quot; resignation was unanimously accepted by the court in a closed-door session early on Thursday.</p>
<p>In his letter, notifying the court of his decision to step down, Valdivieso stressed it was because &quot;he is going to present his name to the public as a candidate in the next presidential elections,&quot; Paez said.</p>
<p>The elections will be held in May next year and Colombian law requires that anyone in public office intending to run for the country's top job step down a year ahead of the polls.</p>
<p>Valdivieso was appointed in 1994, less than two weeks after Samper took office amid a scandal over charges that he received millions of dollars in drug money to finance his campaign.</p>
<p>He made his mark, and earned many enemies, by heading the so-called 8,000 Process -- a probe into the campaign finance scandal that nearly led to Samper's impeachment last year.</p>
<p>Although he is a member of Samper's ruling Liberal Party, Valdivieso, 46, is widely expected to run as an independent candidate for the presidency.</p>
<p>Valdivieso is a cousin of Luis Carlos Galan, a charismatic and highly popular political leader who was assassinated while campaigning for the presidency in 1989. In addition to his current post as prosecutor general, a job from which he has seen all of Colombia's cocaine kings either jailed or killed, he has served as ambassador to Israel, education minister and senator.</p>
<p>Valdivieso's leading opponent for the presidency, according to a flurry of recent polls, is Interior Minister Horacio Serpa, a staunch supporter of Samper and frequent critic of the United States.</p>
<p>Serpa, a firebrand populist, is expected to step down within days to launch his own bid to succeed Samper.</p>
<p>Even Serpa, who Valdivieso came close to arresting last year in connection with Samper's allegedly drug-financed campaign, praised the outgoing prosecutor on Thursday as &quot;a respectable, honourable and very intelligent person.&quot;</p>
<p>But Valdivieso, whose campaign is likely to focus on his image as a strongarm crusader against drugs and corruption, could find himself open to attack on many fronts. Serpa himself has noted in recent public speeches that more than 90 percent of all crimes go unpunished in Colombia, which has the highest murder and kidnapping rates in Latin America.</p>
<p>Despite what Valdivieso described as an overwhelming body of evidence that Samper used cocaine cash to fund his campaign, he failed to build a strong enough case against the president to convince Congress to impeach him on drug corruption charges.</p>
