<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>U.S. debt futures ended a shortened day higher in lackluster trade.</p>
<p>Treasury products at the Chicago Board of Trade closed early at 1210 CDT/1710 GMT and Chicago Mercantile Echange Eurodollar futures closed at 1200 CDT. Trade will be closed Monday for Memorial Day.</p>
<p>&quot;It was just dead in here,&quot; a CBOT bond futures trader said. He said volume was extremely light as skeleton crews staffed trading desks and many traders began their long holidays early.</p>
<p>Most contracts posted very tight ranges Friday.  </p>
<p>June T-bonds closed in the middle of their 109-1/32 to 109-12/32 Globex and day session range. A few traders said 109-12/32 -- Thursday's and Friday's high -- was minor resistance.</p>
<p>December Euros also ended squarely in the middle of their overall range of 93.705 to 93.745.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody is gone for the weekend,&quot; a Eurodollar pit source said. &quot;The pit was basically empty.&quot;</p>
<p>He noted no significant futures plays during the last two hours of trade, saying the market was on hold before next week.  </p>
<p>U.S. cash Treasury markets will wrap up trade by 1400 EDT/1800 GMT, and also will be closed on Monday.</p>
<p>Traders noted that the 109-00 to 108-30/32 area corresponds to the seven-percent cash yield and is an area to watch early next week. Support below there in June rests at 108-17/32, the 50-percent retracement of the 1-1/2-month upmove, according to Optima Technical Research.</p>
<p>At the close, June T-bonds were up 04/32 at 109-06/32, September T-bills were up 0.010 at 94.56, September Eurodollars were up 0.015 at 93.970, December Eurodollars were up 0.015 at 93.725 and June 10-year T-notes were up 03/32 at 107-04/32.
