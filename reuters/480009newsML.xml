<title>USA: California measure could pave way for tobacco suit.</title>
<headline>California measure could pave way for tobacco suit.</headline>

<p>A California lawmaker introduced legislation Monday to clear the way for the state to sue tobacco companies to recoup public health care costs related to smoking.</p>
<p>State Assembly Speaker Cruz Bustamante, a Democrat, said his bill would clarify existing state law, removing barriers to California suing the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>California, the most populous state with potentially billions of dollars in claims, has so far not sued major tobacco companies. But pressure has been building in recent weeks on state lawmakers to join the legal battle.</p>
<p>Liggett Group, owned by Bennett LeBow's Brooke Group Ltd., broke ranks in March with other tobacco companies by agreeing to settle with 22 state attorneys general who sued the industry to recoup smoking-related health care costs.</p>
<p>Bustamante said his legislation, introduced in response to the Liggett accord, would clarify an existing product liability law, removing any barriers that prevent Republican state Attorney General Dan Lungren from joining product liability lawsuits against tobacco companies.</p>
<p>Lungren has maintained that state litigation would likely fail because of the controversial 1987 state law shielding tobacco companies from product liability claims.</p>
<p>&quot;California should already be part of lawsuits against tobacco companies,&quot; Bustamante said, adding that once his bill is approved the &quot;attorney general better get out there and work to get the taxpayers' money back from the tobacco companies.&quot;</p>
<p>Last week, a spokesman for Lungren said California would likely join other states in suing the major tobacco companies if the state legislature removes the legal barriers.</p>
<p>&quot;If the legislature acts and changes the law, it is very likely that California will enter into the lawsuit against the tobacco manufacturers,&quot; Lungren spokesman Rob Stutzman said.</p>
<p>Bustamante's urgency legislation would, if approved, take effect immediately. However, urgency bills require two-thirds support to pass. Democrats control both houses of the legislature.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the state legislature passed nonbinding resolutions calling on Lungren to sue major tobacco companies.</p>
<p>There are an estimated four million smokers in California. According to a recent study by the University of California, state taxpayers spent $4.1 billion in Medi-Cal expenses between 1980 and 1993 to treat smoking-related illnesses.</p>
