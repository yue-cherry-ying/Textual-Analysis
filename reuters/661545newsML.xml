<p>When foreign car makers first started rolling into India, Indian tyre firms were among the first to uncork the champagne.</p>
<p>Secure in the knowledge that they stood at the heart of one of the world's fastest growing car markets, they feverishly expanded capacity.</p>
<p>Five years later, they are wringing their hands.</p>
<p>RISING TIDE OF ECONOMIC REFORM</p>
<p>Ironically, it is the rising tide of economic reform, which earlier promised to lift the sector, that now threatens to swamp it.</p>
<p>Foreign car companies were given permission to set up shop in India under an economic reforms programme, launched in 1991, which swept away decades of socialist controls and invited private and foreign investors.</p>
<p>In the same spirit of liberalisation, India announced in April 1997 it was dismantling half a century of barriers to foreign tyre imports and allowing both new and used tyres to be imported freely.</p>
<p>The announcement silenced Indian tyre makers who had been whooping with joy in the earlier phases of liberalisation.</p>
<p>&quot;How can a $440 million Indian company compete with a $14 billion American tyre company?&quot; one senior official at an Indian tyre firm lamented. &quot;It's a question of unequal competition and economies of scale.&quot;</p>
<p>Tyre industry officials say they are worried that used tyres from other countries will soon flood the Indian market.</p>
<p>&quot;Earlier, used tyres used to be burnt. But now environmental groups are stepping up pressure, so they will be dumped in markets like ours,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>&quot;For them it is waste, so it will be sold very cheaply here. Who will buy our tyres then? It will completely disrupt the market.&quot;</p>
<p>FOREIGN TYRE MAKERS EYEING FAST-GROWING MARKET</p>
<p>India's car production grew by 16 percent to 404,040 vehicles in 1996/97 (April-March), and by 32 percent in the previous year.</p>
<p>The Association of Indian Automobile Manufacturers projects car production at 850,000 vehicles by the year 2001.</p>
<p>Large Western car companies such as Mercedes-Benz, Peugeot, General Motors unit Adam Opel, Bayerische Motoren Werke, Fiat and Volkswagen are either already in India or considering entering it.</p>
<p>Asian players eyeing India or already established there include Daewoo Motor, Honda Motor, Mitsubishi Motors, Toyota Motor, Hyundai Motor and Suzuki Motor.</p>
<p>Tyre industry officials say they are worried that most foreign firms will use radial-ply tyres on their cars, which few Indian tyre makers produce.</p>
<p>Only about 30 percent of India's car tyres are radials -- the bulk have traditional cross-ply treads which are well suited for bumpy Indian roads but have shorter lives.</p>
