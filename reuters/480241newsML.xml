<headline>FINNISH EMU PANEL TO PRESENT CONCLUSIONS IN MAY.</headline>
<dateline>HELSINKI 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>A Finnish government-appointed panel of experts on European economic and monetary union will present its conclusions and economic policy recommendations in its main report in May, the group's chairman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The main report will be the phase when the group will come out in its own collective voice, and (it) will contain the economic policy stances and recommendations of the group,&quot; economics professor Jukka Pekkarinen told a news conference.</p>
<p>The main report would be published in the first half of May, he said, adding that the precise date would be announced &quot;in good time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is progressing well,&quot; Pekkarinen said.</p>
<p>The working group on Tuesday published 15 interim reports on various EMU-related issues.</p>
<p>The experts had refrained from drawing economic policy conclusions and issuing recommendations in the interim reports, Pekkarinen said.</p>
<p>&quot;The interim reports -- both those produced within the group and those commissioned from outsiders -- are the researchers' own views,&quot; Pekkarinen said.</p>
<p>&quot;The main report is a different matter from these interim reports,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The writers themselves answer for (their reports), and conclusions should not be drawn from them concerning the main report,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The interim reports serve as an inventory of current research on the topic of EMU from the Finnish perspective, Pekkarinen said.</p>
<p>The experts' group has patterned its working methods after the Swedish Calmfors panel which published a broad study on EMU last year, Pekkarinen said.</p>
