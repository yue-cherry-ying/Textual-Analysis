<p>U.S. and Japanese officials moved closer to agreement on Saturday on a new regional military role for Japan, a U.S. Defence Department spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>That role might include use of Japanese airfields by U.S. warplanes in a conflict, as well as Japanese involvement in minesweeping, enhanced intelligence gathering and Japanese peacekeeping duties, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first time Japan is looking to do more than in the past,&quot; Navy Lt. Cmdr. Karen Jeffries told reporters after a meeting in Hawaii of Japanese and U.S. defence and foreign affairs officials.</p>
<p>The new arrangements were included in an interim report prepared after six months of negotiations to review the 1978 &quot;Guidelines for Defence Cooperation&quot; under the 1960 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the basis of Washington's defence policy in Asia.</p>
<p>The final report, to be issued in November, will spell out details of the new military cooperation, such as the number of airports to be opened to U.S. warplanes in a future conflict.</p>
<p>Last week, Japanese media said Tokyo would -- for the first time -- conduct minesweeping during a conflict, repair U.S. warships and aircraft, join naval blockades of third countries, and fight under a unified military structure if Japan itself is attacked.</p>
<p>&quot;What this allows us to do is to focus on the situation in a post-Cold War world where there is no Soviet Union,&quot; said Frank Kramer, Assistant Secretary of Defence for International Security Affairs, who led the U.S. delegation on Saturday.</p>
<p>Without revealing details, Kramer said: &quot;The overall relationship stays the same. The entire relationship from the Japanese side remains within the constitution and within the context of the U.S.-Japan bilateral alliance.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about concern voiced by China on any new Japanese military role, Kramer said there was &quot;nothing in the guidelines that should be of concern (to Beijing).&quot;</p>
<p>There was no comment to English-speaking reporters from the Japanese delegation, which was led by Masahiro Akiyama, Director General of Defence Policy in the Defence Agency, and Masaki Arita, Director General of the North America Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Japanese media have reported that despite the planned expansion of its role, Tokyo has held out against joining in combat in an armed conflict in Asia or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Japanese officials were wary of making the role too broad because of the country's pacifist constitution, which bans offensive military actions.</p>
