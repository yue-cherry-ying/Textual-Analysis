<title>USA: IBM shares rise on Wall Street outlook.</title>
<headline>IBM shares rise on Wall Street outlook.</headline>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. stock jumped Thursday as two Wall Street firms raised their price targets for the shares a day after an upbeat meeting with the computer maker's chairman.</p>
<p>IBM gained $5.25 to $167.375 in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most active issues.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse First Boston raised its 12-month target price for IBM to $195, from $165, and Prudential Securities said it expects IBM to hit $225, up from $190 previously, and continued to recommend buying the stock.</p>
<p>&quot;I think management is coming out swinging for a very conservative company,&quot; said Ahmet Chopra at First Boston. &quot;They are showing a lot of confidence in their ability to deliver on a business model they have been touting for years.&quot;</p>
<p>IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner met with Wall Street analysts on Wednesday and said the world's biggest computer maker has many opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>&quot;We are a very different company today,&quot; Gerstner said. &quot;We have very specific programmes to go after our competitiors' business. This was not something IBM did in the past because the consent decree made it very difficult for IBM to behave that way.&quot;</p>
<p>Last week a federal judge in New York approved a pact between IBM and the Justice Department ending the remnants of the 1956 consent decree that had limited IBM in what has become its fastest growing business -- computer services.</p>
<p>Gerstner said services was priority for IBM and reiterated the company's goal for overall revenues to grow steadily but not as quickly as some high-tech companies, which he called &quot;meteors&quot; because some eventually burn up.</p>
<p>&quot;We are focused on growing shareholder value,&quot; Gerstner said. &quot;We have a model that is not the model of the meteors.&quot;</p>
<p>Prudential also raised its 1997 earnings estimates to $12.50 a share, from $12.35, citing better expense controls.</p>
<p>IBM earned $1.2 billion, or $2.37 a share, on revenues of $17.3 billion in the first quarter, surpassing most estimates on Wall Street. IBM's fast-growing service businesses offset a decline in its mainframe sales and other lines.</p>
<p>Revenues grew 9 percent in the first quarter, adjusted for currency fluctuations. Service revenues jumped a strong 28 percent while revenue for some hardware, such as mainframe computers, minicomputers and workstations, declined.</p>
<p>Analysts said they were impressed by IBM's focus on its need to get products out swiftly and Gerstner's aggressive attitude.</p>
<p>&quot;The meeting solidified our view that there is significant long-term revenue and earnings growth opportunities which should lead to a huge stock price over the next two to three years,&quot; Salomon Brothers analyst John Jones wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p>Jones said IBM shares should be worth $180 as its earnings grow a projected 15 percent in coming quarters.</p>
<p>IBM led a rally in blue-chip stocks as well as the high-technology sector. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 50.97 points to 7,136.62 after falling 140 points on Wednesday.</p>
