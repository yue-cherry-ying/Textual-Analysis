<p>South Korea's Kia Group, hit by slumping sales and a challenge from Samsung Motors, has emerged stronger than before because of new labour-management harmony, chairman Kim Sun-hong said on Monday.</p>
<p>Emphasising the difficulties faced by the carmaker, Kim said: &quot;The experience has been so painful, we've viewed the landscape of hell&quot;.</p>
<p>But he said the hardship had thrown union and management together to fend off any hostile raids. The result was accord on a far-reaching reorganisation programme.</p>
<p>With agreement to curb pay, cut jobs and shed assets -- and a slew of new models boosting domestic sales in the second half of this year -- the future was looking bright, Kim told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;A sense of crisis, stemming from outside challenges, has made union and management unite behind a cause. Now I think we can defend ourselves from any takeover bullies,&quot; Kim said.</p>
<p>Kim was bitter about the challenge from Samsung, widely seen as a potential hostile raider.</p>
<p>An internal Samsung memo leaked to the media last month suggested there were &quot;managerial conflicts&quot; at Kia Motors and hinted that Samsung may be interested in furthering its auto ambitions by acquiring Kia, analysts said.</p>
<p>Samsung is set to roll out its first cars next March. But its automaking unit is running short of cash, analysts say, and needs further technology.</p>
<p>Buying Kia -- with its advanced technology and large network of suppliers and sales outlets -- would be the easiest way to turn Samsung into a major player.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome fair competition, but leaking groundless rumours intended to hurt someone is unethical,&quot; Kim said.</p>
<p>Years of heavy capital investment were now starting to pay off with up-to-date assembly lines that could respond flexibly to market conditions, Kim said.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic sales will begin to pick up in the second half with the debut of a slew of new models and a newly established sales company,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said Kia Motors sales, including exports, would reach 850,000 to 900,000 units this year, up from last year's 770,000, but down from its target of 950,000.</p>
<p>Worries over Kia's financial health had been growing for months before the Samsung memo sparked fears that the group may not survive. Domestic sales had been badly hit by strikes in January and an economic downturn.</p>
<p>The company's vehicle sales in the first half of this year dropped to 160,000 units from 220,000 units a year earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour-management relations were our weakest point. But that has changed dramatically,&quot; Kim said.</p>
<p>Unions of Kia Motors and Asia Motors, a commercial vehicle unit, abandoned this year's wage round and agreed to accept any management offer. Asia Motors unions also agreed to job cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;We can push ahead with our restructuring programme strongly now with the help of the labour unions. I think the financial community has now a much better understanding of our conditions,&quot; Kim said.</p>
<p>The group is seeking to cut Kia Motors' 20,000-strong workforce by 10 percent. Asia Motors union agreed to a reduction of 1,447 jobs from 9,200.</p>
<p>The group earlier said it would sell some 795 billion won ($896 million) worth of idle assets.</p>
<p>Kia's moves, analysts and bankers said, would reassure skittish lenders.</p>
<p>Last week South Korean banks agreed to supply $300 million in export loans to the group to help ease its financial strain, Kia's prime creditor Korea First Bank said.</p>
<p>Kia plans to introduce five new models this year, including an upgrade of its sub-compact Sephia and a new mini-van. ($ = 887.10 won)</p>
