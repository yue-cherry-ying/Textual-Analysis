<title>USA: House Republicans push bill to close Energy Dept.</title>

<p>House Republicans Thursday introduced legislation to eliminate the Energy Department and farm out some of its programmes to other agencies.</p>
<p>Reps. Todd Tiahrt of Kansas and Ed Royce of California proposed the bill which they said would save about $5 billion a year and would abolish an unnecessary bureaucracy.</p>
<p>&quot;The Department of Energy has outlived its purpose. It was founded in 1976 on a dubious idea -- that this country needed a national energy policy coordinated by Washington bureaucrats -- and his since grown into a multi-billion dollar bureaucracy with numerous missions and questionable priorities,&quot; Royce said at a news conference.</p>
<p>The bill, which would transfer the Energy Department's nuclear weapons programme to the Defence Department, is a companion to one introduced earlier in the Senate by Minnesota Republican Rod Grams.</p>
<p>The bill would transfer other Energy Department functions to the Interior Department and the Army Corp of Engineers.</p>
<p>Similar legislation died last year because of stiff opposition from the White House.</p>
<p>Critics contend the legislation would merely shuffle expenses around instead of producing actual savings, and argue that nuclear weapons programmes should be under a civilian agency instead of the Defence Department.</p>
<p>Tiahrt and Grams, who also spoke at the news conference, said they thought the legislation had a better chance this year because the balanced budget deal will force Congress and the White House to look for spending cuts.</p>
<p>Grams said he hoped to move the bill through the Senate Energy Committee this month, and to the Senate floor in June or July.</p>
<p>Tiarht said he hoped for House committee hearings on his bill this summer.</p>
