<p>Thailand's oil trading and investment arm, PTT International has gained a piece of China's bourgeoning retail market with a joint venture petrol station chain in Guangdong province, industry sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 10-station chain comes under the brand Petroasia, a joint venture between PTT International with a 30-percent stake, China's state refiner Sinopec with 40 percent and Thai conglomerate Charoen Pokphand Group with 30 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;There are now 10 petrol stations in Guangdong, which includes three newly opened ones,&quot; a source close to PTT said. &quot;We expect to have 20 stations this year altogether.&quot;</p>
<p>The joint venture aims to have 100 petrol stations within five years in China, the source said.</p>
<p>The foray into China's retail market is part of state-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand's (PTT) strategy of investing elsewhere in Asia through PTT International, formed in a major restructuring in February last year.  </p>
<p>In addition to supplying the Philippines market, PTT International is also aiming to boost bulk sales to southern China where it currently sells about 30,000 tonnes of diesel each month.</p>
<p>&quot;The target of supply from Subic Bay is Guangdong because of the Hong Kong handover,&quot; the source said. &quot;We want to be another supply source to China in terms of small lot sales of mostly diesel and fuel oil.&quot;  </p>
<p>Trading sources said with the handover of the British colony to China at the end of June, Hong Kong would be less important as the main conduit of oil products into southern China, opening up opportunities for other supply centres such as Subic Bay.</p>
<p>&quot;China is not an easy market, as there are many things to be considered such as prices, payment, regulation and connections,&quot; the source said. For example it took PTT International about three years to start the petrol station venture.  </p>
<p>The source said oil products for the petrol stations were supplied from Sinopec's refineries as well as from a Subic Bay storage terminal in the Philippines.</p>
<p>PTT International has a joint venture in the Philippines with Coastal Aruba Refining Co N.V. called Subic Bay Petroleum Product Ltd and it leases a 2.4-million-barrel oil depot, equally divided to store diesel and fuel oil.</p>
<p>The source said PTT International aimed to improve its marketing plan to maker greater use of storage depot, now operating at 40 percent capacity.  </p>
<p>Before that PTT International's focus in China was on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), with a joint venture worth $90 million to build an 50,000-tonne capacity LPG depot in the southeastern Chinese town of Shantuo.</p>
<p>The source also said PTT Philippines Inc's five-year plan was to build 150 petrol stations mainly in northern Luzon island, started in November with two stations in Subic.</p>
<p>Under the 2.25-billion-pesos plan ($85.55 million), PTT Philippines also plans to build a string of petrol stations along the Subic Bay-Luzon highway.  </p>
<p>PTT International also sealed a term contract last year to supply 10,000-15,000 tonnes of diesel a month to Burma.</p>
<p>It is hoping to get a foothold into the Indian market in the near future by entering into a joint venture with a local firm.</p>
