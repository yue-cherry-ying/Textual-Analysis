<text>
<p>Jordan's shares drifted lower again on Tuesday to their lowest level since January, with trade battered by absence of outside buying along with a liquidity crunch, dealers said.</p>
<p>The official Amman Financial Market (AFM) index fell 0.10 percent to 151.63 points, close to levels at the beginning of January when the 60-share index started 1997 at 151.61 points.</p>
<p>Bloc purchases in heavyweight Arab Bank accounted for nearly half of Tuesday's turnover of 635,757 dinars ($898,000).</p>
<p>&quot;The market was weak across the board,&quot; broker Husam al-Hanbali said.</p>
<p>Brokers attribute a bearish sentiment to a combination of factors including lack of outside institutional buying, a tight liquidity problem worsened by political uncertainty over the fate of Middle East peace.</p>
<p>Overall 20 shares fell, led by Arab Bank, which lost 1.5 dinars to 250 dinars in trade worth 312,010 dinars. Only 10 stock gained and 15 remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Brokers said the bank, which announced on Friday a 17.7 percent rise in 1996 net profits but declined to set a date for a planned bonus share offer, fell victim to the overall negative sentiment on the bourse.</p>
<p>The private Pearl Index of the 45 most-traded shares on the exchange shed 0.12 percent to 79.49 points, 4.68 percent down from the start of the year.</p>
