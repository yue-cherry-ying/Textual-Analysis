<p>Party election commercials aired on state-run television before Albania's last general election 13 months ago held out the promise of a life of luxury and a future safely in the fold of Europe.</p>
<p>The advertisements are vastly different for Sunday's election, since hundreds of thousands of people lost their life savings when shady investment schemes collapsed, unleashing civil violence across the Balkan nation,</p>
<p>This time, they offer such basics as law and order, a future for the children and Albania's integrity.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year's ads were about a comfortabe life, this time they are just about a safe life,&quot; said a campaign worker for President Sali Berisha's dominant Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The right-leaning Democrats face their main challenge from the Socialist Party for control of the 155-seat parliament after a hard-fought campaign contested by 27 parties.</p>
<p>Political commercials were unknown until last year's election in Albania, which emerged only in 1990 from almost half a century of Stalinist isolation.</p>
<p>In little more than a year, the ads have been refined to a level respectable by Western advertising standards. Their themes range from the emotional to the melodramatic, from the tranquil to the blatantly violent.</p>
<p>In a Democrat ad, the camera flies low over a green meadow dotted with daisies. A shot is heard and the screen turns black and white. Two windowpanes in a kindergarten appear, stained with black handprints to symbolise the thousands killed or injured in the violence.</p>
<p>The camera finally shows the frightened faces of small children to the sound of the hit song &quot;We are the World&quot; and a girl says &quot;think of us, vote for us&quot; before the blue Democratic Party logo appears.</p>
<p>The theme of children appealing to grown-ups to halt the violence and to bring smiles back to their faces is a popular one in a country where family values are held in high regard.</p>
<p>The rightist Republican Party's spot uses a chubby toddler walking across the beach towards a crumbled toy castle. He rebuilds it to the melancholic soundtrack of &quot;Love Story&quot;.</p>
<p>The Socialists feature a young woman emerging from the sea, running across a beach and a field of yellow flowers to reach a ballot box. Albania's red-and-black flag disappears into the box and viewers are urged to &quot;Vote for the Nation.&quot;</p>
<p>The monarchists, campaigning for the reinstatement of King Leka I who has spent most of his life in comfortable exile in South Africa, play to the theme of pomp and glory. Their spot features a golden royal crown, a sword and the scales of justice decorated with a green branch.</p>
<p>The crown appears to fly across the capitals of several European monarchies, holding out the promise that dilapidated Tirana may one day look like London, Madrid or Copenhagen.</p>
<p>The rightist Democratic Union reminds Albanians of the horrors of the country descending into anarchy. Its ad features an axe held above the bloodied face of an injured man lying on the ground, followed by a close-up of a bullet-pierced body.</p>
<p>Many Albanians, who lost as much as $1.2 billion in savings, blame the violence sparked by the collapse of the dubious schemes on Berisha's government. The Democrats in turn accuse the Socialists of inciting the violence.</p>
<p>The early election was called in March to stop Europe's poorest country from sliding into the abyss. An Italian-dominated international force was sent to help to restore order and ensure the safety of some 500 election monitors.</p>
