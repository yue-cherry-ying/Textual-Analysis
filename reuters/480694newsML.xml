<p>A French diplomat said on Monday it would not be a tragedy if the United Nations moved to another country, and castigated New York City's mass transit system as a disaster.</p>
<p>The legal adviser of France's U.N. mission, Hubert Legal, was addressing a U.N. committee the day before the start of a new city programme under which diplomats would no longer be exempt from paying parking fines.</p>
<p>At the same time, each diplomatic mission would be guaranteed two parking spaces and one space outside the home of each ambassador, while a special police &quot;hot line&quot; would be set up so that any unauthorised vehicles using those spots could be towed away.</p>
<p>But some elements of the plan have been challenged by the U.N. legal counsel, Under-Secretary-General Hans Corell of Sweden, as being contrary to international law.</p>
<p>These include a provision under which diplomatic vehicles whose parking fines remain unpaid for a year would be deprived of their diplomatic license plates.</p>
<p>Legal, the French representative on the 15-member committee on relations with the host country, said: &quot;Were the United States to feel that it is impossible under current conditions to play host to diplomatic functions under appropriate conditions, well then I would put it this way -- it would not be a tragedy, there are other possibilities.</p>
<p>&quot;New York is not the only place to put the United Nations. There is Geneva, there is Vienna and other places. Nothing would stand in the way of this organisation transferring a more important portion of what it does to either Geneva or Vienna, for instance,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Legal noted that nothing in the U.N. Charter required the General Assembly or the Security Council to meet in New York.</p>
<p>He said Geneva and Vienna had &quot;a great deal of tradition, culture and civilisation to offer, where the exercise of diplomatic functions is respected and where the kinds of problems you run into here simply isn't encountered.&quot;</p>
<p>In those cities, when diplomatic missions celebrated their national days the local police were on hand to ensure everything went smoothly. But in New York, it was &quot;quite the opposite,&quot; with police showing up &quot;to issue tickets, systematically so, as soon as vehicles show up.&quot;</p>
<p>Dismissing any suggestion that diplomats might rely on New York's public transport system, Legal said it was &quot;disastrously poor in quality, the New York subway being a blot on the ... city.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are talking about an outdated, dangerous and dirty set of services, worse than in many major capitals, indeed many major capitals in the developing world,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The buses were &quot;remarkable -- yes indeed, if you have three hours to wait.&quot; As for the taxis, &quot;most of those are wrecks which in countries that have appropriate traffic police would not even be allowed on the road.&quot;</p>
<p>Legal, backed by the representatives of Russia, Spain, Iraq, Honduras, Ivory Coast, Costa Rica, China and Cyprus, proposed that the new parking rules be discussed urgently by the General Assembly, in which all 185 U.N. members are represented.</p>
<p>A decision on that proposal was deferred until Tuesday.</p>
