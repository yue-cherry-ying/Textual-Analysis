<p>The Taiwan dollar slid against the U.S. dollar on Friday, hitting an 11-month closing low for the third straight session amid strong U.S. dollar demand from importers and non-delivery forward trading, dealers said.</p>
<p>The local unit ended at T$27.824 against Thursday's T$27.810 close. The Taiwan dollar has not closed lower since its T$27.892 finish on May 28, 1996.</p>
<p>Turnover through dealers was an active US$258 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Local banks have actively sold U.S. dollars, but greenback demand from importers and non-delivery forward trading conducted through foreign banks is even stronger,&quot; said one dealer.  </p>
<p>Persistent outflows of foreign funds as they took profits from the stock market were factors behind the Taiwan dollar's steady recent depreciation, including Friday's, dealers said.</p>
<p>Capital outflows triggered by worries over social disorder and ongoing constitutional reforms also had depressed the Taiwan dollar, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Most dealers have agreed that the Taiwan dollar is in a gradual downtrend in the near term,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>For Saturday, a T$27.80-27.84 range was seen.</p>
