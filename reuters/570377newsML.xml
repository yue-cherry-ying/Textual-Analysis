<p>U.S. Treasuries slid in London on Thursday, driven lower by a bout of dollar/yen nervousness, dealers said.</p>
<p>With an overhang of 10-year paper clogging the market from Wednesday's disappointing auction, paper was vulnerable to a more losses, they added.</p>
<p>The dollar slumped against the yen in early European trade as comments from Japan's &quot;Mr Yen&quot; -- Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara -- stirred up market talk of central bank intervention.</p>
<p>Sakakibara said the past year's currency movements raised the chance the Japanese currency could strengthen, possibly to 103 per dollar.</p>
<p>By 1012 GMT, the 30-year long bond was at 95-19 to yield 6.98 percent, down from 95-24 in Tokyo and New York. The dollar had slipped from around 124.70 yen just before the remarks to a low of 123.40.</p>
<p>&quot;Treasuries have sold off a bit this morning following the dollar/yen nervousness,&quot; said one dealer at a U.S. bank here, adding customer flows were light as most European markets were closed for the Ascension Day holiday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was still suffering an overhang of supply from Wednesday's less than successful 10-year auction.</p>
<p>&quot;Dealers are still long because of the overhang from the sloppy 10-year auction yesterday, so we're probably heading lower as investors fight to distribute the paper,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The Treasury sold $12 billion of 10-year notes at an average 6.74 percent yield and a bid-to-cover ratio at 1.86, well below its recent average of 2.41 and its lowest in two years.</p>
<p>Analysts said a lack of data releases to distract the market for the remainder of the week meant investors would start to look to next week's action-packed agenda.</p>
<p>Retail sales, producer and consumer prices and industrial production figures for April will all be combed for pointers on the Fed's interest rate policy.</p>
<p>&quot;If we see a strong retail sales number next week, the market must worry that the slowdown in growth is not in the pipeline,&quot; said David Bloom, economist at HSBC James Capel in London.</p>
<p>He still expected the Fed to tighten at the May 20 Federal Open Market Committe meeting.</p>
<p>By 1014 GMT, the June T-bond future was down 6/32 at 109-04.</p>
