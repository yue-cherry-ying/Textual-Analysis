<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Friday defended Germany's plans to revalue the Bundesbank's gold reserves, saying many other European Union countries already valued their reserves higher.</p>
<p>Kohl was asked during a summit of EU leaders whether Germany's plans to revalue the gold constituted &quot;creative accounting&quot; in the run-up to Europe's single currency.</p>
<p>Speaking at a news conference, he responded by listing values of gold in other countries.</p>
<p>&quot;The price of an ounce of gold at the end of 1996 was $369,&quot; he said. &quot;Now I will read out to you the levels at which the EU countries value gold. It will interest you. In prices per ounce, Germany is at $92, France at $370, the United Kingdom at $297, Italy at $380....&quot;</p>
<p>He went on to list the book value price of gold in all other EU countries, showing that only two, Sweden and Luxembourg, used a lower value than Germany.</p>
<p>Revaluing the Bundesbank's gold reserves could produce a windfall profit for the government.</p>
<p>However, the government could not use this directly to cut the budget deficit to three percent of gross doemstic product (GDP), a key target for countries wanting to join economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Pressed on whether such a revaluation at this stage posed a problem for the stability of the future European currency, Kohl said: &quot;I do not see that at all.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an accounting issue. There is a market price. We have been using the lowest price principle. Othes use the market price. I want a strong European currency.&quot;</p>
<p>Germany last week announced plans to revalue the Bundesbank's gold and foreign exchange reserves in a move which they say is necessary before the transfer of reserves to the European Central Bank.</p>
<p>The move sparked accusations from some that Germany was seeking creative ways to reduce its budget deficit.</p>
<p>Under EU rules, any gains from the revaluation of gold could be used to reduce debt but not as a direct contribution to offset budget spending.</p>
<p>Separately, Luxembourg's prime minister and finance minister Jean-Claude Juncker told reporters that he had no problem with Germany's plans to revalue its assets.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no difficulty with the move as they are not selling the gold to reduce budget deficits,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kohl and Juncker were attending a summit of EU leaders and foreign ministers in the Dutch coastal resort of Noordwijk. The summit was called to assess progress in drawing up a new treaty on European integration.</p>
