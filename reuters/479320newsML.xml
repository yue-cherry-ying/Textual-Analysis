<p>Cummins Engine Co Inc said Tuesday it expected earnings for the first quarter to approach $1.00 a share. The company reported earnings per share of $1.21 a year ago.</p>
<p>Profit before tax in the first quarter is expected to be higher than in the fourth quarter of 1996 on somewhat lower sales, the company said.  </p>
<p>The diesel engine maker reported sales of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter and $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Cummins chairman and chief executive officer Jim Henderson told shareholders that business conditions are favorable in most of its markets at this time, the company said in a news release.</p>
<p>&quot;If business conditions continue as they are now, we expect higher earnings in the second quarter than the first,&quot; Henderson said.  </p>
<p>The company's first quarter ended on March 31.</p>
<p>Cummins said gross savings from a restructuring undertaken in 1996 will grow to $80 million in 1998 from $50 million in 1996.</p>
<p>Cummins closed eight plants and five distribution centers, eliminated six businesses, and reduced employment by 2,300 people through the restructuring, the company said.</p>
<p>Cummins is also investing more than $1 billion in capital and product development from 1996 through 1999, the company said.</p>
<p>&quot;By the year 2000, we will replace today's entire product line with the most advanced engines, product support and information technology in the world,&quot; Cummins president Tim Solso said.</p>
<p>Cummins shares were down 1-1/4 at 50 Tuesday before being halted for news dissemination.</p>
