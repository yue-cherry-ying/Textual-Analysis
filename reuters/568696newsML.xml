<p>A first half goal by Fabio Pecchia gave Napoli a 1-0 win over Vicenza in a scrappy, foul-riddled Italian Cup final first leg on Thursday.</p>
<p>Vicenza, who have never won any major trophy in their 95-year history, started the game strongly but were swiftly pegged back by an aggressive Napoli attack.</p>
<p>Midfielder Pecchia, tipped as a future Italian international, broke the deadlock in the 20th minute.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old latched onto a pass from Mauro Milanese in the middle of the box and scored with an acrobatic flick.</p>
<p>The southern Italian side, roared on by passionate 72,000 home crowd who have had little to cheer since Napoli won the league title in 1990, came close to scoring again only minutes later through a firm header from Argentine striker Roberto Ayala.</p>
<p>But quick reflexes by Vicenza goalkeeper Pierluigi Brivio stopped the ball and Napoli rarely threatened thereafter as a stream of fouls slowed the rhythm of the game.</p>
<p>Vicenza took more of the initiative in the second half and came close to equalising with a blistering free kick by Gabriele Ambrosetti, which brushed the side netting.</p>
<p>&quot;You didn't see the best of Vicenza tonight, but we can certainly bounce back from this,&quot; Vicenza's manager Francesco Guidolin said after the match.</p>
<p>The second leg is on May 29 in Vicenza.</p>
