<p>Two bombs exploded in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday in what Israel said were Palestinian suicide attacks aimed at Jewish settlers.</p>
<p>The Israeli army said two bombers died in separate attacks, one of which wounded five Arabs in a taxi. No Israelis were hurt. Palestinian police could not confirm whether the two men had blown themselves up deliberately.</p>
<p>The Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas denied it was behind the explosions and accused Israel of ordering the blasts to sour relations between Hamas and Yasser Arafat's self-rule Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>The blasts came against a backdrop of stalled Israeli-PLO peace talks and Israeli accusations that Arafat has failed to curb Palestinian militants in the areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip that he controls.</p>
<p>Arafat said one man had blown himself up and accused Israeli soldiers of shooting the other.</p>
<p>&quot;This morning, one blew himself up on the road. In (sic) the same time an Israeli jeep opened fire on two taxis. One Palestinian was killed and five were injured,&quot; Arafat told a meeting of foreign donors in Gaza.</p>
<p>&quot;What will be the reaction from our side, to control more and more? For every pressure there is a reaction. This is natural law,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>An Israeli army spokesman rejected Arafat's account.</p>
<p>&quot;As regards Chairman Arafat's remark, it is absolutely incorrect. There were two suicide attacks and two bombs,&quot; the spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Israeli military sources said one of the dead men wore a suicide bomb belt, and the other wore the uniform of the Palestinian police.</p>
<p>A senior Palestinian security official said police were trying to identify the dead men in an attempt to &quot;clear the ambiguities&quot; surrounding their deaths.</p>
<p>Earlier, other Palestinian police officials had said that a man with five kg (11 lb) of explosives on his back blew himself up on the side of the road at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) about two km (1.5 miles) from the Jewish settlement of Netzarim south of Gaza City.</p>
<p>&quot;We doubt that they were suicide bombings and we are checking the two explosions. No Israelis were in the area and there are no holes in the ground,&quot; Gaza police commander, Major-General Abdel-Razik Majaida, said.</p>
<p>In the second blast about two km (1.5 miles) from Kfar Darom near the Palestinian refugee camp of Deir al-Balah, the presumed bomber was also standing beside the road, Palestinian police said, adding the five Palestinians were wounded in this explosion.</p>
<p>In the past both Jewish settlements have been the focus of Palestinian attacks.</p>
<p>Hamas official Sayed Abu Musameh blamed Israel for the blasts.</p>
<p>&quot;This bombing was done by the Israeli intelligence and its (Palestinian) collaborators in an attempt to create an internal problem between the Islamic movement and the Palestinian Authority,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Last month Hamas claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv in which three Israeli women were killed.</p>
<p>In a separate incident on Tuesday, a Palestinian was shot dead in the West Bank city of Hebron. Israeli police said the man ran into a policeman with his car at an Israeli roadblock near the West Bank Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba. They said the policeman opened fire, wounding a passenger.</p>
<p>A Palestinian witness said he ran to the road on hearing a shot and found a man, wearing pyjamas and slippers, lying in the road. He did not have a car. Clashes erupted nearby after the shooting.</p>
<p>Israeli-Palestinian relations have plunged into crisis since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu broke ground on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem last month. Israeli soldiers have clashed for 13 straight days with stone-throwing Palestinian protesters in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Both Gaza explosions occurred around 7 a.m., about the time Israeli children leave two nearby Jewish settlements on buses for school, Jewish settlers said.</p>
<p>There was no explanation why the two explosions occurred when they did, far from any Israeli soldiers or civilians.</p>
<p>Israeli radio stations suggested that two suicide bombers had mistakenly blown themselves up before their intended time.</p>
<p>Jewish settlers in the area said a PLO police outpost near the Netzarim explosion was unmanned at the time of the blast.</p>
<p>They claimed this showed there was collusion between the Palestinian Authority and the planners of the explosion.</p>
