<title>SINGAPORE: YHS to launch second Singapore property.</title>
<headline>YHS to launch second Singapore property.</headline>

<p>Property interests will make a fairly big contribution to the earnings of soft drinks firm Yeo Hiap Seng Ltd (YHS) in future, managing director and chief executive officer Alex Chan said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;From the sheer fact that our property business has just started and is growing from zero base, its contribution will no doubt be growing. I expect its contribution to be fairly big in relations to food and beverage,&quot; Alex Chan told Reuters.</p>
<p>Chan was speaking ahead of the May 10 soft launch of The Sterling, the company's second private residential property in Singapore.  </p>
<p>The upmarket condomimium project along Bukit Timah in central Singapore, will be a freehold development of 232 apartments ranging from about 1,000 sq ft to 2,250 sq ft. Prices would average Singapore $1,100 per sq ft, after discount, Chan said.</p>
<p>He said sales were expected to be fairly good but declined to give any projections.</p>
<p>Asked if YHS would be interested in developing executive condomimiums for upmarket public housing, Chan said: &quot;We have to study that. It would have to be a business proposition.&quot;  </p>
<p>He said YHS was not threatened by the government's move to provide upscale public housing, a niche now held by the private sector developers.</p>
<p>The Sterling, which will be completed in 2001, was expected to contribute to the group only from 1998, Chan said.</p>
<p>He added YHS continued to look to buy land in Singapore to add to its existing land bank of 950,840 sq ft, inclusive of its two factory sites at Bukit Timah and Dunearn Road.</p>
<p>Chan said the group planned to focus rationalisation plans on its core food and beverage operations.  </p>
<p>It plans to have five manufacturing food and beverage plants in China from one now. Chan declined to disclose the investment budget, but said each plant would cost about US$10 million to build.</p>
<p>Expansion plans are also seen for Thailand and Indonesia, Chan said.</p>
