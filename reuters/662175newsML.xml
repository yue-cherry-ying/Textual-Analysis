<p>British Columbia is set to announce legislation paving the way for the province to sue tobacco companies to recoup medical costs for treating smokers, people familiar with the plan said Sunday.</p>
<p>The move would make British Columbia the first province in Canada and possibly the first government outside the United States to pursue such action, similar to the approach taken by 37 U.S. states, legal experts said.</p>
<p>British Columbia Premier Glen Clark and Health Minister Joy MacPhail will hold a news conference on Monday to announce a new attack against smoking, the government said in an advisory on Sunday.</p>
<p>Provincial officials were not available for further comment. But the government has said since last year it was planning to pursue legal action against tobacco companies.</p>
<p>Legal sources said the announcement would include details on new legislation enabling the government to sue. &quot;They reviewed the existing class-action legislation and decided they felt they had a better case with separate legislation,&quot; said one source.</p>
<p>Vancouver's Province newspaper reported Sunday that the legislation is aimed at forcing tobacco companies into negotiations over paying the costs of health care for smoking-related illness.</p>
<p>British Columbia's government-funded health care program pays out an estimated $420 million Canadian to $560 million Canadian ($311 million U.S. to $415 million U.S.) a year for smoking-related illnesses.</p>
<p>In the United States, negotiations are under set to resume this week between state and federal government officials and cigarette makers over a multi-billion dollar settlement.</p>
<p>The British Columbia government will also announce at Monday's news conference smoking-prevention measures, especially initiatives aimed at hampering tobacco companies from attracting young people to their products, sources said.</p>
<p>Canada's federal government said last month it was considering possible lawsuits against tobacco companies and other provinces are also said to be exploring the idea.</p>
<p>The incentives for governments to sue in Canada are even greater than in the United States because health care is provided universally and funded publicly.</p>
<p>But the risks are also greater. Damage awards have historically been far lower in Canada than in the United States, and under Canadian law, the government would be forced to pay the industry's legal costs.</p>
<p>Imperial Tobacco Ltd., a unit of Imasco Ltd. controls about 65 percent of the Canadian cigarette market. Imasco is 40 percent owned by B.A.T Industries Plc of Britain.</p>
<p>The second biggest company, Rothmans, Benson and Hedges Inc., is 60 percent owned by Rothmans Inc. and 40 percent by Philip Morris Cos Inc. Rothmans Inc is a unit of Rothmans International Plc which is owned by Swiss luxury goods holding company Cie Financiere Richmont AG.</p>
<p>Third place holder RJR MacDonald iw wholly owned by RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. unit R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International. American cigarette brands are also sold in Canada.</p>
