<headline>Yeltsin signs Belarus deal, confirms defence chief.</headline>

<p>President Boris Yeltsin signed a charter on Friday detailing Russia's political union with neighbouring Belarus and confirmed a replacement for the defence minister he dramatically sacked for failing to reform the army.</p>
<p>In the midst of an effervescent bout of political activity that will also see Yeltsin sign a post-Cold War treaty with NATO on Tuesday, Russia's communist-dominated parliament protracted the agony over a budget crisis by ordering the government to find new revenues before it will consider drastic spending cuts.</p>
<p>The 66-year-old Yeltsin, who three months ago appeared destined to spend his four-year second term as a virtual invalid, seemed to be revelling in the action.</p>
<p>He made a rare meet-the-people outing to his granddaughter's Moscow high school on Friday. Underlining his determination to see through market and democratic reforms in his remaining three years in the Kremlin, a trim and buoyant Yeltsin explained his plans to the teenagers and told them he was &quot;optimistic&quot;.</p>
<p>He was similarly upbeat at a glittering Kremlin ceremony later in the day to sign the charter of the Russia-Belarus Union Treaty with President Alexander Lukashenko.</p>
<p>The treaty itself was signed with similar pomp on April 2.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said that the union charter, which along with the treaty is still to be ratified by both parliaments, would promote closer cooperation between the two nations and peoples.</p>
<p>&quot;The spirit of unity between our countries and our peoples is based on the firm foundation of many centuries of common history,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The charter is designed to add substance to the pact. But differences make it unclear exactly what impact it will have.</p>
<p>After building his political career on plans for union, Lukashenko has lately fought shy of submerging Belarus into a greater Russia and wants Minsk to be Moscow's equal. He said on Friday that a disputed clause committing the two Slav states to move towards a single federative state had been withdrawn.</p>
<p>Russian liberals first opposed the union, fearing economic and political damage from ties to the authoritarian Lukashenko. But recently they have changed tactics by pushing for such close integration that Lukashenko fears being totally taken over.</p>
<p>He still backs closer links, however. &quot;We are just going to put into writing the process of integration between our countries which is already unfolding,&quot; he told Russian radio.</p>
<p>Opinion polls show that a majority of people in both countries favours integration of the two nations.</p>
<p>A union with Belarus could extend Moscow's effective territorial domain right back to the western frontier of the old Soviet Union, bordering Poland. Supporters of the deal see it as an appropriate response to Polish intentions to join NATO.</p>
<p>Yeltsin says Russia remains strongly opposed to the western alliance's plan to expand eastward but concluded an accord with NATO last week to give Moscow a say in its affairs and some assurances that expansion will not alter the military balance.</p>
<p>The NATO-Russia Founding Act will be signed in Paris on Tuesday by Yeltsin and leaders of the 16 NATO members, in spite of parliamentary opposition in Moscow.</p>
<p>Deputies in the State Duma lower house said they were likely to declare their opposition after hearing Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov. They cannot block the treaty, however.</p>
<p>While Moscow is slowly putting its external affairs in order after the Cold War, making peace with NATO and edging its way into international bodies like the Group of Seven main industrial nations, its huge armed forces remain underfunded.</p>
<p>In an extraordinary outburst on national television on Thursday, Yeltsin sacked his defence minister, Igor Rodionov, for failing to tackle reforms of the army aimed at slimming down the forces and making them more professional.</p>
<p>On Friday, he confirmed General Igor Sergeyev, head of the Strategic Missile command, as Rodionov's permanent replacement.</p>
<p>General Anatoly Kvashnin, a veteran of the 1994-96 Chechen debacle, was named acting head of the general staff.</p>
<p>Sergeyev, 59, is a respected career officer and intellectual, whom the Kremlin's civilian defence planners are banking on to reform the army without asking for more money. Many analysts agree with Rodionov that it is an impossible task.</p>
<p>The lack of money, however, is as real as the army's problems with low pay and rusting equipment.</p>
<p>Government officials had been due to present plans to parliament on Friday for 20 percent spending cuts made necessary by a huge tax shortfall.</p>
<p>But before they got the chance, the communist-dominated Duma voted overwhelmingly not to listen to the scheme. The deputies demanded the government present plans to raise new revenue by June 1. Only after that will they consider the cuts.</p>
