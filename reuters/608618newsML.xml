<p>South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said on Friday he would not seek to persuade Congolese rebel leader Laurent Kabila to include veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi in his new transitional government</p>
<p>Mbeii, who played a key role in President Nelson Mandela's attempt to ensure a peaceful transition in the former Zaire during seven months of civil war, told reporters that South Africa could not afford to interfere in the country's internal politics.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't sought to intervene in any way in terms of the political personalities in the Congo in terms of saying so-and-so should be or so-and-so should not be part of this government,&quot; said Mbeki, speaking in the Zimbabwean capital Harare.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly, Tshisekedi represents an important political constituency in the country and I would imagine that the alliance would want to ensure that that particular constituency was represented in the government.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether it would be Tshisekedi in person or somebody else I don't know. But we haven't sought in any way to intervene in that process.&quot;</p>
<p>Tshisekedi, who was excluded from the partial government announced by Kabila on Thursday night, commands a huge popular following in Kinshasa as the leading civilian foe of Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko who held power for 32 years.</p>
<p>His followers, who had expected him to be named prime minister, took to the streets on Friday denouncing Kabila's government as Tshisekedi told reporters that he would not recognise the government, but still wanted to meet Kabila.</p>
<p>Earlier, Mbeki cautioned that Kabila's government in the newly-renamed Democratic Republic of Congo could not afford to rush into elections, saying there were serious obstacles to achieving a fair poll so soon after taking power.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be unfair to say to somebody who walked into Kinshasa the day before yesterday: 'Set a date for elections'. They can't and if they did it would be entirely a thumbsuck,&quot; said Mbeki.</p>
<p>He said however he had no doubt that Kabila's alliance was dedicated to calling elections following its successful rebellion which toppled Mobutu, who fled Kinshasa on May 16.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to take a bit of time,&quot; Mbeki said. &quot;There are enormous problems...just in terms of drawing up a voters' roll. But there is definitely a commitment to the holding of elections.&quot;</p>
<p>Mbeki reported earlier this week that a European Union team had explored the possibilities for an early election in Zaire last year and had reported problems caused by infrastructure, roads, administration and the unresolved of issue of the nationality of some residents.</p>
