<headline>SOCCER-MATCHES THIS WEEKEND IN THE SPANISH LEAGUE.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Games scheduled for this weekend in the Spanish championship (league standings in parentheses, kick-off times GMT):</p>
<p>Playing Saturday:</p>
<p>    Barcelona (2) v Deportivo Coruna (3)	1830</p>
<p>A crunch match that Barcelona must win to have any chance of taking the title. Deportivo's hopes of taking second place and with it a European Cup spot also depend on a win.</p>
<p>Playing Sunday:</p>
<p>Tenerife (10) v Racing Santander (11)  1600</p>
<p>Racing have to find substitutes for seven players, among them injured Argentine defender Gabriel Schurrer and suspended midfielder Txema Alonso. Tenerife are still torn by internal conflict ahead of the departure of coach Jupp Heynckes.</p>
<p>    Atletico Madrid (5) v Extremadura (19)   1600</p>
<p>Atletico coach Radomir Antic says his aim is fourth place and after a fine run of results in recent games he will hope to see his team deal a further blow to Extremadura's dreams of staying in the first division next season.</p>
<p>    Valladolid (6) v Celta Vigo (15)    1600</p>
<p>Valladolid are eager to make sure of their UEFA Cup place but will be without suspended defender Pena for a game against Celta who have slipped back into trouble in recent weeks.</p>
<p>    Logrones (22) v Oviedo (16)    1600</p>
<p>Defender Cesar Sanchez will return from suspension for Oviedo if Abel Xavier fails to recover from injury. Logrones have already given up the fight against relegation and are looking ahead to next season.</p>
<p>    Compostela (13) v Espanyol (14)    1700</p>
<p>A win would give a margin of comfort to either of these two sides who ended last season in the top 10 but are now within six points of relegation.</p>
<p>    Zaragoza (12) v Real Sociedad (8)    1700</p>
<p>Real Sociedad fans have taken the unusual step of chartering a train to support their team at Zaragoza, where one more win is needed to kill off relegation worries. Real defender Agustin Aranzabal could miss the game through injury.</p>
<p>    Sevilla (21) v Rayo Vallecano (17)   1700</p>
<p>Sevilla players went to a special mass earlier in the week in search of a miracle answer to their dire league position. Fellow strugglers Rayo took the more practical step of winning their first home game in several months.</p>
<p>Sporting Gijon (18) v Hercules (20)  1700</p>
<p>Another desperate encounter between two sides which face relegation in a season which will see four sides go down.</p>
<p>    Athletic Bilbao (7) v Real Madrid (1)   1730</p>
<p>Teenage striker Raul Gonzalez is struggling to overcome a nagging groin injury in his bid to lead a Real side that has already lost Balkan strike-pair Davor Suker and Predrag Mijatovic through suspension.</p>
<p>    Playing Monday:   </p>
<p>    Valencia (9) v Real Betis (4)   1930</p>
<p>Four successive home draws have left Betis out of contention for Spain's second European Cup place but Valencia are still gunning for a shot at the UEFA Cup and will be boosted by the absence of Betis defender Roberto Rios.</p>
