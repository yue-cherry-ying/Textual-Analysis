<title>USA: CSCE cocoa ends weaker in dull, pre-holiday trade.</title>
<headline>CSCE cocoa ends weaker in dull, pre-holiday trade.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>CSCE cocoa futures ended slightly lower Friday, but trading was sluggish ahead of the holiday weekend, dealers said.</p>
<p>CSCE will be closed Monday in observance of U.S. Memorial Day. London's LIFFE cocoa market will also be closed Monday.</p>
<p>CSCE July futures ended down $2 at $1,461 a tonne, traded $1,471 to $1,452. Second-month September slipped the same to $1,491, while the back months sagged $2 to $6.</p>
<p>Cocoa prices took a downturn at the outset, as expected, on the heels of a weak showing in the London cocoa market overnight. Traders said light local and trade selling pushed the July contract to a low of $1,452 -- just shy of key support at $1,445-$1,440.</p>
<p>But some shortcovering by locals ahead of the long weekend helped to lift prices off session lows, they added.</p>
<p>Technically, traders pegged July near-term resistance at $1,475, but said July would need to get past $1,490 and a chart gap between $1,498 and $1,501 to inspire substantial buying.</p>
<p>On the fundamental side, German cocoa trader Albrecht &amp; Dill GmbH said on Friday the Ivory Coast could have sold 550,000 tonnes from its upcoming 1997/98 cocoa main crop (October/September).</p>
<p>A&amp;D's weekly report cited information received from shippers and added this would be a higher figure than so far expected. Some sources even estimated sales in excess of 600,000 tonnes, the report said.</p>
<p>Volume reached an estimated 4,852 lots. ((--Patricia Avidan, New York Commodity Desk +1 212 859 1640))</p>
