<headline>Amstrad chief says sale to maximise value.</headline>

<p>Chairman of British consumer electronics firm Amstrad Plc, Alan Sugar, on Tuesday justified the sale of the company's mobile phone business, Dancall Telecom A/S, saying it would maximise shareholder value and would be good for its employees.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sugar said he still appreciated Amstrad's investment in Dancall but regretted that its potential was never understood by financial institutions as it had never made a profit since the acquisition.</p>
<p>&quot;Amstrad felt that it had taken Dancall as far as it could...&quot; Sugar said.</p>
<p>Amstrad said earlier it was selling its Danish unit for 92 million pounds ($150.2 million) to Bosch Telecom GmbH, a unit of Robert Bosch GmbH.</p>
<p>Dancall, with more than 600 employees, manufactures digital mobile telephones for use with GSM and PCN networks.</p>
<p>Investors welcomed the sale after Amstrad said it was considering returning some value out of it to shareholders. Its share price rose to a high of 226 pence from last week's close of 200 and was quoted at 223 pence at 1000 GMT.</p>
<p>Dancall Telecom was previously called Dancall Radio A/S until it ran into financial problems in the late 1980s. Amstrad acquired its assets, mainly the inventory and goodwill, from its receivers in September 1993 through a new company Dancall Telecom for 6.3 million stg.</p>
<p>Last month Sugar told a news conference that Dancall was expected to show profits for 1996/97.</p>
<p>Dancall recently launched two new mobile phones, the Dancall Roamer and the Dancall World phone, both considered technologically superior to those of its competitors in the industry.</p>
<p>Amstrad became a darling for investors in the late 1980s when it was riding on the success of its personal computers, word processors and hi-fi products.</p>
<p>But the group soon began losing market share to bigger Japanese and U.S. competitors.</p>
<p>&quot;Quite correctly, we were determined not to let this happen in the case of Dancall,&quot; Sugar said.</p>
<p>&quot;...We decided the best route would be to dispose of the company to a major international organisation that had a depth of technical support and worldwide distribution, and be realistically far better qualified to take the company forward,&quot; he added.</p>
