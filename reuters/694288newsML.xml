<p>Kermit Zarley, who has just three top-10 finishes this year, shot his second round of one-under-par 69 Friday to grab a one-stroke lead midway through the $1.3 million U.S. Senior Open, the third of four major championships on the Senior Tour.</p>
<p>Zarley, the only player in the field to post two sub-par rounds, was at two-under 138 through 36 holes.</p>
<p>At 139 were John Bland of South Africa, Dave Eichelberger, Tom Wargo and Graham Marsh of Australia, who shot a three-under 67, the best round of the tournament.</p>
<p>Zarley had shared the first-round lead with Wargo, Bland, Gil Morgan and Steve Veriato.</p>
<p>Jimmy Powell had a two-under 68 to stand one stroke further back at even-par 140. Veriato and Bob Charles were three strokes back at one-over 141 with Vicente Fernandez, John Morgan, Jay Sigel, Dana Quigley and Leonard Thompson tied at 142.</p>
<p>Zarley overcame a slow start by catching fire on the back nine. He started a string of four birdies with a 30-foot putt at the par-four 12th hole. Back-to-back 15-foot birdie putts followed at 13 and 14 before he sank an uphill 12-footer at the par-four 15th to move to 3-under for the tournament.</p>
<p>Zarley's best finish this year was a fourth-place tie at last month's Home Depot Invitational. But he is coming off a tie for 37th at last week's Nationwide Classic, where he had three rounds in the 70s.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old Zarley sandwiched bogeys at 16 and 18 around a 25-foot birdie on the par-4 17th.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been struggling with my putting here, but golf is a mind game,&quot; he said. &quot;You make a putt or two and pretty soon you start thinking maybe you can hole all of them. That helps your confidence and confidence is such a key thing in all of golf. I just felt a little more confident putting the ball.&quot;</p>
<p>On the front nine, Zarley collected seven pars and two bogeys, missing birdie putts at the sixth and ninth holes.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know if I'm learning anything,&quot; he said of the first two rounds. &quot;I just think that I have to think about having a smooth stroke on the greens and think of rolling the ball the right speed and try not to get carried away with trying to make 30-footers, just to lag the ball close to the hole and if it goes in, fine.&quot;</p>
<p>Marsh won the Nationwide Championship on Sunday after finishing third two weeks ago at the du Maurier Champions. He had five birdies and a bogey today after starting the round three strokes off the lead.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm surprised this is the low round, given the fairly benign conditions we've had the last two days,&quot; Marsh said. &quot;I guess there are a number of ways you can shoot 67, but mine came from hitting a number of iron shots very close today.&quot;</p>
<p>Defending champion Dave Stockton, who injured his back Wednesday, failed to survive the cut of 11-over 151 after a second-round 75 left him at 152.</p>
<p>Two-time champions Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player carded 72s. Nicklaus stood seven strokes behind Zarley at 145, while Player was 10 back at 148. Nicklaus's performance this week will weigh heavily in his decision to compete in next month's British Open. Should he skip the British Open, Nicklaus would end his streak of playing in 142 consecutive major championships.</p>
<p>Arnold Palmer, who won this event in 1981, barely survived the cut at 151 after a six-over 76.</p>
