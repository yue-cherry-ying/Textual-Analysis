<p>Ukraine, which in March announced plans to privatise 18 of its 31 electrical energy companies, now intends to sell off the rest of the sector, Energy Minister Yuri Bochkaryov told a news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Plans to distribute shares in all the remaining companies where privatisation has not begun have been prepared by the energy ministry and given preliminary consideration by the cabinet of ministers,&quot; Bochkaryov said.</p>
<p>He gave no further details on the plans, but the government has said the state would keep a 51 percent stake in the 18 companies already set to be sold off, with up to 30 percent going to a strategic investor and workers getting the rest.</p>
<p>Tenders, open to foreigners, are expected to take place on the first 18 companies in the second and third quarters.</p>
<p>The minister said consumers owed the sector 3.4 billion hryvnias ($1.89 billion) at the start of May after 3.3 billion hryvnias in March. He said the cabinet of ministers planned to implement tough steps soon to reduce the debt.</p>
<p>&quot;We are putting our faith in an order being prepared by the cabinet on tougher payments procedures and we are working very hard on this,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bochkaryov was re-appointed energy minister this week and his portfolio expanded after President Leonid Kuchma folded the state nuclear regulatory agency into the Energy and Electricity ministry as part of a shake-up of government structures aimed at making them more efficient.</p>
