<p>Argentine Economy Minister Roque Fernandez may make a postponed trip to Brazil on Wednesday if there is progress on a trade dispute over Brazil's new import rules, Argentina's envoy to Brazil said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ambassador Diego Guelar told local radio from Brasilia: &quot;We will work today with the hope of advancing towards a satisfactory solution, and then the minister could be here tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Brazil's partners in the regional Mercosur customs union -- Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay -- are alarmed by what they are condemning as &quot;protectionist&quot; measures by Brazil's Central Bank to limit financing for imports.  </p>
<p>Seeking to curb its growing trade deficit, Brazil ruled last week that most Brazilian importers with financing of less than 360 days will have to take out foreign exchange contracts on the day they receive their goods from customs.</p>
<p>Argentina, which posted a $1 billion trade surplus on exports of $6.5 billion to its giant neighbor in 1996, wants Brazil to exclude Mercosur from the new restrictions.</p>
<p>Fernandez had been due to travel to Brasilia Tuesday but postponed his trip, arguing his &quot;presence in Brazil will not be justified until we see that we can truly make progress on a negotiation within the framework of Mercosur.&quot;</p>
<p>The minister said on Monday that two of his top aides would instead travel to Brazil on Tuesday, but only if conditions were right for &quot;constructive negotiations.&quot;</p>
<p>Fernandez said he was worried by the &quot;protectionist spirit&quot; of large sections of the Brazilian media which wholeheartedly backed the new measures.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not the message we got from the Brazilian government,&quot; said Fernandez.</p>
