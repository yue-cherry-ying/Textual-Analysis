<p>Confusion clouded the start of voting on Friday in two Slovak referendums which western diplomats said could prove whether the country was progressing toward integration into western democratic structures.</p>
<p>Slovaks were to begin voting on Friday afternoon on their desire for NATO membership and on whether the president should be directly elected by citizens, instead of by parliament.</p>
<p>But the outcomes could be marred by a row over ballots, tied to a long running feud between the president and the premier, which led to some polling stations lacking ballots, while those with voting slips lacked the presidential question.</p>
<p>The vote on presidential elections is seen as a way for the opposition to prevent Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar from assuming presidential powers when the term of the incumbent, Michal Kovac, the premier's political enemy, ends next March.</p>
<p>Meciar's government has been fighting a fierce battle to have the referendum on presidential elections cancelled.</p>
<p>Polls were to open on Friday from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. (1200 to 2000 GMT) and continue on Saturday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., with the results made public on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>The outcome has been cast in doubt after Meciar's interior minister Gustav Krajci, who is responsible for the technical organisation of the referendums, issued ballots this week without the question on presidential elections.</p>
<p>Ballots with only the three questions of the NATO plebescite were disributed throughout Slovakia, but some mayors refused to accept them, insisting they were illegal as they did not have the seal of the Central Referendum Committee (UKR).</p>
<p>&quot;Our mayor decided to not distribute ballots without the question on presidential elections,&quot; an aide to the mayor of Petrzalka, a Bratislava district, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Citizens, who come to vote will find only the mayor's announcement that the Interior Ministry did not provide legal ballots, approved by the (UKR),&quot; she added.</p>
<p>Krajci said on Friday that scrapping the question on direct presidential elections was justified due to a Constitutional Court ruling that an appendix to the question was irrelevant.</p>
<p>&quot;The court ruled the appendix was illegal which means that the entire question was illegal,&quot; Kreajci told a news conference. &quot;I tried to persuade UKR to drop the question and when it refused, I took my own decision.&quot;</p>
<p>The UKR is responsible for supervision over the referendum and must approve its result for the outcome to be valid.</p>
<p>UKR Deputy Chairman Jozef Rumpolec, who took part in the news conference as an observer, told journalists that the UKR would recognise only those ballots with four questions.</p>
<p>&quot;The three question ballots are a forgery,&quot; Rumpolec said, adding that the official UKR seal had been reprinted on them from the original four-question ballot.</p>
<p>&quot;This is falsification of an official document which is punishable by law and we shall prosecute,&quot; Rumpolec added.</p>
<p>Under the constitution, if parliament is unable to muster a three-fifth majority to elect a new president, which niether the ruling coalition or opposition appear likely to achieve, presidential powers are assumed by the prime minister.</p>
<p>For the propositions to be approved, a turnout of 50 percent of eligible voters is needed with a simple majority of those voting in favour.</p>
<p>Leaders of Slovakia's parliamentary opposition parties, except for the reformed communist Party of the Democratic Left, on Friday issued an appeal to the population to insist on being handed a four-question ballot or to refuse to register.</p>
<p>&quot;We are carefully watching the way the referendums are being carried out, whether the authorities are guaranteeing a truly democratic poll,&quot; one western diplomat said.</p>
<p>&quot;That is the yardstick of democratic maturity and will again be a test of whether Slovakia is ripe for integration into western structures,&quot; the diplomat added.</p>
<p>Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, are widely seen as former Soviet-bloc countries likely to be invited to join NATO at a July summit of the alliance in Madrid,</p>
<p>Diplomats have said that it is unlikely that Slovakia would be invited because of shortcomings in its democratic reforms.</p>
