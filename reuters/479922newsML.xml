<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was quoted on Tuesday as saying that a crisis with Israel over Jewish settlement in Jerusalem had brought the Middle East peace process to its lowest point in 20 years.</p>
<p>&quot;By God, this is the worst situation in the peace process since 1977,&quot; Mubarak told Israel's Maariv newspaper, citing the year Egyptian President Anwar Sadat made a landmark visit to the Jewish state, paving the way for a 1979 peace treaty.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in two radio interviews, launched one of his strongest attacks on Egypt since taking office, accusing Cairo of doing its utmost to kill Israel's chances of normal relations with the Arab world.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sorry to say that Egypt is playing a leading role in stirring up the Arab world and in the diplomatic fight the Arab world is waging against us -- and not just from today,&quot; Netanyahu told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>In Cairo on Monday, Arab foreign ministers decided to stop normal relations with Israel and bring back the old economic boycott of the Jewish state in response to Israel's construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusaloem.</p>
<p>Vowing Israel would never bend to such pressure, Netanyahu said Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with the Jewish state, had been &quot;playing a double game&quot; by telling the United States it was opening &quot;gates into the Arab world&quot; for Israel.</p>
<p>&quot;We discover it is doing its utmost, I am sorry to say, in a pretty systematic way, to shut the gates of normalisation and openness,&quot; Netanyahu said on Israeli Army Radio.</p>
<p>&quot;And, I am sorry to say, the Egyptian government also is leading a line of incessant incitement in the Egyptian press -- including anti-Semitic caricatures which are impossible to describe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Maariv quoted Mubarak as saying he would &quot;like to believe (Netanyahu), at least once&quot;. He charged the right-wing leader elected last May had yet to fulfill a personal promise to him to advance peace and respect agreements with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>&quot;You have succeeded in frightening the world,&quot; Mubarak said. &quot;Relations between Israel and Arab countries were never so bad...you have pushed all of us into a very difficult situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about Mubarak's comments, Netanyahu said: &quot;I am sad and concerned about what is going on because we also hear from the Egyptian side the incessant slander, insults and incitement against Israel and the head of its government.&quot;</p>
