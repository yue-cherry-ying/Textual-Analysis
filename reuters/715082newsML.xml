<p>Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, standing beside U.S. President Bill Clinton, said on Monday he hoped Spain would join NATO's military command later this year.</p>
<p>Speaking after talks with Clinton on the eve of the NATO summit in Madrid, Aznar said there were some problems that needed to be resolved before Spain made a final decision on full integration into the Western defence alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to join the military command of NATO once the command is fully designed and our interests are safeguarded,&quot; Aznar told reporters.</p>
<p>Aznar sees a full role in NATO as key to Spain securing a place among the leading nations of Europe and was anxious to reaffirm his commitment to full integration at the summit.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome Spain's intention to take her full place in NATO's integrated military structure as we complete a new command structure,&quot; Clinton said.</p>
<p>In negotiations with NATO on military integration, Spain is insisting on a sub-regional Iberian command which would encompass all its territory including the Canary islands.</p>
<p>Spain also wants control over access to the Mediterranean through the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>
<p>But Spanish officials have acknowledged in the run-up to the summit that some of their demands in negotiations with NATO will probably not be met.</p>
<p>One sticking point appears to be control over the waters between Spain's southern coast and the Canary islands in the Atlantic which NATO does not want ceded to Spanish control.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some technical problems that still need to be ironed out,&quot; Aznar said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I think that with the impetus given by the Madrid summit between now and the end of the year, particularly the month of December, I think we can take the definitive decision to join the full integrated military structure.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton said Spain was justified in aggressively defending its interests in the negotiations with NATO but added the new structure must be militarily defensible.</p>
