<p>China on Tuesday warned the United States not to interfere in Beijing's dealings with its island rival Taiwan and said Washington should refuse to make any more large-scale high-technology weapons sales to Taipei.</p>
<p>Responding to recent remarks by visiting U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich that Washington would defend Taiwan from mainland attack, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said the island was a domestic issue.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue of Taiwan between China and the United States is just one issue, that of non-interference in China's internal affairs,&quot; Shen told a news briefing in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;We are always for peaceful reunification with Taiwan, but if a situation of independence occurs in Taiwan or foreign forces interfere in Taiwan, then we will take other necessary measures,&quot; he said but gave no details.</p>
<p>Beijing has considered Taiwan a rebel province since defeated Nationalist forces fled there in 1949 and has vowed to invade the island if it ever declares formal independence.</p>
<p>White House officials have sought to play down remarks by Gingrich, who was quoted during a three-day visit that ended on Sunday as telling Chinese officials here that the United States would defend Taiwan against such an attack.</p>
<p>However, when China carried out intimidatory war games and missile tests off Taiwan in the run-up to the island's first presidential elections in March 1996, Washington sent two aircraft carrier battlegroups into seas off Taiwan to monitor the situation.</p>
<p>Differences over Taiwan have long been a major irritant to the sensitive Sino-U.S. relationship, already battered by disputes over human rights, copyright piracy and trade.</p>
<p>Arms shipments by Washington to Taiwan were supporting dreams of independence on the island and should not be repeated, Shen told the news briefing.</p>
<p>Taiwan, which relies on high technology defences to deter attack from China's huge People's Liberation Army, in January took delivery of two launchers for U.S. Patriot missiles -- part of a $175 million 200 missile Patriot purchase.</p>
<p>Local media has said the island was scheduled to take delivery this month of the first two of 150 F-16 fighter aircraft from the United States in the culmination of a deal that rocked Sino-U.S. ties when it was first announced.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently the large amount of U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan to a certain degree supports and connives at Taiwan separatist forces and hampers the process of peaceful reunification,&quot; Shen said.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that the United States will take the stance of not interfering in China's internal affairs on the Taiwan issue, and even more that it will not make large sales of advanced weapons,&quot; Shen told the news briefing.</p>
