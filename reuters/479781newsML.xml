<headline>OPTIONS - Stock jitters send Bund volatility up.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bund volatility jumped on Tuesday at the open, as concerns over stock market declines coupled with concerns over rising interest rates, traders said.</p>
<p>Implied volatility of May options on June Bund futures rose as high as 6.3 percent compared with a close of 5.8 percent on Thursday. It was trading around 6.2 percent by 1400 GMT.</p>
<p>Traders said nervousness about U.S. interest rates, coupled with shocks to the stock market, had left investors considering alternatives in options, although as yet that interest had not translated into much positioning.</p>
<p>&quot;It would certainly make sense to head for options,&quot; said a salesman at a European bank here. &quot;But there aren't many indications that people are doing it yet.&quot;</p>
<p>He said people were waiting to gauge the performance of the Dow Jones before committing themselves.</p>
<p>A trade of 3,500 May 100.50 Bund calls was sold at a volatility of 5.8 percent.</p>
<p>Traders said the technical performance of the underlying Bund futures market was under scrutiny -- and a failure in the market to break above 99.70 had worried investors.</p>
<p>&quot;It needs to close above 99.40, or the outlook is very bearish,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>June Bund futures were trading at 99.39 at 1430 GMT, off 0.62.</p>
<p>Traders said volatility was likely to remain high ahead of the non-farm payrolls data on Friday -- key data which could influence the course of U.S. rates.</p>
<p>&quot;There's concern last week's rate rise was just the first of many,&quot; said a trader at a British bank in London.</p>
<p>June Euromark options were trading at 10.7/12.5 percent, little changed, while September was at 11.5/13.0 percent.</p>
<p>Notable trades included selling 7,000 96.75 June calls, and a December 96.25/96.75 combination.</p>
