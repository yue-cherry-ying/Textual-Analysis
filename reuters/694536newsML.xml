<title>USA: Fewer Miami emigres see Cuba changing soon - poll.</title>
<headline>Fewer Miami emigres see Cuba changing soon - poll.</headline>

<p>Fewer Cuban emigres see change coming any time soon on the Communist-run island, but nearly half favour dialogue to promote political and economic change there, a new poll by the Miami Herald newspaper said.</p>
<p>The poll, carried in the early Sunday editions of the Herald, also found that most members of Miami's Cuban-American community support the U.S. trade embargo against the government of President Fidel Castro, but few believe it works well.</p>
<p>A large majority would favour military action by the United States or exile groups to overthrow the Castro government, the poll found, but younger Cubans were more conciliatory than those who left the island decades ago.</p>
<p>The poll was conducted among 1,200 Cuban-Americans by the Florida International University's Institute of Public Opinion Research and had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
<p>Six years ago, 77 percent of Cuban-Americans in the Dade County area that surrounds Miami said they felt major political change would take place in Cuba within five years, the poll found. That figure is now just 36 percent.</p>
<p>The poll found that 48.3 percent now favoured a national dialogue among Cuban emigres, dissidents and representatives of the Cuban government, while 45.3 percent opposed the idea.</p>
<p>In 1995 and 1993, the pollsters found that only 36 percent favoured dialogue.</p>
<p>Almost 72 percent of those polled said they favoured continuing the U.S. embargo, but almost 73 percent said it had not worked well in keeping U.S. goods out of Cuba.</p>
<p>The poll found that 69 percent supported military action by exile groups, and 63 percent supported U.S. military action, to overthrow Castro, who came to power in a 1959 revolution.</p>
<p>It also found that while 74 percent of Cuban-Americans between 18 and 29 years old favoured dialogue with the Castro government and 22 percent were against, those over 65 took the opposite view, with 60 percent against and only 33 percent in favour.</p>
<p>The 800,000-strong Cuban community in the Miami area is the biggest in the United States.</p>
