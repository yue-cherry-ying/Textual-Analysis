<p>An extraordinary rebound from drought is delivering the European Union one of its largest grain crops this year, raising fears of a costly surplus just when farm spending is being squeezed.</p>
<p>A bumper harvest, if confirmed over coming few weeks, could blow a hole in the EU's cautious budget for subsidising grain exports and raise the chances of trade tension with Washington.</p>
<p>EU spending is already under pressure from the cost of last year's mad cow disease crisis, and still more cash is needed to help finance the slaughter of millions of pigs hit by swine fever in Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>
<p>The last thing EU officials say they want now is another expensive grain mountain.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is going to be extremely difficult for the Commission this year,&quot; a European farm official said on Monday.</p>
<p>Wheat and barley crops are racing to a near-record finish in France's northern plains and elsewhere, but the quality is often below what bakers and brewers want --- meaning much of it will have to be fed to animals or exported with large subsidies.</p>
<p>And with good crops outside Europe hitting prices globally, officials say subsidies, now dormant, could return earlier and at a higher cost than the EU Commission had hoped.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be heavy competition in Europe and on the world market and we are going to have a knife at our throats to export this year,&quot; the farm official said.</p>
<p>Further, world wheat prices of $120-130 a tonne are $25 under protected EU prices and need larger subsidies to close the gap than the Commission budgeted to spend. Industry sources believe it drafted its farm budget when prices were around $150 a tonne.</p>
<p>But private and public reports of big crops have increased speculation that Brussels will ditch its &quot;wait-and-see&quot; gamble on prices and sell as soon as export tenders formally open on July 17.</p>
<p>&quot;The sooner things start, the sooner you can be sure they are looking at their own indications of a very big crop,&quot; said one official who monitors EU grain export policy.</p>
<p>That is likely to rankle with the U.S., which opposes export aid but which has vowed to &quot;fight subsidy with subsidy&quot; if it believes EU handouts are hurting its farmers.</p>
<p>U.S. crops are in excellent shape, and European officials predict the timing of any new EU subsidies will be a delicate diplomatic decision.</p>
<p>How big the EU crop is depends on the next two crucial weeks of weather. Analysts say a dry fortnight would allow grain crops to make up for the drought followed by an over-wet June.</p>
<p>The EU grain lobby Coceral on Friday forecast a two percent drop from last year's record EU grain crop to 197 million tonnes, but said sunshine might boost yields by the same percentage.</p>
<p>Last year's crop was followed by exports of nearly 27 million tonnes over the 1996/97 marketing year, according to latest EU data.</p>
<p>Coceral projected a 2.4 percent lower wheat crop at 88.4 million tonnes, but sources said private estimates seen by EU officials were for a wheat crop of more than 90 million.</p>
<p>Autumn-harvested maize was also reported to be doing well.</p>
<p>Only two crops have suffered significant damage -- durum wheat, grown to make pasta or semolina, and malting barley for the beer industry. Barley which fails to make the grade will be reclassified for animals, and brewing and pasta industry costs are expected to rise.</p>
<p>Even with a slight drop in total harvests, the Commission faces a battle to supply industrial-scale producers of animal feed, grain's biggest domestic customer.</p>
<p>Swine fever is set to hamper local grain consumption, and EU grain faces intense competition from oilseeds after a steep plunge in U.S. soy prices and an overshoot in oilseed plantings in Europe.</p>
<p>A big U.S. corn crop will also increase the supply of competing U.S. gluten feed.</p>
