<p>As the Euromarket readies for Russia's second dollar bond issue, bankers said the country's political climate was now more investor-friendly than it had been for its debut last year.</p>
<p>Russia had proved itself with two jumbo Eurobonds, in dollars and marks, and paved the way for the rest of the country to follow, they said.</p>
<p>They also cited the appointment earlier this year of reformers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov, the driving force behind Russian privatisation, as first deputy prime ministers.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation in Russia is very different now to how it was last year. Nemtsov has helped Russia a lot, people are a lot more bullish,&quot; a banker said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sentiment is stronger, there has been a sea-change in politics since then (the first Russian Eurobond) with Chubais and Nemtsov now firmly in place,&quot; CSFB director-economics Jonathan Hoffman said. &quot;But tax revenues is still a concern.&quot;</p>
<p>A failure by Russian authorities to collect planned tax revenue has triggered a budget crisis.</p>
<p>The mood prior to Russia's debut bond last November was dogged by President Boris Yeltsin's ill-health, but he has amazed many observers with his stoicism following heart surgery.</p>
<p>Recent positive comments by International Monetary Fund head Michel Camdessus and World Bank President James Wolfensohn were also encouraging investors, bankers said.</p>
<p>Camdessus said Russia could become an economic superpower if it pursued reforms actively and Wolfensohn pledged $6 billion in loans to Russia over the next two years.</p>
<p>Russia plans to launch a $1.0 billion Eurobond after extensive roadshows in late June.</p>
<p>On Friday a Russian official said the maturity was likely to be between 10 and 20 years. This is longer than the seven to 10-year maturity initially mooted. But bankers close to the deal on Friday said this was nonsense and others said 10 years might be pushing it.</p>
<p>First Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said most proceeds from the issue would be used to finance the budget deficit.</p>
<p>Rough price talk is based on Russia's credit ratings -- Ba2 by Moody's Investors Service and BB minus by Standard &amp; Poor's -- and other fundamentals.</p>
<p>A seven-year deal has been mooted at 325-340 basis points over U.S. Treasury notes and a 10-year at 350-365 b.p. Other syndicate sources quoted more generous ranges with around 400 b.p. for a 10-year deal.</p>
<p>Russia's debut $1.0 billion five-year offering -- the first since the 1917 revolution -- was trading at around 310 b.p. over U.S. Treasury notes, significantly tighter than the 345 b.p. launch spread.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan and SBC Warburg were awarded the mandate for both Russia's dollar deals.</p>
<p>In March the Federation also launched a 2.0 billion mark seven-year bond to yield 370 b.p. over Bunds (Greman government bonds). This is now trading around 366 b.p. over, dealers said.</p>
<p>Also in the deal's favour is the broader investor base. Bankers said &quot;new lines&quot; for Russian paper have been opened. &quot;Funds that were previously unable to purchase Russian risk are now able to,&quot; a syndicate manager said. &quot;People will continue to buy Russia if it is correctly priced.&quot;</p>
<p>Those bankers that feared an oversupply of Russian paper in the next few months praised the Federation for restricting the amount even though they acknowleged the appetite for another jumbo dollar deal.</p>
<p>Russian borrowers need authorisation to issue Eurobonds from a number of entities, including the ministry of finance and the central bank.</p>
<p>&quot;It is good that Russia is pacing the issuance as we could otherwise see an oversupply,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;The timetable is heavy now.&quot;</p>
<p>European Bank for Reconstruction and Development deputy vice president Guy de Selliers told Reuters it was right that Russia ensured other entities approached the market in an &quot;organised and disciplined&quot; way.</p>
<p>Regions and municipalities that are currently eyeing the international bond market include Chelyabinsk, Irkutsk, Komi, Leningrad region, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, St Petersburg, Sverdlovsk and Tatarstan. Numerous corporates and banks also plan to tap the market.</p>
