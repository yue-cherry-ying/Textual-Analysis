<p>Australian captain Mark Taylor found his form at last to lead defiant resistance on the third day of the first test against England at Edgbaston on Saturday.</p>
<p>Batting again 360 behind after England declared their first innings at 478 for nine, Australia reached 133 for one when rain brought an early tea.</p>
<p>Taylor was 66 not out, his first half-century in 22 test innings since December 1995.</p>
<p>Another personal failure, together with an Australian defeat, would have further increased the pressure on Taylor to stand down.</p>
<p>He showed few nerves, however, in easier batting conditions than the first innings when Australia were routed for 118. Taylor struck six fours and the first six of the match in completing his half-century off 69 balls.</p>
<p>Matthew Elliott stayed with him until the 37th over and had made 66 when off-spinner Robert Croft bowled him, prodding forward.</p>
<p>Greg Blewett joined Taylor, but almost immediately rain fell for the second time in the day.</p>
<p>An hour was lost when play could not resume after lunch and further showers were forecast, adding to the faint hope of the Australians clawing their way to survival.</p>
<p>Against that, they were without Mark Waugh, who was detained in hospital for 24 hours after suffering stomach pains.</p>
<p>Earlier, England had batted on for nine and a half overs, losing three wickets in adding 29 to their overnight total of 449 for six.</p>
<p>Mark Ealham was left not out on 53, emulating Nasser Hussain and Graham Thorpe in passing his previous highest test score.</p>
<p>Mike Kasprowicz deservedly picked up two more wickets, having Croft (24) and Darren Gough (0) both caught behind.</p>
<p>Those catches for Ian Healy gave him six, a personal best in test cricket, which equalled the record for an Ashes innings jointly held by Rodney Marsh (Australia) and Jack Russell (England).</p>
