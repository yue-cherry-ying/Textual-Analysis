<p>Poland's Brady bonds are expected to rise further following the $1.69 billion buyback announced on Wednesday by the country's finance ministry, emerging market debt experts in London said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The credit story is clearly improving and to retire 40 percent of the long-dated Bradies certainly is going to heighten demand for the remaining stock,&quot; Daniel McGovern, first vice president and head of emerging markets research for Merrill Lynch in London said.</p>
<p>Yield spreads on Poland's Brady bonds have already tightened between 15 to 25 basis points on the buyback news and are expected to narrow by the same amount in coming months.</p>
<p>Poland's finance ministry said on Wednesday that the bulk of the $1.69 billion of Brady bonds bought back in the secondary market were discount bonds.</p>
<p>According to market sources, Poland's par bonds tightened by about 15 basis points, while the country's PDI and discount bonds narrowed between 15 to 20 basis points.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, McGovern said he expected Poland's PDI bonds to be the best performer of Poland's Bradys.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the PDI is probably the most interesting. We think it is the candidate to enjoy the greatest upside,&quot; said McGovern, noting that there could be an additional 15 to 20 basis points of spread tightening.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking at about 120 over (U.S. Treasuries) in a six month period,&quot; said one emerging market trader at a major U.S. investment bank in London.</p>
<p>He said current levels were around 143 basis points over U.S. Treasuries. On a price basis, Poland's PDI bonds were 3/8 firmer at 82-7/8 bid and its discount bonds  were 1/4 stronger at 98 bid.</p>
<p>Earlier today, both London analysts and a senior Polish banker said they expect Poland to receive a credit rating upgrade from the rating agencies.</p>
<p>&quot;An upgrade is a question of when rather than if,&quot; said the emerging market trader at the U.S. investment bank.</p>
<p>A finance ministry official in Warsaw said Standard and Poor's and Moody's Investors Service had both finished appraisals in April but he would not comment on the likelihood of a rating upgrade by either rating agency.</p>
<p>The ministry official also said that IBCA rating agency planned to visit Warsaw next week to finish work on an appraisal of the country's economy.</p>
