<title>USA: NBA-BULLS GET LOW-SCORING WIN OVER HEAT.</title>
<headline>NBA-BULLS GET LOW-SCORING WIN OVER HEAT.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Michael Jordan shook off three horrible quarters to score 14 points in the final 6:27 and the Chicago Bulls cranked up the defence to beat the Miami Heat 75-68 Thursday in the lowest scoring NBA playoff game ever.</p>
<p>The win, which gave the defending champion Bulls a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals, erased a 74-71 game between Syracuse and Fort Wayne on April 7, 1955 from the record book as the lowest-scoring in NBA playoff history.</p>
<p>Jordan, who once scored 63 points by himself in a playoff game, was 2-of-12 from the field and had only nine points just before the midpoint of the fourth quarter. But he finished with 23 by dominating the game's crucial moments, from the field and at the free-throw line.</p>
<p>Scottie Pippen also had 23 points for Chicago, which shot just 35 percent (23-of-64) from the field.</p>
<p>Tim Hardaway had 15 points and Alonzo Mourning 14 for Miami, which hit just 33 percent (25-of-74) from the floor.</p>
<p>The game also saw the lowest scoring first half in playoff history. Chicago led 39-29 at the break, and the 68 combined points were one fewer than the New York Knicks and New Jersey Nets produced on April 29, 1994.</p>
<p>In the first half, Jordan managed just seven points on 1-of-7 shooting.</p>
