<headline>Analysts peg USDA cotton output at 17.96-18.8 mln bales.</headline>

<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is expected to peg the U.S. cotton crop at 17.96-18.8 million 480-lb bales, in its first supply and demand report for the new crop, analysts said.</p>
<p>The USDA put the current crop at 18.95 million bales, in its most recent estimate.</p>
<p>Exports in the 1997/98 season were pegged at 6.0-7.2 million bales, while domestic consumption was seen between 10.8-11.1 million bales.</p>
<p>Carryover could fall anywhere from 3.85-5.01 million bales, according to market analysts.</p>
<p>&quot;Those numbers are very tentative,&quot; Carl Anderson, a cotton marketing specialist with Texas A&amp;M University, said, pegging output at 18.8 million bales.</p>
<p>Anderson echoed the felling of each analyst surveyed, who stressed that the crop estimates are based on the USDA's prediction that planted area would reach 14.485 million acres.</p>
<p>Since March, when the USDA issued its planted area forecast, the market has seen weather-induced planting delays throughout the cotton belt, high soybean prices, and low prices for new-crop December futures.</p>
<p>As a result, the USDA is expected to trim its planted area estimate in July.</p>
<p>&quot;If you put a gun to my head and forced me to use the perspective planting number,&quot; production would reach 18.05 million bales, Smith Barney analyst David Brandon, said.</p>
<p>He said growers are more likely to plant about 13.85 million acres of cotton by the end of the season.</p>
<p>Indeed, in its most recent progress report, the USDA said only 25 percent of the crop has been planted, compared with 31 percent a year ago and 37 percent in a five-year average.</p>
<p>&quot;Planting delays should be watched closely from here on out, Rian Powell, an analyst with Allendale Inc, said.</p>
<p>Powell put output estimate at 17.96 million bales, the low end of the range, and said several more weeks of cool, wet weather in the Southeast chould damage yields considerably.</p>
<p>Analysts agreed that the USDA report is not likely to give the market a fundamental reason to rally from the contract lows hit earlier this week. In fact, prices are expected to weaken further by the fall, barring a severe weather or pest problem over the summer.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on what we see now, we certainly should see lower prices this fall,&quot; Sharon Johnson, an analyst with Frank Schneider and Co Inc, said.</p>
<p>Her estimate for production came in at 18.0 million bales.</p>
<p>In the longer term, low prices may be just what the market needs to climb back to the 80.00 cent per lb range, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll sell more cotton overseas, increase demand, decrease ending stocks, and prices will rise,&quot; Johnson said.</p>
