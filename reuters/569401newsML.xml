<headline>CAM says to sell property for S$29 mln.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>CAM International Holdings Ltd, the main board listed firm embroiled in fraud allegations, said on Thursday it was selling a Singapore industrial property for Singapore $29.0 million.</p>
<p>CAM said in a statement it expected to make a S$4.48 million net gain on the deal to dispose of the building in central Singapore for which the firm says it no longer has any use.</p>
<p>CAM paid S$22.8 million for the property in June 1996 with the aim of making it a corporate headquarters as well as housing research and development (R&amp;D) and subsidiary manufacturing operations there.  </p>
<p>Lower costs in Malaysia had caused the company to rethink the strategy and instead base R&amp;D and manufacturing in Malaysia.</p>
<p>&quot;As the original purpose of acquiring the property is no longer valid, the company has decided to sell the property&quot;, the statement said.</p>
<p>The deal has to be approved by the government's Housing Development Board and by CAM shareholders, unless the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) waives that requirement.</p>
<p>CAM said it had asked the SES to clarify the point.</p>
<p>Shares in CAM were suspended on April 30 after an auditor's report on the company was delivered to the Ministry of Finance.  </p>
<p>The report, made public on Monday, alleges possible breaches of the companies act and penal code by certain CAM directors.</p>
