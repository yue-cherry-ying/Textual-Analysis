<title>MEXICO: Swiss prosecutor questions Mexico's Raul Salinas.</title>
<headline>Swiss prosecutor questions Mexico's Raul Salinas.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-03-31</dateline>

<p>Switzerland's chief prosecutor questioned the brother of former President Carlos Salinas on Monday about a multi-million dollar secret bank account in Switzerland, media reports said.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Carla del Ponte interrogated Raul Salinas on Monday about the origin of $84 million stashed in the account.</p>
<p>Mexican news agency Notimex said del Ponte spent six hours questioning Raul Salinas in a maximum-security jail just outside Mexico City, where he is being held.</p>
<p>Raul Salinas reiterated that the money was part of an investment fund that drew cash from various Mexican businessmen, and was not tied to any illegal activities, his lawyer told reporters.</p>
<p>Swiss officials arrived in Mexico City late on Sunday, and could question Raul Salinas again, officials said.</p>
<p>He was arrested in early 1995 on charges of plotting the murder of a top politician and of illicit enrichment. He also was recently charged by Mexican authorities with money laundering.</p>
<p>The fortune was discovered in September 1995 when Raul Salinas' wife tried to withdraw the funds. Since then, Swiss and Mexican officials have been investigating whether or not the money was laundered from the illegal drug trade.</p>
<p>He has denied the charges and has said the money was from legitimate business in Mexico.</p>
<p>Salinas is alleged to have amassed a fortune while serving as an official during part of his brother's 1988-1994 term. Carlos Salinas fled Mexico soon after his term ended and now lives in self-imposed exile in Ireland.</p>
<p>It is the third time Swiss investigators have come to Mexico to question Raul Salinas. Mexican newspapers reported the Swiss investigators were in the United States for three days last week, meeting with officials from the Justice Department and Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>
