<p>Some two thirds of Dutch people believe Queen Beatrix should abdicate when she turns 65 in 2003, leaving the throne to her eldest son Willem-Alexander, according to a survey published in Trouw newspaper on Saturday.</p>
<p>Beatrix's mother, Juliana, gave up the throne at the age of 70, but 65 percent of people believe the present queen should stand down five years earlier, Trouw said.</p>
<p>Fifty three percent of those polled said it would be acceptable for Prince Willem-Alexander, who turns 30 on April 27, to cohabit with a woman without marrying her.</p>
<p>Forty three percent said they would not object to the prince choosing to live with a male partner.</p>
<p>Willem-Alexander had a highly publicised romance a few years ago with a law student named Emily Bremers who later went on to work for the Dutch airline KLM.</p>
<p>However, the gossip magazines have carried little substantive news about the prince's love life more recently.</p>
