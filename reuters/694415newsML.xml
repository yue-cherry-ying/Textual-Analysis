<p>Britain and China resolved a final diplomatic wrangle over Hong Kong's transfer on Saturday when they agreed what archives should be handed over, laying to rest fears that files on dissidents could end up in Beijing.</p>
<p>Two days before the transition, only the very broadest details were announced in a carefully worded memo of understanding on a matter under negotiation for eight months.</p>
<p>Government-run Hong Kong Radio said the agreement wrapped up the last diplomatic negotiation of the handover.</p>
<p>There was no direct mention of issues like files on dissidents who fled China and either settled in Hong Kong or passed through on their way to other countries like the United States.</p>
<p>But an authoritative source said Britain was able to delicately step round the dissident issue and protect strategic military information by sticking to its position that files on British-Hong Kong relations belonged only in London.</p>
<p>&quot;Quite clearly, information on dissidents falls into this category so there is no worry about files falling into the wrong hands,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>The South China Morning Post said on Saturday personal files on about 13 mainland dissidents who chose to stay on in Hong Kong have already been shipped to London.</p>
<p>The group arrived as illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>&quot;The immigration records will show no trace of their identities,&quot; said a source close to the colonial government.</p>
<p>The so-called &quot;Sino-British Agreed Minute on the Transfer of the Hong Kong Archives&quot; said Britain would give up to China local archives &quot;needed for the normal administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in future.&quot;</p>
<p>The use of the words &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;future&quot; appeared to give Britain an easy diplomatic way out of ever turning over historical files that might be useful to China in tracking down anti-Beijing elements in Hong Kong and abroad.</p>
<p>Military archives turned over to Beijing involved almost exclusively easily-found details of barracks and installations which China's troops will occupy from Monday night's takeover of the British colony.</p>
<p>Foreign affairs files turned over were solely ceremonial as Hong Kong under Britain's 156-year rule had no independent foreign policy.</p>
<p>There was also something for China in the agreement with Britain promising to consult China three months in advance, and to consider its views, if London decided to make any of the removed archives available to the public.</p>
<p>&quot;From now if there are cases where archives which should have been transferred by the British side have not been transferred, the two sides will seek to resolve the matter through consultation,&quot; the memo said.</p>
