<headline>BA says strikers could be sacked, sued.</headline>

<p>British Airways Plc said on Saturday it had warned any cabin staff who took part in a planned strike that they could be sacked or sued for damages, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Iain Burns confirmed a story in the Express on Sunday newspaper which said the airline had sent a warning letter to cabin crew, who last week voted overwhelmingly in favour of striking over a five month pay row.</p>
<p>&quot;Staff have been informed that striking could result in them being dismissed or being sued for damages,&quot; Burns said by telephone, describing the measures as a last option.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly we don't want to do that. But management resolve is strong. We don't want our customers to suffer,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The T&amp;G union acting for British Airways staff said a meeting to decide whether unionised cabin crew should strike and for how long would be held on Monday.</p>
<p>The airline faces a separate threat on Monday when unions will also publish the result of a second strike ballot of 9,000 BA ground staff.</p>
<p>BA has already placed its operations on red alert to cope with the strike threat. It said earlier this week it had retrained non T&amp;G-affiliated staff in other duties and was willing to make external appointments.</p>
<p>If action goes ahead, strike breakers will be offered payments of 75 pounds ($125) in cash per day for taxis, hotel accommodation and coach services to break through picket lines.</p>
<p>T&amp;G leader Bill Morris, writing in the Express on Sunday, accused BA chief executive Robert Ayling of acting like bullying 19th century mill owner. Burns dismissed the charge.</p>
<p>&quot;Would a 19th century mill owner share 94 million pounds ($150 million) with its staff as we have done this year as part of our profit-share scheme?&quot; he asked. ($ = 0.601 British Pounds)</p>
