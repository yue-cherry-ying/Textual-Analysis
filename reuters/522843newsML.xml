<p>India's United Front coalition appeared on Saturday to be nearing agreement on a leader to head a new centre-left government and end a three-week political crisis, alliance politicians said.</p>
<p>Coalition leaders were scheduled to meet at 7:30 p.m. (1400 GMT) to choose a new leader, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu said.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be some good news for you,&quot; Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah told reporters.</p>
<p>Asked if the 15-party United Front was ready to reach a consensus on a new leader, Abdullah said: &quot;Yes.&quot; But another senior front leader said no final decision had yet been taken.</p>
<p>Naidu was spearheading efforts to narrow down a long list of contenders to replace caretaker prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda, whose 10-month-old government fell in a vote of confidence on April 11 after the Congress party withdrew its crucial support.</p>
<p>Congress on Friday pledged to support a new centre-left government led by the United Front provided it replaced Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>Among the frontrunners were caretaker Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav of the populous northern state of Uttar Pradesh and caretaker Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral of Deve Gowda's Janata Dal party.</p>
<p>A senior United Front official who asked not to be identified said strong support had built up for Gujral, a veteran government minister who is widely respected but has little political base.</p>
<p>But other officials said Yadav, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister, could win.</p>
<p>Southern regional leader G.K. Moopanar had been a front-runner in the race to succeed Deve Gowda. But his chances appeared to have faded after left-wing parties, suspicious of his close ties to Congress, raised objections, officials said.</p>
<p>On Friday, after the Congress party formally threw its support behind the coalition, United Front officials had said they were confident the alliance would select a new leader on Saturday and that a new government would be formed by Sunday.</p>
<p>President Shankar Dayal Sharma has indicated he would like a new government formed by Monday, when parliament reconvenes.</p>
<p>But splits quickly emerged between supporters of Moopanar, Yadav and other contenders within the United Front, comprising regional, communist and centrist parties.</p>
<p>The efforts to choose a new leader have had to balance the interests of north against south, but also take into account the sometimes divergent views of the communists, Deve Gowda's socialist Janata Dal and regional parties.</p>
<p>Yadav's backers said he would be able to lead the fight against the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) if, as many expect, most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, in the heart the Hindi belt the next government soon falls.</p>
<p>Yadav comes from India's where the BJP draws its strength.</p>
<p>But Gujral was seen as a fall-back choice if bickering among higher-profile leaders threatened to prolong the process, raising the chances the president would dissolve parliament and call mid-term elections.</p>
