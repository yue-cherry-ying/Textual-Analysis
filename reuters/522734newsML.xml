<p>Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa, who plans to ban foreign donations to political parties when Hong Kong returns to Chinese rule in July, gave money in 1992 to Britain's Conservative Party.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it is certain, Mr Tung himself has said so,&quot; an information officer with Tung's office said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The South China Morning Post reported on Saturday that Tung made a 50,000 sterling (US$81,500) donation to the Conservative Party before Britain's general election in 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a fact well-known to everybody and, as a result, I am particularly sensitive that this should not happen in Hong Kong,&quot; Tung was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>A Tung aide told the newspaper Tung had made the donation in a personal capacity when he was chairman of shipping group Orient Overseas (International) Ltd.</p>
<p>He resigned from that position last October to vie for the territory's future leadership post.</p>
<p>Last week Tung proposed curbs on civil liberties, including a blanket ban on foreign funding for political groups, to take effect after Britain hands Hong Kong back to China on July 1.</p>
<p>Tung's donation provoked heavy criticism from Hong Kong's pro-democracy supporters.</p>
<p>&quot;It is ridiculous that he is now banning people from doing what he himself has done before,&quot; Cheung Man-kwong of the Democratic Party was quoted in the report as saying.</p>
