<p>President Boris Yeltsin told Japan's foreign minister on Friday that long-frosty bilateral ties were improving and he thanked Tokyo for supporting Russian membership of the group of leading industrialised nations.</p>
<p>Welcoming Yukihiko Ikeda to the Kremlin, Yeltsin said he looked forward to talks with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in July in the U.S. city of Denver at a summit of the Group of Seven nations, now expanded to include Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;Relations between Russia and Japan have notably improved since we agreed that deeds should come before discussion of the islands issue,&quot; Interfax quoted Yeltsin as telling Ikeda.</p>
<p>He was referring to a bitter territorial issue that has overshadowed ties between Russia and Japan and blocked the signing of a formal peace treaty ending World War Two hostilities.</p>
<p>Japan wants Moscow to return four remote islands in the north Pacific seized by the Red Army in 1945.</p>
<p>Despite this dispute, Russia and Japan have agreed to expand economic cooperation and to step up dialogue on a range of issues.</p>
<p>Japanese diplomats said Ikeda's visit to Moscow was a further sign of the improvement in relations.</p>
<p>&quot;A peace treaty and full normalisation of our relations is the ultimate goal we are seeking,&quot; a senior Japanese official told reporters in Moscow on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Today's meetings have produced further impetus to our relations at a high level,&quot; he said on Friday. The official, who declined to be named, added that Ikeda had passed on to Yeltsin a letter from Hashimoto.</p>
<p>In it, Hashimoto called for an acceleration of dialogue based on a 1993 Tokyo declaration which for the first time formally acknowledged the existence of a territorial problem between the two countries.</p>
<p>He said Tokyo welcomed Moscow's cuts in the number of troops stationed on the islands, known in Japan as the Northern Territories and in Russia as the Southern Kuriles. Japanese officials believe about 3,500 Russian troops are based there.</p>
<p>Ikeda later held two hours of talks with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and was due to meet First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, who chairs a bilateral intergovernmental commission on trade and economic relations.</p>
<p>The Japanese official said Nemtsov, a pro-market liberal regarded as a possible future president, would visit Japan from June 9-11. &quot;We want to put a strong emphasis on such high-level contacts,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The official said Japanese support for Russia joining the G7 nations showed Tokyo now regarded Moscow as an equal partner and not as an adversary, as during Soviet times. &quot;We want to promote Russia's integration into the world economy,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>In addition to other issues, Ikeda and Primakov were expected to discuss reform of the United Nations' Security Council. Japan, an economic superpower but still lacking real political clout in world affairs, wants to win a permanent seat on the council.</p>
