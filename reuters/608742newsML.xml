<p>Russian Energy Minister Boris Nemtsov said on Friday the government planned a further shake-up at national power company Unified Energy System (UES) as part of its reorganisation of the electricity industry.</p>
<p>Nemtsov, charged with restructuring Russia's natural monopolies and who also has the rank of First Deputy Prime Minister in Russia's new reformist cabinet, told regional energy officials that a new wholesale energy market would start functioning this summer.</p>
<p>This would allow cuts in electricity prices for industrial consumers, although it would be some years before the new market was fully developed.</p>
<p>&quot;It will not be possible to cut tariffs without creating a normally functioning wholesale market,&quot; Nemtsov said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is desirable that we see the first results as early as this summer. Of course it's not possible to create a full-blooded market in a few months, but we plan to do that by 2000,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The government's restructuring efforts would look at heating tariffs as well as electricity prices, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;To create this market sensibly, without destroying the whole system, is an extremely difficult task for the state. We will move towards this very carefully, step by step, to achieve this,&quot; Nemtsov said.</p>
<p>Nemtsov, who was previously governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region, said the government's restructuring of UES, Russia's biggest company, would be carefully coordinated with regional governments and energy companies.</p>
<p>&quot;I still remember well that I worked for five and a half years as a governor and know how the problems of the regions are underestimated,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>UES, which owns and operates Russia's national grid, operates its own power stations and has large or controlling stakes in 70 of Russia's 72 regional &quot;energo&quot; power utilities.</p>
<p>Its shares dominate the Russian stock market, although foreign investors have often criticised the management for being unfriendly towards shareholders.</p>
<p>The state itself still owns 52.7 percent of RAO Yedinaya Energeticheskaya Sistema Rossii (UES), and Nemtsov said the government was setting up a new committee, which he would head, to represent the state's interests in the company.</p>
<p>UES will then be effectively under state control, he said.</p>
<p>The committee will recommend that Boris Brevnov, a banker brought in from Nizhny Novgorod by Nemtsov to serve as UES's vice-president, should take over as chief executive from Anatoly Dyakov, Nemtsov said.</p>
<p>Dyakov would remain chairman of the board of UES, on which all members of the government committee will also serve, Nemtsov said.</p>
<p>&quot;Anatoly Dyakov will not be a member of the committee of government representatives, but it would be advisable for him to be on the board of directors, as one of the most experienced and competent energy specialists in the country. He will defend the interest of the state, which also means of consumers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The reorganisation of UES is part of a broader effort to make the Russian energy market more competitive. The government says it wants to create a genuine wholesale market, allowing regional companies to sell power to industrial consumers all over the country, and independent companies to use the grid.</p>
<p>UES has already said it plans to cut its tariffs to industrial users by 13 percent this year, and Nemtsov said he hoped to see a price cut this summer.</p>
<p>Nemtsov repeated that the government would not allow UES to be broken up, and said the federal government had to retain control of the distribution system for electricity.</p>
<p>But he said the government could eventually devolve control of privatisation of energy companies, and the management of state stakes in them, to regional authorities.</p>
