<p>Cosmetics retailer Body Shop International Plc said on Thursday total retail sales in the first eight weeks of its current year grew seven percent overall, but were down two percent based on comparable stores.</p>
<p>The retailer, which reported a three percent drop in underlying profits to 31.7 million pounds for the year to March 1 1997, said its main challenge was to drive sales growth in its stores around the world, where markets were becoming ever more competitive.  </p>
<p>The group's retail sales rose eight percent to 622.5 million pounds ($1 billion) and the dividend was increased by 38 percent to 4.7 pence a share.</p>
<p>The retailer took a 6.5 million pound exceptional provision for its operations in France, where trading had been difficult and sales performance poor.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been reviewing with our head franchisee the best way forward in France, and are considering the potential transfer of the head franchise rights to a new operator,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>Chairman Gordon Roddick, who started the environmentally-conscious retail group with wife Anita, said the main challenge was to drive sales growth ahead in Body Shop stores around the world in markets which were becoming ever more competitive.</p>
<p>&quot;I am pleased to report that our underlying profitability for last year remained pretty much on track despite softer sales trends in some markets,&quot; he said in a statement.</p>
