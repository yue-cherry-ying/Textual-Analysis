<p>Singapore is worried by the rapidly increasing number of people over the age of 65 and the problems it will raise for the small island-state, Health Minister Teo Cheow Tong said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Yeo said in a speech before medical specialists that Singapore now has 210,000 people over the age of 65 in a population of 3.1 million people.</p>
<p>&quot;By the year 2020, we will have about 530,000 elderly, or 13 percent of the population,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What is worrying is that, arising from the post-war baby boom, the number of elderly will increase even more rapidly after that.&quot;</p>
<p>Singapore's elderly population is projected to rise to 800,000 by 2030.</p>
<p>&quot;They will then make up over 18 percent of the total population,&quot; Yeo said. &quot;It has complex social, economic and health dimensions.&quot;</p>
<p>Experts have said the problem may be even more acute in Singapore because of its smaller population base compared with its neighbours like Indonesia, which has a population of nearly 200 million people.</p>
<p>One way Singapore is trying to cope is to raise the retirement age, Yeo said. Beginning in January 1999, the retirement age will be increased to 62 years from 60.</p>
<p>Yeo said &quot;the longer term plan of eventually raising it to 67 years,&quot; the Health Minister said. &quot;Employment gives the elderly person a sense of worth, dignity and financial independence.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeo did not elaborate on his remarks but said Singapore needed to identify the most efficient and effective way to meet the health care needs of the elderly.</p>
<p>Putting the elderly in institutions is not a solution because &quot;it is difficult to replicate the warm emotional environment and support of their own family settings,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The number of nursing home beds is expected to rise to around 7,000 by the year 2000 from the current 4,400.</p>
