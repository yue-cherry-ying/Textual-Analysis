<p>You might not like the sound of &quot;Gangsta Rap&quot; but its harsh lyrics reflect real, deep-rooted problems in American society, a police expert said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The lyrics of the black music genre have been condemned by politicians, police organisations and others as being violent, sexist and anti-white.</p>
<p>But, said Sgt. Ron Stallworth of the Utah Department of Public of Safety: &quot;These kids are telling you what's wrong in our society. You might not like the message ... but it is saying something America needs to know.&quot;</p>
<p>Stallworth, an acknowledged expert on the music and its political aspects, addressed the National Conference on Preventing Crime in the Black Community, taking place in Miami.</p>
<p>Gangsta Rap has a controversial and bloody history. Two prominent rappers have been murdered recently -- Tupac Shakur in September and The Notorious B.I.G. in March. A song written by Ice-T, &quot;Cop Killer&quot;, caused a national furore in 1992 and was even denounced by President George Bush.</p>
<p>Stallworth said the names adopted by Gangsta Rap artists reflected violent attitudes and codes of behaviour -- ATL (Above the Law) and Public Enemy. A violent lifestyle was also reflected in songs titles, such as &quot;The Day the Niggaz Took Over&quot;, &quot;F--- the Police&quot; and &quot;Homicide.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The message is that America is white-dominated and racist, represses African-Americans, and the police are there to enforce that system,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rap lyrics glorified the killing of policemen, and black cops were particularly hated since they were seen as traitors, Stallworth said. Police were seen as an occupying force in the blighted inner cities.</p>
<p>&quot;If we want these kind of songs to stop, we had better start policing ourselves,&quot; Stallworth said, directing the remark to police officers in the audience.</p>
<p>&quot;We have got to understand what is motivating these kids. Whether we like it or not, these gangs are a microcosm of the greater American society. Gangsta Rap is like a window onto another world.&quot;</p>
<p>Stallworth, who bolstered his presentation with recitations of aggressively worded rap songs, said the music had predicted the Los Angeles riots of 1992.</p>
<p>To black youths, the unrest was a social revolt, he said.</p>
