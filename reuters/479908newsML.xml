<p>Iraq has welcomed an Arab League decision to suspend normal relations with Israel but urged Arab governments to take a firmer stand towards the Jewish state, newspapers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The papers, quoting a cabinet meeting chaired by President Saddam Hussein on Monday, said peace with Israel would never be &quot;real and solid&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;At a time the cabinet lauds the decisions taken (by Arab League) to confront Zionist aggression and oppression, it hopes these decisions are not meant to absorb the anger of Arabs and Palestinians (towards Israel),&quot; the official al-Qadissiya daily said.</p>
<p>Arab foreign ministers, frustrated by Israeli policies on settlements and Arab territory, recommended at a meeting in Cairo on Monday ending normal relations with Israel and restoring an economic boycott.</p>
<p>&quot;The cabinet says that Iraq had not wanted to see some bortherly Arabs...misled by the American administration as a sincere mediator or peace with the enemy (Israel) would be real and solid,&quot; the paper said.</p>
<p>Iraq, which fired scores of Scud missiles at the Jewish state during the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait, is still theoretically at war with Israel.</p>
<p>Its official media have carried reports opposing the making of peace by Arabs with Israel. Baghdad has also denied Western reports of clandestine contacts with the Israeli government.</p>
