<text>
<p>Banco de Mexico said on Tuesday its net international assets as of March 26 were $10.683 billion, compared to $10.858 billion on March 20.</p>
<p>The central bank said that its net international reserves as of March 26 were $19.836 billion, compared to $20.252 billion as of March 20.  </p>
<p>The central bank said the decrease of $175 million in net international assets in the same time period was due to:</p>
<p>--Net income from operations by the state oil company Pemex worth $46 million.</p>
<p>--Net sales of foreign currency to the federal government worth $204 million.</p>
<p>--A net loss of $17 million dollars for a combination of factors including changes in the dollar value of non-dollar assets and liabilities held by the bank; net returns on interest rates and from trading of metals and securities; and net deposits in dollar accounts from commercial banks at the central bank.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico said that between March 20 and March 26 the monetary base rose by 2.435 billion pesos due to an increase in the seasonal demand of bills and coins generated by the Easter Week holidays.</p>
<p>In the same period, deposits with the central bank decreased by 2.515 million pesos, chiefly because of the increase in demand for bills and coins.</p>
<p>The following table details Banco de Mexico's reserves and net domestic credit. All figures are in billions of pesos, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
