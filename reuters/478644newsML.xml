<p>Kazakhstan will name the winner of an international tender to develop its giant Uzen oilfield after April 20, a government official told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Birzhan Madiyev, in charge of individual projects privatisation at the finance ministry's state property department, said the World Bank wants the government to work out tighter criteria for bidders by April 7.</p>
<p>The World Bank is backing the tender and has allotted a</p>
<p>$108 million loan for the rehabilitation of the heavily exploited Uzen oilfield.</p>
<p>Participants include Amoco Corp of the United States, Malaysian state oil firm Petronas and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC).</p>
<p>Madiyev said that in line with the World Bank's demand, the three finalist companies would have to improve their investment offers and submit them to the tender commission by April 16, when offers would be opened.</p>
<p>Officials have said the development of the Uzen oilfield would cost around $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>The tender for the right to rehabilitate and exploit Uzen, Kazakstan's second largest oilfield after Tengiz, with estimated reserves of around 150 million tonnes of oil, was announced in February last year.</p>
<p>But Sarybay Kalmyrzayev, head of the state property department at the finance ministry, said last month the results had been delayed by the Oil and Gas Ministry, transformed recently into the National Kazakh Oil Company.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the Oil and Gas Ministry) have upset the tender, and we have been ordered to finalise the work,&quot; Kalmyrzayev said.</p>
<p>Work on Uzen was launched in 1965, and around 260 million tonnes of oil have been extracted over the last three decades.</p>
<p>Uzen's oil output peaked at 16 million tonnes in 1975 but has gradually fallen to the current 2.7 million tonnes a year.</p>
<p>Nurlan Balgimbayev, head of Kazakh Oil, has said investment in Uzen, located 150 km (100 miles) east of the Caspian Sea in southwest Kazakhstan, would raise oil output to around seven million tonnes.</p>
