<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington early next week, it was announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The prime minister has decided to make a quick visit to the U.S. beginning on Sunday night. The prime minister...is happy to have an opportunity to meet with President Clinton,&quot; said a statement issued by Netanyahu's office.</p>
<p>The meeting comes against the background of spiralling Israeli-Palestinian violence and a crisis in Middle East peacemaking.</p>
<p>Clinton said on Tuesday he was &quot;prepared personally to do anything I can&quot; to save the Middle East peace process. &quot;We've got to try to keep the lid on things over there ... It is not going to be easy,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Two Palestinians were killed in blasts in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday which Israel said were botched suicide bombings aimed at Jewish school children.</p>
<p>The PLO charged Israeli troops were behind one of the blasts. Hours later Israeli troops shot dead two Palestinians on the 13th day of clashes in the West Bank touched off by Israel's settlement construction in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups, whose militants have killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombings, denied they were involved in the blasts and blamed Israeli intelligence.</p>
<p>Hamas's military wing vowed to take vengeance on Israel for the blasts.</p>
