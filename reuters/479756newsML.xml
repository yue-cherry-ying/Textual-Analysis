<title>UK: UK gilts close lower as bearish US overshadows.</title>
<headline>UK gilts close lower as bearish US overshadows.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Gilt futures closed sharply lower on Tuesday, although opening lows were fought off, after a survey showing the acceleration in UK manufacturing levelled off in March failed to shake off bearish overtones from the U.S.</p>
<p>Bond markets across Europe were hit by a plunge in the U.S. stock market over the weekend amid fears the long bull run had run its course.</p>
<p>&quot;After the dramatic move we saw yesterday with bonds, Europe was playing catch up with the United States and so some of the domestic data had slightly less effect than it should have had,&quot; said Jonathon York, broker at Mees Pierson.  </p>
<p>June gilts tumbled to a session low of 108-05 at the open, then recovered to settle at 108-11, down 20/32 on the day.</p>
<p>York said nervousness as the UK election drew nearer was feeding weakness in the market and pushed it lower. &quot;On fundamentals gilts look pretty good value at the moment, but we're not really seeing foreign investors getting involved because of the election,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market would probably drift until Friday when U.S. non-farm payroll data would provide the week's focus.</p>
<p>If gilts did recover, York said key resistance was at 108-18 and 108-28 beyond that.</p>
