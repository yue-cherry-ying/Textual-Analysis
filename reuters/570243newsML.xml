<p>A Florida judge has ruled that the trial of a secondhand smoke class-action lawsuit filed by airline flight attendants be split into two parts with common issues decided before individual claims.</p>
<p>Dade County Judge Robert Kaye, in a ruling made available Thursday, handed a measure of victory to plaintiffs in the case by ruling that a jury will hear evidence about the behaviour of tobacco companies during the trial's first stage.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, known as Broin v. Philip Morris et al, was filed by a group of flight attendants who claim they were made ill by cigarette smoke on U.S. passenger jets.</p>
<p>The trial, scheduled to begin June 2, will be the first class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry. The class represents an estimated 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants suffering from lung diseases and other ailments.</p>
<p>The ruling resulted from a hearing Monday in which the tobacco companies asked Kaye to divide the trial, first having a jury consider whether second-hand smoke causes diseases and later determining the industry's liability. Plaintiffs' lawyer Stanley Rosenblatt argued that the two issues were intertwined and should not be separated.</p>
<p>In his ruling, Kaye decided to allow jurors to hear &quot;common&quot; issues during the first stage. These issues are the medical evidence on the alleged health effects of secondhand smoke and evidence on the behaviour of tobacco companies.</p>
<p>During the second stage, jurors will hear the claims of individual flight attendants.</p>
<p>Rosenblatt said he was pleased with the ruling because it would allow jurors to see &quot;the whole picture&quot; during the first stage.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it would have been wrong to separate the science of causation from the behaviour of the tobacco company over the years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. spokeswoman Peggy Carter said the ruling indicated that Kaye was having difficulty attempting &quot;to try what are really individual cases as a class action.&quot;</p>
<p>The tobacco companies have argued in the past that the lawsuit should not have been certified as a class-action because the illnesses of individuals and the causes of those illnesses should be proved individually.</p>
<p>&quot;We continue to believe this case cannot and should not proceed as a class action,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>In his ruling, Kaye said the case should be decided in stages and phases which would include &quot;special verdicts&quot; and &quot;general verdicts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The first stage shall encompass all common issues with regard to the subclass of lung/pulmonary/sinus diseases and disorders including lung cancer ... the second stage shall be concerned with the non-common or individual claims of the plaintiffs in this subclass,&quot; Kaye wrote.</p>
<p>Kaye revamped an initial trial plan, deciding that the issue of whether secondhand smoke causes lung cancer and other maladies should be linked to the behaviour of the defendants, the tobacco companies.</p>
<p>As a result, the first stage of the trial will decide whether the plaintiffs can prove the secondhand smoke-illness link, when the tobacco companies knew about the dangers, whether they knew about the threat to flight attendants and whether they fraudulently misrepresented the hazards.</p>
<p>The first stage also will decide whether the tobacco companies had a duty to warn flight attendants of the dangers of second-hand smoke and whether the flight attendants are entitled to punitive damages.</p>
<p>If the jury finds for the flight attendants in the first phase, the second phase will deal with the claims of individuals and the amount of compensatory damages.</p>
