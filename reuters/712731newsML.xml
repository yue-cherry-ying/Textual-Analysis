<title>RUSSIA: Yeltsin decrees wages to be paid by year-end.</title>
<headline>Yeltsin decrees wages to be paid by year-end.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-07-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin ordered on Tuesday that wage arrears to the armed forces should be paid in two months and the rest of the backlog to other employees on the state payroll by January 1, 1998, Russian news agencies said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said last week he wanted all these debts to be paid by October 1 but senior ministers appeared to have persuaded the 66-year-old leader that the task was not realistic.</p>
<p>Last week Yeltsin gave the cabinet three months to pay back all public-sector wage arrears but two leading reformers in the government, first deputy prime ministers Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais, said the deadline was too tight.</p>
<p>Chubais is also finance minister. Nemtsov, who is also fuel and energy minister, was quoted as saying on Monday that it might take up to six months to pay back all the debts to workers.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's decree was signed after he met Nemtsov and other top government officials at his holiday retreat in the northwestern region of Karelia.</p>
<p>&quot;We must determine ways to find finances...how we can cut spending and increase revenues, where to use borrowing, the sale of property and securities,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted Yeltsin as saying during the meeting.</p>
<p>The overall sum of the debt was not immediately avaliable.</p>
<p>But Chubais has said the wage backlog to the armed forces alone was more than five trillion roubles ($863 million).</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry's press service said on Tuesday that the central government's debt to those working in federal institutions was 7.7 trillion roubles while the overall debt of regional authorities amounted to 25.6 trillion.</p>
<p>It was not clear if the figures released by the ministry included the debt to the armed forces.</p>
<p>&quot;When we unite efforts of the federal authorities, both presidential and governmental, as well as banks and local authorities, then we can cope with any problem, &quot; Yeltsin was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>News agencies said Yeltsin also signed decrees on production sharing and on oil industry debts to the state budget. They also covered quotas on oil sales.</p>
<p>No details were immediately avaliable but Interfax quoted Yeltsin as saying both documents were &quot;of global importance&quot;. He added the decree on oil was &quot;a real blow against banditry&quot;.</p>
<p>Nemtsov was quoted as saying the new rules were aimed at making it impossible &quot;for crooks to do nothing but earn money&quot;. ($ = 5792 Russian Roubles)</p>
