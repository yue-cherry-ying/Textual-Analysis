<headline>Polish Pekao bank to be offered through bourse.</headline>
<dateline>WARSAW 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>An initial public offering of between five and 15 percent of Poland's Bank Pekao SA group will take place in the first half of 1998 at a special bourse session, the bank's president said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Shares will be sold through the Warsaw stock exchange at a special session,&quot; Andrzej Dorosz told Reuters in an interview. The subscription for the Pekao shares was likely in the first quarter of 1998, he added. @</p>
<p>The government gave its final approval for the privatisation of the Pekao group, worth around three to 4.5 billion zlotys, under which the bank will seek only passive investors.</p>
<p>Under the scheme, 30 percent of the bank's shares will be earmarked for a future sale to help finance a reform of the social security system and up to 15 percent will be offered to the bank's employees.</p>
<p>Dorosz said that the second stage of the bank's privatisation was likely to involve a new share issue in 1999 to increase its capital, possibly by 33 percent. @</p>
<p>&quot;It is difficult to talk now about the size of the issue, because it would take place in 1999, but it would be about one third of the value of the bank's capital,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Pekao group was created last year under a government scheme to consolidate and privatise Poland's banking system ahead of its opening up to foreign competition in several years.</p>
<p>Under the programme, the treasury gave Bank Pekao its 100-percent stakes in Pomorski Bank Kredytowy w Szczecinie SA, Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy SA, Bank Depozytowo-Kredytowy SA. @</p>
<p>The group plans to increase its gross profit to more than one billion zlotys in 1997 from last year's 848 million zlotys. Its balance sheet was 41.6 billion zlotys last year and its own funds were 1.9 billion zlotys.</p>
