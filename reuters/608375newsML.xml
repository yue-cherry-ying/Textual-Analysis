<p>British Lions acting captain Jason Leonard is more worried about his own side than the opposition in Saturday's opening match of their eight-week tour of South Africa.</p>
<p>The Harlequins and England tighthead prop is concerned about how the 1997 Lions will blend in their first outing, against a well-balanced Eastern Province invitation side.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't tend to look at the opposition that much -- we just want to make sure that we play our game at the moment. Obviously, we're still finding out stuff about each other as we've only been together for 10 days or so,&quot; Leonard said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really a case of just gelling as a group, of worrying about what we can do, how we can make stuff go right and how we can play well. I don't think we're worrying too much about the opposition at this moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Leonard will take charge on Saturday after the Lions selectors decided to rest tour captain Martin Johnson for the opening game following his demanding season in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Lions coach Ian McGeechan is using the tour opener to look at various player combinations.</p>
<p>Saturday's line-up includes the 1993 Lions centre pairing of Jeremy Guscott and Scott Gibbs and the English flanker duo of Richard Hill and Lawrence Dallaglio.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to be open-minded and we want to look at combinations,&quot; McGeechan said. &quot;We also have to take advantage of the fact that some of the players are used to playing together. There's certainly merit in picking players who have worked together before.&quot;</p>
<p>But McGeechan also knows that Saturday's opposition, which includes Springboks Kobus Wiese and Hennie le Roux and former Wallaby flank Sam Scott-Young, cannot be under-estimated.</p>
<p>&quot;They've been strengthened by the Gauteng players and others in their line-up have played Super 12 rugby this season. It's certainly a different side to that which represented Eastern Province earlier in the year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They've got a reasonable amount of experience in their line-up and are able to play some younger players as well.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lions have drafted in Welsh number eight Scott Quinnell as a replacement for England's Tim Rodber who has gastro-enteritis.</p>
<p>Teams:</p>
<p>British Lions: Neil Jenkins; John Bentley, Jeremy Guscott, Scott Gibbs, Nick Beal; Gregor Townsend, Rob Howley; Scott Quinnell, Richard Hill, Lawrence Dallaglio, Doddy Weir, Simon Shaw, Jason Leonard (captain), Keith Wood, Tom Smith.</p>
<p>Eastern Province Invitation XV: Theo van Rensburg; Henry Pedro, Rian van Jaarsveld, Hennie le Roux, Deon Kayser; Ken Ford, Chad Alcock; Jacques Greeff, Sam Scott-Young, Matthew Webber, Kobus Wiese, Armand du Preez, Daniel Saayman, Jaco Kirsten, Willie Enslin.</p>
