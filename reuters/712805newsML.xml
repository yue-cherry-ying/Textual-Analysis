<p>Skoda Automobilova a.s., the Czech unit of Germany's Volkswagen AG, said on Tuesday it would shut down production of its flagship Felicia compact model on Wednesday due to flooding of some crucial part suppliers.</p>
<p>Skoda spokesman Milan Smutny said the floods, which hit the eastern part of the Czech Republic on Sunday and have been worsening since, caused large damage to some of Skoda's suppliers, forcing some to stop production entirely.</p>
<p>&quot;Facilities including machines of some of our suppliers are under water, they can't produce nor supply,&quot; Smutny told Reuters from Skoda headquarters in Mlada Boleslav, north of Prague. He would not name the affected companies.</p>
<p>&quot;Our estimate is that we will be forced to interrupt production (from Wednesday) until Friday,&quot; he said, adding that the estimate was based on a forecast saying the floods would peak on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Smutny said Skoda was making 1,250 Felicias daily, adding that the company was prepared to compensate for the shutdown.</p>
<p>He added that the production of the mid-sized Octavia model was not threatened.</p>
<p>Some other companies have been forced to shut production due to the flooding, including tyre-maker Barum Continental, a subsidiary of Germany's Continental AG.</p>
<p>Rail and many road links to the northeast of the Czech Republic have been cut off and hundreds of houses were under water on Tuesday. Telephone networks and power supplies were cut off in the most affected areas.</p>
<p>Thousands of soldiers and rescuers continued evacuating people throughout Tuesday, and early estimates of the damage said it would be many times more than the two billion crown damage caused by floods last year.</p>
