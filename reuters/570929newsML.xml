<p>The business operations of South Korea's Hansol Group are expected to emerge unscathed from the firm's alleged connection to a sleaze scandal surrounding the son of President Kim Young-sam, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no doubt the scandal will hurt Hansol's image,&quot; said Suh Boyun, head of research at Dongsuh Securities. &quot;But the group's business activities will not be affected.&quot;</p>
<p>Hansol, whose flagship firm Hansol Paper is South Korea's largest paper-maker, is the country's 16th-largest business conglomerate.</p>
<p>By late on Thursday, prosecutors had not confirmed local media reports they had evidence that Hansol had managed a seven billion won ($7.8 million) fund at the request of an associate of the president's son, Kim Hyun-chul.</p>
<p>The main opposition National Congress for New Politics alleged the money was part of a 20 billion won fund left over from President Kim's 1992 election campaign.</p>
<p>Prosecution officials have said an arrest warrant will be sought against the younger Kim soon.</p>
<p>But the issue is not seen creating long-term damage to Hansol in a country with a long history of forgiving transgressions committed by business figures.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not expect a big impact on the Hansol Group, as the scandal is unlikely to develop into anything that pressures the group,&quot; said Chung Dong-bae, head of investment information at Daewoo Securities.</p>
<p>Kim Woo-choong, the globe-trotting chairman of the third-ranked Daewoo Group, and the chairmen of the Dong-Ah and Jinro groups all walked free despite convictions last year for bribing former president Roh Tae-woo.</p>
<p>The tycoons received suspended sentences. Their conglomerates were spared punishment altogether.</p>
<p>&quot;What happens in Korea is a personal reckoning rather than a corporate reckoning,&quot; said Henry Morris, managing director of securities firm Coryo International (H.K.) Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Hansol investigation results in a court proceeding, it will be against people, not the Hansol companies.&quot;</p>
<p>Share prices of Hansol's seven listed firms took a beating on Wednesday, with Hansol Paper and Hansol Electron going limit-down. The drubbing continued on Thursday morning, but by the end of the day a recovery had begun.</p>
<p>At the close of trading, five of the seven companies, including Hansol Paper and Hansol Electron, were unchanged from Wednesday's close of 19,600 won and 22,400 won, respectively.</p>
<p>Hansol Merchant Bank fell 200 won to 8,600, and Hansol Chemical Co Ltd rose 400 won to 23,300.</p>
<p>The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 4.41 points, or 0.64 percent, to 684.69.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the shock and disappointment wears off, people start to look at the situation more rationally,&quot; Morris said. &quot;Hansol is very well-regarded.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts praised the group's expansion into non-paper businesses such as telecommunications and merchant banking.</p>
<p>&quot;The group is heading in the right direction by expanding into future-oriented areas including information technology,&quot; said Suh of Dongsuh Securities. &quot;Hansol has good cash flow and it has utilised the stock market well to raise money.&quot;</p>
<p>Hansol was spun off from the giant Samsung Group several years ago. The group is controlled by the sister of Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee. ($1 = 895 won)</p>
