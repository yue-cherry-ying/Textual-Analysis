<p>As the Peruvian hostage crisis begins its fourth full month, President Alberto Fujimori is facing deadlocked talks with Marxist guerrillas holding 72 VIPs inside the Japanese ambassadors' residence.</p>
<p>While April has traditionally been a charmed month for Fujimori -- his election wins in 1990 and 1995 both fell in April -- his spell may end this year as his struggle of wills with the rebels drags into its 15th week.</p>
<p>The standoff with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) has undermined Fujimori's claim to have crushed Peru's leftist guerrillas, a task he once boasted was easier than getting a divorce from his wife, Susana Higuchi.</p>
<p>Talks were again deadlocked after apparently making progress last week. And &quot;the Chinaman,&quot; as Peruvians affectionately call him, begins April looking drawn, haggard and older than his 57 years.</p>
<p>Though his vitality seems intact, the deep lines on his face and his graying hair both betray the effects of 105 days and nights grappling with the worst crisis of his seven years in power.</p>
<p>Political analysts say the protracted crisis is taking a toll not just on Fujimori's face, but on his standing with the Peruvian public. It's also had a personal cost, with his brother Pedro among the 72 hostages living under MRTA guns.</p>
<p>&quot;His early success in getting the country to rally behind his government to respond to the MRTA's insolent challenge is being eroded by the delay in solving the crisis,&quot; said one Latin American diplomat in Lima.</p>
<p>His popularity, which in 1995 stood at 70 percent, has tumbled to 49 percent and polls show most Peruvians blame lapses by his security forces for the hostage crisis. Even worse, it has tainted the image of peace and progress in Peru that Fujimori worked so hard to present to the world.</p>
<p>But analysts said his problems did not start with the siege of the residence during a cocktail party on Dec. 17.</p>
<p>&quot;The months before the taking of the hostages were difficult for the president,&quot; said one official. His chief national security adviser, Vladimiro Montesinos, was accused by jailed drug kingpin Demetrio Chavez of taking bribes to ignore cocaine flights out of the Upper Huallaga Valley.</p>
<p>Fujimori's close relations with the military were taxed in November, when he pardoned former Gen. Rodolfo Robles, who was jailed by military courts after charging state intelligence services with links to paramilitary squads.</p>
<p>By freeing Robles, &quot;Fujimori reacted in an unusual way, causing his first serious confrontation with the military command,&quot; wrote commentator Fernando Rospigliosi in news magazine Caretas.</p>
<p>The brisk economic growth brought by Fujimori's policies has had a seamy underside in poverty and low wages. Official figures show 47 percent of Peruvians live in poverty, and while the minimum wage stands at $175 a month, calculations of basic food, clothing and shelter costs are about $400 a month.</p>
<p>The days when Peruvians spoke reverentially of Fujimori seem to have passed.</p>
<p>Last Thursday the northern town of Ferranafe was the scene of the first public booing of Fujimori. &quot;My salary doesn't buy anything,&quot; shouted one resident.</p>
<p>And a poll published by Lima newspaper El Comercio showed that if presidential elections were held today, Fujimori would be defeated by the mayor of Lima, Alberto Andrade.</p>
<p>He still has many defenders, like taxi driver Jaime Castro who called the critics &quot;a bunch of ingrates. They forget that the Chinaman ended the car bombs, the curfews, the people's trials (held by leftist rebels) and the murder of policemen.&quot;</p>
<p>Peru's undeclared civil war between the state and two left-wing insurgencies cost about 30,000 lives over 17 years.</p>
<p>Fujimori's tough line on the rebels won him the admiration of Peruvians. But with his support now fractured, his past popularity will be of little help to him in dealing with the MRTA hostage-takers.</p>
