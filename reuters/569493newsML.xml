<p>The United States, winner of the &quot;hormone beef&quot; dispute, wants the European Union to open its market to U.S. beef imports, a top Agriculture Department official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our preference is to open this market,&quot; trade adviser Paul Drazek said, rather than the alternative of accepting lower tariffs on other goods. &quot;The issue of compensation is secondary.&quot;</p>
<p>Since 1989, the EU has barred imports of beef produced with the aid of synthetic growth hormones. The World Trade Organisation, in an interim report late on Wednesday, agreed with the United States' argument that the ban was an unfair trade barrier.</p>
<p>According to the United States beef industry, the ban has reduced sales by at least $100 million a year and as much as $250 million annually. It said it wanted the EU to remove the ban.</p>
<p>The EU declined to comment on the report, which was confidential. Drazek did not directly discuss the ruling during testimony before a U.S. House of Representatives Agriculture subcommittee but his comment indicated a U.S. victory.</p>
<p>&quot;We always felt certain and continue to feel the WTO panel will conclude the EU ban is inconsistent&quot; with trade rules, Drazek said.</p>
<p>It will be a month before the ruling can become final. The EU could appeal the ruling or could try to keep the ban in place by offering compensation.</p>
<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told Reuters a victory &quot;would be very positive news...we've been fighting this for a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>While the EU has argued the ban was based on health concerns, U.S. officials contended the synthetic hormones were identical to natural growth stimulants and were safe for use.</p>
<p>&quot;We realise we are a long way from shipping products to the European Union,&quot; said Mark Armentrout, chairman of the international markets committee for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a trade group for U.S. ranchers, packers and exporters. &quot;But this was a major hurdle we needed to overcome. We are very excited by this initial ruling.&quot;</p>
<p>During a telephone news conference, Armentrout said the industry was willing to label its products as U.S. origin. However he said it would not &quot;put something on it that connotes a negative image.&quot;</p>
<p>At the House subcommittee hearing, Representative Wes Watkins, R-Okla., said the EU should &quot;drop this ban and open its markets immediately.&quot;</p>
