<p>The Riga stock exchange on Friday said it is ready to launch its free list, following the security commission's approval on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We have set no deadlines but we will be ready to do that in the coming weeks,&quot; Uldis Cerps, president of the bourse, told a news conference.  </p>
<p>The free list will be available for any company whose share issue prospectus has been approved by the securities commission, Cerps said.</p>
<p>Quoted companies which view the information and disclosure requirements of the other lists as too demanding could also be transferred to the free list, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Young, growing companies trying to attract public funds could seek them via the bourse's free list,&quot; Cerps said.</p>
<p>Cerps said the Riga bourse thus joins the tradition of most bigger European stock exchanges, which also operate free lists.  </p>
<p>&quot;We will have lists ready by the end of June and we already have one secondary list company, Kurzeme Lock, which has applied for the free list quotation,&quot; Guntar Kokarevich, the bourse's finance department manager, said.</p>
<p>The bourse said that it might transfer secondary list stocks Akta, Liepaja and Ventspils fish canneries, Naruta confectionery and Rota1 to the free list.</p>
<p>The bourse warned the companies on Thursday that their quotation will be stopped from May 26 unless they submit the mandatory financial reports by today, Friday.</p>
<p>By mid-day only Naruta confectionery had handed in its balance sheet to the bourse, Kokarevich said.</p>
