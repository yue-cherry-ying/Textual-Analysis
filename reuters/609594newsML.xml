<p>Villagers in the central Indian hamlets of Tamer and Bita on Friday recalled the horror of their world collapsing around them as they waited in summer heat for relief aid.</p>
<p>Authorities said 38 people were killed and thousands made homeless in an earthquake that struck Madhya Pradesh state in the heart of the subcontinent on Thursday, measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale.</p>
<p>&quot;The authorities are yet to give us the relief material including food,&quot; Bita village chief Gangaram Patel said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was like a thunderstorm, and smoke billowed out of the soil,&quot; said Patel, who injured his head when a wooden pole supporting a roof fell on him.</p>
<p>&quot;I rushed out of my house and saw cracks in the walls of the adjoining houses and could hear the roofs coming down in many others.&quot;</p>
<p>Bamboo poles used to support roofs jutted out from mounds of earth from broken walls that blocked the narrow alleys of Bita. In some places, tin roofs dangled loosely over wrecked houses.</p>
<p>Rescue teams set up camps for the homeless in Jabalpur, a city of 1.2 million people about 20 km (12 miles) from the epicentre. Bita lies 10 km (six miles) east of the epicentre of the tremor.</p>
<p>In Tamer, adjoining Bita, farm labourer Lokram said the earthquake was like a bulldozer rampaging across the village.</p>
<p>He folded his hands and looked at the sky, saying: &quot;We are lucky we were saved. But no relief has reached us yet and the debris has not been cleared by the authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;Please ask the authorities to visit our village and provide us with some food and clothing,&quot; Lokram said.</p>
<p>Gangaram said some 5,000 people were left homeless in the two villages.</p>
<p>Lokram's 55-year-old brother, Tekram, said: &quot;We still fear to enter the house, the structure hangs delicately. It might collapse any time.&quot;</p>
<p>Ajay Singh, a senior official in Jabalpur, said the tremor caused extensive damage to property but killed relatively few people despite its magnitude.</p>
<p>The quake, which struck at dawn, levelled several villages near Jabalpur. But relatively few villagers died as they were either sleeping outside in the summer heat or were doing early morning chores outside their huts, officials and residents said.</p>
<p>In Jabalpur's Victoria Hospital, survivors lay on blood-splattered beds.</p>
<p>&quot;The earth shook like a see-saw and the roof fell on me,&quot; Ram Kali Bai, 60, from Puranabasti village near Jabalpur, said from her hospital bed.</p>
<p>Geological Survey of India officials said experts from New Delhi would asses the chances of aftershocks in the region, part of the Narmada River basin that has been hit by five quakes of at least 6.0 on the Richter scale since 1927.</p>
<p>In September 1993, about 10,000 people were killed in neighbouring Maharashtra state when an earthquake measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale struck the Latur-Osmanabad region.</p>
