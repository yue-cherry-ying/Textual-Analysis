<title>DUBAI: Saudi supports Arab decisions on Israel ties.</title>

<p>Saudi Arabia said it supported Arab League resolutions recommending Arab states freeze the normalisation of ties with Israel, the official Saudi Press Agency reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>SPA said the cabinet, chaired by King Fahd, said after its weekly meeting on Monday night that the kingdom &quot;supported what the ministerial council of the Arab League meeting in Cairo recommended&quot;.</p>
<p>It said King Fahd reiterated his country's condemnation of Israel's settlement policy which he said threatened the Middle East peace process and urged the international community to work to end Israel's building of settlements in Palestinian land.</p>
<p>Arab foreign ministers recommended on Monday after a two-day meeting in Cairo that Arab states put an end to normal relations with Israel and restore the old economic boycott of the Jewish state.</p>
<p>The ministers also recommended closing down Israeli missions and withdrawing from multilateral talks on Middle East peace.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has no official ties with Israel, but has along with its Gulf Arab partners lifted a decades-old boycott of companies and institutions that deal with Israel -- the so-called secondary and tertiary boycott.</p>
<p>The Arab League recommendations are the most decisive joint Arab step taken since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office last June on a platform that challenged what Arabs saw as the basic principles of Middle East peace talks.</p>
<p>The immediate cause was Netanyahu's decision to go ahead with a Jewish housing settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
