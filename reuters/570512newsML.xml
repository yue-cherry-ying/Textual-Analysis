<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures were called to open lower Thursday following a weaker ACCESS session and early talk of softer cash prices, industry sources said.</p>
<p>June over-the-counter trade ranged from $2.30 to $2.32 after settling Wednesday at $2.353 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).</p>
<p>On ACCESS, June last traded 4.8 cents lower at $2.305.</p>
<p>Early cash prices at the Henry Hub, La., were talked a few cents lower at $2.27-2.30 per mmBtu.  </p>
<p>Technically, traders pegged resistance in June at the new high of $2.43 and then at $2.47-50. Support was seen first at $2.20, with major buying likely at $2.05 and then along the up trendline around $2.04.</p>
<p>In Wednesday's cash market, Gulf Coast swing prices firmed 10 cents to about $2.30. Midcon pipes were up a similar amount to $2.10-15. New York city gate gas firmed more than five cents to about $2.60.</p>
<p>Temperatures throughout most of the East and Midwest are expected to drop below normal into this weekend before turning milder early next week, Weather Services Corp.</p>
<p>AGA said late Wednesday that U.S. gas stocks rose last week by 46 bcf, within the 40-50 bcf expected range, and were still 206 bcf, or 30 percent over year-ago. Eastern storage gained 28 bcf and remained 130 bcf, or 50 percent, over 1996 levels.</p>
