<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday threw his weight behind plans for a union with neighbouring Belarus, despite warnings that the deal could be costly for Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;President Yeltsin states clearly and unequivocally that he is an initiator of the unification of the two fraternal states and their peoples, a consistent and firm supporter of it,&quot; a Kremlin spokesman said, quoting spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a geopolitical necessity and an economic reality.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who sent security adviser Ivan Rybkin to Minsk on Tuesday with a message for Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, is due to sign the Union Treaty on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The document provides for close coordination of foreign, military and economic policies between the two former Soviet republics. But it stops short of merging the Slav neighbours into a single state.</p>
<p>Government spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov had said the planned union could be costly for Moscow and economists warned it would be hard to integrate Russia's open privately owned economy with the centrally planned Belarussian one.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the agreement) means taking away some financial resources. To a certain extent it will make the financial situation in Russia more complicated,&quot; Shabdurasulov said.</p>
<p>The Russian government is already struggling to meet its budget plans and the International Monetary Fund has withheld several tranches of a $10 billion three-year loan because it is worried about low tax revenues. Ministers play host to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus in Moscow this week.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky, clearly reacting to newspaper criticism that there had been no debate on the planned union, said Wednesday's signing ceremony would be followed by a month of public debate on a charter of the new body.</p>
<p>But the union document should be treated with extra caution, he added. &quot;Before such a step, one should check 100 times to make truly integrational steps,&quot; Yastrzhembsky said.</p>
<p>The original draft of the Union Treaty, obtained by Reuters this week, had been contradictory, insisting that Russia and Belarus would remain separate sovereign states but that union decisions had to be obeyed.</p>
<p>It called for socially oriented market reforms -- a dream to conservative hardliners in Belarus but a nightmare for the young team trying to build a competitive market economy in Russia.</p>
<p>Kremlin sources said Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, appointed earlier this month to coordinate economic reforms, wanted to scrap the initial 17-page draft and replace it with a two-page declaration of intent.</p>
<p>But he faces opposition from more conservative ministers, some of whom see union with Belarus as a way to strengthen Russia and boost its international standing.</p>
<p>&quot;If everything goes all right, the treaty will be signed. It is of major significance,&quot; Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov told reporters in the Russian parliament on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not talking about an immediate union of the two states, we are talking about speeding up the process of integration. The whole world is following this path, why should we and Belarus go in different directions.&quot;</p>
<p>Russian communists and their allies argue that a union with Belarus was needed and opinon surveys have shown that it had good chances of being accepted by the population.</p>
<p>Liberals in Russia and in Belarus' nationalist opposition say the deal would hurt both countries' national interests.</p>
<p>The nationalists accuse their hardline leader of surrendering Belarus' five-year independence. Russian liberals have urged Yeltsin not to make any deal with Lukashenko who has a bad human rights record.</p>
