<p>Yen-based Tokyo precious metal futures ended weaker on Thursday on light volume, pressured by the yen's firmer tendency against the dollar, traders said.</p>
<p>Gold prices ranged from flat to nine yen per gram lower. Most-active benchmark April was down two at 1,370 yen.</p>
<p>Traders said they were tending to be moderately bearish on yen-based gold futures.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold futures may have more room to dip, as the yen's firmness dampened market sentiment,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Spot gold was quoted at $342.40/70 per ounce at 0734 GMT, against $341.00/50 in New York on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>In the bullion market, moderate two-way trade was detected.</p>
<p>One trader said he expected gold to drift within a tight range of between $340 and $343 per ounce, due to a lack of fresh incentives to move gold either way.</p>
<p>Platinum and palladium futures were mostly lower.</p>
<p>News on Wednesday that Russia may have signed a long-awaited decree to resume exports of platinum group metals (PGM) halted since December, had little impact on the market.</p>
<p>The market remains wary because the Russian PGM export agency has not informed Japanese buyers of an exact time schedule for export contract talks in Japan, a trader said.  </p>
<p>Mixed trade was detected in platinum group metals.</p>
<p>&quot;In palladium futures, some private investors covered shorts on price dips, while others built fresh shorts on believing prices may fall once Russia resumes exports,&quot; a palladium trader said.</p>
<p>Palladium prices ranged from four yen to eight yen per gram lower. Benchmark April was off four yen at 596 yen.</p>
<p>Platinum futures ranged from flat to seven yen per gram lower, with benchmark April ending down one yen at 1,464 yen.</p>
<p>Benchmark April silver was down 0.3 yen per 10 grams at 192.7 yen.</p>
