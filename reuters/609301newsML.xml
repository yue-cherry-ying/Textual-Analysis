<p>President Bill Clinton on Friday nominated Stanley Roth, a former National Security Council official, as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, the White House announced.</p>
<p>If confirmed by the Senate, Roth will replace Winston Lord, who retired in January.</p>
<p>Roth, whose nomination had long been expected, headed Asia policy at the NSC from March 1994 to Jan. 1, 1996. Since then he has been a researcher at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a private think-tank.</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry called him &quot;a very capable and skilled foreign policy expert on Asian affairs&quot;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Senate on Friday confirmed two other State Department nominations: Thomas Pickering, former ambassador to Moscow, as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, replacing Peter Tarnoff; and Stuart Eizenstat, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, as Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, replacing Joan Spero.</p>
<p>Both appointments were approved by unanimous consent, without a recorded vote.</p>
