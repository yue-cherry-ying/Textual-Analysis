<p>On a hillside campus in southern Virginia, thousands of earnest young Christian fundamentalists live and study in a community that consciously sets itself against the mainstream of American culture.</p>
<p>Founded in 1971 by Baptist preacher, TV evangelist and political activist Jerry Falwell, Liberty University claims to be the largest independent Christian university in the world.</p>
<p>Its 6,000 resident and 10,000 commuting students live in a kind of alternative universe, almost entirely cut off from the norms and ways of society outside. It is an entirely evangelical Christian world, where other voices are stilled, other beliefs largely unheard from.</p>
<p>&quot;You get to be in a comfort zone. Everywhere I go I'm surrounded by Christianity,&quot; said Larry Place, a Liberty undergraduate.</p>
<p>&quot;At Liberty, I've felt a freedom to live my Christian life in God's sight. Rules are set to establish us as a Christian institution,&quot; said student Chad Pruitt.</p>
<p>Falwell, who won national prominence in the 1970s and 1980s as leader of the Moral Majority political movement, conceived the university as an instrument to spread his version of Christianity around the country and the world.</p>
<p>CATCH THE VISION</p>
<p>&quot;People would come to Lynchburg, study with us, be a part of America's fastest-growing church, see it expanding, see it growing, see how it's done, catch the vision, carry the vision to their own home towns and translate what God was doing in Lynchburg to churches in every state of the union and every country of the world,&quot; he wrote in his autobiography.</p>
<p>With 26,000 alumni and thousands of Liberty-trained pastors and missionaries already spreading the word, Falwell now says his vision is taking shape.</p>
<p>&quot;The next 25 years, I predict we will change the world with young champions for Christ who leave this campus and invade every sector of society with a quality of talent and gift and a vocation and a commitment to the living Christ,&quot; he says in a recruiting video sent to prospective students.</p>
<p>Students at Liberty take their mission to preach very seriously. &quot;We hand out religious tracts before and after every game,&quot; said Libi Cook, a member of the university's womens softball team.</p>
<p>Prayer is a pillar of life at Liberty and students are expected to do plenty of it -- at compulsory convocations three times a week, in small groups in their residence halls and on their own. Students are also required to do community service at home or abroad.</p>
<p>Liberty is committed to the proposition that the Bible is the literal word of God. A &quot;Creationist Museum&quot; on campus carries exhibits that seek to show that God created the world in six days, as told in Genesis, and that the theory of evolution is wrong.</p>
<p>The museum presents a display of dinosaur bones and fossils. An explanatory panel says carbon testing has demonstrated they are only a few thousand years old and were &quot;preserved during the Worldwide Flood recorded in Genesis.&quot;</p>
<p>TEACHING AND PREACHING</p>
<p>Lew Weider, a pastor who teaches a compulsory ethics course, said his classes were a mixture of teaching and preaching.</p>
<p>&quot;I teach information from a passionate perspective. Even these kids are confused. They are Generation X, a product of their culture,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;These students have been taught by their culture that everyone has the right to do what they want. They have been duped,&quot; said Weider.</p>
<p>&quot;Christians have been taught by society they cannot legislate Christian morality. But if we remain silent, they shove their morality down our throats,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Anyone entering the university commits themselves to a strict code of behaviour that governs their every waking moment. &quot;The Liberty Way&quot;, as it is called, lays down the way students must dress -- coats and ties for men, modest skirts for women and absolutely no jeans or shorts.</p>
<p>For men, &quot;hair should be cut in such a way that it will not come over the ears, collar or eyebrows at any time. Ponytails for men are unacceptable. Beards are not acceptable for undergraduate students,&quot; the Liberty Way says.</p>
<p>Male and female living quarters are strictly segregated. The code also tells students what kind of posters they can have in their rooms, what kind of music they can listen to -- &quot;music that honours the Saviour and is in harmony with God's word -- what kind of movies they may watch. It bans sunbathing on campus and even sets limits on throwing snowballs.</p>
<p>But undergraduate Chad Pruitt denied Liberty students were strait-laced Bible thumpers. &quot;We watch movies. We go to (shopping) malls. It's just that we have a relationship with Jesus Christ,&quot; he said.</p>
