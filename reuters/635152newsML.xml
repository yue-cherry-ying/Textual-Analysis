<headline>Spurned husband burned joint savings -- or did he?.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>A 62-year old man took revenge on his estranged wife after she refused to consider reconciliation by burning most of their life savings in his back garden .</p>
<p>Raymond Orton told a court he withdrew 100,000 pounds ($163,000) cash from a joint account held with his wife Brenda, 61, and set fire to it in a dustbin.</p>
<p>&quot;I got a big tin, put some newspaper in, set light to that and just slung the money on,&quot; Orton said. He is charged with breaching pledges not to dispose of any joint assets from the marriage.</p>
<p>But the judge hearing the case on Monday said he doubted the story and ordered further inquiries. &quot;It may be he has done something else with the money and will gain the benefit subsequently,&quot; he said.</p>
