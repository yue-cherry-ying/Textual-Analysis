<headline>Westinghouse's CBS makes Mel Karmazin TV chief.</headline>

<p>Westinghouse Electric Corp., moving to boost its slumping television operation, said Friday that the president of its CBS television and cable group resigned and would be replaced by Mel Karmazin, who ran Infinity Broadcasting until Westinghouse acquired it last year.</p>
<p>Karmazin replaces Peter Lund, 56, who had been head of the TV network since 1995. Lund joined CBS in 1977.</p>
<p>The company said all of its television and radio stations will be consolidated into a single organisation as part of a corporate reorganization. Karmazin, currently head of the CBS radio division, will be chairman and chief executive of the new CBS station group.</p>
<p>Westinghouse Chairman Michael Jordan said the reorganization was in advance of the company's corporate split this fall, when the industrial businesses become Westinghouse Electric Co. and the media businesses CBS Corp. Jordan will run CBS.</p>
<p>Beginning immediately, the television and cable units will report directly to Jordan, the company said.</p>
<p>All CBS radio and television stations will be consolidated into a single organisation led by Karmazin.</p>
<p>Wall Street signalled its approval by boosting Westinghouse's stock $1.75 to $18.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Industry analysts said the move would be a boost to the slumping CBS television network.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a significant positive for the stock specifically, and for the company,&quot; said Niraj Gupta, an analyst at Schroder Wertheim.</p>
<p>Giving Karmazin control of the 14 CBS owned and operated television stations would be an immediate shot in the arm, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;He's worshipped by the financial community,&quot; said John Reidy at Smith Barney. &quot;He did a fabulous job at Infinity.&quot;</p>
<p>As the chairman of Infinity Broadcasting, Karmazin built the company up as the leading radio station operator in the country before selling it to Westinghouse for about $4.9 billion. With the sale, Karmazin became a major Westinghouse shareholder.</p>
<p>But Reidy cautioned that &quot;This is a new and different kind of challenge&quot; for Karmazin.</p>
<p>While a Westinghouse statement did not detail Lund's title or responsibilities had he remained with the company, a spokesman said Lund would have been president and CEO of the CBS television network and cable services.</p>
<p>CBS said Lund &quot;declined the opportunity to lead the remaining television and cable businesses and elected to leave CBS.&quot;</p>
<p>Lund's resignation was reported to have been sparked when Jordan decided to give Karmazin control of the stations. A CBS source said the resignation occurred earlier this week.</p>
<p>CBS said that Lund &quot;agreed to assist in the transition to the new organisation.&quot;</p>
<p>It said Jordan &quot;endorsed the leaders of the three core network businesses&quot; -- Leslie Moonves, president of Entertainment; Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News; and Sean McManus, president of CBS Sports.</p>
<p>The CBS businesses posted first-quarter earnings of $110 million, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, versus $146 a year ago, including accounting changes, according to a Westinghouse spokesman.</p>
<p>By the end of this year, CBS will own four cable channels -- The Nashville Network, Country Music Television, the Spanish-language TeleNoticias, and the recently launched CBS Eye on People.</p>
<p>The announcement of the shakeup came a day after CBS presented its fall TV lineup to advertisers at Carnegie Hall. The slate of shows was generally well-received.</p>
<p>Advertisers said the strongest shows appeared to be the new Steven Bochco police drama, &quot;Brooklyn South,&quot; which will air in place of &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; on Monday nights and &quot;The Gregory Hines Show,&quot; to run on Friday nights.</p>
