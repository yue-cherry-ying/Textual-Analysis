<title>UK: Anti-smoking activists demand global settlement.</title>

<p>Anti-smoking activists from around the world signed a joint letter on Tuesday urging that any settlement in U.S. tobacco talks take other countries into consideration.</p>
<p>They said they were afraid that talks aimed at settling a raft of lawsuits by U.S. states against tobacco companies would leave the firms free to act as they wished in other countries.</p>
<p>&quot;An American settlement that excludes the rest of the world or attempts to give the tobacco companies global immunity is unethical and will be ineffective from the public health perspective,&quot; said Dr Judith Mackay, director of the Hong Kong-based Asian Consultancy on Tobacco Control.</p>
<p>&quot;If sales fall in the United States, or the U.S. companies are forced to pay a substantial settlement award, the tobacco multinationals can be expected to intensify their invasion of the Third World and Eastern Europe,&quot; the campaigners, from 19 countries, said in an open letter.</p>
<p>The U.S. states are trying to recoup medical costs for treating smokers, and similar moves are afoot in the Canadian province of British Columbia.</p>
<p>The campaigners said any settlement should apply controls to all cigarettes made in the United States, including those for export, and should include a global code of conduct on issues such as advertising aimed at children.</p>
<p>It should also ensure that non-Americans get the same levels of compensation as American victims.</p>
<p>A key negotiator in the U.S. tobacco talks said he was hopeful a settlement would be reached this week.</p>
<p>Sources close to the talks said that one of the most contentious issues that still remains is whether individuals would be able to sue for punitive damages.</p>
<p>They said both sides had already agreed to a number of health care provisions, with the tobacco industry agreeing to cut advertising and stop using cartoon characters, pay penalties if youth smoking is not reduced, and fund programmes to help smokers quit.</p>
