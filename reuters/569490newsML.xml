<p>Investors embraced stock mutual funds in April, spurning low-yielding bond and income funds, but caution ruled amid fears that the stock market rally would fizzle, an industry group and analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>At the same time, more aggressive stock funds appear to be making a comeback, as the scare from last month's stock sell-off is wearing off, they said.</p>
<p>Investors poured an estimated $13.5 billion into stock mutual funds in April, up from $10.5 billion in March, the Investment Company Institute (ICI) said.</p>
<p>In the first few days of May, investors snatched up conservative mutual funds, and overall cash flows are primed to beat April totals, according to fund companies.</p>
<p>At the same time, the ICI said the estimated flow to bond and income funds was nil last month after investors withdrew $1.99 billion in March.</p>
<p>&quot;If we hold this daily pace for all of May, it will be the fastest pace on record,&quot; said Gavin Quill, vice president of marketing for Scudder Investor Services Inc.</p>
<p>For the first five days of May, Scudder saw inflows of $76 million compared with $187 million for all of April -- a daily rate of about $15 million vs. $9 million in April, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;May is on track to be about the same as April or stronger,&quot; said Brian Mattes, a spokesman at Vanguard Group.</p>
<p>Quill said &quot;the area of greatest focus&quot; is its conservative growth and income fund, which has accounted for nearly 50 percent in equity flows so far this month.</p>
<p>&quot;Index funds are out in front. The 500 Portfolio fund is still a frontrunner,&quot; said Mattes of Vanguard.</p>
<p>However, investors are also becoming more aggressive.</p>
<p>&quot;There's been a dramatic shift within the first week to more aggressive funds,&quot; said Tracey Gordon, a spokeswoman at Charles Schwab Corp. &quot;The laggards for the first quarter are suddenly performing extremely well.&quot;</p>
<p>Schwab posted net inflows of $174 million into aggressive growth funds for the first seven days of this month compared with $32 million for all of April.</p>
<p>Growth funds had inflows of $252 million for the first days of May vs. $129 million for all of April, Gordon said.</p>
<p>Massachusetts Financial Services Co. said the conservative Massachusetts Investors Trust, the country's oldest fund, and MFS Research Fund, a mid-cap growth fund, both benefited from large inflows this month.</p>
<p>&quot;Large-cap growth and income and growth funds are the most popular so far this month,&quot; said Jim Folwell, a market analysis manager at MFS.</p>
<p>Analysts noted that while the April estimates were higher than the March results they were still far below the flows in April 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;A year ago, the stock market was a lot more accomodating than it was this year,&quot; said Susan Paluch, managing editor of the Morningstar Investor newsletter. &quot;That's certainly having an effect.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts also noted that new fund investors, scared by the stock market's volatility, have sought refuge in safer money market funds.</p>
<p>The ICI's monthly estimates are derived from unpublished weekly estimates based on a survey of long-term funds that account for about 97 percent of long-term mutual fund assets, the ICI said.</p>
