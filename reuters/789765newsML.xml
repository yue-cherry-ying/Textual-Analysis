<p>A federal jury began deliberations Friday to decide whether Arizona Gov. Fife Symington lied to banks to prevent the real estate empire he developed from collapsing.</p>
<p>Symington, 51, faces 19 counts of federal bank fraud stemming from his real estate dealings in the mid-1980s to early 1990s. He also is charged with one count each of attempted extortion and perjury.</p>
<p>After receiving instructions from U.S. District Court Judge Roger Strand, the jury began its deliberations following 13 weeks of testimony, including six days from Symington, a two-term governor.</p>
<p>The seven-man, five-woman jury will work weekdays until it reaches a unamimous verdict or there is an impasse.</p>
<p>The state's Republican chief executive would be forced from the office he has held since 1991 if convicted on a single count. He could also face a prison term.</p>
<p>Prosecutors depicted Symington as a well-educated liar, who manipulated lenders to get millions in loans.</p>
<p>The government also pressed hard on allegations that Symington abused his office in seeking to change his loan agreement with six labour unions.</p>
<p>The unions provided $10 million to build an office-retail project in downtown Phoenix.</p>
<p>Prosecutors also have tried to prove that Symington lied during bankruptcy proceedings about one of his financial statements. He filed for bankruptcy in September 1995.</p>
