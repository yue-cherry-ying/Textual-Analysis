<p>Jordan expects to announce the transformation of its Red Sea port of Aqaba into a free trade zone by early next year, a senior government minister said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Jawad Anani told reporters the government, after having drafted the terms of reference for the project, had shortlisted six international firms to submit proposals on optimal ways of transforming the port city, Jordan's only sea outlet, into a free-trade zone.</p>
<p>The government would award the tender by August and the winning firm would have six months to submit the proposals.</p>
<p>&quot;The firm will study the options to make this project more viable and its impact on the state budget and study the needed legislation to facilitate it...and to become a vital project capable of attracting foreign investments,&quot; Anani said.</p>
<p>The government has placed the project centre stage among schemes it is now promoting to draw much needed foreign investment to help rejuvenate its aid-dependant economy.</p>
<p>It believes a special regime in the port city, which is attractively located between trading crossroads, could attract multi-nationals to set up large scale re-export industry with an eye to neighbouring markets.</p>
<p>Aqaba's free-zone area would have its own administration and a different legal and tax regime from that applied in Jordan and enjoying special customs arrangements to curb internal smuggling to other parts of the kingdom, Anani said.</p>
<p>Anani said the project, which needed extensive marketing, would be submitted by Jordan to foreign investors attending the Middle East and North Africa economic summit which Qatar plans to host in Doha next November.</p>
<p>The envisaged free trade areas space will cover an area of 23 square km. The port city of Aqaba, now a major conduit for Iraq trade, is also a base for Jordan's expanding downstream fertiliser industry.</p>
