<p>The White House on Friday blasted the Republican Congress for failing to approve emergency disaster aid for 33 states before leaving for the Memorial Day holiday weekend.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton &quot;is extremely disappointed that those citizens of 33 states that need access to disaster assistance ... will see some of their assistance jeopardized,&quot; White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said.</p>
<p>&quot;Communities that have been depending on this funding to get back on their feet are being left short-changed by a short-sighted Congress, which does not reflect well on the Republican leaders of Congress,&quot; McCurry said.</p>
<p>House Republican leaders on Thursday allowed members to take a week's break after blocking efforts to provide disaster aid for the flooded Midwest.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, one of the states in line to receive federal disaster relief, said Republican legislators were more concerned with getting away for the long holiday than with disaster victims.</p>
<p>&quot;Republicans wanted to leave in the worst way, and they did,&quot; Daschle said at a news conference on Friday. &quot;They put a greater priority on plane tickets than disaster payments. They set a new low for responsibility in the Congress.&quot;</p>
<p>Daschle said the move was &quot;an outrageous way in which to govern ... and I think some day they are going to feel sorry they made this disastrous mistake.&quot;</p>
<p>Some Democrats have said the decision to close shop with aid in limbo was reminiscent of the two unpopular government shutdowns engineered by Republicans during unsuccessful talks on a fiscal 1996 budget deal.</p>
<p>Both parties support disaster aid, but Clinton threatened to veto the $8.4 billion emergency spending bill because of unrelated spending and environmental amendments added by Republicans.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's pray there's no hurricane any time soon,&quot; McCurry told reporters, saying &quot;there's no money left&quot; to deal will many of the problems facing disaster victims.</p>
<p>McCurry said about $100 million worth of federal money earmarked to rebuild and redevelop parts of the flood-ravaged Dakotas and Minnesota will be suspended, along with two Agriculture Department programs aimed at emergency conservation and flood control.</p>
<p>Money that would have paid for emergency loans for flood victims will also be held up without the disaster aid bill, McCurry said.</p>
