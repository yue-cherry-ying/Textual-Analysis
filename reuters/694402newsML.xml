<p>A Brazilian civil rights group plans to sue Transport Minister Eliseu Padilha for comparing the nation's soccer legend Pele, who is black, to asphalt, local newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Speaking at a transport seminar on Thursday, Padilha said, &quot;There are two blacks admired in Brazil. One is Pele, forever our king. The other is King Asphalt, everybody likes asphalt.&quot;</p>
<p>Padilha's comment came under fire from reporters covering the conference. When they told him his comment sounded racist and asked for an explanation, Padilha said he did not intend to demean Pele but was merely repeating an expression he had heard.</p>
<p>&quot;The racist interpretation made by the press was wrong,&quot; Padilha told a local news agency on Friday.</p>
<p>But the Centre for Expression of Marginalized Populations (CEAPM) plans to file criminal charges against Padilha for racism and a civil suit for collective damage, executive secretary Ivanir dos Santos told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Under Brazilian law, racism is considered a crime.</p>
<p>&quot;This declaration is very bad. At school, when someone wanted to offend me, they would say I was an 'asphalt popsicle,'&quot; dos Santos said.</p>
<p>Padilha told the newspaper he telephoned Pele, who is currently in New York, to apologise for his remark, saying that he did not mean to demean Pele and that his own grandparents were black.</p>
<p>&quot;My mother is of European descent, my father is of black origin and in order to clear this up, I have invited representatives of black movements to meet on Tuesday to clear up this episode,&quot; Padilha said.</p>
<p>Pele, whose name is Edson Arantes Nascimento, is Brazil's sports minister. Although viewed abroad as one of the world's greatest athletes during his long soccer career, he has complained about being subjected to racism back home in Brazil.</p>
<p>However, Pele told Globo television that he was confident Padilha had not intended any offence with his remark.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe the way he expressed himself was unfortunate, but I don't have any doubt that he didn't do this in a pejorative tone,&quot; Pele said.</p>
<p>Economist Helio Santos, a member of the interministerial work group created by Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to combat racism, said the transport minister's comment showed that Brazil was still an intrinsically racist society.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not only minister Padilha who is racist, it's society as a whole,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>About half of Brazil's population is black or mulatto.</p>
