<headline>Would-be Russian tsar's ceremony postponed.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-06-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>A ceremony to mark the coming of age of a teenager who claims to be head of Russia's exiled imperial family has been postponed because of economic troubles in the city where it was due to take place.</p>
<p>Prince Georgy Mikhailovich, 16, was to have been sworn in as head of the tsarist family in Kostroma on Saturday. The ceremony will now take place on August 28 or 29.</p>
<p>&quot;Socio-economic conditions in Kostroma at the moment are not favourable for holding this ceremony,&quot; Vadim Lopukhin, an official of the Nobility Assembly, whose members claim descent from the pre-revolutionary aristocracy, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The organisers were worried by strikes and discontent due to unpaid wages in the city, north of Moscow.</p>
<p>Mikhailovich's great-grandfather was a cousin of Nicholas II, murdered with his family by Bolsheviks in 1918.</p>
<p>The Russian government has denied suggestions that President Boris Yeltsin is considering restoring the monarchy.</p>
