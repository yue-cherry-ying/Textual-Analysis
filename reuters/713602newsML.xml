<title>PORTUGAL: Portugal copper workers to continue strike - union.</title>

<p>Workers at the Neves Corvo copper mine in southern Portugal decided Tuesday to continue their strike after a meeting with management brought no new proposals, union officials said.  </p>
<p>Antonio Banza, a leader of the mine workers union, told Reuters strikers insist the company stop the introduction of a Sunday shift before they'd agree to any future talks.</p>
<p>Mine managers and union representatives held several hours of talks Tuesday but without achieving any breakthrough in the dispute over working hours.</p>
<p>Antonio Saleiro, civil governor of nearby Beja, 250 km southeast of Lisbon, warned strikers, who have been mounting pickets outside the mine gates, that they were breaking the law if they prevented employees who wanted to work from entering the premises.</p>
<p>But union leaders said pickets were only operating on side entrances and that no worker was being prevented from entering through the main gate.</p>
<p>Banza said that a group of strikers would stage a demonstration outside the offices of the state-controlled Somincor, which has a 51 percent stake in the mine, on Thursday.</p>
<p>Somincor has said that it will not meet the strikers for as long as they continue picketing the mine.</p>
<p>Union leaders said that the strike, which began Monday morning, had the backing of 90 percent of the workforce.</p>
<p>The mine management says that the introduction of Sunday working is necessary to boost efficiency and enable the mine, where copper grades have fallen steadily, to compete on the international market. --Lisbon bureau 3511-3150035</p>
