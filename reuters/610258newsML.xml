<p>French mining group Eramet said on Friday that it would hold its annual general meeting on July 28 &quot;at the latest&quot;.</p>
<p>In a statement issued following a meeting of its board of directors, Eramet said the board would meet again on June 24 (corrects from May 24) to set a date for the annual general meeting and decide which draft proposals it would submit for shareholders' approval.</p>
<p>On May 13 Eramet postponed an annual shareholders meeting called for May 29 to give itself more time to consider a number of requests put forward by shareholders and staff.</p>
<p>Eramet is involved in a dispute with its main shareholder</p>
<p>the French state over the distribution of mining assets in</p>
<p>New-Caledonia.</p>
<p>State-holding Erap, which has 55 percent of Eramet has threatened to take control of Eramet's board and to replace chairman Yves Rambaud, who opposes plans to curb the group's expansion in new Caledonia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile institutional investors concerned over the way the state has handled the dispute have drafted proposals aimed at insuring the future independence of the board. Staff representatives want employees to be given a chance to select three directors under a 1983 public sector law.</p>
<p>Eramet's board met earlier in the day to review these proposals.</p>
<p>In the statement Eramet said the three staff representatives could be selected during the last week of June, provided an agreement can be reached with trade unions.</p>
<p>The board has also asked four its members to review draft proposals by minority shareholders ahead of their submission to the annual general meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;Due to the election date for staff representatives, the annual general meeting will be held on July 28 at the latest,&quot; Eramet said.</p>
<p>The group also said that it will ask a commerce court for</p>
<p>permission to postpone until end July the deadline for approval by shareholders of the group's 1996 accounts.     -- Paris newsroom +331 4221 5432</p>
