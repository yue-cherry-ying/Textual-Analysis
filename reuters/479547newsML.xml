<p>Indian political leaders began jockeying for power on Tuesday ahead of a parliamentary confidence vote in Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's government, triggered by the sudden loss of a key ally.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda's 15-party coalition swiftly closed ranks behind the prime minister after the Congress party, which gave make-or-break support to the government, suddenly withdrew its backing on Sunday and staked a rival claim to power.</p>
<p>The 10-month-old centre-left United Front alliance controls only 178 seats in the 545-member lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha. The Congress party had reluctantly shored up the government with its 140 deputies since June.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda on Monday won an extra four days from President Shankar Dayal Sharma to prove his majority. Sharma had earlier set an April 7 deadline for a confidence vote.</p>
<p>Sharma's directive to Deve Gowda to take a vote of confidence by April 11 closed the government's option to call snap polls, forcing the prime minister either to resign or seek a split in the Congress party to gain a majority.</p>
<p>Most senior Congress leaders have stopped short of publicly throwing their weight behind party president Sitaram Kesri's decision to topple the government, sparking speculation over an imminent rift within the party.</p>
<p>Congress' shock decision sent share prices in Bombay plunging more than eight percent on Monday as investors struggled to come to grips with the unexpected bout of political uncertainty.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda has ruled out stepping down to defuse the crisis.</p>
<p>The Hindu rightwing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which emerged as the single largest party in last year's inconclusive general elections, has vowed to vote against the confidence motion.</p>
<p>The BJP, which lost power after 12 days of government last May when it failed to muster a parliamentary majority, says it will not stake a claim to form a government at this stage.</p>
<p>Analysts say the BJP, which controls 194 seats in parliament with its allies, is keen to contest mid-term elections. An opinion poll last month showed that the BJP was the only party likely to gain from fresh general elections.</p>
<p>Both Congress, which suffered a humiliating defeat in elections last May, and the United Front, which was hastily cobbled together after the polls threw up no clear winner, appear reluctant to face fresh polls.</p>
<p>Congress and the coalition's constituents had been bitter opponents during the election campaign but they had joined hands solely to thwart the BJP's bid for power.</p>
