<p>Hungarian state privatisation agency APV Rt is considering selling its 25 percent plus one vote stake in OTP Bank, possibly in the fourth quarter of this year, a banking source said.</p>
<p>The government would retain only its golden share which would mean that &quot;nothing could happen without the government's approval in strategic matters of the bank&quot;, the source told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;This is how they (the government) look at privatisation -- they believe there should...be an almost total disappearance of the state from the bank,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>The daily Nepszabadsag reported on Friday that Agnes Balazs, deputy state secretary in the Ministry of Finance, said APV had proposed the sale of the government's stake in OTP but that the government had not yet discussed the matter.</p>
<p>Balazs was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The banking source, who asked not to be identified, said the government hoped to complete the sale of its holdings in Hungary's biggest commercial bank before the next parliamentary elections, due to be held by next May.</p>
<p>&quot;It may be the fourth quarter because they could do that based on the first half results and that would probably give them a better chance to have a higher price,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>The source added that the offering would probably be made along similar lines to those of recent IPOs for oil and gas conglomerate MOL and drugs maker Richter Gedeon, with shares offered internationally and domestically.</p>
<p>The source added that the offering would not be made to strategic investors.</p>
<p>OTP posted an after-tax profit of 9.94 billion forints in 1996 on assets of 1,256.1 billion forints, compared with an after-tax profit of 6.97 billion forints on assets of 1,027.78 billion forints in 1995.</p>
<p>At a shareholders meeting in April, chairman and CEO Sandor Csanyi said OTP had lost one percent of its market share last year in Hungary's increasingly competitive retail banking sector, retaining a 57 percent share.</p>
<p>He said the bank's large network and development of services should enable OTP to retain this share.</p>
<p>OTP shares closed on Thursday at 4,300 forints, down from the year high on April 21 of 4,450.</p>
