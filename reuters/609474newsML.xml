<p>Two car bombs exploded in the western Algerian town of Tlemcen on Friday, killing seven people and wounding 12, Algerian security services said.</p>
<p>The Algerian news agency APS, quoting the security services, said the bombs exploded before dawn in Tlemcen, some 400 km (250 miles) west of Algiers.</p>
<p>In separate incidents, APS said security forces killed 29 people in what they described as anti-terrorist operations in Algiers, Laghouat and Tissemsilt.</p>
<p>In a statement carried by the agency, the security forces said they killed 29 &quot;terrorists&quot; and seized explosive devices as well as weapons including rifles and machine guns but gave no hint to when it happened.</p>
<p>Laghouat and Tissemsilt are located south and south west of Algiers.</p>
<p>The bomb attacks, less than two weeks before June 5 parliamentary elections, followed a car bomb explosion on Thursday that killed 15 people and wounded more than 30 in Boufarik, south of Algiers.</p>
<p>Moslem guerrillas have carried out many bomb attacks since they launched an armed campaign against the Algerian government in 1992 after authorities cancelled general elections which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win.</p>
<p>About 60,000 people have been killed in the political violence.</p>
<p>A Western diplomat based in Algiers said after Thursday's car bomb that it was aimed at disrupting preparations for the elections, the North African country's first since the guerrilla campaign started.</p>
<p>Earlier this month a car bomb killed four people and wounded 21, many of them schoolchildren, in Algiers.</p>
<p>This week the government offered residents up to 4.5 million dinars ($80,000) for information leading to the capture or killing of Algeria's most wanted guerrillas.</p>
<p>The offered reward appeared on posters put up on walls in several suburbs of Algiers.</p>
