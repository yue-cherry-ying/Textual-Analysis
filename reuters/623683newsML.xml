<p>A Massachusetts prosecutor, angered by delays in the probe of an alleged affair between an underage babysitter and one of the sons of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy, has told witnesses to talk to him now or face a grand jury later, the Boston Herald reported Thursday.</p>
<p>Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper said Norfolk County District Attorney Jeffrey Locke would continue to press ahead with his investigation into the alleged affair between Michael Kennedy and the family's babysitter, which prosecutors say began when the now 19-year-old college student was 14.</p>
<p>Locke's spokeswoman Nina Flaherty declined comment.</p>
<p>Massachusetts state police assigned to Locke's office have contacted game wardens in Maine about rafting trips Kennedy took with the babysitter in 1994 and 1995, the Herald said.</p>
<p>The investigation into the allegations that Kennedy had a 4-1/2 year affair with his children's babysitter has become a political albatross for his brother, U.S. Representative Joseph Kennedy II, who wants to run for Massachusetts governor in 1998.</p>
<p>The congressman's standing in recent polls against his probable Democratic primary opponent, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, show his support slipping.</p>
