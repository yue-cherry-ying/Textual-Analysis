<p>Torpedo Moscow, containing many former Army Club CSKA players who left after a off-season coaching row, demolished a weakened CSKA 5-0 in the Russian premier league on Saturday.</p>
<p>The CSKA side was totally transformed by the departure of coach Alexander Tarkhanov and much of his squad to Torpedo Moscow after the arrival of sacked Zenit St Petersburg coach Pavel Sadyrin, a former Russian coach.</p>
<p>Lithuanian striker Edgaras Yankauskas, one of CSKA defectors, opened the score on a penalty in the first half and scored with a long shot in the second.</p>
<p>Another Lithuanian, halfback Tomas Rzhanauskas, completed the second-half four-goal massacre with an 83-minute strike.</p>
<p>Dark horses Kamaz Naberezhniye Chelny scored a surprise 2-1 victory at home over last year's champions, Spartak Moscow, dropping Spartak to second place in the table.</p>
<p>Rotor Volgograd moved top thanks to a 9th minute goal by Alexander Berketov against Baltika Kaliningrad.</p>
<p>For Zhemchuzhina Sochi, another lesser known team, one strike by Timour Bogatyryov was just enough to secure a worthy win over Krylya Sovietov Samara.</p>
<p>In another Moscow derby Dynamo went down 2-1 to Lokomotiv after missing a penalty.</p>
<p>Last year's runners-up Alania Vladikavkaz lost 1-0 to Rostselmash Rostov, who rose to third place.</p>
