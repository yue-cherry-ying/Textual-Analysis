<p>Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Ian Macfarlane said on Thursday the bank had been successful in producing only a mild slowdown in economic growth in 1996.</p>
<p>Macfarlane, answering a question from former Labor treasurer Ralph Willis to a government committee, said the Reserve Bank's tightenings in 1994 had been sufficient to slow an initial sharp expansion to about three percent GDP growth in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we've had a very mild mid-term slowing,&quot; Macfarlane told a federal parliamentary committee.  </p>
<p>Willis had asked if the Reserve Bank's easings in 1996 should have been carried out earlier.</p>
<p>Macfarlane said he thought it was pointless to try and judge the Reserve Bank in hindsight.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that's a Utopian expectation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Willis' Labor government was routed in the March 1996 election, just months before the Reserve Bank started its series of three policy easings in mid to late 1996.</p>
