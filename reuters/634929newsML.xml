<p>Federal authorities are investigating possibile anti-competitive practices in the fine art auction industry, the New York Times said in Tuesday's edition.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the U.S. Justice Department has subpoenaed financial documents from some of the more prominent art dealers in Manhattan, as well as from Sotheby's and Christies, the world's largest auction houses.</p>
<p>Among the documents subpoenaed were correspondence between dealers and auction houses, travel logs, telephone bills and invoices, and other records, the Times said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said that its &quot;antitrust division is looking at the possibility of anti-competitive practices in the fine art auction industry.&quot;</p>
<p>It is believed that about two dozen New York art dealers have been contacted by the Justice Department.</p>
<p>Christies International Plc reported in a filing submitted to the London Stock Exchange that its U.S. subsidiary had received a subpoena, the Times said.</p>
<p>In the filing, Christies said it &quot;believes that it has acted properly at all times.&quot;</p>
<p>Sotheby's also confirmed it had received a subpoena and said it was working with the Justice Department to provide the relevant information.</p>
<p>Unnamed sources familiar with the investigation said the Justice Department was focusing primarily on dealers' practices rather than those of auction houses.</p>
