<title>RUSSIA: Russian shares seen following Dow's lead.</title>
<headline>Russian shares seen following Dow's lead.</headline>

<p>Russian shares prices drifted lower in thin trade on Tuesday and traders said U.S. fears of another short-term interest rate hike and a general feeling of gloom on Wall Street had spilled into the market.</p>
<p>They said the U.S. market would probably set the tone for Russian shares on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System 23-share index lost 0.92 percent from Monday to close at 298.52 on $21.4 million market turnover.</p>
<p>The 10 most heavily traded shares in dollar terms all ended lower. Mosenergo  MSNG.RTS regional power utility shares fell to $1.275 from $1.310 and national power utility UES  EESR.RTS dropped to $0.18717 from $0.19170.</p>
<p>Regional utility Lenenergo  LSNG.RTS dropped to $0.860 from $0.865.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we have to wait for the Dow Jones -- that kind of a fall is very serious,&quot; said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's head of equities trading, Pavel Gronbjerg.</p>
<p>The Dow lost almost 300 points in the previous two trading sessions and opened mixed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Gronbjerg said Russia itself was in relatively good shape, though he said the market was intently following possible union with neighbour Belarus, which is expected to sign accords on closer ties with Russia on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But traders said selling was slight, and there was some buying. Russian share prices are often marked down as trading slows but large sellers are often scarce and the appearance of a large buyer can quickly spur the market.</p>
