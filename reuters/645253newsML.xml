<title>SOUTH KOREA: Kia Motor files complaint against Samsung.</title>
<headline>Kia Motor files complaint against Samsung.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1997-06-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>South Korea's second largest carmaker Kia Motors Corp filed a complaint with prosecutors against Samsung Motor Inc, a Kia spokesman said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;We filed a complaint today as Samsung defamed our company,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;We are also considering filing a lawsuit next week for compensation on expected Losses and the damage to our reputation,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Kia earlier said Samsung Motor, a unit of powerful Samsung Group, argued in an internal report that confidence in Kia's top managers had been lost and that Kia faced &quot;internal managerial conflicts&quot;.  </p>
<p>The Samsung report also said Kia had reached its maximum growth potential, Kia said.</p>
<p>A Samsung Motor spokesman acknowledged the existence of the internal report but said he could not comment.</p>
<p>Kia has also brought the issue to the Korea Automobile Manufacturers' Association to seek collective action against Samsung Motor.</p>
<p>&quot;Representatives of domestic carmakers discussed the Samsung report today and will meet again next Monday. The outcome from the meeting will be delivered to the relevant governments,&quot; an association official said.  </p>
<p>The association official said Chung Mong-gyu, president of the association and chairman of Hyundai Motor, would hold a news conference on Monday after the meeting.</p>
<p>Samsung's internal report proposed restructuring the domestic car industry to overcome a possible crisis in the sector following excessive facilities investment and an unstable supply and demand situation.</p>
<p>The need to restructure the car industry has been discussed for years and analysts have said only one or two carmakers were expected to survive the shakeout.  </p>
<p>Kia said Samsung's contention that the vehicle industry should be anchored by companies operating under stable group management was an effort to win support for Samsung's hostile takeover intentions towards Kia, the only car maker not affiliated with a large diversified business conglomerate.</p>
<p>Samsung has never admitted its intention to take over Kia, but industry observers and analysts said Samsung would be interested in such a deal because it would greatly help Samsung's expansion into the car industry.</p>
