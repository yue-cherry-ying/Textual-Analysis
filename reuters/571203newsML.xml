<p>A review of applications for the Emaar Properties initial public offering in the United Arab Emirates showed that around 25 people submitted 43,000 applications for shares, the company said.</p>
<p>Local newspapers said these applications were likely to be rejected, in line with Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum's orders to weed out so-called proxy buyers.</p>
<p>A total of 180,000 applications worth 3.3 billion dirhams were received for the some 657 million dirhams worth of Emaar shares offered to the public, the company said.</p>
<p>Two thirds of Emaar's capital is open to the public. The rest is held by the founders, including the Dubai government with a 10 percent stake. This means Emaar can only accept a maximum of around 130,000 applications of 500 shares each.</p>
<p>&quot;The process of reviewing Emaar share applications revealed several discrepancies commmon to many public issues in the UAE capital market during the last three years. Initial analysis has revealed that some 25 applicants have submitted 43,000 applications in the Emaar public issue,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no doubt that the fraudulent applications which were discovered during the review...have accelerated efforts to make an official stock market in the country to regulate future share issues and trading in stocks,&quot; said Mohamed Alabbar, chairman of Emaar's founding committee.</p>
