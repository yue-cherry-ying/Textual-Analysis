<title>UK: Mark steady, French franc unperturbed by election.</title>
<headline>Mark steady, French franc unperturbed by election.</headline>

<p>The mark was steady against most European currencies, with the French franc in no mood to cede ground before the first round of French parliamentary elections on Sunday.</p>
<p>The equanimity with which the market is approaching the elections makes the franc vulnerable to setbacks if the opposition Socialist party puts in a better-than-expected performance this weekend, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is very complacent so the risk-reward picture has to be skewed towards looking for a weaker franc,'' said James McKay, the international economist at PaineWebber International.</p>
<p>Yet, most traders expect the franc to stay well within 2.25 percent of its central European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) midrate against the mark even if the Socialists pull off an unexpected victory.</p>
<p>Mark/French franc was last at 3.3695/00 from 3.3677/81 late Thursday in Europe. That's about 0.5 percent away from the central ERM parity of 3.3539.</p>
<p>The opposition Socialists have tried to distinguish themselves from the ruling coalition government by taking a more combative line on the European single currency.</p>
<p>Socialist leader Lionel Jospin said Tuesday there was no reason he should be committed to the &quot;stability pact&quot; which threatens punitive measures against those who don't keep their fiscal house in order after joining EMU.</p>
<p>But such comments have done little to unsettle the franc given the last opinion poll published Saturday put support for the ruling coalition at 40 percent, compared with 28 for the Socialists and their allies.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a point a few weeks ago when everything was looking very sticky and as if the government wasn't going to get in, but it's all more settled now,'' said a trader at a German bank in London.</p>
<p>Even if the Socialists put in a better-than-expected performance in the first round, traders don't expect the franc to fall too far.</p>
<p>&quot;If the Socialists make a credible showing, the mark will go up, but at the end of the day, I don't know that they would do anything different with the economic policies,&quot; said a trader at a French bank in London.</p>
<p>The franc will weaken no further than 3.40 per mark if the ruling centre-right coalition government loses, according to economists polled by Reuters. That's less than the 3.41 rate they targeted in a survey conducted two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The French franc hasn't traded more than 1 percent away from its central mark parity rate since the beginning of this year, and usually hugged the parity more closely.</p>
<p>The mark came off highs it set against the Swedish crown, with traders reporting Riksbank purchases of crowns at about 4.50 per mark. The crown was last at 4.4875/05 from 4.4760/90 late in Europe yesterday.</p>
