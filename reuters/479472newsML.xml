<text>
<p>** Gold 24 carat closed 5 rupees lower at 4,720 rupees per 10 gramme against the previous close of 4,725 rupees as sluggish seasonal buying and profit-taking trimmed early gains.</p>
<p>** Prices of a gold biscuit (116.50 gramme) closed 100 rupees lower at 55,200 rupees per piece after gaining 500 rupees on Monday. They were down by 500 rupees during last week.</p>
<p>** Silver (.999) closed 15 rupees lower at 7,330 rupees per kg against the previous close of 7,345 rupees but up 15 rupees against today's opening level of 7,315 rupees as fresh industrial buying and thin supplies helped prices to bounce back towards the close.</p>

<p>Gold 24 carat closed 5 rupees lower at 4,720 rupees per 10 grammes against the previous close of 4,725 rupees as lower than expected seasonal buying and profit-taking trimmed early gains towards the close on Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gold opened 5 rupees higher at 4,730 rupees but failed to consolidate gains towards the close while volume was at low ebb. Gold was up by 45 rupees per 10 grammes on Monday.</p>
<p>Prices of gold biscuits (116.50 gramme) closed 100 rupees lower at 55,200 rupees each after gaining 500 rupees on Monday as emergence of profit-taking at the higher level capped the rally which followed the withdrawal of support by the Congress party to the United Front on Sunday.</p>
<p>Silver (.999) closed 15 rupees lower at 7,330 rupees per kg against the previous close of 7,345 rupees.</p>
<p>Actually silver opened 30 rupees lower at 7,315 rupees per kg on the back of overnight losses in the world market but later on fresh industrial buying and limited inflow dragged prices upward from the early losses towards the close.</p>
<p>Silver was up 20 rupees per kg on Monday. (Conversion $1=35.85 rupees)</p>
