<p>Bahrain said on Saturday a Shi'ite Moslem had died of natural causes, denying an opposition report he had died from injuries he received in a clash with police.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no linkage. Police are not involved in the matter,&quot; a government official told Reuters. &quot;The man has died of natural causes,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The London-based Bahrain Freedom Movement said in a statement sent to an international news organisation that Abdul-Zahra Ibrahim Abdullah, 27, died one week after he was beaten by the security forces.</p>
<p>The official confirmed Abdullah had been arrested on June 1 in Sanabis village, five km (three miles) west of the capital Manama, during anti-government protests.</p>
<p>&quot;The man was arrested on June 1 and was freed on June 3. He later died in hospital from a blood disease,&quot; he said but gave no further details.</p>
<p>The opposition statement said that during the attack, security forces &quot;deployed rubber bullets and tear gas before storming houses and damaging at least 50 private cars as part of the collective punishment policy&quot;.</p>
<p>Residents said Abdullah was buried in Sanabis on Friday. They said riot police patrolled the area after protesters blocked roads in Sanabis and the nearby village of Daih. There were no reports of injuries or arrests.</p>
<p>&quot;Fabrications and claims against the government are easy matters and a way of raising tension,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>More than two dozen people have been killed in more than two years of anti-government protests in the Gulf Arab state. Hundreds of people, including children, have been arrested.</p>
<p>Members of the island's majority Shi'ite community have waged sporadic protests, bombings and arson attacks since December 1994 to demand political and economic reforms by the Sunni-led government.</p>
