<headline>Don Tyson testifies for second day before grand jury.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Poultry tycoon Don Tyson appeared before a federal grand jury Friday for a second day to answer questions about alleged gifts and favors given to a former Clinton administration agriculture secretary.</p>
<p>Tyson entered the courthouse shortly before 9 a.m. EDT, after spending some seven hours testifying before the panel Thursday.</p>
<p>He said nothing to reporters, but a spokesman for Tyson Foods Inc., said a statement would be issued after he finished testifying.</p>
<p>Tyson, 67, is the retired chairman of Tyson Foods and a longtime political contributor and friend of Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>An independent special counsel has spent more than 30 months investigating whether food companies regulated by the Agriculture Department gave football tickets, free travel and other favors to former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy.</p>
<p>Espy has claimed he is innocent of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The investigation led by special counsel Donald Schmaltz began after questions were raised about Espy's acceptance of gifts from Tyson Foods and other companies at the time the Agriculture Department was preparing tighter meat and poultry inspection rules.</p>
<p>Schmaltz, who appeared at the courthouse with some five boxes of papers, declined comment on the grand jury proceedings.</p>
<p>More than a dozen individuals and companies, including Espy's former chief of staff, have been indicted in the probe.</p>
