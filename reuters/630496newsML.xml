<p>A 59-year-old Argentine farmhand has fathered 35 children by three sisters with whom he has lived for 25 years, a local newspaper in the jungle province of Misiones reported on Monday</p>
<p>&quot;I love all three of them the same, from the oldest to the youngest,&quot; said Juan Rojas, a farm worker in Misiones, 700 miles (1,100 kilometres) northeast of Buenos Aires. He told Misiones newspaper Primera Edicion, in comments carried by the state news agency Telam, that the three sisters aged 58, 47 and 43 &quot;behave well, they care for me, and, most of all, they take care of my children without distinction.&quot;</p>
<p>The farmhand said he married the eldest sister when he was 19 and had three children with her. &quot;But when their father died, they were left all alone with their mother, so they came to live with us,&quot; Rojas said of his wife's sisters.</p>
<p>&quot;When they grew up, it was only natural that we should all live as husband and wives. They agreed and we are all happy.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the two younger sisters, asked about having more children, said that was &quot;up to God and Mr Rojas.&quot;</p>
