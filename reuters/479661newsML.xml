<p>After losing almost 300 points in two trading sessions, the Dow industrials are expected to head higher at the start of trading Tuesday.</p>
<p>Analysts said, however, that the market still had a way to go in its correction, perhaps as low as 6400/6500 on the Dow, and that any rally attempt until then would be short-lived.</p>
<p>The March National Association of Purchasing Management index is due at 1000 EST/1500 GMT and will be carefully scrutinized for any confirmation that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates again.  </p>
<p>&quot;The only way to end the decline is to go through a capitulation phase in which everyone panics and they dump their stocks. You saw the start of that yesterday with all the gloom and the bad news bears jumping up and down,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, analyst at Prudential Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to clobber the market good. Any attempt at recovery before then will be aborted.</p>
<p>&quot;This morning they will try to rally them, and they won't be able to do it. The trigger is a rising rate structure and a blue chip index which outperformed the rest of the market by 60 percent over the last two years.&quot;  </p>
<p>Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments, said that the market could sell off another 200 points by the end of the week. But he also said that a weaker than forecast March NAPM could spark a relief rally.</p>
<p>February leading indicators and construction spending will be released at the same time as the NAPM.</p>
<p>&quot;The NAPM is the one that will steal the show and affect the bond market,&quot; Cardillo said. &quot;If we don't see an index much above 54, we should have a relief rally. From a technical standpoint, we are just a bit oversold here.&quot;  </p>
<p>In Tokyo, the Nikkei Average shed 133.81 points, or 0.74 percent, to 17,869.59.</p>
<p>In London, the FTSE 100 Index was down 74.4 at 4238.5.</p>
<p>U.S. shares were generally firmer in London but trading volumes were thin on Tuesday as European investors returned to their desks after a four-day Easter holiday break to find the Dow nearly 300 points lower. International Business Machines Corp was up 1/4 at 137-5/8 while Philip Morris Cos Inc added 1/2 to 114-5/8.</p>
<p>Intel Corp was up 3/8 at 139-1/2 and Digital Equipment Corp gained 1/4 to 27-5/8.  </p>
<p>The dollar was weak in Tokyo and flirted with 1.67 marks in Europe.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries were flat to slightly higher, with the long bond up 1/32 to yield 7.10 percent.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street writes that in a conference call with customers Monday morning, Merrill Lynch chief investment strategist Charles Clough reiterated the advice he has been giving for some time -- investors should go East. He once again urged investors to put more money into the Japanese market, which has been declining through much of the the six-year bull market in U.S. stocks.  </p>
<p>The New York Times Market Place writes that the plunge in the stock market yesterday was wide and deep as efforts to push the market higher were crushed.</p>
