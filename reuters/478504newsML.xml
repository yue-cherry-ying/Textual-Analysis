<p>Rains continued to strengthen over Ivory Coast's cocoa belt in mid-March after February's drought, favouring development of the mid-crop (May-Sept), weather analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Official weather data for the second 10 days of March showed rains at 10 weather stations totalled 208.1 mm against 169.4 in the previous 10 days.</p>
<p>&quot;Levels are still below the long-term average for March but they are catching up,&quot; said a national weather centre spokesman.</p>
<p>Rains were strongest on the eastern border with Ghana, while heavy rain also fell around the capital Yamoussoukro and the centre-west cocoa region around Gagnoa.</p>
<p>Rains recorded at Adiake fell over a period of seven days but in other regions rainfall was confined to only two or three days out of 10.</p>
<p>More regular rains favouring cocoa pod growth have since fallen in key areas but complete data have not yet been compiled, said one local crop analyst.</p>
<p>Other crop analysts have said that regular showers into April will determine how close this year's mid-crop will be to a bumper 200,000 tonnes in the record 1.2 million tonnes 1995/96 (Oct-Sept) harvest season.</p>
<p>The 1996/97 mid-crop could exceed 150,000 tonnes if rains were sufficient, one said recently, adding that harvest predictions would be reviewed in April when pods on trees gave a better idea of yields.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture last week upgraded its total 1996/97 harvest prediction to 1.1 million tonnes from 1.05 million.</p>
<p>Local crop analysts gave a 1.1 million tonne preliminary estimate in February, after forecasting between 800,000 and one million tonnes before the season opened in October.</p>
<p>Port arrivals of at least 920,000 tonnes by early March had been higher than expected, they said.</p>
<p>Data from Ivory Coast's national weather station showed the following rainfall for the second 10 days of March in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan (data for the previous 10 days in brackets)-</p>
<p>Dalao 0 mm (18.0 mm), Gagnoa 42.9 (5.9), San Pedro 1.1 (4.0), Tabou 16.0 (0.5), Man 0 (65.5), Dimbokro 0.8 (11.3), Yamoussoukro 24.2 (15), Abidjan 23.1 (23.4), Sassandra 3.1 (0.5), Adiake 96.9 (27.8), Korhogo 0.0 (0.0).</p>
