<text>
<p>A desperate Argentine mother whose car was being stolen with her 7-year-old son inside threw herself in front of the car, then grabbed hold of the exhaust pipe when the car ran over her, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They told television reporters in the city of Cordoba on Wednesday that Monica Juncos, 36, was dragged along beneath the car for nearly a block until the thief had to slow down because of a pothole. Passers-by blocked the road, forcing him to stop, pulled him out of the car and called the police.</p>
<p>Juncos, who was shopping with her son and 2-month-old daughter, had gone into a store with the baby when the thief struck. When she saw the car being stolen she left the baby in the shop and sprang into action.</p>
<p>She suffered bruises and burns from the exhaust pipe but was recovering well in a hospital. The thief was identified as a policeman suspended from duty two years ago.</p>
