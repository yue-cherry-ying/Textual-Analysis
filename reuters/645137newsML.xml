<title>USA: NHL ICE HOCKEY-FLYERS HAVE BACKS TO THE WALL AGAINST FLYING RED WINGS.</title>
<headline>NHL ICE HOCKEY-FLYERS HAVE BACKS TO THE WALL AGAINST FLYING RED WINGS.</headline>
<dateline>DETROIT 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The last team to trail the Detroit Red Wings by three games to none in the Stanley Cup playoffs won four straight to win the title.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Flyers coach Terry Murray, whose team will try to stave off elimination on Saturday, is thinking in much more modest terms.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not looking at four games,&quot; admitted a sombre Murray. &quot;We want to win one period first, then build on it and try and win just one game.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1942 the Detroit Red Wings shocked the Toronto Maple Leafs, winning the first two games of the Stanley Cup final at Maple Leaf Gardens and then taking a commanding three games to none lead in Game 3 in Detroit. Toronto, however, swept the next four.</p>
<p>Murray says the Flyers, who have lost the first three games in this series, must improve in every area to become competitive against Detroit.</p>
<p>&quot;It isn't just (goalie) Ron Hextall, we need to improve in every facet of our play,&quot; said Murray. &quot;Eric Lindros's confidence level is down, and we are giving them too many odd man rushes. We have to come out and play with great intensity, and build on that.</p>
<p>&quot;We held a meeting, just the players and the three coaches, and we talked it through. It was good therapy. The only yelling was done by myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Action, not words, will determine whether the Flyers can get back into the Stanley Cup on Saturday despite being winless in Joe Louis Arena since 1988.</p>
<p>Said Hextall: &quot;Thursday night's loss (6-1) wasn't the most fun I have had in my life. What hurts is we worked all year to get to the Finals and now we are playing our worst hockey of the season.&quot;</p>
<p>The confident Red Wings need only one win to end a 42-year Stanley Cup drought with their eighth title triumph.</p>
<p>Joey Kocur, the hard nosed right wing whose goal was so important in Game 1, said, &quot;This is a special time in Detroit hockey. We have to stay focused and get the job done, the quicker the better. They will play desperate.</p>
<p>&quot;Guys will say they are not thinking about winning it all tomorrow, but they are. I may have some trouble sleeping tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>Red Wing captain and centre Steve Yzerman, said: &quot;I think we are trying to just stay relaxed. I think it has helped us to not get too carried away when things go wrong, and not to get too excited when they go right.&quot;</p>
<p>Detroit coach Scotty Bowman, bidding for his seventh Stanley Cup victory, acknowledged some concerns. &quot;Keeping the focus on hockey and not tickets and all the hype is tough.&quot;</p>
<p>If the Wings win Bowman will become the first coach to win Stanley Cup titles with three teams -- Montreal, Pittsburgh and Detroit. Toe Blake of Montreal with eight Cup wins in 13 seasons is the all-time leader.</p>
<p>One old time Red Wing, Ted Lindsay, the captain of the 1955 Stanley Cup champions, and a very active member of the Red Wing Alumni, has been visiting the locker room on occasion and working out.</p>
<p>Lindsay, called Old Scar Face, said: &quot;If they win Saturday I will be just like any other hysterical fan. I won't go to the dressing room, this is their time.</p>
<p>&quot;This championship will be great for the Red Wings, and the City of Detroit. It's been a long time coming.&quot;</p>
