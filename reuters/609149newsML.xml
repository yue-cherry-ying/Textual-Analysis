<p>Taiwan on Friday announced a surprisingly low jobless rate in April, and economists said the downward trend should persist as the domestic recovery strengthens, especially in industrial output.</p>
<p>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said April unemployment was 2.59 percent, lower than government and private economists had expected.</p>
<p>The figure was well below an average 2.896 forecast compiled from a May 21 Reuters Poll of Taiwan economists.</p>
<p>&quot;With the gradually strengthening recovery, our jobless rate likely will fall to meet the government's target of 2.6 percent for 1997,&quot; agency director Chen Chang-hsiung told reporters after announcing the April figure.</p>
<p>The cabinet's Council for Economic Planning and Development has set a joblessness target of 2.6 percent for 1997. In the January-April period, unemployment averaged 2.76 percent.</p>
<p>Experts said Taiwan's recovery was creating new jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic industrial output had shown 10 straight months of growth, effectively helping stabilise or reduce the high jobless rate,&quot; said National Securities economist Lin Kuo-yang.</p>
<p>&quot;First half exports are seen maintaining stable five percent growth and likely will perform better in the second half,&quot; Lin said. &quot;All these should back up a declining jobless rate.&quot;</p>
<p>Taiwan said on Wednesday its April industrial output rose 6.12 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>Directorate economists said April's relatively low jobless figure was a surprise -- confounding expectations that an islandwide outbreak of hog foot-and-mouth disease in March and a related ban on Taiwan's huge pork exports would cost jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;The impact of the hog epidemic was lower than expected, partly because many pork processors did not lay off workers but only reduced their working hours,&quot; Chen said.</p>
<p>Chen said precise figures for epidemic-related job losses, when available in mid-June, would not be especially high.</p>
<p>Besides banning all pork exports temporarily, the government responded to the outbreak by ordering the slaughter of all hogs, even healthy ones, at all affected farms -- or about four million of Taiwan's 14 million pigs.</p>
<p>Chen confirmed that a steadily accelerating recovery was key to a month-on-month decline from the 2.79 percent jobless rate in March, saying a rebound in manufacturing and the long-struggling construction sector was creating jobs.</p>
<p>Economists said numerous construction projects had been launched since late March in anticipation of recovering demand, though new political and social factors had the potential to keep potential home-buyers on the sidelines.</p>
<p>&quot;People are taking a wait-and-see attitude on buying houses due to political worries over social disorder and the ongoing constitutional reforms, though this should not have much impact in terms of reducing employment,&quot; said Grand Cathay Securities vice-president Terry Chen.</p>
<p>The island's jobless rate hovered around 1.5 percent from 1991-1994, rose to 1.79 percent in 1995 and pushed above three percent for three months from August 1996 -- a dramatic rise for Taiwan -- before turning back downward.</p>
<p>Joblessness was 2.6 percent for all of 1996, a 10-year high.</p>
