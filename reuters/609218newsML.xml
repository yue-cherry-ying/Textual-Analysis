<p>An early-morning fire of suspicious origin caused heavy damage Friday to a busy Portland abortion clinic that has been the target of arsonists in the past.</p>
<p>Officials with the Portland Fire Bureau said the cause of the fire was &quot;suspicious.&quot; FBI agents and officials from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms are investigating and &quot;pursuing all leads,&quot; an FBI spokesman said.</p>
<p>Fire broke out shortly before 3 a.m. (6 a.m. EDT) at the Lovejoy Surgicenter in the northwest part of the city, and flames were shooting out a back window when firefighters arrived, Dave Centres of the Portland Fire Bureau said.</p>
<p>About 70 firefighters responded to the scene and extinguished the fire within an hour, but the two-story concrete block building was damaged heavily, Portland fire officials said. The building was unoccupied at the time and there were no injuries.</p>
<p>Employees told the Oregonian newspaper that bomb threats had been called in last weekend to the clinic and several other facilities in Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>The abortion clinic, one of the nation's busiest, has been the frequent site of demonstrations and has been victimised twice before by arson fires. The clinic was the subject of a 1996 book, &quot;Lovejoy: A Year in the Life of an Abortion Clinic.&quot;</p>
