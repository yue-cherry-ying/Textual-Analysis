<title>CHINA: China southern city opens underground railway.</title>
<headline>China southern city opens underground railway.</headline>
<dateline>GUANGZHOU, China 1997-06-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>China's southern city of Guangzhou formally opened the first stretch of its new underground railway on Saturday with a ceremony timed to mark the run-up to the return of neighbouring Hong Kong to Beijing rule.</p>
<p>City and central government officials and representatives of European and U.S. companies involved in building and financing the subway marked the opening by travelling on trains between five stations along its 5.4 km (3.2 mile) first stretch.</p>
<p>The Guangzhou Metro would eventually have 16 stations across the booming but traffic-clogged city and would be fully operational in 1999, officials said.</p>
<p>Guangzhou is the capital of Guangdong province, which borders on Hong Kong. The underground opening ceremony was timed to come just three days before the British colony returns to China after 156 years of colonial rule from London.</p>
<p>German technicians who helped to develop the line for Guangzhou, which is the third Chinese city to build an underground railway after Beijing and Shanghai, said it would eventually be able to carry 450,000 passengers a day.</p>
<p>&quot;At peak times (each train) can pick up 2,600 people, which means there are eight people per square metre, which is not the standard we use in Germany, but it solves the mass transit problems in Guangzhou,&quot; said Werner Rauer of Germany's ADtranz.</p>
<p>ADtranz, a joint venture between ABB AG and Daimler Benz AG, built the trains for the railway. Siemens AG supplied electromechanical equipment.</p>
<p>The German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development provided 351 million marks ($203 million) in financing for the underground through the german development bank, the Kreditanstalp fur Wieddrausbau (KsW), officials said.</p>
<p>The bank also supplied 356 million marks in commercial funds from the capital market, they said.</p>
<p>Holding the opening of the Guangzhou underground just before the handover of sovereignty in Hong Kong helped to show the importance of the links between the two cities, said German economic cooperation official Wighard Hardtl.</p>
<p>&quot;Guangzhou is one of the growing cities near Hong Kong and I believe it is essential for German and European industry to be involved here,&quot; Hardtl said.</p>
<p>&quot;Many people came for the opening and then will attend the handover, it's a kind of double sensation,&quot; he said.</p>
