<p>A judge has ordered five former employees of singer Michael Jackson to pay nearly $1.5 million in court and attorneys' fees after they lost a wrongful dismissal suit against the self-styled &quot;King of Pop&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the fees set forth are reasonable. I am going to award them,&quot; Superior Court Judge Zell Canter said at a hearing on Wednesday in Santa Maria. Jackson was not in court.</p>
<p>Under California state law, the winner of a civil suit is allowed to recover some of the costs of a suit, including attorneys' fees.</p>
<p>The five former employees at Jackson's Neverland Ranch, near Santa Barbara, sued the star last year claiming they were forced to quit as a result of harassment, threats and being spied on by Jackson's security guards.</p>
<p>After a six-month trial that ended in March, the judge ruled against their claim.</p>
<p>In addition to the state award of court costs, the five had also signed a confidentiality agreement containing certain provisions for granting litigation costs to the winner of a potential lawsuit.</p>
<p>&quot;Having contracted for this type of relief, Mr Jackson is entitled to it (collect costs) just like any other person,&quot; Jackson's lawyer Steve Cochran told reporters outside the courthouse, some 100 miles (160 km) north of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just the flip side of the coin of what the plaintiffs tried to do,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The costs awarded to Jackson by Judge Canter totalled $1.473 million, of which $1.29 million were attorneys' fees.</p>
