<p>The explosions that killed two Palestinians in Gaza on Tuesday were the latest in a string of blasts that claimed lives in the area since Israel handed most of the Strip to the PLO in 1994.</p>
<p>The following is a chronology of past attacks aimed at the 4,000 Jews who remain in settlement enclaves in Gaza under Israeli army guard.</p>
<p>-- November 11, 1994: Palestinian suicide bomber on a bicycle kills three Israelis near Netzarim settlement in central Gaza. Islamic Jihad, which opposed the 1993 Israeli-PLO peace deal, claims responsibility.</p>
<p>-- April 9, 1995: Seven Israelis killed in two separate suicide car bombings. Islamic Jihad claims responsibility for attack on bus carrying Israeli soldiers and settlers near Kfar Darom. Hamas says it carried out second attack on Israeli military convoy at nearby Netzarim.</p>
<p>-- June 25, 1995: Hamas suicide bomber detonates a donkey cart laden with explosives near Morag settlement in southern Gaza, wounding three Israeli soldiers.</p>
<p>-- November 2, 1995: Seven Israelis hurt in car bomb explosion beside bus travelling to Gush Katif settlement bloc in southern Gaza Strip. Second car bomb explodes harmlessly a few kilometers away. Islamic Jihad had vowed to avenge assassination of its leader Fathi Shqaqi in Malta in October. Israel was widely blamed for Shqaqi's death.</p>
<p>-- April 1, 1997: Two Palestinians killed in Gaza Strip in what Israeli army calls separate suicide attacks aimed at killing Jews near Netzarim and Kfar Darom. Both explosions occur at about time Israeli children leave the settlements on school buses, settler spokesmen say.</p>
