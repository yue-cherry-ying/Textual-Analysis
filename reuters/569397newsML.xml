<headline>Benefun Int'l eyes on fashion megastore in HK.</headline>

<p>Fashion products retailer Benefun International Holdings Ltd said it planned to open megastores in Hong Kong before it applied the concept to the market in Taiwan.</p>
<p>&quot;We are targeting to open about two megastores, potentially in Tsimshatsui (in Kowloon) and Causeway Bay (on Hong Kong Island),&quot; said Teo Guan Thye, director of Benefun, in a media briefing on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Each store will involve an investment of about $US1-$2 million including stock,&quot; Teo said.</p>
<p>Benefun, which plans to seek a dual listing in Hong Kong and Singapore later in May, is the holding company of Benefashion Ltd, a company which imports and retails a wide range of men, ladies, and children casual wear of Benetton SpA under the Benetton, Sisley, 012 and Zerodonto of Benetton brandnames in Hong Kong and Benetton and 012 apparel in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Benefashion also distributes fashion accessories including belts, handbags, shoes, ties, watches, fragrances, cosmetics, and luggage under the brandnames Benetton and Sisley.</p>
<p>As at January 31, 1997, Benefashion had a retail network of 20 outlets in Hong Kong and 56 in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The number of outlets will be reduced after the shops merge into one megastore, Teo said.</p>
<p>&quot;The company (Benefashion) had achieved some two percent year on year growth in turnover to about HK$400 million for the year ended in June 1996,&quot; said Teo, who is also the managing director of Benefashion.</p>
<p>&quot;Among the turnover, HK$240 million was from Hong Kong and HK$150 million was from Taiwan,&quot; Teo added.</p>
<p>Teo said Benefashion was likely to be the largest customer of Benetton in Asia, excluding Japan.</p>
<p>&quot;However, we do not have any concrete plan to penetrate into the China market,&quot; Teo said. &quot;Definitely, there is a potential market in China, but...it is not yet ready because the middle class income population is yet to be established.&quot;</p>
<p>Last month garment manufacturer and retailer Heshe Holdings Ltd said it planned to seek a primary listing for its subsidiary Benefun in Hong Kong and secondary listing in Singapore.</p>
<p>Market sources said they expected Benefun would kick off its initial public offering in Hong Kong later in May and dealing in company shares is expected to be in late May or in early June.</p>
