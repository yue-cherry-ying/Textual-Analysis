<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel, ignoring almost universal scepticism that Germany can qualify for European monetary union (EMU), said on Saturday he would find a way to get Bonn into the single currency project and would not raise taxes to do so.</p>
<p>Speaking at a meeting of the junior wing of his Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), Waigel said there was no talk in Germany of delaying EMU beyond its scheduled 1999 launch and promised Germany would fulfil budget deficit goals stipulated by the Maastricht Treaty for nations wanting to join EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;You will see, Germany will make the deficit criteria,&quot; Waigel told journalists at the meeting in southern town of Erlangen. &quot;We are not discussing a delay.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Maastricht, nations joining EMU must have budget deficits no higher than three percent of gross domestic product. Germany's deficit stood at 3.8 percent last year and most economists doubt it will fall to three percent this year.</p>
<p>One of the fastest ways to make up that gap would be to raise taxes, but Waigel faces stiff political opposition and said on Saturday he would not resort to such a move -- at least not this year. Asked if he was planning to increase taxes, Waigel replied: &quot;Not in 1997&quot;.</p>
<p>The junior coalition partner Free Democrats (FDP) have repeatedly stressed their opposition to tax increases, which Waigel had previously declined to rule out.</p>
<p>Earlier, a FDP spokesman denied reports it had threatened to leave the coalition if it insisted on raising taxes to help get Germany's finances in shape for EMU.</p>
<p>Waigel has said little, however, of how he intends to meet the deficit goal, perplexing economists who say high unemployment and lower-than-expected tax revenues make it nearly impossible for Germany to strictly qualify.</p>
<p>Against that background, some economists expect the finance minister to use mathematical rounding to arrive at three percent, claiming for example, that a 3.3 percent deficit quota amounts to 3.0 in the eyes of the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>Waigel has insisted in the past that he would not employ rounding and said on Saturday, &quot;We won't talk about decimal points. There is only one figure in the treaty, that is the (number) three.&quot;</p>
<p>With few options for making up the deficit at a stroke, Waigel has increasingly looked for small savings.</p>
<p>According to Der Spiegel magazine, for example, Waigel wants to reduce funding to the labour office by over two billion marks during the second half of this year, slashing money for training and job creation schemes.</p>
<p>The savings would still leave Germany far short of the 10 to 15 billion marks in savings that economists reckon Germany needs to qualify for EMU.</p>
<p>Waigel has had a difficult couple of weeks that have included calls for his resignation, a bitter fight with the Bundesbank over revaluing Germany's official reserves and on Friday, a disappointing increase in unemployment.</p>
<p>On top of all that, Waigel is in the midst of preparing the budget for next year, a task more difficult than the job of qualifying for EMU, he said.</p>
<p>Waigel ruled out increasing government new debt in 1998, saying total borrowing in the year must remain under 58 to 59 billion marks.</p>
<p>The German constitution requires that new government borrowing does not exceed total public investment, which Waigel expects to be around 58 to 59 billion marks in 1998, a figure similar to this year's.</p>
<p>&quot;We are standing before a very decisive four weeks,&quot; Waigel said of his preparation of the 1998 budget.</p>
