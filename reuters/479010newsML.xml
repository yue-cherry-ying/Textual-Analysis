<p>Japan's Finance Ministry does not have any plans to use public money to help two Hokkaido-based banks carry out a planned merger, a senior ministry official told reporters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The ministry said earlier that it had asked the Bank of Japan to use a special fund originally designed to help resolve the problem of failed mortgage firms to help another Japanese bank, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd (NCB), in its restructuring efforts.</p>
<p>But the official said there was no such plan in the case of the planned merger between Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd, another troubled bank, and smaller regional bank Hokkaido Bank Ltd, which was announced earlier on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The official also said that he understood that no single bank would take over the overseas operations of NCB, which announced earlier on Tuesday it was pulling out of overseas business as part of a radical restructuring programme.</p>
<p>The withdrawal from overseas operations will be carried out smoothly in consultation with overseas monetary authorities and private banks, the Finance Ministry official said.</p>
<p>&quot;No single bank is going to take over all of NCB's overseas operations,&quot; the official said.</p>
