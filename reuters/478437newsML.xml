<headline>IPE gas oil ends $1.25 weaker, Brent 23 cts adrift.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>IPE gas oil futures closed $1.25 a tonne lower on Tuesday as U.S. sellers brushed off the potentially bullish effect of snowstorms in the northeastern United States, brokers said.</p>
<p>April gas oil settled at $165.50 a tonne, 25 cents off the low, following a late burst of selling form the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;The contract kept well away from yesterday's value area and built up good value at these lower levels,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>U.S. players were seen selling the contract down while European dealers appeared more supportive. Snowstorms in parts of the U.S. northeast failed to revive the contract.</p>
<p>It traded at around $166.50 a tonne for much of the day.</p>
<p>&quot;The effect of the snow story was in the end to remind people what the time of year was rather than to show how cold it was,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>May Brent was 23 cents lower at $19.15 a barrel at 1704 GMT.</p>
<p>The contract spiked to the day's high of $19.27 a barrel around 1625 GMT, lifted by a break above $20.60 a barrel on May NYMEX crude. But May Brent was immediately sold into and retreated to trade in a range of $19.10 to $19.20 a barrel.</p>
<p>Heating oil was 0.18 cent higher on NYMEX at 54.60 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>Weekly U.S. inventory data was expected late on Tuesday and GNI said they expected crude, gasoline and distillate stocks all to be &quot;flat to a couple of million barrels lower.&quot;</p>
