<p>A smiling Mary Pierce  cruised through her resumed first round match at Wimbledon on Saturday, beating Belgian Dominique Van Roost 6-3 6-4.</p>
<p>Pierce, who was leading 1-0 after the match was abandoned on Wednesday, looked relaxed and confident as she clocked the first three games to put her 4-0 up.</p>
<p>Ninth seed Pierce, who reached the quarter-finals here last year, lost the next three of the next four games to the battling Belgian.</p>
<p>Van Roost, ranked 29, lost points because of silly mistakes, and her frustration was clearly visible as she failed to capitalise on Pierce's two double faults to lose the first set.</p>
<p>Pierce on the other hand never lost her composure, despite losing the first game of the second set and apparently suffering some pain in her upper right arm.</p>
<p>Van Roost, who made it to the third round here last year, applied pressure until the bitter end but she failed to block Pierce.</p>
<p>&quot;I knew it would be a difficult match. She (Van Roost) is a fighter and never gives up until the last point,&quot; the Frenchwoman said.</p>
<p>&quot;I was just trying to do what I could and stay aggressive.&quot;</p>
<p>Pierce said she would see the trainers later in the day about her arm.</p>
<p>&quot;I have some pain in my arm, but it's not my elbow so I'm not worried,&quot; she said.</p>
