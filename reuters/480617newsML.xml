<headline>Second blast in Gaza Strip, no word of casualties.</headline>
<dateline>GAZA 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>A bomb exploded near a bus carrying children of Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip, the second such blast in Gaza on Tuesday, security sources said.</p>
<p>There were no immediate reports of casualties, they said.  </p>
<p>They said the blast occurred near Netzarim settlement, just as a bus of schoolchidren was leaving the heavily guarded enclave.</p>
<p>Earlier a bomb exploded on a horsecart near an Israeli checkpoint less than one km (half a mile) from Kfar Darom settlement, they said. The sources said there may have been Palestinian casualties in the Kfar Darom blast.</p>
<p>The area has been especially tense in recent weeks, as the Israeli-Palestinian peace process plunged into crisis over work on a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem. Daily clashes have ensued, and last month an Islamist suicide bomber killed three women in a Tel Aviv cafe.</p>
<p>In the past Palestinians have mounted attacks both in Kfar Darom and Netzarim.</p>
