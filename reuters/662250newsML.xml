<p>New Zealand faces a potential catastrophe twice as bad as the 1953 Tangiwai disaster which killed 151 people because of a blocked outlet in Mount Ruapehu's crater lake, scientists said in a report on the volcano released on Sunday.</p>
<p>The report said there was a risk of mudflows and flooding from the crater lake, with potential to wipe out bridges, roads, main trunk rail lines and the national power grid.</p>
<p>In a report commissioned by the Department of Conservation following eruptions at the mountain in 1995-96, scientists concluded that the flood would be twice as devastating as that in 1953.</p>
<p>That flooding led to the Tangiwai disaster when 151 people were killed when a train plunged off a rail bridge. The bridge had been wiped out by a wall of mud, water and rocks from the mountain.</p>
<p>The latest eruptions had significantly altered Ruapehu and, while there was no risk in the immediate future, a major blockage had formed over an outlet from the crater lake, the report said.</p>
<p>If the lake filled to overflowing it would be likely to breach the rim, dumping 1.5 million cubic metres of mud and water on to surrounding countryside.</p>
<p>Conservation Minister Nick Smith said the crater rim was stable for now and there was no immediate threat because it would take about up to four years to refill after the 1995/6 eruptions.</p>
<p>But if the mountain erupted again, the situation would change, he said.</p>
<p>Scientists say it would probably take less than an hour for the lake water to breach its natural defences.</p>
<p>&quot;This would probably cause greater damage to bridges, roads and possibly power lines and the Rangipo Power Station than has occurred in the past,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;There would also be significant environmental damage in the Whangaehu and Tongariro River catchments and Lake Taupo.&quot;</p>
<p>The report recommended a trench be dug in the area where the blockage had occurred and suggested intensive monitoring to look for any changes in stability of the area.</p>
