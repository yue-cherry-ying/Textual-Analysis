<p>Frequent travelers who don't bother to take a look at their hotel bill on checking out might be surprised to find out what's there -- or maybe what isn't.</p>
<p>That comes from a survey done by a hotel industry consulting firm that sent people posing as guests to 400 hotels. They found a lot of billing mistakes, surprisingly more often in the guest's favour than in the hotel's.</p>
<p>Bills failed to record charges from in-room hospitality bars 32 percent of the time and meals charged to the room were not posted 17 percent of the time.</p>
<p>Other small costs such as telephone and fax charges failed to make the bill often, the survey conducted by Richey International of Jacksonvile,Fla., said.</p>
<p>This might seem surprising given the sophistication of billing proceedures at some hotels that allow guests to do video check-outs via the TV set in the room, or that let credit card-assured guests leave without ever seeing the front desk again.</p>
<p>The firm that did the survey said it appeared that desk clerks may not be taking full advantage of available technology. Another likely reason for the finding is that a whole range of lodging establishments was included in the survey, right down to simple roadside inns.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted for New Castle Hotels of Shelton, Conn., which owns and operates 15 hotels in the eastern United States, including Marriotts, Hiltons, Sheratons and Holiday Inns.</p>
<p>On another travel front, the world's largest owner and operator of business aircraft -- Executive Jet of Montvale, N.J. -- reports that more companies are in the market for corporate jets but are buying in as partial owners, a kind of time-sharing arrangement.</p>
<p>The company says there are now 5,000 business jets owned by 3,400 companies and individuals in the United States. But the trend, it says, is to buy as little as one-sixteenth ownership in a plane, saving the heavy investment costs and other expenses of complete ownership.</p>
<p>Such partial shares start at $389,000 and run up to $3.6 million, depending on the model of the aircraft, plus management fees. The partial owners are charged as well for actual flight time.</p>
<p>The company says the rationale of such an ownership depends on traffic volume, especially frequent flights between the same points, or visits to smaller cities that require time-consuming connections through larger airports.</p>
<p>Executive Jet said that by the end of this summer it will have more planes in operation than Air Canada.</p>
