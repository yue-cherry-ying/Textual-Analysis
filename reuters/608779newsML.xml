<title>CROATIA: Croatian stocks mixed, market to drift sideways.</title>
<headline>Croatian stocks mixed, market to drift sideways.</headline>
<dateline>ZAGREB 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Istrian hotelier Riviera was showcased on Friday in a directionless Croatian stock market which ended the week mixed, and analysts predicted shares would continue to drift sideways next week.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that the stock exchange will remain in the doldrums though there are one or two buying opportunities where prices have bottomed out,&quot; Michael Glazer of Auctor brokerage told Reuters.</p>
<p>He named food stock Podravka, which seemed to have halted its recent steep downslide to close flat at 265 kuna, as one. It also had the day's second largest volume of 1,936 shares.</p>
<p>Turnover slumped to 2.75 million as buyers stayed out of more expensive stocks such as blue chip Zagrebacka Banka and fished for bargains instead. Volume was slightly lower at 5,470 units.</p>
<p>Zagrebacka's ordinaries rose 20 kuna or 0.99 percent to end at 2,050 kuna on volume of 313 shares. Its Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs), which represent 1/10 of each share, fetched $33.62/68 on London's Seaq International.</p>
<p>&quot;Trade was very poor...apart from a handful of stocks including Riviera,&quot; said one trader with a large market share, but he saw no obvious reason for the Istrian hotelier's sudden upward thrust after remaining on the sidelines for months.</p>
<p>Riviera, adding 6.45 percent to 165 kuna, led five gainers and was the most active issue with 1,965 shares.</p>
<p>Five of 14 traded issues fell on Friday and four were flat.</p>
<p>Another fully-listed stock Pliva pharmaceuticals lost two kuna or 0.44 percent to 448 on volume of 153 units, following a dip in its 1/5 GDRs to $15.31 from $15.37 on the London Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The third company in the top bourse bracket, Varazdinska Banka, was very poorly traded after staying out of the market on Thursday.</p>
<p>Its two issues went in opposite directions -- ordinary shares closed at 39,500 kuna, 1.0 percent down from two days ago with only two shares sold. But the bank's bearer stock rose 4.76 percent to 1,100 kuna on volume of 10.</p>
<p>Varazdinska is expected to become more liquid once it splits both stocks, and reissues them with a face value of 100 kuna per share, probably next week.</p>
<p>Confectioner Kras, selling 788 units, regained 0.10 kuna to end the week at 410 kuna -- still two kuna down from last week.</p>
