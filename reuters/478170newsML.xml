<text>
<p>SEATTLE, April 1 (Retuer) - Paccar Inc Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark Pigott said Tuesday that based on the stronger than expected sales so far this year, the company now expects overall North American truck sales to be similar to last year's 205,000 units, rather than the 10 percent decline originally anticipated.</p>
<p>Pigott told investors at a conference sponsored by Ragen MacKenzie he was pleased with sales of the company's trucks so far this year and said the company was gaining market share in North America.</p>
<p>Vice Chairman Mike Tembreull told Reuters the company had been &quot;pleasantly surprised&quot; by sales in January and February, which he said were the highest in 19 months. He said capital spending would increase over the average $80 million to $100 million the company has been spending annually, but he declined to be more specific.</p>
<p>Pigott also said the company expected to spend $250 million to $300 million over the next five years on developing new products.</p>
