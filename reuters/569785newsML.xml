<title>USA: Los Angeles County begins budget hearings.</title>
<headline>Los Angeles County begins budget hearings.</headline>

<p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors held its first public hearing Thursday on its proposed $11.97 billion 1997-1998 budget, which calls for 1,200 job cuts in the health services department.</p>
<p>Additional public hearings were expected to be held before the supervisors begin their final budget deliberations in June. The 1997-1998 budget year begins July 1.</p>
<p>In April, Los Angeles County's chief administrative officer proposed the $11.97 billion spending plan.  </p>
<p>County CAO David Janssen said his proposed spending plan -- $173 million smaller than the current budget -- was balanced, but warned that the county's financial condition remained &quot;precarious.&quot;</p>
<p>The budget proposal included an operating reserve of $29.7 million.</p>
<p>The budget called for 1,200 job reductions in the county Health Services Department.</p>
<p>The county would add, however, hundreds of social service and sheriff's department jobs, Janssen said.</p>
<p>The budget included 304 new positions in the department of public social services to help welfare recipients find jobs and 718 new sheriff's department jobs for the county's Twin Towers jail in downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Janssen warned that several factors could undermine his budget plan, including fluctuations in state funding and unexpected costs associated with welfare reform.</p>
<p>The budget does not include any funds for pay raises. Most county employees have not had a raise for three years, and for many groups it has been four and five years.</p>
