<p>Rock legend Bob Dylan has been released from an undisclosed hospital where he was treated for a potentially fatal infection, his publicist said on Monday.</p>
<p>Elliot Mintz said the singer was discharged at the weekend and was expected to fully recover in four to six weeks -- in time to begin the North American leg of his concert tour in August.</p>
<p>Dylan, 56, called off a European tour last Wednesday after being admitted to a hospital suffering from a potentially life-threatening infection.</p>
<p>A source, who asked not to be identified, declined to say where the hospital was but added that it is not in New York as some media had reported.</p>
<p>Dylan was admitted to hospital suffering from severe chest pains. His condition was diagnosed as histoplasmosis, a potentially fatal infection which creates swelling in the sac which surrounds the heart.</p>
