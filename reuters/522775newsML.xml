<p>The cost of a nearly 10-day-old strike at a Chrysler Corp engine plant has risen to about $20 million a day in lost profits, but negotiations to resolve the dispute remained low-key on Saturday.</p>
<p>Chrysler spokeswoman Nicole Solomon said the company had scheduled no formal meetings this weekend with United Auto Workers Local 51, which represents about 1,800 workers who walked off their jobs at Chrysler's Mound Road engine plant in Detroit just after midnight on April 10.</p>
<p>Top officials from both sides, however, were expected to contact each other by telephone, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not finding the compromise, so you continue to talk,&quot; she said. &quot;This is a tough one because of the issues involved.&quot;</p>
<p>The union struck in an effort to thwart Chrysler's plans to shift production of driveshafts from the plant to an outside supplier, a move union officials say will eliminate over 200 UAW jobs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chrysler confirmed on Friday that a lack of V-8 and V-6 truck engines from the Mound Road plant had forced it to shut two truck plants in Saltillo and Lago Alberto, Mexico, bringing to 15,000 the number of Chrysler workers idled by the strike.</p>
<p>Chrysler shut down three U.S. plants on April 11 and one in Canada, including its Jeep Grand Cherokee plant in Detroit, pickup truck plants in Warren, Mich., and Fenton, Mo., and a plant that makes large vans in Windsor Ontario.</p>
<p>Chrysler also has suspended production of its Dodge Viper roadster in Detroit because it has run out of the muscle car's V-10 engines, which are built at Mound Road.</p>
<p>Solomon said the automaker has not yet made a decision on whether to oppose the payment of state unemployment benefits to the workers idled by engine shortages, part of which are funded by the company. The automaker is not paying any wages to the strikers or those idled.</p>
<p>Analysts said the lost production in the United States, Canada and Mexico is costing Chrysler about $20 million a day and much of it will not likely be made up during the second quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll have to start chipping away at our second quarter earnings estimates,&quot; said Lehman Brothers auto analyst Joseph Phillippi. &quot;If it's not done by next Friday, we're looking at negative comparisons.&quot;</p>
<p>Chrysler was originally expected by Wall Street analysts to earn about $1.3 billion during the April-June period because of strong truck production plans, compared to $1.05 billion in the same period of 1996. Chrysler on April 10 reported record first quarter profits of $1.03 billion.</p>
<p>But Chrysler stock has not suffered because of the strike, which Burnham Securities analyst David Healy said indicates that investors appear to back Chrysler's tough stance aimed at maintining its ability to cut costs.</p>
<p>&quot;The market isn't paying much for 1997 earnings as it is,&quot; Healy said. &quot;The stock has been dead at or around $30 a share.&quot;</p>
<p>Chrysler shares closed up 37.5 cents on Friday at $30.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Bargainers also made little headway on Friday in efforts to end a two-week-old strike at General Motors Corp.'s Oklahoma City car assembly plant as a strike deadline at another GM plant drew closer.</p>
<p>The United Auto Workers union has threatened to strike GM's Pontiac, Mich., pickup truck plant at 11:59 p.m. EDT (0359 GMT)  on Tuesday unless the two sides can reach a tentative agreement for a new local contract before then.</p>
<p>The Oklahoma City plant makes GM's new Chevrolet Malibu and Oldsmobile Cutlass mid-size cars, and the walkout has forced GM to shelve multimillion dollar advertising campaigns to introduce the sedans to the public.</p>
<p>GM spokesman Bill Betts said on Friday that bargainers for GM and UAW Local 1999 in Oklahoma City were continuing to meet regularly, but still had major issues to resolve.</p>
<p>Like the Chrysler strike, the GM strike in Oklahoma City is over jobs. GM reduced the plant's workforce by about 900 people when it launched production of Malibu and Cutlass, which were designed with far fewer parts, and the UAW wants a sizeable portion of those jobs restored.</p>
