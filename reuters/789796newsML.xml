<p>Workers at a Wal-Mart store in Wisconsin on Friday voted against joining the United Steelworkers union, the first time employees of a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. store in the United States have voted on unionizing, officials said.</p>
<p>In a 54-27 vote, the workers rejected the union at the Wal-Mart store in Merrill, Wisconsin. Union organiser Patsy Schafer said the union would continue its effort.  </p>
<p>&quot;There won't be a union yet,&quot; Schafer said in a telephone interview from Merrill, Wisconsin. &quot;We are going to continue on and we'll see.&quot;</p>
<p>Of Wal-Mart's 780,000 employees worldwide, only workers at a Wal-Mart store in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, belong to a union, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman said. While union elections have been held at Sam's Club warehouse stores and other operations, they had not been held at a U.S. Wal-Mart store before, she said.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., is the world's largest retailer, with 1996 sales of $104.4 billion and more than 3,000 total outlets.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart's stock lost $1 to end at $37.0625 in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading Friday.</p>
