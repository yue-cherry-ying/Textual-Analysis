<p>The leader of ethnic Albanians in Serbia's mostly Albanian province of Kosovo on Thursday postponed elections for the province's ethnic parliament, bowing to pressure by the United States.</p>
<p>Serbian authorities regard the parliament of the self-proclaimed Republic of Kosovo as illegal.</p>
<p>&quot;The mandate of the deputies to the Parliament of the Republic of Kosovo, elected in the multiparty parliamentary elections on 24 May 1992, is extended,&quot; Ibrahim Rugova said in a statement faxed to Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Their mandate is extended till 24 December 1997, namely until new elections are held,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rugova had already extended the mandate of the self-proclaimed parliament once last year in what rival parties see as an abuse of power.</p>
<p>During a visit last month, John Kornblum, former US envoy to the former Yugoslavia, told Rugova to abandon the idea of an independent Kosovo and that the Albanians must seek a solution for their problems within Serbia.</p>
<p>This starkest-ever American message to the Albanian Kosovo leadership was a bitter blow to Rugova, Albanian sources in the provincial capital Pristina told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision to delay fresh elections is a direct result of U.S. pressure. It is a bitter pill for Rugova to swallow,&quot; one authoritative source said on condition of anonimity.</p>
<p>Rugova and other leaders of almost two million Albanians have been pushing for their own Kosovo republic within the new Yugoslavia comprising Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
<p>If this is not achieved, more radical leaders have threatened force to create an independent Kosovo.</p>
<p>Albanians, who outnumber Serbs nine to one in the province, have boycotted Serbian institutions since 1989 when Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic cracked down on Kosovo, saying Albanians wanted to secede.</p>
<p>Serbs consider Kosovo as the cradle of their culture.</p>
<p>The United States has also pressured Milosevic to restore human rights in the province if he is to gain access to foreign financial institutions now barred by an U.S.-imposed sanctions.</p>
<p>Milosevic needs funding for his moribund economy devastated by four years of war, collapse of the single Yugoslav market and U.N. sanctions imposed because of Serbia's support for Bosnian Serbs in the war in Bosnia.</p>
<p>But Belgrade has so far insisted the Kosovo problem is an internal Serbian affair and refused to attend recent Serb-Albanian talks in New York on the issue.</p>
<p>Diplomats believe that Kosovo Albanians, who account for 20 percent of Serbia's some seven million voters, could tilt the scales in favour of the Serbian opposition in presidential and parliamentary elections to be held by the end of the year, should they end their boycott and vote.</p>
<p>Albanian leaders reject the possibility of ending their boycott but some sources believe this stance could change, artly because of outside pressure and partly due to a growing differences among the leaders on future strategy.</p>
