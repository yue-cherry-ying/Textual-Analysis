<p>Jury selection resumed on Tuesday in the Oklahoma City bombing trial but legal experts predicted it could be weeks before a panel is found to determine if Timothy McVeigh planted the bomb that killed 168 people two years ago.</p>
<p>Only six potential jurors were interviewed on Monday when the trial formally started. But the snail's pace did not disturb relatives of those who died in the worst act of violence against civilians ever on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>&quot;It's slow but I have been waiting a long time. I want the process to be right and thorough. You can't rush the thing. It takes what it takes,&quot; said Marsha Kight, who lost her 23-year-old daughter in the April 19, 1995, tragedy.</p>
<p>But the slow pace seemed to annoy Federal District Court Judge Richard Matsch when jury selection resumed on Tuesday. He cut off defence attorney Stephan Jones after Jones spent 38 minutes finishing up a detailed examination of the last juror interviewed on Monday, asking her such things as whether she would require McVeigh to testify.</p>
<p>Matsch, known for his hair-trigger temper, said, &quot;She will do whatever I tell her to do. ... I believe you have had more than an adequate time to examine this witness.&quot;</p>
<p>Jones quickly conceded. &quot;With the court's admonition, I wouldn't ask any more questions,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Legal experts said earlier predictions that a jury of 12 plus six alternates could be found in two to three weeks appeared to be wildly optimistic unless the slow pace of questioning potential jurors is dramatically speeded up. They said it might take between four and six weeks.</p>
<p>McVeigh officially is on trial for the &quot;use of a weapon of mass destruction&quot; and the murder of eight federal officials. A second defendant, his former Army buddy Terry Nichols, will be tried separately later.</p>
<p>Lawyers for both sides and Matsch spent an hour to an hour and a half quizzing each potential juror, asking their opinions on everything from whether they wanted to serve to whether they thought they could order McVeigh executed if he was found guilty.</p>
<p>Jones resumed questioning of the sixth potential juror, identified only as juror 851, a commercial artist and photographer. &quot;Good morning, Mrs 851,&quot; he said, greeting the woman, whose identity like those of other potential jurors is being kept secret for their own protection. He noted that in a 40-page questionaire she filled out she wrote that &quot;I can't help but believe (McVeigh's) guilty based on media reports.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that your opinion ... you believe he's guilty based on what you've read?&quot; Jones asked. &quot;Yes sir,&quot; she replied, adding that it would be difficult for her to put aside &quot;things that are already implanted in (my) head from the media.&quot;</p>
<p>She also said she could not erase from her memory images of the 19 children killed in the blast.</p>
<p>Matsch and the lawyers have to find a panel of 64 people from which to choose the jury, with the defence and the prosecution then having 20 challenges each to bar jurors they consider potentially hostile to their side.</p>
<p>Because the case carries the death penalty, people opposed to capital punishment will not be seated as jurors. Only one of six people questioned on Monday expressed such opposition.</p>
<p>Jurors sat behind a screen to protect their privacy as the trial began under tight security. Juror 851 told Jones she was disturbed by the security arrangements for bringing her into the courthouse. Without giving any specifics, she said, &quot;It's very creepy. I don't know what the concerns would be, but it's odd.&quot;</p>
<p>There were reports that jurors were being brought to the courthouse in vans with darkened windows.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers fear that heavy media coverage of the bomb investigation has poisoned potential jurors against McVeigh and are expected to seek to disqualify those they think have already made up their minds.</p>
<p>They are especially concerned that press reports that McVeigh confessed his guilt to them may have tainted chances for a fair trial. But only two of six jurors questioned on Monday had heard of the reports; one said he did not believe what he read in the papers and the other said she heard the confession was a fake.</p>
