<p>The U.S. space agency will continue to send astronauts to Russia's Mir space station despite the collision that robbed the orbital outpost of a science lab and half its power, a senior NASA official said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;Our current plan is to continue the missions. If something came up to change that assessment, we would certainly look at it very seriously,&quot; said Frank Culbertson, the veteran astronaut who runs NASA's joint missions with Mir.</p>
<p>Although many of the U.S. scientific experiments aboard the station were lost when a cargo craft struck Mir on Wednesday, &quot;there was plenty of science left,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If we reach the point where it's not safe, then we will bring people home,&quot; he said. &quot;But for right now, I think they're in a stable, safe environment and we're learning a lot.&quot;</p>
<p>Two more U.S. astronauts were training in Russia for future missions to Mir. The space station's current NASA resident, Michael Foale, was due to be relieved in September. He was the fifth NASA astronaut to live and work on the station.</p>
<p>Three days after the dramatic crash, which breached the air-tight wall of the Spektr science module, life aboard Mir was gradually improving, Foale said on Saturday in a radio transmission released by NASA.</p>
<p>&quot;Slowly, slowly, we've gotten things back together,&quot; he said. &quot;Let's just hope that things will get back to normal as soon as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>The Russian space authorities were planning a daring spacewalk inside the damaged module in mid-July to restore power lost in the crash. Repair gear was to be delivered to Mir by a Russian cargo craft scheduled for launch between July 5 and 8.</p>
<p>Foale said he had managed to scrounge a toothbrush, clothes and a pair of running shoes. Most of his personal items were lost inside the sealed-off Spektr compartment.</p>
<p>The British-born astronaut also described the moment of Wednesday's collision.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard the big thump and a thud,&quot; he said. &quot;Almost immediately, we heard a hiss and felt pressure falling in our ears. The alarms in the space station went off, telling us we had a depressurization of the station.&quot;</p>
<p>Fortunately, Foale and his two Russian crewmates, Vasily Tsibliev and Alexander Lazutkin, were able to quickly seal off the leaking compartment.</p>
<p>&quot;Since that rather exciting moment we've been dealing with all the problems that resulted from that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Mir crew was given some time off on Saturday to recover from their ordeal. Tsibliev and Lazutkin also endured the serious fire that struck Mir in February.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been tough, its going to continue to be tough, but this what they trained for,&quot; Culbertson said.</p>
