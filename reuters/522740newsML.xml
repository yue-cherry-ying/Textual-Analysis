<p>U.N. and aid officials visited a Libyan-Egyptian border camp on Saturday to find out what happened when Libyan policemen and soldiers forced more than 200 Palestinian refugees there to suddenly return to Libya.</p>
<p>One aid official told Reuters by telephone it was not clear where the refugees were taken.</p>
<p>&quot;The Libyans arrived at 4 a.m. on Friday. It is not clear whether they were taken to Tubruq or Benghzai,&quot; said Eric Stobbaerts of Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), who visited the site.</p>
<p>He said officials from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees were also at the camp near Salloum on the Mediterranean coast.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems clear that international attention pressured the Libyans to find a solution to the problem, and one solution was to return them to Libya.&quot;</p>
<p>Stobbaerts said MSF was concerned about refugees who needed medical care for heart conditions or diabetes.</p>
<p>Bulldozers have started knocking down the tents and crude shops the refugees had set up to try to make a living and people's belongings strewn about the camp made it appear the site was abandoned in haste, travellers said.</p>
<p>Travellers had said on Friday that they saw the armed police and soldiers beat the refugees to make them board the buses.</p>
<p>The refugees had been living at the camp since September 1995, where Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi expelled them to punish the Palestinian leadership for making peace with Israel.</p>
<p>Libya reversed its policy on the refugees in January, saying it was not possible for them to go home to Palestinian-ruled areas. The Palestinians refused to return, saying they would rather go to Egypt or instead to self-rule areas.</p>
<p>Israel has entry rights to the Palestinian areas under peace deals.</p>
<p>Egypt would not let them in unless they could prove a third country would give them residence. It has made some exceptions in cases of emergency health problems.</p>
