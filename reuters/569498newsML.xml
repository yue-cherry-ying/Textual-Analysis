<headline>Stocks gain on upbeat view of capital gains tax cut.</headline>

<p>Blue-chip stocks bounced back Thursday as Wall Street put a positive spin on plans to lower the capital gains tax rate.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average was up 50.97 points at 7,136.62 as it recaptured part of Wednesday's 140-point plunge. At one time, the blue-chip index was up nearly 130 points before profit-taking trimmed the gain.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,403 to 1,097 on heavy volume of 534 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The market's bounce went against conventional wisdom that news of a proposal to make a capital gains tax cut effective as of Wednesday would unleash a wave of pent-up selling on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It was definitely a shock,&quot; Jay Meagrow, institutional trader at McDonald &amp; Co. said of the market's action on Thursday. &quot;I didn't see it coming.&quot;</p>
<p>After the stock market closed Wednesday, the Republican chairmen of the congressional tax-writing committees said they would propose setting May 7, as the effective date for a capital gains tax.</p>
<p>The tax cut would allow investors to keep more of their profits when they sell stocks.</p>
<p>But lightening the capital gains tax burden also makes investing in stocks more attractive, a view that held the day Thursday, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand for stocks seems to be the dominant factor,&quot; said Robert Stovall, president Stovall/Twenty-First.</p>
<p>The bond market also helped.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 11/32, lowering its yield to 6.94 percent from 6.96 percent on Wednesday, when the yield rose sharply due to a disappointing auction of 10-year Treasury notes. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>&quot;It adds a lot of octane to the equity market when rates move well below 7 percent,&quot; said Guy Truicko, equity portfolio manager at Unity Management.</p>
<p>Among big movers, International Business Machines Corp. jumped 5-5/8 to 167-3/4 after it had an upbeat meeting with industry analysts late Wednesday.</p>
<p>US Airways Group Inc. rose 2-3/4 to 34-1/2 after saying it would cut unprofitable routes and close some facilities in a sweeping restructuring aimed at cutting costs.</p>
<p>Oil stocks gained amid a rise in crude oil prices. Atlantic Richfield Co. advanced 2-5/8 to 145-3/4, Texaco Inc. gained 4-3/8 to 110-5/8 and Chevron Corp. added 1 to 70-5/8.</p>
<p>Petsmart Inc., which runs a chain of pet supply superstores, fell 13/16 to 10-13/16. The company said it expects to report disappointing income for the latest quarter.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index rose 7.92 points to 1,330.83.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 4.64 points to 820.26. The American Stock Exchange index was up 0.45 to 570.95.</p>
<p>The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 1.95 to 426.90. The average share was up 20 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 7,745.411 up 38.431 or 0.50 percent.</p>
