<p>Key December three-month Euroyen interest rate futures firmed slightly by midday on Thursday, with the topside capped by a smaller-than-expected retreat in Tokyo stocks after steep losses on Wall Street overnight.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who had sold Euroyen futures earlier this week wanted to buy back, but they failed to do so because the Nikkei stayed above 20,000 yen,&quot; said a city bank dealer.</p>
<p>A view spread after Wednesday's quick recovery from the day's low of 99.85 that the key December may stay above 98.90 unless the market factors in a further rise in interest rates, traders said. The December was up 0.01 at 98.95.  </p>
<p>It moved between 98.94 and 98.97 after opening at 98,96. Turnover was 30,837 contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;Many people think the Nikkei's recent rises are temporary and they haven't changed their outlook on interest rates,&quot; the dealer said. The Nikkei stock average ended the morning at 20,016.90, down 32.00 points or 0.16 percent from Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the interbank market, the key overnight call rate fell to around 0.47 percent by midday from Wednesday's weighted average of 0.49. The rate's sharp fall was attributed to steady progress in banks' fund-raising before the current bank reserves reporting period ends on May 15.  </p>
<p>Traders said that in response to a decline in banks' fund demand, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) let the money market hold a fund surplus of 180 billion yen on Thursday, down from around 300 billion yen on the previous three business days.</p>
<p>About 30 billion yen of two-month certificates of deposit (CD) were issued at 0.55 percent, the first issue since April 21, when the two-month CDs were issued at 0.54 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The buyers of the CDs did not expect a change in Japan's low interest rate policy in two months. But an increasing number of people now expect a change after the BOJ's 'tankan' survey in early July,&quot; another city bank dealer said.</p>
