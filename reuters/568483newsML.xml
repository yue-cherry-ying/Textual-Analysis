<p>For most U.S. Treasury market participants, Friday could not come soon enough.</p>
<p>With no economic news scheduled for release, players expect light activity and Treasuries sticking to tight ranges, as the market gears up for the next wave of data next week.</p>
<p>Friday &quot;is a good day for a half day and then go play golf,&quot; said one head trader at a primary dealership. &quot;The market is ready for a breather.&quot;</p>
<p>Others expressed similar sentiments, noting that trading the market this week has been quite stressful.  </p>
<p>After rallying significantly all of last week, Treasuries came back to earth over the past few days, helped out by two abysmal auctions in which investors balked at the expensive levels on three and 10-year notes.</p>
<p>&quot;It shows a bear market mentality,&quot; said Scott Graham, a trader at Prudential Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Yet, after two days of selling that took yields back up to &quot;comfortable&quot; levels, buyers emerged, Graham noted.</p>
<p>He and others said it is a good bet the positive tone seen on Thursday would continue into Friday, provided there are no surprises from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.  </p>
<p>Greenspan is slated to deliver a short address to New York University's Stern School of Business at 2030 EDT/0030 GMT.</p>
<p>Since the Fed is hush hush as to the content of the speech, analysts said that, should Greenspan make any mention of the economy, monetary policy or irrational exuberance, it could have an impact on the markets, beginning with Tokyo.</p>
<p>Most, though, doubt that scenario, in which case &quot;the market scratches higher&quot; on Friday,&quot; said Steven Wood, director of financial markets research at BancAmerica Securities.  </p>
<p>Players said a dramatically improved technical environment than earlier in the week was another reason why the market could drift higher on Friday.</p>
<p>Late Thursday, the 30-year bond was at 96-7/32, up 15/32, with its yield down to 6.93 percent from 6.96 percent. All other maturities posted gains, boosted by a range of factors, including a coupon pass, a large hedge fund reportedly buying $1 billion of Treasuries against mortgage backed securities and the June bond contract breaking above its 109-21/32 resistance.  </p>
<p>&quot;The technical picture looks a lot better than 24 hours ago,&quot; said a trader, referring to Thursday's close versus Wednesday's close. Thursday morning, &quot;the market looked like hell.&quot;</p>
<p>Part of that has to do with the latest Fed view.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is still thinking they aren't going to go in May,&quot; said Joe LaVorgna, financial market economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Rather, he said, the market has priced in a rate rise in July, evidenced by a 5.55 percent level on May federal funds futures, but a 5.75 percent level for July fed funds futures.  </p>
<p>But not all factors are bullish, traders noted.</p>
<p>&quot;There are so many cross-currents in the market,&quot; said Graham, ticking off the budget talks, an &quot;overheated&quot; economy, talk of intervention to curb the dollar and possibility of eliminating some Treasury auctions.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a slew of things to look at. The market is not focusing on just one thing,&quot; he said.</p>
