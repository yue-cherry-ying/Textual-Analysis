<p>House Commerce Committee chairman Thomas Bliley said Tuesday that his committee was unlikely to vote before September on a bill to build a temporary dump for spent fuel from nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we can (move before September) with all that we have on our plate,&quot; the Virginia Republican told reporters, referring to budget and tax issues that would take up Congressional time until September.</p>
<p>Nuclear utilities are pressing the government in the courts and in Congress to live up to its side of a 1982 contract to start taking away their radioactive waste in early 1998.</p>
<p>The Energy Department has said it will not be able to fulfill the contract because it has nowhere to store the spent fuel. President Bill Clinton has vowed to veto a bill that would force the government to build a temporary dump in Nevada before a decision is made on where to bury the waste forever.</p>
<p>Speaking at an energy industry luncheon, Bliley said he did not want to pass a bill that would draw a veto from President Clinton unless he was sure to have the votes to override White House opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;Last Congress I said we'd move legislation on this issue 'smartly',&quot; he said. &quot;'Smartly' doesn't include sending up a bill to the president who says he'll veto, not when you don't have 67 votes (to override a veto) in the Senate.&quot;</p>
<p>Bliley said he was waiting to see how the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in September on utilities' call for the government to stop collecting nuclear waste fees from the industry until it has built a dump.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll get one shot at nuclear waste legislation this Congress, just one. I want it to be a kill shot, not a shot in the dark,&quot; he said.</p>
