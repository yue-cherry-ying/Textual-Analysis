<title>USA: Alaska governor vetos billboard legislation.</title>
<headline>Alaska governor vetos billboard legislation.</headline>
<dateline>ANCHORAGE, Alaska 1997-04-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Alaska's governor Friday vetoed a controversial bill that would have eased restrictions on roadside signs, saying the law would permit billboards that would mar the state's scenery.</p>
<p>&quot;Since territorial days, Alaska leaders have resisted the urge to clutter our magnificent landscape with billboards, and the state proudly leads the nation in the protection of our unmatched scenery,&quot; Gov. Tony Knowles, a Democrat, said.</p>
<p>Knowles vetoed the legislation in a ceremony at Mendenhall Glacier, a popular tourist destination in the state capital of Juneau.</p>
<p>At the same time he issued his veto, the governor signed new state regulations allowing standardized directional signs within state rights-of-way along the highways.</p>
<p>The bill Knowles vetoed would have allowed directional signs outside of the state rights-of-way strips, and would have reduced the penalty for sign violations.</p>
<p>The bill was passed by the Republican-controlled legislature at the urging of tourism businesses who say the state's billboard restructions hurt them.</p>
<p>Knowles' Republican predecessor, Gov. Walter Hickel, vetoed a similar bill in 1994.</p>
<p>An override vote is scheduled for Monday, and Republican leaders are confident of easily overturning Knowles' action, said a spokesman for the bill's sponsor, Republican state Sen. Lyda Green.</p>
