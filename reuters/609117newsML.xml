<title>THAILAND: Thai Danu clarifies merger talk collapse.</title>
<headline>Thai Danu clarifies merger talk collapse.</headline>
<dateline>BANGKOK 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>Thai Danu Bank Plc said on Friday problems of share swaps and complicated tax and legal issues prompted it to scrap its planned merger with Finance One Plc.</p>
<p>Thai Danu said in a statement of its decision to end efforts of forming alliance with Finance One: &quot;The two companies have started conducting a due diligence exercise...and devoted considerable time for determining the ratio of mutual share swaps.</p>
<p>&quot;We concluded that the merger process as agreed to under the memorandum of understanding and related legal proceeding would take considerable time and also due to unclear merger related tax issues...a merger between Thai Danu and Finance One would not create real synergy as expected by both organisations.&quot;  </p>
<p>Thai Danu President Pornsanong Tuchinda said in a statement his bank would continue supporting government policy of shoring up Thai financial institutions.</p>
<p>Thai Danu ranks 11th among Thailand's 15 commercial banks.</p>
<p>The Thai Finance Ministry and the Bank of Thailand announced earlier that they would back the Thai Danu-Finance One merger to make it a model for future similar mergers among finance firms which currently struggle to adjust to growing non-performing loans extended to the property sector.</p>
<p>Analysts have said a collapse of the Thai Danu-Finance One merger talk could erode market confidence in the stability of Thailand's 91 finance firms which have an average 25 percent loan exposure to the property sector.</p>
<p>The Thai property sector is in its fourth year of severe slump with no immediate recovery in sight.  </p>
<p>Trading in Thai Danu and Finance One shares have been suspended by the Stock Exchange of Thailand since late February.</p>
<p>Finance One has said it has about 66 billion baht in outstanding loans, of which about 20 billion went to the property sector.</p>
<p>Thai Danu sources said earlier that the bank was prepared to take over about six billion baht of these loans.</p>
<p>Deputy central bank governor Jaroong Nookhwun said earlier on Friday his bank is prepared to contain any damage that the financial sector may face if the proposed Thai Danu-Finance One alliance did not materialise.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan said the delay in wrapping up their merger talk partly stemmed from problems encountered by auditors assessing Finance One's assets.</p>
<p>Both Jaroong and Amnuay said they expect a need for Finance One to raise capital to offset its shrinking assets.</p>
<p>Thai Denu's Pornsanong said in his statement: &quot;Thai Danu is prepared to move ahead in line with (Thailand's) financial development and liberalisation due to the bank's cautious and prudent planning...&quot;.</p>
