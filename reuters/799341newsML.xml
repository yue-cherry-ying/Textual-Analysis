<title>TAIWAN: TAIWAN CABINET APPROVES TAX MERGER PROPOSAL.</title>
<headline>TAIWAN CABINET APPROVES TAX MERGER PROPOSAL.</headline>

<p>Taiwan's cabinet on Thursday approved a tax merger proposal to boost investment which has been slowing, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The cabinet agreed to merge the island's two income taxes into one business income tax and set the merged rate at 25 percent,&quot; a government spokesman said.</p>
<p>The proposal was initiated by the finance ministry in October 1996.</p>
<p>The merger would reduce tax revenues by about T$30-40 billion a year, but the finance ministry would recoup the sharp downturn by assessing a 10 percent levy on profits that enterprises reserve rather than distribute to shareholders immediately, officials said.</p>
<p>The new tax system would avoid double taxation and will help corporate structures, finance minister Paul Chiu had said.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact this is a tax reduction,&quot; Chiu said. &quot;It will encourage investment (in Taiwan) and increase our international competitiveness.&quot;</p>
<p>Taiwan has been trying to entice major multinationals to locate their Asia-Pacific operations centres to the island by boosting local economic competitiveness, but the scheme has been hindered by the slow pace of market liberalisation, including tax reform.</p>
<p>The tax revision still needs final approval by the parliament and could take effect in January 1998 if all goes well.</p>
<p>Foreign nationals' taxes would not be affected and their maximum rate would remain at 40 percent, Chiu said.</p>
<p>The tax merger is really an accounting change that eliminates double taxation of companies' profits and the dividends they pay to shareholders, analysts said.</p>
<p>As a result, the maximum assessment on domestic individuals' income will be capped at 40 percent, below the maximum level of 55 percent for which they were liable before the merger.</p>
<p>Currently, foreign investors' income is taxed first by a 25 percent business income tax, and then a 20 percent dividend tax on the 75 percent untaxed part, making the rate 40 percent.</p>
