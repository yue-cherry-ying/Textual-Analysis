<headline>NYC's new agency picks PRAG as financial adviser.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The New York City Transitional Finance Authority at its first board meeting on Tuesday selected the same financial adviser, Public Resouces Advisory Group (PRAG), as the city uses.</p>
<p>Authority officials at the meeting explained that PRAG was picked because of its experience in helping with New York City's sales of general obligation bonds, as the new agency's debt will be sold under the same criteria.  </p>
<p>Joe Lhota, New York City's budget director and head of the new agency, reiterated that it expects to begin selling bonds as soon as August. &quot;From a timing standpoint, this Authority would actually be in the market in a late August (to) early September timeframe.&quot;</p>
<p>The Authority, created by Albany to sidestep the city's debt cap, was expected to soon send out Requests for Proposals to underwriters and bond counsels. While investment bankers who sell New York City's bonds likely will be free to apply to underwrite the Authority's new bonds, a city official, who declined to be named, said it had yet to be decided whether a bank would be able to serve on both syndicates. PRAG will serve as the Authority's advisor for 18 months.</p>
<p>New York City's debt limit is based on a five-year average of real estate prices, and the built-in lag means that the cap does not fully reflect the recovery in values since a sharp, local recession in the early 1990s. The city anticipated that it would hit its debt cap about one month before its fiscal year ends on June 30. In fiscal 1998, the new Authority plans to issue a little less than $1.3 billion, while New York City likely will sell $1.3 billion of general obligation bonds.</p>
<p>In an early test, the five-member board split along party lines, as Alan Hevesi, the New York City Comptroller, only won the support of the City Council Speaker's representative, Tom McMahon, in an effort to ammend the bylaws to require a four- or five-vote majority, instead of the the simple three-vote rule that was kept. The Republican Giuliani Administration appointed the three other board members, Lhota, the Commissioner of Finance, and the Commissioner of Design and Construction.</p>
