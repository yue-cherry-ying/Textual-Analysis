<title>UK: Zeneca reports 15 percent rise in pre-tax profit.</title>
<headline>Zeneca reports 15 percent rise in pre-tax profit.</headline>

<text>
<p>British drugs and speciality chemicals company Zeneca Group Plc said Friday that its pre-tax profits in the first four months of the year rose by 15 percent.</p>
<p>Zeneca, which did not provide detailed figures, said the gain excluded the impact of sterling's rise, which it acknowledged had &quot;a dampening effect,&quot; but said its underlying improvement &quot;continues apace.&quot;</p>
<p>Chairman Sir Sidney Lipworth told shareholders at the group's annual meeting that Zeneca was &quot;well in touch with&quot; its goal of doubling its pre-tax profits in the next five years, as it did from 1992 to 1996.</p>
<p>In a sign that it is reluctant to disturb the management chemistry that has helped Zeneca to leave its one-time parent Imperial Chemical Industries Plc in the dust, Zeneca announced that its chief executive, Sir David Barnes, would stay on for an additional year, retiring at the annual meeting in 1999.</p>
<p>The delay buys time for Zeneca in the notoriously difficult job of finding top-flight pharmaceutical executives.</p>
<p>Barnes steered Zeneca through its spin-off from ICI in 1993 and since then its shares have more than trebled in value, giving it a stock market capitalisation of nearly 18 billion pounds ($29.2 billion) and dwarfing ICI's 5.7 billion pound ($9.3 billion) valuation.</p>
<p>The company is the world's second biggest seller of cancer drugs after Bristol Myers Squibb Co. and has its eyes on the number one slot.</p>
<p>Its other strengths include heart drugs such as the ACE-inhibitor Zestril and it has recently moved into the highly competitive asthma field with Accolate, a new type of asthma treatment.</p>
