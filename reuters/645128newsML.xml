<p>Mark Johnson's pinch-hit single with one out in the bottom of the 10th inning scored Jason Kendall with the winning run to give the surprising Pirates a 5-4 win Friday over the Philadelphia Phillies.</p>
<p>Johnson, ripped in a Pittsburgh newspaper column earlier in the day for his weak 2-for-24 stretch at the plate, batted for Freddy Garcia and lined a Ricky Bottalico pitch down the line in right for the winning run.</p>
<p>&quot;It's as good a win as we had this year,&quot; said manager Gene Lamont, whose low-budget Pirates are in first place in the Central Division with a 30-29 record.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess when a guy takes a beating in the paper, it's tough on the whole team. To throw it back in the face of the people that do it is really nice.&quot;</p>
<p>Said Johnson: &quot;I guess I'm just going to keep battling. It seems I've been the focus lately. It was a situation where I knew I had to come through.&quot;</p>
<p>Pittsburgh starter Francisco Cordova carried a shutout into the eighth inning, but the Phillies erupted for four runs to tie the game.</p>
<p>Marc Wilkins, the fourth Pittsburgh pitcher, got the win to improve to 5-0. Jerry Spradlin (1-2) took the loss for the hapless Phils, who have lost seven of their last eight games.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, Ray Lankford hit a pair of solo homers and Ron Gant hit another to back the strong pitching of Alan Benes as the St. Louis Cardinals took a 3-1 win over the Dodgers.</p>
<p>Benes (5-5) rebounded from last Sunday's 6-1 loss to the Dodgers, holding them to seven hits in eight innings and striking out seven. Dennis Eckersley worked a perfect ninth inning for his 12th save.</p>
<p>Chan Ho Park (4-3), who beat the Cardinals last Sunday, allowed three runs and seven hits over seven innings and took the loss.</p>
<p>In San Diego, the Houston Astros zoomed out to a 7-0 lead after four innings then held on to defeat the Padres 8-7.</p>
<p>San Diego battled back with six runs in the fifth to pull within 7-6, but Jeff Bagwell hit a solo homer in the sixth -- his league leading 19th homer -- for a key insurance run as Houston stayed a half-game behind the Pirates in the Central.</p>
<p>&quot;It was nice because they had come back and that tacked on another,&quot; Bagwell said of the homer. &quot;You look back and you think you probably should've lost the game.&quot;</p>
<p>Jose Lima (1-3) picked up his first National League victory. Padres starter Joey Hamilton (4-3) was the loser.</p>
<p>Houston has won four of its last five games.</p>
<p>In Montreal, Jim Bullinger pitched a six-hitter against his former team and Henry Rodriguez homered as the Montreal Expos stopped a three-game losing streak with a 3-0 win over the Chicago Cubs.</p>
<p>Bullinger (3-5) is 2-1 in three starts against his former team this season. &quot;A win in this league is pretty hard to come by, so they're all pretty special,&quot; said Bullinger.</p>
<p>Chicago's best scoring chance came in the seventh after a pair of one-out singles. But pinch-hitter Dave Clark grounded into a double play.</p>
<p>&quot;It's no lie when they say those are a pitcher's best friend,&quot; Bullinger said about the twin killing.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, Javy Lopez homered, doubled and drove in three runs, and five relievers combined to allow one unearned run over the final 6 2/3 innings to lead the Atlanta Braves to a 9-5 victory over the San Francisco Giants.</p>
<p>Tony Graffanino went 3-for-4 and Andruw Jones and Michael Tucker each had two hits for the Braves, who banged out 15 hits.</p>
<p>In Cincinnati, Brett Tomko tossed six strong innings to notch his first major-league win and recorded his first hit and RBI in the process as the Cincinnati Reds finally beat the New York Mets, 5-2.</p>
<p>Tomko (1-1), called up to replace the injured John Smiley, allowed one run and four hits as the Reds beat the Mets for the first time in five meetings.</p>
<p>Rick Reed (4-3) had his worst outing of the season for the Mets, surrendering five runs and nine hits in six innings.</p>
<p>At Colorado, the Rockies' game against the Florida Marlines was postponed because of rain.</p>
