<headline>SIMEX Euroyen, JGBs slip on Sakakibara comments.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-05-23</dateline>

<p>SIMEX Euroyen and Japanese government bond (JGB) futures came under pressure from comments by key Japanese Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara in late Friday trade.</p>
<p>Sakakibara was quoted as saying the Bank of Japan (BOJ) could be expected to hike the discount rate by 0.50 percent in the coming year.</p>
<p>&quot;The discount rate is currently very low. It it rises by 0.50 percent, it will be at 1.0 percent, which remains low. A move on such a scale should be expected in the coming year,&quot; he told the French afternoon daily, Le Monde, in an interview.  </p>
<p>Sakakibara also said the BOJ would not hike rates until it was sure of an economic upturn.</p>
<p>Dealers said the comments caused a slight sell-off in a market which was already depressed by the dollar's strength against the yen and the resilience of Tokyo stocks on Friday.</p>
<p>But the impact was contained by the absence of Tokyo players and the fact that the market was already relatively short after heavy unloading earlier this week when a senior BOJ official said the central bank was mulling the timing of a rate rise.  </p>
<p>The lead December Euroyen contract was quoted at an intra-day low of 98.86 at 1115 GMT against its IMM close at 98.90. June JGBs ended at 123.48 against a previous 123.95.</p>
<p>&quot;We could see another round of selling on Monday. Most of the Japanese are out now and the Londoners are the only ones reacting,&quot; a trader with a Japanese futures house said.</p>
<p>He said December Euroyen could fall sharply to 98.81 if it breached the 98.85 level. June JGBs were expected to target the 123.00 psychological support.</p>
<p>Eurodollar futures ended little changed ahead of an abbreviated session and a long weekend in Chicago.  </p>
<p>&quot;I'm still looking to sell Eurodollars on any rallies because the U.S. is definitely going to hike rates again,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>He said he would sell the December contract anywhere above 93.750. It ended at 93.725 against its IMM close at 93.710 on light volume of 5,086 lots.</p>
