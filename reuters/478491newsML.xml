<p>A Sudanese spokesman on Tuesday denied rebels had captured the northeast district of Agigi and said the army had destroyed Eritrean and Ugandan tanks helping rebels in their anti-government fight.</p>
<p>&quot;We confirm that Agigi is in the hands of the armed forces,&quot; Sudanese Culture and Information Minister Brigadier Al-Tayeb Ibrahim Mohamed Khair told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;The army has contained the joint offensive of the Eritreans and the rebels in Karora after destroying two of their tanks and killing a number of their elements.&quot; He did not give a figure.</p>
<p>Sudanese rebel leader John Garang said in a statement issued in Asmara on Tuesday that a coalition of northern and southern opponents of Khartoum's Islamist government seized Agigi, karora, Itairba and Agiti districts in northeast Sudan.</p>
<p>Garang, who heads the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and is military commander of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), said NDA forces &quot;liberated&quot; the districts last week and over the weekend and were advancing towards the town of Tokar.</p>
<p>Tokar is 150 km (90 miles) southeast of Port Sudan, the country's main link to the outside world.</p>
<p>Khair said: &quot;The enemy is now under seige for six days and in very low morale in Wadi Ganit and outlaw claims that they have captured Agigi is a lie and part of psychological warfare.&quot;</p>
<p>Sudan has charged Ethiopia and Eritrea with helping rebel forces in their offensive on Sudan's east and northeast areas.</p>
<p>The two countries and the rebel coalition have denied it.</p>
<p>Khair, who is the government spokesman, said opposition forces and SPLA rebels committed atrocities in Karora when they advanced on the Red Sea locality aided by Eritrean troops. He said the victims included religious leader Sheikh Mohammed Ahmed Gumu, 70, his son, his son's family and three other men.</p>
<p>Rebels say the northeast offensive is aimed at cutting the road between Khartoum and Port Sudan in a bid to sever Khartoum's main link with the outside world.</p>
<p>Khair denied rebels were advancing towards Port Sudan.</p>
<p>He said government forces had &quot;foiled the plan of the Ugandan aggressors to advance towards the city of Juba in the south after destroying 10 of their tanks and pushing them back.&quot;</p>
<p>The SPLA captured the town of Yei in March when the campaign against the Islamist government shifted to the far south and the rebel group began to advance towards the regional capital Juba.</p>
<p>Sudan said at the time that Ugandan troops were helping the SPLA, but Kampala denied the charge.</p>
<p>Khair said the army had won back areas in the Blue Nile area captured by rebel forces in January.</p>
<p>&quot;Our forces have advanced beyond the stage of repelling the attackers to the stage of counterattack represented in the liberation of all the northern Blue Nile district and a group of localities in the southern Blue Nile district,&quot; Khair said.</p>
<p>Northern rebels of the NDA opposition coalition based in Eritrea attacked the army on the Sudanese side of the border with Eritrea in January but failed to capture much territory.</p>
<p>Rebel units further south, led by the southern-based SPLA, captured the Sudanese towns of Kurmuk and Qeissan on the Ethiopian border in an attack coordinated with the northerners.</p>
