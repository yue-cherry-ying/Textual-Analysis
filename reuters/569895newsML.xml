<p>An earthquake jolted Bangladesh and parts of India on Thursday, causing some damage to older buildings but no deaths, government officials and witnesses said.</p>
<p>A tremor of &quot;moderate intensity&quot; was felt in most parts of Bangladesh at 8:54 a.m. (0254 GMT) and lasted 30 seconds, meteorological department director Sajedur Rahman said.</p>
<p>He said the epicentre of the earthquake was 326 km (195 miles) north of the southeastern port city of Chittagong.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Royal Observatory estimated the magnitude of the earthquake at 5.7 on the open-ended Richter scale.</p>
<p>Residents in the eastern town of Sylhet, about 300 km (180 miles) north of Chittagong, said some old buildings were damaged by the tremor.</p>
<p>&quot;A few people were injured while leaving their homes in panic,&quot; a government official in Sylhet said by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still waiting for reports from remote areas. Some buildings in the town developed cracks due to the tremor.&quot;</p>
<p>In Dhaka, residents in the old part of the city rushed out of their homes in panic.</p>
<p>Indian Meteorological Department officials estimated the earthquake at 5.5 on the Richter scale and said it was felt in Guwahati, capital of the northeastern state of Assam, which borders Bangladesh's Sylhet district.</p>
<p>&quot;No damage to any property or loss of life is reported,&quot; S.N. Deka, director of Meteorological Department at Guwahati, said.</p>
