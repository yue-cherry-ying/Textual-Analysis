<headline>Calif. Gov. signs bill paving way for tobacco suit.</headline>

<p>California's governor said on Thursday he signed legislation paving the way for the state to sue major tobacco companies to recoup public health-care costs related to smoking.</p>
<p>Republican Gov. Pete Wilson also called on the state's attorney general, Dan Lungren, to file California's lawsuit against the industry.</p>
<p>Lungren is expected to announce the lawsuit shortly.  </p>
<p>&quot;Today marks a significant milestone in California's ongoing efforts to stop smoking,&quot; Wilson said.</p>
<p>California, the most populous state, with billions of dollars in potential claims, has so far not sued major tobacco companies.  But pressure has been building on state lawmakers in recent months to join the legal battle.</p>
<p>Lungren, a Republican, has long asserted that a lawsuit by California against tobacco companies would fail because of a 1987 state law shielding them from product liability claims.  </p>
<p>The bill signed by Wilson Thursday removes the barrier, allowing Lungren to sue tobacco companies to recover state-paid medical costs of treating smokers.</p>
<p>&quot;For far too long, tobacco companies have enjoyed a special statutory immunity from any product liability suit -- whether it was brought by a smoker who chose to light up, or by a state or local government which had to pay for that smoker's medical bills,&quot; Wilson said.</p>
<p>Wilson said tobacco-related illnesses cost state taxpayers about $430 million a year in Medi-Cal outlays.  </p>
<p>&quot;That's money we could put to more productive uses, especially when it comes to helping kids get a better start in life,&quot; Wilson said.</p>
<p>With the governor's signature, the tobacco legislation immediately takes effect.</p>
<p>&quot;The next step is for California to join the 36 other states that already have brought suit against tobacco companies,&quot; Wilson said.  &quot;I've asked Attorney General Lungren to do exactly that.&quot;</p>
