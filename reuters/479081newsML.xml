<p>A new men's magazine is hitting the newsstands Tuesday, April 1. If the idea of &quot;cheesecake,&quot; comes to mind, be advised that the only serious cheesecake photograph in Maxim is likely to be in a recipe.</p>
<p>But while there might not be a preponderance of cleavage photos, Maxim, the U.S. version of the two-year-old British magazine of the same name, is all about women -- and what men should do to meet them, woo them and keep them warm, cosy and ready for love.</p>
<p>Maxim is seeking out 22- to 49-year-old male readers -- those too hip for GQ and Esquire and too staid for Details. Call it something like a &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; for guys.</p>
<p>&quot;Men want very simple information -- they want it to give them an edge. Men don't like to ask for directions, but want to know what the other guys don't,&quot; said Maxim's editor-in-chief Clare McHugh.</p>
<p>Clare McHugh, that's right, she's a she. This fact, she said, will give Maxim an edge. Coming from a women's magazine background, she said she sees the importance of bringing service journalism to a magazine for men.</p>
<p>Men want to know about sports, travel, food and gadgets, she said, but Maxim hopes to offer something that its more straight-laced competitors don't, and that's a healthy dose of humour.</p>
<p>Features such as &quot;Are you a Mac guy or a PC guy,&quot; &quot;The Seinfeld Girls,&quot; and &quot;How To: Get along with her pop&quot; slide over the edge into satire.</p>
<p>Maxim flaunts that it has a woman editor with a letter to readers and her picture gracing the first issue.</p>
<p>&quot;Women can get away with&quot; the tone of many of Maxim's articles, McHugh said, which includes the liberal use of puns in titles and picture captions.</p>
<p>&quot;It allows an article like 'babe management,'&quot; she said, which is a decidedly satirical look at &quot;investing in the woman of your dreams.&quot;</p>
<p>More serious articles on cars, sports and an account of the death of an ice climber balance out the mix.</p>
<p>Unlike Penhouse or Playboy, Maxim will not run political or highly controversial articles, McHugh said.</p>
<p>Then there's lingerie. Following McHugh's claim that men want to know but don't want to ask, an article entitled &quot;The gift that keeps on giving&quot; is a buyer's guide to women's lingerie, including suggestions for styles to match a woman's personality.</p>
<p>Food also will play a large part in Maxim's editorial direction, McHugh said from the New York-based magazine's office.</p>
<p>In the debut issue, a feature walks the reader through preparations for a romantic meal, including salad, tenderloin of beef, steamed asparagus, and the never-fail recipe for love -- chocolated-covered strawberries. Another article outlines affordable, available wines.</p>
<p>Under the current format, Maxim will never be confused with a porn magazine, McHugh said, and in fact was reformatted from its British relation.</p>
<p>U.S. Maxim might have similar articles as the British magazine but they are executed differently. Maxim on this side of the Atlantic is less &quot;laddish,&quot; which McHugh defined as &quot;the glorification of male boorishness.&quot;</p>
<p>Maxim is joining a growing field of magazines catering to men. Separate from so-called adult magazines, which might have photographs of nude women, Maxim is part of a growing segment of service-oriented men's magazines.</p>
<p>New additions to the genre include Personal Best, a spin-off from Conde Nast's GQ, which is scheduled for Spring 1998; Times Mirror's Verge, which is due this spring; and the independently published Icon, currently in distribution.</p>
<p>Maxim, published by Britain's Dennis Publishing Inc., currently has a press run of 350,000 copies. It will come out monthly and has a newsstand price of $2.99, or $3.50 Canadian.</p>
