<p>A federal judge on Monday granted a request to delay the effective date for implementing regulations arising from a tough new immigration law.</p>
<p>Acting after a lengthy hearing, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled against the Justice Department just six hours before the law was to take effect and delayed the regulations that would carry out the measure until April 5.</p>
<p>The ruling, delivered from the bench, represented a major setback for the Justice Department. Department lawyers said no decision had yet been made on whether to mount a last-minute emergency appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>The law, approved by Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton in September, has sparked panic in some communities with large immigrant populations, creating long lines outside marriage bureaus and a steep rise in requests for a change in immigrant status.</p>
<p>The law's overall purpose was to tighten U.S. borders against illegal aliens by increasing the number of border patrol agents, improving technology and beefing up barriers along the U.S.-Mexican border.</p>
<p>Deportation procedures will be streamlined under the law and the number of aliens exempted from deportation will be capped. Also, those foreigners who are ineligible to enter the United States will face &quot;expedited removal&quot; at ports of entry.</p>
<p>A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and several other groups charged the federal government failed to give immigrants the required amount of time to prepare for the law's sweeping policy changes.</p>
<p>The judge agreed, noting that the regulations governing the law's enforcement had been published on March 6. Sullivan said Congress in the law specifically required a full, 30-day period before the regulations can take effect.</p>
<p>He said the law involved pervasive changes and immigrants should have adequate advance notice of the law's key provisions.</p>
<p>&quot;Four days may seem minimal to some, but under these circumstances four days cannot be trivalized,&quot; Sullivan said, referring to the delay on when the regulations go into effect.</p>
<p>Sullivan emphasised the law itself was not blocked from taking effect April 1, but he issued an injunction ordering that the regulations interpreting and implementing the law be delayed until April 5.</p>
<p>Paul Virtue, a senior official at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service, an agency which is part of the Justice Department, had warned that a last-minute ruling against the government could have &quot;disastrous consequences.&quot;</p>
<p>He said a restraining order would cause &quot;wide-scale confusion, miscommunication and error,&quot; that thousands of deportation cases may be compromised and &quot;the agency's ability to enforce the immigration laws&quot; would be undermined.</p>
<p>But the judge rejected his concerns.</p>
