<p>Ireland's centre-right Fianna Fail party was heading for a narrow and possibly inconclusive win over Prime Minister John Bruton's government when counting began from Friday's voting, an exit poll showed on Saturday.</p>
<p>The survey, the first of its kind carried out at an Irish election, showed that Bertie Ahern's party would win 44 percent of votes and that its Progressive Democrats ally would garner four per cent.</p>
<p>If the results were confirmed by the official count, it would make Ahern the kingmaker in the 166-seat Irish parliament but might leave his party needing the support of a third party to have a clear majority.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Bertie Ahern is poised to became Taoiseach (Prime Minister) and to head a Fianna Fail-led government into the new Dail (parliament),&quot; The Irish Times said.</p>
<p>It said that Bruton's three-party left-right coalition, known as the Rainbow because of its political mix, stood no chance of getting back into power.</p>
<p>&quot;The outgoing Rainbow government has no chance of being reelected, even it were to coalesce with the Green party to form a four-party coalition,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>If the result were confirmed, it would confirm a 30-year trend in Irish electoral history in which no sitting government has been returned to office.</p>
<p>Ireland votes using proportional representation which allows voters to list all candidates in order of preference. The method leads to a long count, which may well last until midday on Sunday, electoral officials said.</p>
<p>The poll showed that Bruton's Christian Democrat Fine Gael would win 27 percent of the vote, its Labour party ally eight per cent and the small Democratic Left three percent.</p>
<p>The big loser appeared to be the Labour party of Dick Spring, which pulled out of coalition with Fianna Fail at the end of 1994 and threw its support behind Bruton.</p>
<p>In 1992 elections Labour won a record 19.31 percent of the poll but its share in the 1997 election would appear to spell the end of the international career of Spring, one of Ireland's best-known figures.</p>
<p>Labour held 32 seats in the outgoing parliament but opinion polls say this could be slashed to 20 because of a backlash against Spring for ditching Fianna Fail.</p>
<p>Spring helped build, shape and pursue an Anglo-Irish peace initiative for Northern Ireland in partnership with Britain and, as Foreign Minister, was vocal in defending the rights of small nations during Ireland's six-month tenure of the EU presidency.</p>
<p>Irish financial markets say an inconclusive result to the election is the one they fear most because any period of uncertainty could unsettle trading and put a brief question mark over one of Europe's most succesful economies.</p>
<p>Among small parties that Fianna Fail might have to court to secure a majority are the Green party, which has one member of parliament at present but fielded more than 20 candidates.</p>
<p>Others include two anti-abortion so-called &quot;Family Value&quot; parties and Sinn Fein, the political wing of Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas fighting British rule of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>But both of the rival coalitions have ruled out any electoral deal with Sinn Fein because of continuing IRA violence. Most mainstream Irish political parties have frozen contact with the party altogether.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein is tipped to win and take its first seat in the Irish parliament in modern history if its candidate in Monaghan/Cavan, Caoimghin O'Caolain is returned.</p>
