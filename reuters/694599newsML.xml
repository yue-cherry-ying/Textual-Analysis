<p>A weeklong U.N. Earth Summit ended early on Saturday with its chairman delivering the verdict: &quot;Our words have not been matched by deeds.&quot;</p>
<p>Razali Ismail, the blunt Malaysian U.N. General Assembly president, called the results of the session attended by dozens of presidents and prime ministers &quot;sobering&quot; but &quot;honest&quot; in not attempting to gloss over failures.</p>
<p>He accused the more than 170 participating nations of lacking the &quot;political will to tackle criticial issues&quot; set out at a landmark 1992 environment summit in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>But he said there was widespread recognition that abject poverty affecting 1.3 billion people had to be eradicated if the world was to make economic and ecological progress.</p>
<p>And, he said, &quot;we have advanced our understanding on the need for action on fresh water, forests, climate change and energy&quot; policies.</p>
<p>Delegates made no firm commitments on greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate changes or on providing more aid to developing countries so they would not follow the polluting paths of wealthier industrialised nations.</p>
<p>Prospects, however, were good for new agreements on protecting fresh water in separate negotiations after the conference ended. On protecting forests, the session put off until 2000 a decision on whether to negotiate a treaty, pushed by Europe, Canada, Malaysia and Russia but opposed by the United States and Brazil.</p>
<p>Echoing Razali's words, Tanzania's U.N. ambassador, Daudi Ngelautwa Mwakawago, representing Third World states, told the meeting: &quot;The world is crying for positive answers. This session has not provided them.&quot;</p>
<p>Most industrial countries pledged at Rio to increase foreign aid to 0.7 percent of their gross national product, a goal on the U.N. agenda since 1972. Only Scandanavian countries and the Netherlands have ever achieved this goal. Elsewhere aid has fallen to below 0.3 percent, with the United States registering the sharpest drop in the last few years.</p>
<p>After five days of speechmaking, the conference's main committee completed its work in a lighthearted atmosphere as a blizzard of amendments was gavelled into acceptance.</p>
<p>The paper patchwork was then stitched together and passed on to the General Assembly's plenary, which adopted it shortly after 1 a.m. EDT (0500 GMT).</p>
<p>The final summit document, however, failed to include a political statement of intent because governments could not agree on one.</p>
<p>Instead a more general, shorter preamble was attached to the voluminous final document reaffirming the lofty principles set forth in Rio that enshrined the concept of &quot;sustainable development&quot; -- economic growth compatible with social justice and ecological safety.</p>
<p>While acknowledging a number of positive achievements since Rio, the text said: &quot;We are deeply concerned that the overall trends for sustainable development are worse today than they were in 1992.&quot;</p>
<p>Although delegates were encouraged by slower population growth, rising health standards and food production, the gains are being overshadowed by dwindling forests, farmlands and fish stocks, and pockets of severe poverty.</p>
<p>As expected, a major battle will take place before agreements on global warming are reached among industrial states meeting in Kyoto, Japan, in December.</p>
<p>Saturday's document speaks of &quot;widespread but not universal agreement&quot; on considering &quot;legally binding, meaningful, realistic and equitable targets (that) will result in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions within specified time frames, such as 2005, 2010 and 2020.&quot;</p>
<p>The European Union wanted specific goals now, which the United States, Japan, Canada and Australia rejected.</p>
<p>President Clinton in a Thursday night speech dwelt at length on the hazards of global warming and promised to educate the American people on the need to reduce use of energy and the dangers of carbon emissions.</p>
<p>He admitted the United States was the world's largest polluter, but he set no new targets.</p>
