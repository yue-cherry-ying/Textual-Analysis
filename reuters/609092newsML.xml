<p>Malaysia's Tan Chong Motor Holdings Bhd has undertaken a major restructuring exercise to streamline its operations and give investors a direct stake in its various units, its managing director said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to restructure to look at new ways of doing things. You must be continuously improving,&quot; Tan Eng Soon told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Under the proposed restructuring, the asset-rich firm will spin off its auto parts, non-motor and foreign operations divisions, retaining only the Malaysian motor unit.</p>
<p>The Malaysian auto parts division will be spun off as APM Holdings Bhd and the non-motor business as TC Corp Bhd. The overseas operations, which sell Nissan cars and own properties, will be spun off as Tan Chong International Ltd.</p>
<p>APM Holdings and TC Corp are to be listed on the Kuala Lumpur exchange and Tan Chong International on the Hong Kong bourse.</p>
<p>&quot;We are giving shareholders a direct participation in the operating units...the business now is quite widespread,&quot; Tan said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you like the Malaysia operations but not the others, now you can't sell. So I give you an option (with the demerger).&quot;</p>
<p>Tan Chong Motor assembles and sells the vehicles of Japanese firm Nissan in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong. It sells Nissan and Subaru vehicles in Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In Malaysia, it produces about 2,000 vehicles a month.</p>
<p>The company also manufactures vehicle parts and is involved in property, and the trading of industrial equipment to Shiseido cosmetics.</p>
<p>Tan said he expects to get regulatory approval to split the operations later in the year and hopes to list the three units by the year's end.</p>
<p>Analysts said the restructuring would help to unleash the value of the various divisions, especially APM Holdings, one of Malaysia's largest automotive component manufacturers.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the restructuring is good for shareholders because the earnings of Tan Chong Motor are not going anywhere,&quot; said MBf Northern Securities analyst Azizah Ahmad. &quot;By splitting them up, APM (Holdings) valuation will be higher,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The company posted net earnings of 259.8 million ringgit ($103.9 million) for the year ended December 31, 1996, a sharp gain over 1995's 135.2 million.</p>
<p>Company officials said they plan to double output of the firm's three popular Nissan vehicles in Malaysia to a total of 1,400 units a month by the end of this year. The models, which were launched last year, were the Nissan Cefiro saloon, the Serena and the Terrano four-wheel drive.</p>
