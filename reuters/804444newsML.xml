<p>The affair of Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed took a bizarre new twist on Sunday when British newspapers reported that the Harrods store heir had been dogged by a double.</p>
<p>Former merchant seaman Mohamed Sead was said to have been seducing beautiful women and running up huge bills while posing as fellow Egyptian Al Fayed.</p>
<p>The fake Al Fayed offered film parts to Jodie Foster and Brooke Shields and on one occasion booked 23 rooms at the Miami Fontainebleau Hilton hotel -- plus five for luggage and four for security guards -- in the real Al Fayed's name, The Sunday Times reported.</p>
<p>Sead is now in jail in Canada, having been sentenced to a two-year term for impersonation, according to British newspapers.</p>
<p>In a court affidavit, Al Fayed said: &quot;By impersonating me, Sead has caused immeasurable damage to my good name, my reputation, my family and Harrods as well as causing potential commercial damage to my business interests.&quot;</p>
<p>British media have indulged in frenzied speculation about a new romance for Diana, who was last year divorced from heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, and Al Fayed, a 41-year-old playboy film producer whose father, Mohamed Al Fayed, owns London's famous Harrods department store.</p>
<p>But the course of true love, if that was what could be inferred from fuzzy photographs apparently showing Diana, 36, and Al Fayed kissing aboard his father's luxury yacht, has not run entirely smoothly.</p>
<p>Al Fayed's former girlfriend, model Kelly Fisher, claimed he made love to her by night while romancing Diana by day.</p>
<p>In Britain's top-selling Sunday newspaper the News of the World, the 30-year-old American alleged the Egyptian playboy shuttled between her and Diana on a recent Mediterranean holiday.</p>
<p>Fisher said Al Fayed told her he wanted her to have his baby during passionate moments on a yacht across the bay from the yacht where the princess was staying.</p>
<p>&quot;I was blissfully unaware that the man trying to father my child was setting his sights on Diana,&quot; Fisher, who now plans to sue Al Fayed for breach of promise, was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Fisher told the newspaper that on the mornings after their lovemaking, Al Fayed would disappear.</p>
<p>&quot;He'd reappear more than four or five hours later without explanation -- other than that his father needed him. I now know that it was at that time he was romancing Diana,&quot; Fisher said.</p>
<p>&quot;He did not want to end it with me, nor had he any intention of giving up whatever he has with the Princess of Wales. The truth is he wanted us both,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;I was to be his secret sexual relationship -- I believe it is called his 'bit on the side'. It was absolutely repugnant to me.&quot;</p>
<p>But doubt was cast on Fisher's side of the story by Al Fayed's first wife, Suzanne Gregard, who was married to him for eight months in 1986.</p>
<p>Gregard, 37, told the Sunday Mirror newspaper that Fisher had broken off her relationship with Al Fayed before he started seeing Diana.</p>
<p>&quot;Kelly told me, 'I've broken up with him, I've had enough',&quot; Gregard said.</p>
<p>Al Fayed denies he promised to marry Fisher and The People newspaper said he had pledged his love to Diana by vowing to give up all his other women for her.</p>
<p>Diana flew to Greece on Saturday with a female friend, Rosa Monckton, who runs the London branch of the jeweller Tiffany, for her third Mediterranean holiday in two months.</p>
<p>Her two sons, Princes William and Harry, are with their father on the royal family's Balmoral estate in Scotland.</p>
