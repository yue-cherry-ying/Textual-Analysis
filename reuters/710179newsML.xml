<p>Concerns over trade practices of Korean automakers in growth markets like eastern Europe will top the agenda of lobbyists for European and U.S. automakers in upcoming meetings with their Korean counterparts.</p>
<p>&quot;We have communications that a lot of investments in eastern Europe by Korean automakers are not based on their country's international trade agreements,&quot; Heinz Handtrack, director of trade and economics at the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The association, known by its French acronym ACEA, and the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA) will meet in Seoul on July 15-16 with the Korean Automobile Manufacturers Association, Korean government officials and vehicle importers, Handtrack said.</p>
<p>Since 1994, Korean automakers have announced plans to multiply their manufacturing capacity by investing billions of dollars around the world, but AAMA and ACEA say they want to know how the Koreans are paying for their projects.</p>
<p>&quot;Korean automakers are not making big profits,&quot; Handtrack said. &quot;If you look at their overseas investment plans, if you look at their sales and possible profits from these ventures, then the question immediately arises -- where is the money?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have spent some months in Korea, and I never knew where the money was coming from,&quot; added Handtrack, referring to his work in 1991 for Mercedes-Benz AG to supply engines to Korean automaker Ssangyong Motor Co.</p>
<p>At the meetings, AAMA and ACEA also plan to discuss Korea's &quot;frugality campaign&quot; to discourage consumer demand for imported goods, such as cars, Handtrack said.</p>
<p>And partnerships between Korean automakers and foreign governments to build &quot;national cars&quot;, such as Kia Motors Corp's involvement in Indonesia, also are important issues, he added.</p>
<p>The European Commission already has acted on Korean investments in eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Most notably, a commission review of an agreement between Daewoo Group and Poland led to tougher conditions on the company's ability to import duty-free 110,000 almost-finished cars to avoid Poland's high customs levies on completely built vehicles, Handtrack said.</p>
<p>&quot;These cars were shipped completely-built from Korea to Slovenia, where some parts were dismantled for re-assembly in Poland,&quot; Handtrack added. &quot;It was a Mickey Mouse operation to re-assemble the cars -- it took some minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>Daewoo was forced to increase the number of parts it disassembled from any cars that it wants to bring duty-free into Poland, but the commission continues to examine the company's investments in Poland, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is still an issue for discussion,&quot; Handtrack said.</p>
<p>ACEA and AAMA want to avoid a trade war with Korea, but they may pressure their goverments to pursue sanctions through international organisations like the World Trade Organisation (WTO) if their concerns are not allayed, officials from both associations said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are carefully examining the possibility of seeking action through the WTO,&quot; ACEA spokesperson James Rosenstein told Reuters. &quot;We remain vigilant to find out what's going on.&quot;</p>
