<p>Taiwan's central bank, reacting as money rates bubbled ever higher, said it would inject funds into the banking system on Saturday.</p>
<p>A central bank official said the bank would execute open market operations on Saturday through repurchase of negotiable certificates of deposit offered by interested financial institutions.</p>
<p>The institutions have the option of repurchasing the NCDs within six days, the official said.  </p>
<p>The central bank said interested financial institutions should contact the bank directly.</p>
<p>Bids would close at 10:00 a.m. (0200 GMT).</p>
<p>Funds would be released according to actual demand, the central bank said.  </p>
<p>Taiwan's interbank rate roared into double digits to a record high close on Friday, creating tight liquidity in the banking system as funds continued to stream out of banks into the red-hot stock market.</p>
<p>The overnight interbank rate, capping a 10-session ascent, closed at 10.541 percent against Thursday's 8.597 finish -- roughly double the central bank's 5.0-5.5 percent target zone.</p>
<p>It was the rate's highest close since official recordings began on September 1, 1991. The central bank said it would continue to watch closely the banking system's liquidity flow.</p>
