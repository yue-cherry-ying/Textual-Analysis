<p>The head of Ivory Coast's forestry agency SODEFOR denied in an interview published on Wednesday that the World Bank had suspended its funding of SODEFOR operations.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to assure you that there is no threat of withholding funds coming from the World Bank,&quot; Jean-Claude Anoh told the government daily, Fraternite-Matin.</p>
<p>&quot;The last project financed by the World Bank covered the period 1990-1996, and it ended exactly on June 30, 1996,&quot; Anoh said, adding a second project had been planned to follow immediately but talks on the best way to implement it had taken time.</p>
<p>Donor sources have said funds have been withheld, partly because the agency has failed to halt illegal tree-felling in protected forests, and partly because it has failed to meet wood production targets while replanting to preserve stocks.</p>
<p>Anoh added that negotiations between the two sides should help the new projects get off the ground soon.</p>
<p>However, donors are demanding restructuring, which will involve a loss of jobs.</p>
<p>The agency intends to cut back its operations with the loss of around 350 jobs. It believes that will enable it to finance with its own funds an annual reforestation objective of 2,000 hectares.</p>
<p>Currently, SODEFOR's operations are 70 percent-funded by aid donors and 30 percent by Ivorian government money.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast, whose total forest area has dropped to 3.9 million hectares (9.6 million acres) today from 12 million hectares (29.7 million acres) in 1957 decided last March to flush illegal cocoa and coffee planters from protected forests.</p>
<p>Donors have seen in these measures a sign of goodwill from the authorities though no timetable has been set for destroying illegal plantations, relocating farmers and reforesting the land.</p>
