<p>Fashion designers will be allowed to continue using the world's finest thread, from the vicuna, but environmental groups want to curb poaching of the animal.</p>
<p>Vicuna -- prized by many designers as the thinnest and smoothest natural fibre -- has been debated quietly and calmly at a conference on endangered species otherwise dominated by heated argument over ivory.</p>
<p>Wool from the vicuna, a member of the llama family which is found in South America, is many times thinner than human hair and a skirt made from it can cost upwards of $2,000.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no problem in the current trade...but we are anxious to ensure that any expansion will also be done in a sustainable way,&quot; said Arthur Lindley, of Britain's Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA).</p>
<p>Up until 1994 wild vicunas in Peru and Chile were trapped, sheared and released back into the bush. The wool had to be woven and clearly marked before export.</p>
<p>But the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) then gave Peru permission to export raw wool with no identifying marks.</p>
<p>&quot;Since then, there is considerable evidence of increased poaching because they (poachers) are able to trade it illegally,&quot; Lindley said.</p>
<p>Farmers who lived off the vicuna had an interest in ensuring sustainable stocks, but poachers were more likely to kill the animals before shearing them.</p>
<p>Argentina, Bolivia and Peru have proposed that the CITES meeting in Harare allow expanded trade to include not just raw and woven wool but also handicrafts.</p>
<p>&quot;Our concern is over the difficulty of control in trading raw wool. Our most serious concern is that we should cut out illegal trade,&quot; Lindley said.</p>
<p>&quot;But in principle we believe trade in live animals is a sustainable and very good business. The animals are sheared live and the mortality level is very low indeed.&quot;</p>
<p>Peru's vicuna population is estimated at 75,000. Argentina, counts around 32,000, Bolivia 33,000 and Chile 19,000.</p>
<p>The four exporting countries say they are open to suggestions on controlling the trade, but insist they already have tight anti-poaching measures in place.</p>
<p>The proposals will be put to the vote at the CITES conference next week.</p>
