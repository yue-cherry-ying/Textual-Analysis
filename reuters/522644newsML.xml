<p>Aid workers returned to Rwandan Hutu refugee camps south of the Zairean rebel-held city of Kisangani on Saturday, a day after protesters blocked their way and attacked aid vehicles.</p>
<p>Rebel soldiers secured the jungle road to Biaro and Kasese camps under an agreement with the United Nations. Torrential rain cleared the streets.</p>
<p>&quot;The military commander came this morning and told us not to protest but to talk to the governor,&quot; Kisangani resident Jean-Paul Niyongesa told Reuters.</p>
<p>Hundreds of angry Zaireans attacked aid vehicles trying to leave a Zaire river ferry to reach the camps on Friday, protesting against the presence of the refugees.</p>
<p>Witnesses said some aid workers were held for over an hour. The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said it was temporarily suspending its operations.</p>
<p>The incident was a setback for the UNHCR which was forced to delay indefinitely a plan to start repatriating around 100,000 refugees by air to Rwanda after pressure from regional authorities.</p>
<p>Rebel governor of Upper Zaire region Yagi Sitolo refused permission to start repatriations, saying that a cholera outbreak at Kasese camp 25 km (16 miles) south of the city would threaten the local population if refugees were brought to Kisangani airport.</p>
<p>The governor also said too much money was being spent on refugees at the expense of the impoverished local population.</p>
<p>U.N. medical officers say a limited operation to repatriate healthy refugees poses no threat to Kisangani residents.</p>
<p>&quot;Today (Saturday) there will be a letter written to local authorities deploring what has happened and pointing out what is being done for the local population,&quot; said UNHCR regional spokesman Paul Stromberg.</p>
<p>At least 13 refugees died of cholera on Friday at Kasese, the latest victims of the outbreak that started after the exhausted and malnourished refugees arrived south of Kisangani after a five-month trek through the jungle.</p>
<p>Demonstrators at Friday's protest told Reuters the refugees should move deeper into the jungle away from Kisangani, Zaire's third city.</p>
<p>Tensions were whipped up by local radio broadcasts against the refugees and unconfirmed reports in the city that refugees had killed a rebel or several local Zaireans.</p>
<p>Aid workers said they suspected the Tutsi-dominated rebels were inciting, or at least did not stop, unrest to block the airlift.</p>
<p>Stromberg said rebel authorities in Goma on the Rwandan border on Friday requisitioned 60,000 litres of aircraft fuel due to be used for the refugee airlift. Rebel officials gave no explanation.</p>
<p>The refugees are the rump of more than two million Hutus who fled Rwanda in 1994 after the victory of Tutsi rebels in the civil war and the genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and Hutu moderates.</p>
<p>The refugees are in a very poor state after trekking 600 km (375 miles) since last October through jungle where they survived on grubs and tree-bark. They marched westwards to flee the Zairean rebels, supported by Rwanda's government.</p>
<p>Rebels of Laurent Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) seized Kisangani on March 15 and control nearly half of Zaire in a six-month-old campaign to oust ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
