<headline>BCCI liquidator wins round in fight for victims.</headline>

<p>Victims of the biggest banking fraud in history won a symbolic victory in a British court on Friday, but the six-year battle to recoup their losses is far from over.</p>
<p>The liquidators of Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) won an order for 2.94 million pounds ($4.8 million) against former shipping tycoon Abbas Gokal, who earlier this month was sentenced to 14 years in prison for his part in the BCCI fraud.</p>
<p>BCCI collapsed in 1991 with total debts of more than $12 billion after evidence emerged of widespread money laundering. Thousands of people lost their savings as a result of its demise.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very pleased by the compensation order the court made this morning. However, Abbas Gokal caused significant damage to BCCI and its creditors and we will continue to pursue his assets worldwide,&quot; liquidator Christopher Morris of accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche told Reuters.</p>
<p>If Gokal does not pay, he faces an extra three years in prison.</p>
<p>But Gokal is just one of the potential sources of compensation to the victims of the BCCI fraud. Morris said the liquidators have actions outstanding against BCCI's auditors Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Young, as well as the Bank of England and Gokal's Gulf shipping group.</p>
<p>The liquidators are claiming $3.5 billion plus interest against Price Waterhouse, $1.6 billion plus interest against Ernst &amp; Young and 550 million pounds ($898 million) from the Bank of England, which regulated the British-based operations of BCCI.</p>
<p>Depositors have already received a 24.5 percent dividend, more than $2.0 billion in total, and Morris is confident the liquidators will make another payment of not less than 10 percent at the end of this year or the beginning of 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;It won't be the last, there will be at least one more,&quot; Morris said.</p>
<p>Some initial expectations of how much the BCCI depositors would get back were as low as 25 percent, although this has risen over time. An average payout in liquidations is around five percent.</p>
<p>The law requires that any claim is made within six years and this is likely to spark a flurry of last minute activity to ensure that every avenue to recoup money can be pursued in the future.</p>
<p>Morris said co-operation between the authorities around the world on BCCI had been largely good, but he singled out the U.S. and Britain's Serious Fraud Office and DTI for particular praise.</p>
<p>But despite this, he admitted that an ultimate resolution to the liquidation would be some way off.</p>
<p>&quot;I shall probably be retired before that day arrives,&quot; 55-year-old Morris said.</p>
