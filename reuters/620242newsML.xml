<p>Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, still suffering from a 1995 stroke, often appears unwell when meeting visitors and leaves the daily affairs of the kingdom to his crown prince and defence minister, top diplomats in Riyadh said.</p>
<p>&quot;The king is not in good health,&quot; one diplomat told Reuters, echoing comments made to Reuters in the last few days by other senior diplomats based in Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and exporter.</p>
<p>&quot;Last week he received 24 ambassadors for accreditation and he wasn't his old self,&quot; the diplomat added.</p>
<p>The diplomats said the ambassadors who over two days presented their credentials to King Fahd, 75, reported he was frail, unfocused and had a very limited attention span.</p>
<p>They said his remarks were punctuated by long, awkward pauses and absence of mind. He also no longer gave his traditional long monologue about life in the kingdom, with which he used to greet all new ambassadors, they said.</p>
<p>The diplomats said the king had good days when he appeared to be well, but added his condition changed daily.</p>
<p>&quot;He has his moments, sometimes he is good, sometimes he is out of it,&quot; one diplomat said.</p>
<p>The diplomats said succession appeared to be clear in the kingdom, with the king's half-brother Prince Abdullah, 73, and his full brother Defence Minister Prince Sultan next in line to the throne.</p>
<p>They said Abdullah's smooth transition to temporary rule after King Fahd's stroke put Saudis and foreign governments at ease.</p>
<p>An orderly transfer of power in Saudi Arabia, the Gulf's economic and political heavyweight, is widely considered important to stability in the region which sits on 45 percent of the world's oil reserves.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no battle for succession among the top two figures in the country, Crown Prince Abdullah and Prince Sultan,&quot; a diplomat said.</p>
<p>King Fahd's health has been a cause of concern for several years. A stroke in November 1995 put him in hospital for a few days and in early 1996 he handed over the affairs of state to Crown Prince Abdullah. He re-assumed power seven weeks later.</p>
<p>The king, overweight and diabetic, has long used a walking stick to relieve discomfort from an arthritic knee.</p>
<p>The king, in power since 1982, often chairs the cabinet's weekly meetings which are carried on state television.</p>
<p>The diplomats said his condition made decision-making difficult, as final authority still rested with the monarch.</p>
<p>&quot;Crown Prince Abdullah and Prince Sultan are doing the day-to-day running of things just fine, but the big decisions still rest with the king,&quot; one diplomat said.</p>
<p>&quot;Abdullah and Sultan do all the work,&quot; another said. &quot;No one dares tell (the king) he should step down. This is part of the way the system works here. But because King Fahd is still officially in charge, this leads to stagnation.&quot;</p>
<p>Other diplomats said one question that remained was who would replace Prince Sultan as number three.</p>
<p>&quot;The only issue is who would take Sultan's place...Prince Nayef is next in terms of pecking order, but Prince Salman is also in serious consideration,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Prince Nayef is the kingdom's interior minister, but diplomats said he was not as popular as Prince Salman, the powerful governor of Riyadh. Both are also sons of the late founder of Saudi Arabia, King Abdul-Aziz al-Saud.</p>
<p>&quot;Salman is popular. He heads a number of foundations, is active in giving grants to the Palestinians and Bosnia. He has a high profile,&quot; he said. &quot;He is much more than just a regional prince. He is a man on the rise.&quot;</p>
