<p>An explosion at a chemical plant in northeast Arkansas Thursday released toxic gases into the air and forced the evacuation of a nearby hospital, emergency officials said.</p>
<p>Firefighters had flames under control at the BPS Co. chemical plant in West Helena, and there were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries from the blast, officials said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We understand the fire is now under control, but officials there are asking people to remain out of the area,&quot; said Francis Huddleston, an Arkansas Office of Emergency Services spokesperson.</p>
<p>The explosion released an &quot;unknown quantity of toxic gas,&quot; Huddleston said.</p>
<p>Patients from Helena Regional Hospital were evacuated to a nearby community college as a precaution after the early afternoon blast, Huddleston said.</p>
<p>The explosion rocked the manufacturing and farming community located along the Mississippi River near the tri-state border with Tennessee and Mississippi, Huddleston said.</p>
