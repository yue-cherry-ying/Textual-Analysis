<p>Bankers Trust New Zealand announced an 11 percent rise in the bank's after-tax profit for the year to December to NZ$26.7 million, the New Zealand Press Association reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The bank, a unit of Bankers Trust NY Corp, said growth of its fund management business had been important for its growth in 1996.</p>
<p>The bank's result was achieved on a 7 percent rise in operating revenues to $80.8 million, but operating expenses were up 15.5 percent at $33.51 million.  </p>
<p>At balance date the bank had total assets of $4.3 billion, from $2.16 billion a year ago, and for the seventh consecutive year had neither written any debts off, nor made any provision for doubtful debts, Chief Executive Gavin Walker said.</p>
<p>At balance date shareholders' funds were worth $183 million from $161 million a year ago.</p>
<p>The biggest changes in the bank's balance sheet were a $1.8 billion increase in debts from related parties to $1.917 billion, and a $1.03 billion rise in deposits to $2.14 billion.  </p>
<p>Cash and money-market placements were up at $535 million from $31.23 million, as were fixed assets at $8.08 million from $1.95 million. Trading securities were down at $291 million from $859 million.</p>
<p>Trading securities Bankers Trust was liable for increased to $281 million from $4 million, while debts to related parties were up at $1.37 billion from $725 million.</p>
<p>The bank's total capital adequacy was 20.67 percent, 2.6 times that required by the Reserve Bank.</p>
