<headline>IPE gas oil closes firmer after NYMEX leads rally.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE gas oil futures closed firmer on Thursday tracking a surge in NYMEX crude and products futures.</p>
<p>May gas oil ended $1.50 a tonne higher at $169.00, having traded at a session high of $170.00.</p>
<p>&quot;We dipped off with New York and with the crude, gas oil was just following the others today,&quot; a broker said.</p>
<p>NYMEX unleaded gasoline spear-headed the rally which took NYMEX crude through key resistance at $19.90 a barrel and important psychological resistance at $20.00.</p>
<p>There was talk that operational snags at two U.S. Gulf Coast refineries had shut in gasoline production, but this could not be immediately confirmed.</p>
<p>The the market edged off earlier highs and some traders said that it was vulnerable to further losses.</p>
<p>June Brent was trading 43 cents up at $18.59 a barrel, having touched a session high of $18.63.</p>
<p>Dealers said that the market regarded news that OPEC was likely to leave it output celing unchanged as fairly neutral.</p>
<p>&quot;It's overproduction that is the key issue,&quot; said one broker.</p>
<p>OPEC President Libyan Oil Minister Abdullah Salem al-Badri told Reuters on Thursday that he expected to group to stick with its 25.03 million barrels per day (bpd) output quota when it meets in June.</p>
<p>Seven OPEC oil ministers have scheduled talks in Isfahan in Iran for Thursday to discuss quota violations which have helped knock $7 a barrel off oil prices since the start of the year.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey on Thursday estimated OPEC's April output at 27.05 million bpd.</p>
