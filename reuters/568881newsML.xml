<title>UK: Copper price forecasts revised up for 1997 - Billiton.</title>

<p>An expected build of copper surpluses from new production capacity coming on stream has been delayed, and price forecasts for 1997 have been revised higher, brokers Billiton said in a report issued on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;For the moment confusion reigns, as a combination of nearby tightness, chart-based trading and uncertainty about the near term fundamentals push prices this way and that,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The timing and volume of Chinese buying in coming months remains a key deciding factor in the market, and low LME stocks mean the market will be vulnerable to further squeezes.</p>
<p>Also critical is the economic outlook for the major economies. Slower-than-expected growth could result in lower demand and faster acculmulation of stocks.</p>
<p>Aluminium price forecasts were also revised higher due to a stronger than expected rebound from last October's lows.</p>
<p>&quot;Fundamental developments have been supportive, in that consumer restocking has resulted in a sustained drawdown in stocks, but production is rising steadily and we are forecasting a market in rough balance for the year as a whole,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Zinc prices were also seen higher than previously thought, due in part to positive sentiment emerging sooner than expected in the the form of interest from investment funds.</p>
<p>Lead prices, by contrast, were revised lower, because a drawdown expected over the winter failed to materialise.</p>
<p>&quot;However, assuming an at least reasonable replacement battery season this year, coupled with the improved economic environment, we are looking for slightly better demand growth this year, followed by a more modest increase in 1998,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tin forecasts were also turned down, due to a decline in demand last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The best we can hope for is a slight rebound this year and next, but at the same time production will be rising more quickly. Thus we look for surpluses bringing further downward pressure on prices,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Nickel forecasts remain unchanged, although possible supply disruptions at Russia's Norilsk Nickel remain a market factor. Average annual prices (LME cash, U.S. cents/lb)</p>
