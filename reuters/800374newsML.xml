<p>Turkey has called on Kurdish separatist rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan to return to the country to do his military service or face losing his citizenship.</p>
<p>Ocalan, who has led a violent campaign by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) for Kurdish self-rule in Turkey since 1984, was among those listed in a government warning published in the official gazette on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The following people who do not reside in Turkey...and have not to this date completed their military service will be subject to the following ruling:</p>
<p>&quot;It is announced that if they do not come to Turkey and...apply to do their military service in three months, proceedings will be started to remove their Turkish citizenship,&quot; the announcement said.</p>
<p>Ocalan, who has been missing since 1980, is probably the most wanted man Turkey. He is alleged to reside in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in Lebanon.</p>
<p>If he returned to Turkey he would face multiple charges under the country's wide-ranging anti-terror laws including separatism, forming group threatening unity of the state, multiple killings and treason.</p>
<p>Ocalan ordered the PKK's first violent action 13 years ago this Friday, with an attack on two gendarmerie posts in the mainly Kurdish southeast.</p>
<p>Since then more than 26,000 people have been killed in conflict with Turkish security forces.</p>
<p>Turkish security officials said on Thursday they had killed 27 rebels in the last two days in fighting with PKK guerrillas in the southeastern Sirnak province. One soldier was killed in the fighting, they said.</p>
<p>Friday's anniversary is usually a time of heightened tension and increased security alerts throughout the country in fear of further attacks marking the day.</p>
