<p>China, the defending champions, clinched a place in the Sudirman Cup mixed team badminton final, but only after a tough clash against Indonesia on Friday, the Chinese edging home 3-2.</p>
<p>With Susi Susanti scoring a surprise win over world and All-England champion, Ye Zhaoying, the outcome eventually rested on the final women's doubles tie.</p>
<p>But, this time, there was never any hint of an upset as the Olympic champions Ge Fei and Gu Jun cruised to a 15-3 15-3 victory over Eliza and Rosiana Zelin.</p>
<p>In the final, China will meet the winner of the other semifinal between Denmark and South Korea being played on Friday evening.</p>
<p>China gained an early advantage with Liu Yong and Ge taking the mixed doubles in straight games, 18-15 15-13, against Limpele Flandy and Minarti Timur.</p>
<p>But the ever popular Susanti, one of the most successful ever woman players, set the match alight when she staged a thrilling fightback against Ye. The Chinese player comfortably took the opening game 11-6, but Susanti, the former world champion who has now dropped to number five in the world, sent the tie into a third end by taking the second 11-6.</p>
<p>The decider was totally one-sided with Susanti, who recently married the former Olympic Champion, Allan Budi Kusuma, in totally dominant form, while Ye crumbled dramatically under the pressure and failed to win a point in going down 11-6 6-11 11-0.</p>
<p>It was a win that raised Indonesia's hopes of reclaiming the title that had eluded them since the inaugural year of 1989 in Jakarta and helped set the stage for a dramatic climax.</p>
<p>China regained the advantage in the men's singles with All-England Champion Dong Jiong crushing veteran Ardy Wiranata 15-2 15-8, but Budiarto Sigit and Chandra Wijaya set-up the final tie decider with a 15-8 15-6 win over Liu and Sun Jun in the men's doubles.</p>
<p>&quot;We all played our best, but China are stronger overall and deserved the win,&quot; said Susanti. &quot;I was delighted with my own form and it gives me confidence for next week's individual championships.&quot;</p>
