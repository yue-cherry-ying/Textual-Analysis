<p>Future Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa insisted on Saturday that Chinese troops and armour sweeping in just after Britain's handover next week could not move against the local population without his order.</p>
<p>&quot;They will not, they cannot,&quot; he said in an interview with the U.S. television network NBC.</p>
<p>As the colonial legislature closed its doors with the declaration &quot;the King is dead, long live the King&quot;, Tung sought to calm anxieties sparked by news that 4,000 People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops would move into Hong Kong just six hours after China takes over the territory at midnight on Monday (1600 GMT).</p>
<p>&quot;I think the PLA presence in Hong Kong is a symbol of sovereignty. It is necessary to show that symbol of sovereignty,&quot; he told interviewer Tom Brokaw.</p>
<p>He praised the PLA as &quot;a very well disciplined people, a very well disciplined army&quot; and added that once Hong Kong people got to know them &quot;they will be part of our community&quot;.</p>
<p>International reaction has been muted to the planned arrival of the soldiers, spearheaded by a column of 21 armoured cars and backed by 400 other vehicles, six helicopters and a number of warships.</p>
<p>But the prospect of armoured vehicles rumbling through the streets of Hong Kong, igniting painful memories of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, sparked outrage among democracy activists in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Outgoing Governor Chris Patten blasted the move as &quot;a most appalling signal&quot;, not because China did have the right to post troops to the territory, but because of the timing of the deployment and the method.</p>
<p>The South China Morning Post quoted one military analyst as saying China might use the occassion to unveil its new anti-riot &quot;internal security vehicle&quot;, possibly mounted with machineguns.</p>
<p>There was a chance the PLA might roll out its even more lethal six-wheel, all-armour vehicle, also boasting infrared vision, Paul Beaver of Jane's Defence Information group, the respected British publication, was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>But while pro-democracy leaders condemned what they saw as PLA bullying, Hong Kong villagers along the border were planning to welcome the troops with flowers and a metal plaque saying &quot;an army with power and civilization&quot;.</p>
<p>At the end of a marathon 23-hour session of the Legislative Council, to be replaced by a Beijing-picked assembly, its president Andrew Wong declared: &quot;The King is dead, long live the King.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Life must go on in Hong Kong and it will,&quot; he said later.</p>
<p>Wong is one of 33 members of the 60-seat council who will join a Provisional Legislature that takes over when Hong Kong formally reverts to China, ending 156 years of colonial rule.</p>
<p>In his interview with NBC, Tung took a swipe at pro-democracy figures who plan to disrupt the investiture of the new legislature with protests. Nobody could spoil the party, he said, laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;If anybody feels they can achieve martyrdom they will be very disappointed,&quot; he said, without mentioning Martin Lee, the head of the Democratic Party planning the protest who is often accused by critics of having a martyr complex.</p>
<p>&quot;People really must behave themselves in accordance with the law,&quot; Tung said.</p>
<p>Barely-disguised friction between Patten's outgoing administration and Tung's incoming government threatened to spill into the end-of-empire party that Britain is throwing at sunset on the waterfront of Victoria Harbour.</p>
<p>Tung's office said he may have to miss the Hollywood-style extravaganza, complete with dragon dances, massed choirs and bagpipes -- and a farewell speech by Patten -- to greet arriving Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Li Peng.</p>
<p>But Tung's advisers portrayed the issue as a scheduling problem, not a snub.</p>
<p>The main ceremony at midnight features Britain's heir to the throne Prince Charles formally handing over control of Hong Kong to President Jiang.</p>
<p>The Royal Navy, which claimed Hong Kong for Britain in the Opium Wars, won the right to pull down the flag on the colony. The honour of lowering the Union Jack will go to Operation Mechanic Nick Tarrant of the ship HMS Chatham.</p>
