<title>HONG KONG: Hong Kong Governor's mansion to become guest house.</title>

<dateline>HONG KONG 1997-05-28</dateline>

<p>Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa, who refuses to move into the mansion occupied by generations of colonial governors because of bad &quot;fung shui&quot;, said on Wednesday he would remain in his flat.</p>
<p>Chinese house-hunters traditionally put great store in the principles of geomancy, or fung shui, an age-old belief that harmony with the elements ensures good fortune.</p>
<p>Government House, now occupied by Chris Patten, the 28th and last Governor of Hong Kong, would be converted into a state guesthouse and be used for entertaining by Tung, his principal officials and by local charities, his spokesman said.</p>
<p>Tung was also looking at making part of the mansion into a museum.</p>
<p>He has chosen not to take over Patten's offices in Government House and will move into the nearby civil service headquarters building instead.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Tung has decided to continue living in his existing apartment ... and not in Government House as he feels that it would be a more appropriate way to mark the beginning of a new era,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>But the taxpayer will foot the bill to lease the flat next door to Tung's and for alteration work to expand his living quarters.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, a British colony since 1841, reverts to China at midnight on June 30.</p>
