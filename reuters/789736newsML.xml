<p>China's Ministry of Finance has transferred its stakes in three major national securities firms to other companies to help boost the development of the securities industry, an official securities newspaper said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The ministry previously held a five percent stake or 50 million shares each in China Guotai Securities Co Ltd, China Southern Securities Co Ltd and China Securities Co Ltd, the China Securities newspaper said.</p>
<p>State industrial enterprise Huaqiao City Economic Development Co has taken over the stakes in Guotai and China Southern, the newspaper said. It gave no value for the transaction.</p>
<p>China Zhonglu (Group) Co, another state industrial enterprise, has taken over the stake in China Securities, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;This move will have enormous significance for encouraging the healthy development of China's securities markets,&quot; the newspaper quoted Gao Jian, director of the ministry's state debts administration, as saying.</p>
<p>China's State Council, or cabinet, ordered the transfer in a bid to separate the ministry from management of securities firms, and to encourage links between commercial and financial companies, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The three securities firms -- none of which are listed companies -- were set up in October 1992 with a registered capital of one billion yuan each, it said.</p>
<p>A number of state-owned commercial banks as well as the People's Insurance Company of China continue to hold stakes in the three securities firms, the newspaper said.</p>
