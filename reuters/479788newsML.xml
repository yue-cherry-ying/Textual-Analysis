<headline>IPE Brent retraces some losses but still sickly.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures retraced some losses on sporadic pre-market New York buying but remained firmly in the red ahead of the NYMEX opening on Tuesday, brokers said.</p>
<p>May Brent was 16 cents weaker at $19.22 a barrel at 1250 GMT, around 12 cents stronger than the mid-morning levels seen as the market caught up with Monday's U.S. sell-off.</p>
<p>June was 14 cents adrift at $19.35 a barrel.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a little bit of buying from New York,&quot; a broker said. &quot;But it tapered off as people realised the clocks had changed and they still had time to go before NYMEX opens.&quot;</p>
<p>British Summer Time began on Sunday, pushing the clocks ahead one hour from Greenwhich Mean Time.</p>
<p>Dealers saw support for Brent at around $19.08/$19.09, followed by $18.90.</p>
<p>April gas oil futures were unchanged at $166.75 a tonne.</p>
<p>Forecasts of colder U.S. weather were seen by some as slightly supportive to distillates.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll see what the U.S. makes of the snow they've had when they open up. With the volatility that we have seen recently this market can move very quickly without much behind it,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Independent forecasters Weather Services Corp said on Tuesday they saw temperatures in the key market of the northeastern U.S. eight to 14 degrees below normal on Wednesday, but rising to slightly above normal on Friday.</p>
<p>Shell Nigeria said its operations were returning to normal after local political disputes last week curbed output by as much as 210,000 barrels per day.</p>
<p>IPE dealers said this news was by now largely discounted by the market.</p>
<p>Physical Brent looked sickly too, and a cargo was traded on Monday at May Brent -96 cents, down from May -88 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Weekly U.S. inventory data was expected late on Tuesday and GNI said they expected crude, gasoline and distillate stocks all to be &quot;flat to a couple of million barrels lower.&quot;</p>
