<p>Several influential U.S. lawmakers on Thursday urged President Bill Clinton to make Ireland's peace process a top priority during his meeting with new British prime minister Tony Blair next week.</p>
<p>The co-chairmen of the Congressional Ad Hoc Committee for Irish Affairs, and the head of the Congressional Friends of Ireland, said they met with top Clinton administration officials on Thursday.</p>
<p>A senior National Security Council official at the meeting renewed the administration's commitment to positive engagement in the peace process, the Ad Hoc group said in a statement.</p>
<p>Clinton is due to meet Blair during next week's summit meeting with European leaders in The Hague.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the Irish caucus leaders said they reiterated their firm belief that &quot;the best hope for progress in Ireland rests with the United States continuing to play the role of honest broker in the conflict,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The congressional leaders agreed that an IRA ceasefire and the immediate start of all-party talks, free of any preconditions, should be the primary goal of all those working in support of the peace process.</p>
<p>The lawmakers also made a direct plea for relief in the cases of seven Irish nationals facing deportation from the United States, and urged the administration to foster support for the peace process with its action on these cases.</p>
<p>Participating in the meeting were Reps. Tom Manton, a New York Democrat, Ben Gilman, a New York Republican, Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Pete King, a New York Republican, all of the Ad Hoc Committee, and Representative James Walsh, a New York Republican, of Congressional Friends of Ireland.</p>
<p>Britain's new Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam set off for Washington on Thursday for two days of talks with members of Congress and senior members of the U.S. administration.</p>
<p>The new government has sought to breathe new life into the peace process this week by ordering the first talks between British officials and Sinn Fein since its military wing, the IRA, ended a ceasefire in February 1996.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein will not be allowed to join the talks when they resume on June 3 until the IRA calls a credible ceasefire.</p>
<p>Britain's efforts to set up talks involving Sinn Fein and Unionist groups were stymied last year by the Irish Republican Army's decision to end a 17-month ceasefire and resume a bombing and shooting war aimed at ending rule from London.</p>
