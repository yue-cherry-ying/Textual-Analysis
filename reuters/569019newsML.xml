<p>Albanian President Sali Berisha insisted on Thursday that &quot;rebel committees&quot; in the south of the Balkan state were an obstacle to holding free elections and he called on European monitors to go and look for themselves.</p>
<p>In a statement after meeting European envoy Franz Vranitzky, Berisha said that when the monitoring groups had reported back, all parties should declare a date for the elections.</p>
<p>The statement appeared to be a further obstacle in the way of early elections, agreed by all Albanian parties in March when a nine-party National Reconciliation government was set up to halt the slide to anarchy.</p>
<p>Vranitzky, a former Austrian chancellor now acting as envoy of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), made no comment after meeting Berisha. The two men were due to meet again for dinner.</p>
<p>It is the European envoy's third visit since widespread rioting over failed pyramid savings schemes broke out in February.</p>
<p>Berisha's statement made little reference to a dispute between his Democratic Party and the rest of the government over how many seats should be chosen by proportional representation in the election, due by the end of June.</p>
<p>Berisha said a new electoral law changing the form of voting had not been foreseen in the March 9 agreement setting up the national reconciliation government, but he said he would back open dialogue on the issue.</p>
<p>The parties have failed in five meetings to reach agreement on the law and interim Prime Minister Bashkim Fino has said the government will now adopt the new law by majority and pass it on to the Democrat-dominated parliament for approval.</p>
<p>Fino has said he will seek a vote of confidence from the parliament and has warned the government will resign if the electoral law is not passed.</p>
<p>Fino's Socialists pulled out of the May 1996 general election late on polling day alleging widespread fraud. The Democrats won 122 seats in the 140 seat parliament and international observers agreed voting was seriously flawed.</p>
<p>Fino has denied his Socialist party has anything to do with the salvation committees that Berisha called rebels, and says they should be disbanded after a date is set for the elections.</p>
<p>The influence of the committees, citizens' groups that sprung up in southern Albania to restore order after the riots, is on the wane in much of the region.</p>
<p>The groups themselves deny they have any political motives, other than the resignation of Berisha and the return of money lost in the funds.</p>
<p>But Berisha insisted that particularly in the towns of Vlore and Tepelene the committees were armed and were preventing political opponents from organising.</p>
<p>&quot;I can say that the rebel committees, the armed wing of the opposition, are against holding elections,&quot; he said in the statement.</p>
<p>&quot;To be proud of the support from such committees, led by bandits, smugglers and mafia...is an irresponsible attitude.&quot;</p>
<p>Vranitzky earlier met leaders of the political parties to try to resolve the deadlock over the electoral law.</p>
<p>&quot;Time is running short and so we are very serious about the fact that things need to happen now,&quot; Vranitzky's spokeswoman told reporters.</p>
<p>Vranitzky said shortly after he arrived on the three-day visit on Wednesday that he would convey to all Albanian political leaders &quot;the expectation of the international community that they find political consensus as far as the election is concerned&quot;.</p>
