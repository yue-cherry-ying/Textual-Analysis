<title>USA: NYMEX electricity seen steady to up on spot power.</title>
<headline>NYMEX electricity seen steady to up on spot power.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-08</dateline>

<p>NYMEX electricity futures were expected to open steady to higher Thursday on reports of strong physical power prices in the West in part due to generation outages, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Any news of any Western outages will likely push things higher,&quot; said one New York based futures trader.</p>
<p>In early over the counter discussion, June Palo Verde (PV) was pegged at $22.65-23.00, steady from Wednesday's June NYMEX futures settlement at $22.96 per megawatt hour (MWh).</p>
<p>Earlier Thursday, June PV had been set at $22.20-22.40 in over the counter talk, but a pop up in next-day physical Western power prices Thursday morning reversed the decline, sources said.</p>
<p>June California Oregon Border (COB) was talked at $16.60-16.75, up from a Tuesday NYMEX June settlement at $16.57 per MWh.</p>
<p>June COB had been set at $15.90-16.25 per MWh earlier Thursday, but jumped up with the PV contracts, the sources said.</p>
<p>Sources said electricity futures have been taking strength from robust physical power prices in the West, where cooling demand has been strong due to temperatures reaching over 100 degrees Fahrenheit in parts of Arizona.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, short-term physical prices rose on news of an unplanned outage at the 750 megawatt (MW) Four Corners power plant in Arizona, as well as a delay in restarting a 350 MW unit at the San Juan plant in New Mexico.</p>
<p>Sources said rumors of another unplanned outage in the West was putting more upward pressure on physical power prices and futures.</p>
<p>Close to 8,000 MW of generation remains off line in the West, for either refueling or maintenance, although many units were expected to return to service through the month.</p>
<p>June NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures opened down 3.3 cents at $2.32 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the Pacific Northwest were forecast to be seasonable and sunny Friday, then becoming more showery with mountain thunderstorms and a slight cooling trend over the weekend.</p>
<p>In the Southwest, weather in Arizona and southern California deserts were expected to be dry and seasonable hot into early next week.</p>
