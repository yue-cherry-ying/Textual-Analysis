<p>U.S. spot residual fuel prices, shrugging off a tumbling gas market, mostly gained again Thursday in thin trade, boosted by a sharp rally in crude and the prospects for better utility demand soon, sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuel looks pretty strong across the barrel. Crude rallied, and there are a few people looking but not in droves yet because there's no actual demand,&quot; said one cash trader, noting fairly mild East Coast temperatures this week.</p>
<p>In New York Harbor, physical one percent firmed 40-50 cents to $15.25 a barrel, with May paper done 35 cents higher at $15.60 on stronger crude, traders said.  </p>
<p>NYH June one percent paper sold at $16, steady to up slightly on the day. July paper was quoted at $16.15.</p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour notionally firmed more than a quarter to about $16, traders said.</p>
<p>New York high sulphurs scored smaller gains, with 2.2 percent up 20 cents to $14.50.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Gulf, three percent gained slightly to $14, while one percent also was modestly higher at $14.75.</p>
<p>No USG deals were reported.</p>
<p>New York city gate swing gas prices eased slightly Thursday to the high-$2.50s/mmBtu, or about $16.25 a barrel equivalent. Gas at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point, also was down slightly to the low-$2.30s/mmBtu, or $14.68 a barrel.</p>
