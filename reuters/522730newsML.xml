<p>Taiwan share prices closed slightly lower on Saturday with investors continuing to take profits amid cautious market sentiment, brokers said.</p>
<p>The weighted index ended down 24.28 points or 0.29 percent at 8,302.25. Turnover was a brisk T$93.48 billion in Saturday's shortened session.</p>
<p>The market, buoyed by expectations of continued economic recovery, has added a hefty 25 percent in 1997 alone by April 14. But it has eased by more than 300 points in its past five sessions.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was no further bearish news today, just that investors have turned cautious in general,&quot; said Joe Chiou, analyst for Taiwan Securities Investment.</p>
<p>The profit-taking spree was exacerbated by a government announcement on April 16 that it planned to speed up a selldown of equity in various listed state firms.</p>
<p>Saturday's loss came despite the heavily weighted financials launching a rebound of 1.34 percent.</p>
<p>Brokers expected the index to consolidate at current levels on Monday. A 8,250-8,350 range was seen.</p>
