<p>Swedish shares ended sharply lower on Tuesday, stung by recent U.S. weakness and climbing bond yields.</p>
<p>The exchange's general index dropped 4.34 percent to 2,631.23 in turnover of 4.87 billion crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems as if there was some selling from (bank) branches, while it has been quieter on the institutional side,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The downturn was broad and heavyweights drugs major Astra and telecoms group Ericsson were pulled along in the slump.</p>
<p>Astra plummeted 20 crowns to 344.5 and Ericsson dropped 12.5 crowns to 253.5.</p>
<p>Forestry group AssiDoman managed to withstand negative pressure and ended flat at 200 crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;It is somewhat strange that AssiDoman withstood pressure so well, but it could be that people think it is well positioned in the economic cycle with its sawn timber,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The bank sector dropped 4.21 percent with Nordbanken shedding eight crowns to land at 252 and S-E-Banken sliding 5.5 to 78.</p>
