<headline>NYCE cotton ends firmer, market seen weakening.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>NYCE cotton futures settled slightly higher on steady trade buying as prices consolidated losses and players awaited news on exports.</p>
<p>Expectations for at least 150,000 bales in exports in Thursday's report could support prices in the near term, but the market is seen weakening amid a dearth of bullish news.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't come up with a good reason for this market to go up,&quot; a dealer said. He added that May could fall into the 60.00-cent-per-lb range if exports fall below 150,000 bales.</p>
<p>Several traders noted widespread talk of business overnight after the market slid to life-of-contract lows Monday on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's first estimate of planted cotton acreage.</p>
<p>The USDA put 1997 planted area at 14.48 million acres compared to expectations that ranged from 13.7 million to 14.3 million acres.</p>
<p>Benchmark May closed up 0.35 cent at 71.70 cents per lb, having ranged from 71.85 to 71.35. The back months ended 0.28 higher to 0.28 lower.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 12,000 lots compared to Monday's official 17,751 lots.</p>
<p>The trade was cited on both sides of the market and the speculators noted as the major sellers, floor sources said. ((Suzanne Rostler, New York Commodity Desk, 212-859-1640))</p>
