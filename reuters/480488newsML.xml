<headline>Yuan closes up against US dollar in Shanghai.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Chinese yuan closed up but at an intraday low of 8.2955 on Tuesday from Monday's 8.2958 against the U.S. dollar in Shanghai after rising in the past two trading days, traders said.</p>
<p>The weighted average price on Monday was 8.2955.</p>
<p>Dealers said pro-yuan sentiment was strong, pushing the yuan up. But recent rises sapped momentum for further gains after the currency hit an intraday high of 8.2905 late in the session.</p>
<p>The yuan opened higher at 8.2953 and moved in a narrow range of 8.2951 and 8.2954 for most of the session, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Trading was dull with most done at 8.2953, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said optimism about the yuan's short-term upward trend was mainly because foreign banks have started local currency business in Shanghai, triggering expectations of increased yuan demand.</p>
<p>&quot;The yuan rose today on expectations of increased demand for the local currency now that the foreign banks have begin yuan business&quot;, said one dealer.</p>
<p>The Industrial Bank of Japan and the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp last Thursday became the first two foreign banks to do local currency business in China.  </p>
<p>&quot;After three days of rises, we're likely to see a technical correction on Wednesday,&quot; said a second dealer. &quot;The yuan is expected to move slightly down tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>The yuan closed up slightly at 6.6940 from 6.6761 against 100 Japanese yen on Tuesday and higher at an intraday high of 1.0705 from 1.0710 against the Hong Kong dollar.</p>
