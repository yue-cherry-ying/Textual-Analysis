<p>Former West German defence minister and one-time Bundestag President Kai-Uwe von Hassel collapsed and died at a political prize ceremony on Thursday, aged 84.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Aachen city authorities said the veteran politician collapsed shortly after entering the town hall to attend a ceremony in which German President Roman Herzog was due to be awarded Germany's prestigious Charlemagne prize.</p>
<p>Von Hassel, a member of Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU), was West German defence minister from 1963 to 1965 and president of the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) from 1969 to 1972.</p>
<p>After the Social Democrats (SPD) became the largest party in parliament in the 1972 elections, von Hassel remained a CDU deputy in the Bundestag until 1980 and focused on European politics.</p>
<p>He was a regular guest of honour at the annual ceremony for the Charlemagne prize, launched in 1950 and awarded for promoting European unity, the spokeswoman said.</p>
