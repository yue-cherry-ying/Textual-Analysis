<p>Japanese police have arrested a suspect in the brutal murder last month of a schoolboy that shocked the nation, domestic media reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The NHK television network and Kyodo news agency said the suspect was arrested in the city of Kobe in western Japan where the beheading of the 11-year-old boy took place on May 27.  </p>
<p>The reports said that the person under arrest was a teenager but gave no further information.</p>
<p>Police in Kobe refused to confirm the reports but said a news conference would be held later on Saturday.</p>
<p>The arrest comes soon after police sources said that the month-long investigation had yielded few clues on why the boy was beheaded with a note criticising Japan's educational system.</p>
<p>His head was found at the front gate of a junior high school, while his body was dumped near a television station.</p>
