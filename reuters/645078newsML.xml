<p>Australia's opening batsmen survived a demanding period of 18 overs before lunch as the tourists began their second innings with a deficit of 360 runs on the third day of the first test against England.</p>
<p>When rain stopped play five minutes before the interval, they were 51 for no wicket, with captain Mark Taylor on 29 and Matthew Elliott 22.</p>
<p>That score, together with a weather forecast of more rain later, provided some rare encouragment for the visitors, though it was tempered by the news that Mark Waugh might not be able to bat. He was taken to see a specialist before play began, complaining of stomach pains.</p>
<p>Elliott came close twice in three balls to giving Mark Butcher a catch at silly point off spinner Robert Croft, bowling his first over of the match.</p>
<p>The first went wide of Butcher's left hand and, although the second was caught, umpire Steve Bucknor turned down England's vociferous appeals, apparently because he judged the ball had come off the batsman's pad.</p>
<p>The ball appeared to be swinging a lot less for England's bowlers than it had done when they sent Australia packing for 118 in the first innings.</p>
<p>Earlier England had batted on for nine and half overs, losing three wickets in adding 29 to their overnight total of 449 for six.</p>
<p>Mark Ealham was not out on 53, emulating Nasser Hussain and Graham Thorpe in passing his previous highest test score.</p>
<p>Mike Kasprowicz deservedly picked up two more wickets, having Robert Croft (24) and Darren Gough (0) both caught behind. Those two catches for Ian Healy gave him six, a personal best in test cricket, equalling the record for an Ashes innings jointly held by Rodney Marsh (Australia) and Jack Russell (England).</p>
