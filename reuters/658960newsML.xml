<title>TURKMENISTAN: Caspian Sea gulf renamed after Turkmen president.</title>

<p>Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov, focus of a growing personality cult, has had a gulf on the country's Caspian Sea coast named after him, the official press said on Friday.</p>
<p>The official Watan daily said that after &quot;taking into account numerous appeals&quot; from workers and local authorities, Turkmenistan's parliament &quot;has decided to rename the Krasnovodsky Gulf...to be called in future the Turkmenbashi Gulf&quot;.</p>
<p>Niyazov is better known in the desert republic of four million as Turkmenbashi, or chief of the Turkmens. The port town of Krasnovodsk, situated on the gulf's shore, has already been renamed Turkmenbashi.</p>
<p>Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Niyazov, former Communist Party chief of the resource-rich republic, launched a personality cult in which his name has been given to schools, military units and towns.</p>
<p>His chubby countenance graces countless portraits across the capital Ashgabat.</p>
<p>Critics say the cult has taken on a surreal quality of late.</p>
<p>A German food company has started producing yoghurt at a milk factory near the Turkmen capital Ashgabat with Niyazov's face printed on each pack. A French-made aftershave called Turkmenbashi sells for $40 a bottle.</p>
<p>The government has also announced plans to build a 70-metre (230-foot) tower next to the presidential palace with a 12-metre (40-foot) revolving statue of Niyazov on top.</p>
