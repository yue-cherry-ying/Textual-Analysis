<p>Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar and legislative leaders are scheduled to meet Thursday afternoon for their first formal talks on the governor's proposed school funding reform package.</p>
<p>Edgar has proposed a 25 percent state income tax increase to provide $1.2 billion of property tax cuts and $600 million for public schools.</p>
<p>The proposal would increase the state income tax from 3 percent to 3.75 percent to generate about $1.5 billion of additional revenues. The stated goals of property tax cuts and school funding leave the proposal with a $340 million hole.</p>
<p>A special committee of eight legislators and aides to the governor prepared the plan and began unveiling it to lawmakers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Edgar, Republican state Senate President James &quot;Pate&quot; Philip and Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan plan to meet in the governor's office at 2:30 p.m. CDT. The minority leaders in the house and senate have also been invited as have the members of the legislative committee.</p>
<p>A question high on everyone's list to answer is should the governor and legislative leaders fill the gap before presenting a formal plan to the General Assembly, Madigan's spokesman Steve Brown said.</p>
<p>The plan prepared serves as a &quot;blue print&quot; or model and all the leaders will have questions and concerns about it, said Patty Schuh, spokeswoman for Philip.</p>
<p>Philip would be reluctant to approve a significant increase in the income tax, but is open to discussion, Schuh said.</p>
