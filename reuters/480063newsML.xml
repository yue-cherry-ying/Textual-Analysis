<headline>Helsinki ends down but brokers hope worst is over.</headline>
<dateline>HELSINKI 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares closed sharply lower, led by a decline on Wall Street while Helsinki was closed for Easter, but the bourse managed to weather the storm better than many in Europe, brokers said.</p>
<p>The HEX general index fell 2.22 percent to 2,784.45 after hitting 2,760.04 earlier -- down over three percent -- and the FOX derivatives and portfolio benchmark closed at 970.83 points, down 2.54 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We've taken this (downward correction) quite calmly,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Telcommunications group Nokia lost 8.50 markka or 2.85 percent to close at 290.00 markka, accounting for 30 percent of 605 million markka volume, which was livelier than last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Tomorrow will be a better day,&quot; said another broker, pointing to expectations ahead of the U.S. market open that Wall Street would stabilise.</p>
<p>&quot;This morning nobody wanted to buy anything -- in the afternoon there was demand in quite a few shares,&quot; one broker said. &quot;I don't see any major panic.&quot;</p>
<p>The banking sector and Merita fell most sharply, with the banking sub-index down almost six percent and Merita down 1.00 markka or 5.88 percent at 16.00, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Fears of higher interest rates have again hit banking shares,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Brokers said the outlook depended fully on U.S. markets. &quot;There are no fundamental reasons for this decline,&quot; said one.</p>
