<p>Afghanistan's Taleban militia said it had recaptured a strategic town north of the capital Kabul on Saturday and was advancing further in an apparent move to clear the main highway to the north.</p>
<p>Taleban sources, quoted by a Pakistan-based Afghan news service, said the purist militia took Jabal os-Siraj, 70 km (44 miles) from Kabul, in an early morning offensive against opposition forces.</p>
<p>    There was no independent confirmation of the report.   The</p>
<p>Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) said the Taleban launched the offensive with 2,000 fighters, tanks and jet bombers pushing forces led by renowned opposition guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah Masood from the town on Kabul's main highway to the north after a four-hour battle.</p>
<p>It quoted a Taleban spokesman, Abdul Wakil, in the southern Afghan town of Kandahar saying the militia forces were now advancing towards the mouth of Masood's native Panjsher Valley stronghold and fighting to recapture another strategic town, Golbahar, which the Taleban recently lost to the opposition.</p>
<p>Jabal os-Siraj controls access to the Salang highway that leads to the north over the towering Hindu Kush mountains.</p>
<p>The report of the Taleban advance comes after a flurry of diplomatic activity by Afghanistan's neighbours.</p>
<p>Russian deputy foreign minister, Viktor Pasuvalyuk, arrived in Islamabad on Friday night, and was due to hold talks with Pakistani authorities during which Afghan developments were likely to be high on the agenda.</p>
<p>Turkmenistan's Foreign Minister Boris Shikhmuradov was also due to arrive in Islamabad on Saturday for talks likely to focus on Afghanistan.</p>
<p>An Iranian deputy foreign minister, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, met Uzbek opposition leader General Abdul Malik in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif on Friday, a day after meeting ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani in the opposition-held northeastern town of Faizabad, AIP said. Masood's forces had captured both Golbahar, at the entrance to the Panjsher Valley, and Jabal os-Siraj last week, c utting off a Taleban force based in Pul-i-Khumri, further north in Baghlan province. The Taleban were also ousted from the newly taken main northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif by Malik's forces.</p>
<p>The use of tanks and other heavy arms in Saturday's battle was made possible after the Taleban repaired a bridge at Matak between Jabal os-Siraj and Charikar, south of there, that had been blown up by Masood's forces, AIP said.</p>
<p>Taleban sources said about 45 opposition fighters and only three Taleban were killed in Saturday's battle.</p>
<p>On Friday, AIP quoted Taleban sources as saying the militia had repulsed a big attack on the border between Baghlan and Samangan provinces launched by forces commanded by Malik.</p>
<p>The Taleban, which controls most of Banglan province and some of Samangan, killed 11 opposition soldiers and captured 55, while five of its own fighters were killed, it said.</p>
<p>Iran's state-run Tehran radio said on Thursday that Boroujerdi discussed the Afghan situation with Rabbani, whom Tehran still recognises as the lawful Afghan head of state, whose forces were driven out of Kabul by the Taleban Islamic militia in September.</p>
<p>Boroujerdi had stopped off in Tajikistan on his way to Afghanistan and met the Tajik foreign minister, the radio said.</p>
<p>The Taleban government has frequently accused Iran of supporting forces loyal to Rabbani. On Monday it ordered the Iranian embassy in Kabul closed for alleged involvement in espionage. Iran denied the charges.</p>
<p>Tehran has refused to recognise the Taleban government and continues to recognise Rabbani, who fled to northern Afghanistan when Taleban forces captured the Afghan capital.</p>
<p>Shi'ite Moslem Iran has accused the Sunni Taleban of being dependent on foreign states and giving Islam a bad name by its harsh interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.</p>
