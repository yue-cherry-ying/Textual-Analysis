<p>Israel denied on Saturday a meeting had been set between Israeli and Palestinian representatives for Sunday in Cairo.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman issued the denial hours after Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa announced the two sides would meet to discuss the impasse in peacemaking prompted by Israel's settlement building.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of a meeting tomorrow between Israeli and Palestinian respresentatives was raised but no meeting has been set,&quot; said Shai Bazak.</p>
<p>&quot;The contacts aimed at reviving peace talks continue,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Moussa spoke to reporters after Palestinian President Yasser Arafat briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo on his latest contacts with the Israelis. He said Arafat had met on Friday with an adviser to Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Egypt has stepped up mediation efforts since a summit between Mubarak and Netanyahu last month.</p>
<p>The Sunday meeting would centre on &quot;important points connected with the peace process, including settlements&quot;, Moussa said, adding that Netanyau's adviser gave Arafat new Israeli ideas to break the deadlock in talks.</p>
<p>He did not name the Israeli adviser or the experts who will take part in the Cairo meeting but said an Egyptian representative would attend as an observer.</p>
<p>Israel-PLO peace talks plunged into crisis in March when Netanyahu launched a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources said on Friday Egypt and the Palestinians were working on a five-point plan which includes a freeze on any change in the status of Jerusalem and a ban on Jewish settlement of the West Bank for &quot;a sufficient period&quot;.</p>
<p>In return the Palestinians would give a firm commitment to address Israel's security demands, they added.</p>
<p>But Bazak denied reports Israel was willing to halt construction at the East Jerusalem settlement site which Israel calls Har Homa and Arabs refer to as Jabal Abu Ghneim.</p>
