<p>Kenya's biggest brewery has issued a strong protest over a proposal to double the import duty on beer exports to neighbouring Tanzania,</p>
<p>Alistair Hepburn, senior liaison officer for Kenya Breweries Ltd (KBL), said in Dar es Salaam on Sunday that the Confederation of Tanzanian Industries (CTI), in a report to the government, had called for tariff changes to increase protection for locally brewed beer.</p>
<p>&quot;If this proposal is adopted, it will double the current duty on beer imported from Kenya (to 90 shillings ($0.14) a litre) while leaving the local product unchanged,&quot; Hepburn said.</p>
<p>At the same time, he said, the CTI had proposed reducing the tariff on beer imported from outside the East and Southern Africa Preferential Trade Area (PTA). This was against the spirit of the PTA, and would favour beer imports from South Africa and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Tanzania's budget for the financial year beginning on July 1 is to be revealed in Parliament next Thursday.</p>
<p>Kenya Breweries is a public company quoted on the Nairobi Stock Exchange with breweries in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu. It owned Tanzania's only brewery in Dar es Salaam until it was nationalised in 1967.</p>
<p>In recent years, Tanzania has become a big export market for Kenyan beer.</p>
<p>Kenya Breweries placed full-page advertisements in Tanzanian newspapers last week condemning the CTI proposals, which it said had been drawn up without consulting KBL.</p>
<p>Tanzania Breweries Ltd (TBL) is controlled by South African Breweries, which bought the main shareholding when the company was recently privatised.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on KBL's complaints, South African Danie Niemandt, Chief Executive Director of TBL, told Reuters that KBL was operating on a &quot;false assumption&quot;. He said there was no &quot;specific agreement&quot; between Tanzania and Kenya on import duty on Kenyan beer.</p>
<p>TBL supplies 80 per cent of the local market, he added.</p>
<p>KBL says it supplies between 16 and 20 percent of Tanzanian beer sales -- a market described by Hepburn as &quot;big and valuable&quot;.</p>
<p>In a strongly worded statement, KBL Managing Director Michael Karanja said: &quot;We sincerely hope that the (Tanzanian) Ministry of Finance will review -- and better still, ignore -- the recommended tax increase on PTA beers. This will be in line with the spirit of East African Cooperation.&quot;</p>
