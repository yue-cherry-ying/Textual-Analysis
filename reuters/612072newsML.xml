<p>The World Bank has suggested Bangladesh reform its banking sector through improving its legal framework against loan defaulters and banning &quot;outrageous&quot; trade union practices, a finance ministry official said on Friday.</p>
<p>He said the suggestions were made by a World Bank committee that spent three months reviewing Bangladesh's banking woes and possible remedies.</p>
<p>Banking sources said the committee prepared a 500-page report on its findings and recommendations, and handed it on Thursday to government leaders and banking authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;Without radical reforms the banking sector will not respond positively to changing trend of economy,&quot; the committee said at a meeting on Thursday with the finance ministry's economic relations division.</p>
<p>The World Bank move was prompted by a recent crisis in Bangladeshi banks caused by more than 130 billion taka ($3 billion) in defaulted loans.</p>
<p>The bad loans caused a liquidity crisis and held back lending to industry.</p>
<p>&quot;The committee recommended that outrageous activities of the trade unions must be banned. Until it is done, the whole programme for the development of banking sector would fail,&quot; said the ministry official who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>The official was referring to frequent interference by trade unions in banks' administration and sanction of loans. &quot;Those who refuse to give in to pressure (from trade unions) are sometimes threatened or physically assaulted,&quot; one bank official said.</p>
<p>Current banking laws allow lengthy hearings for loan cases and minimum penalties. The World Bank said regulations should be amended to speed up trials and to allow heavier punishments, one official said without elaborating.</p>
<p>The committee suggested the government form a legal task force allowing the Bangladesh Bank (central bank) to investigate and file cases against &quot;top-20 loan defaulters&quot; and the directors of lending banks for any negligence.</p>
<p>&quot;The World Bank wants to know by 30th June, 1997, whether the government accepts or disagrees or wants to modify the suggestions,&quot; one Bangladeshi bank official said.</p>
<p>The World Bank also suggested formation of a special committee comprising eminent Bangladesh professionals to appoint members of the Board of Directors of the central bank and chief executives of the commercial banks.</p>
<p>&quot;The World Bank suggestions do not appear to contradict changes we are already contemplating for healthy development of the banking sector,&quot; central bank governor Lutfar Rahman Sarkar told Reuters without elaborating.</p>
