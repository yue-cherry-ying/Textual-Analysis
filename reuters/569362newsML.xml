<p>A China Southern Airlines Boeing 737 crash-landed during stormy weather in the southern city of Shenzhen on Thursday, killing at least 10 people and injuring 20, local officials said.</p>
<p>The airliner was on a scheduled flight from the southwestern city of Chongqing to Shenzhen, a booming city on China's border with Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The cause of the crash, the first reported in China for almost three years, was unclear, but one airline official said by telephone: &quot;The attitude of the plane during landing was wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>The airliner's co-pilot was among at least 10 people killed, said another official.</p>
<p>Shenzhen airport was closed and other flights diverted after the crash, which happened during a thunderstorm late on Thursday. &quot;The plane is burning,&quot; said one city official said. &quot;The whole place is chaotic.&quot;</p>
<p>Ambulances and rescue workers ferried dead and injured passengers from the airport to hospital, while fire engines put out the blaze.</p>
<p>Witnesses said they saw paramilitary police equipped with riot gear rush to the airport after the crash. &quot;The situation is very serious out there,&quot; said one Shenzhen resident.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known if any foreigners were on board the airliner.</p>
<p>Chinese aviation officials had been celebrating almost three years without a serious accident, a record credited to improved precautions taken after a Russian-made Tupelov-154 crashed after takeoff on a domestic flight in June, 1994.</p>
<p>That crash, which killed 160 people, was the worst reported accident in China's aviation history.</p>
<p>The International Airline Passengers Association had cited China as one of the most dangerous places in the world to fly after five crashes in 1993 killed 76 people and 10 aircraft were hijacked to Taiwan.</p>
<p>In 1992, a series of accidents over a four-month period killed 276 passengers, including many foreigners.</p>
