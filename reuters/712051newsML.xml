<p>Taiwan had a trade surplus of US$321.9 million in June, down 21.5 percent from a US$410 million surplus in June 1996, the finance ministry said on Monday.  </p>
<p>Exports in June totalled US$9.959 billion, up 2.7 percent compared with June 1996.</p>
<p>Imports were US$9.638 billion, up an annual 3.8 percent.</p>
<p>The June trade surplus came in significantly below an average forecast compiled from a July 2 Reuters Poll of Taiwan economists, which projected a surplus of US$492 million -- which would have been a 20 percent rise compared with June 1996.  </p>
<p>For the second consecutive month, Hong Kong topped the United States as Taiwan's top export market -- an indication of communist China's growing importance to rival Taiwan's economy. Much of Hong Kong's imports are destined for China, which reclaimed sovereignty over the territory on July 1.</p>
<p>June exports to Hong Kong accounted for 24.5 percent of Taiwan's total exports and a 10.5 percent increase from June 1996 to US$2.441 billion.</p>
<p>Nationalist Taiwan, viewed by Beijing as a renegade province since a civil war split them in 1949, has allowed indirect trade with China since a late 1980s political thaw.  </p>
<p>Taipei has said it would allow businesses to continue to use Hong Kong as a conduit for trade with China despite its reabsorption by Beijing.</p>
<p>Taiwan's June exports to the United States totalled US$2.371 billion, accounting for 23.8 percent of the total exports and a 5.7 percent rise from a year ago. Exports to Europe stood at US$1.328 billion in June, comprising 13.3 percent of the total.</p>
<p>Japan remained Taiwan's top import source, accounting for US$2.528 billion or 26.2 percent of the total, followed by the United States at US$1.998 billion (20.7 percent) and Europe at US$1.733 billion (18.0 percent).  </p>
<p>Hsu Kuo-chung, the ministry's chief statistician, said he expected both exports and imports to rise between 6-8 percent in the second half of 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Information and electronic products should be the items that lead the surging growths,&quot; Hsu said.</p>
<p>Exports for the electronic and machinery sector, which includes information products, accounted for a hefty 46.2 percent of Taiwan's total June exports at US$4.6 billion.</p>
<p>The same sector comprised 36.6 percent of June imports at US$3.528 billion.  </p>
<p>Taiwan's June trade surplus with the United States fell 33.5 percent at US$373.3 million from the same month a year ago.</p>
<p>Its trade surplus with Hong Kong increased 10.2 percent at US$2.293 billion.</p>
<p>Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan was US$1.524 billion, up 56.2 percent from June 1996.  </p>
