<p>Citicorp, which has made no secret of its desire to expand its investment management capability, signaled Friday it will build the business rather than buy a management firm.</p>
<p>Citicorp announced it has hired Peter Carman, 56, from Putnam Investment Management Inc, who will become chairman of Citibank Global Asset Management and Chief Investment Officer.</p>
<p>&quot;They couldn't find something to buy at a price they were willing to pay,&quot; said Raphael Soifer, analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. &quot;The price has always been an obstacle.&quot;  </p>
<p>Citicorp chairman and chief executive John Reed told analysts in January that investment management was one of the businesses the company was interested in but he said asking prices were high.</p>
<p>In a statement Friday, Reed said Carman joins Citicorp as &quot;part of an expanded commitment on our part to build an absolutely first class investment management competence completely within the company.&quot;  </p>
<p>Reed continued, &quot;We look to Peter to draw on his experience in building and shaping a team-oriented investment process where portfolio managers are complemented by a state-of-the-art research capability that includes both strong fundamental analysis and rigorous quantitative techniques.&quot;</p>
<p>Putnam, a unit of Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos Inc, has long been rumored to be for sale. Asked if there had been any discussions between Citicorp and Marsh &amp; McLennon, a Citicorp spokesman declined comment.  </p>
<p>In a separate news release, Putnam said that with Carman's departure, it has consolidated its international and domestic groups with Tim Ferguson, a senior managing director and head of the international group, now heading domestic as well.</p>
<p>Citicorp's spokesman said Carman will head up all areas of investment management including the Private Bank unit and institutional money management. He will report to Paul Collins, a vice chairman.</p>
<p>Citicorp manages about $120 billion in customer assets from 21 investment centers around the world.</p>
<p>Carman had been senior managing director and chief of equity investments at Putnam since 1993. Earlier, he was chief investment officer at Sanford C. Bernstein Co.</p>
<p>Carman will succeed Neville Bowen, who will retire at the end of June as planned, Citicorp said.</p>
