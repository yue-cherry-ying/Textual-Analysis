<p>At least 15 members of a Moslem rebel group were killed on Saturday when their camp in Sirawai, southern Philippines, was attacked with air strikes and heavy artillery, military authorities said.</p>
<p>Philippine soldiers killed the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) guerrillas after pounding the rebel group's camp early today, Colonel Glicerio Sua, chief of the Philippine Army's 101st Infantry Brigade based in Zamboanga del Norte province, told reporters.</p>
<p>Three other members of the MILF, a breakaway Moslem faction fighting for an Islamic state in the southern islands, were wounded in another clash with the military in nearby Siocon town on Friday night.</p>
<p>&quot;We subjected this (MILF camp) to air strikes and heavy artillery,&quot; Sua said in an interview with reporters.</p>
<p>Sua said soldiers were still pursuing other rebels who managed to escape.</p>
<p>Moslem rebels also left three wounded colleagues as they fled pursuing soldiers in a separate gun battle in Siocon town on Friday night, said Army colonel Johnny Corcha.</p>
<p>Military officials said that on Thursday soldiers killed at least six MILF rebels who had ambushed Siocon town mayor Jesusa Pastor, wounding the mayor and killing two people.</p>
<p>The MILF was not part of the peace deal forged by Manila last year with the mainstream Moro National Liberation Front.</p>
