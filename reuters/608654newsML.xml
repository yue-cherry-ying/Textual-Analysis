<p>A witness at the trial of 71 former officials in Ethiopia's ousted Marxist government said on Friday that a defendant ordered the execution of 39 youths suspected of belonging to an opposition Marxist cell in 1978.</p>
<p>The witness, who cannot be named under trial protocols, said that Major Kassaye Aragaw also gave instructions that the victims should dig their mass grave before they were executed.</p>
<p>The witness, a former head of prison at Debre Birehan, 130 km (80 miles) north of the capital Addis Ababa, said:</p>
<p>&quot;The execution order which came from the National Revolutionary Campaign and Security Department was signed by Major Kassaye Aragaw.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Late one evening in December 1978, the 39 prisoners were handcuffed in pairs and were ordered to stand in the grave they dug earlier in the day. Masked soldiers opened fire killing all 39, and they were buried on the spot,&quot; the witness added.</p>
<p>When Kassaye queried the authenticity of the signature, the witness replied: &quot;Yes, the execution order carried your name as well as your title as member of the 'Dergue'.&quot;</p>
<p>Only 46 of the 71 officials of Ethiopia's military junta, known as the &quot;Dergue&quot; and which was toppled in 1991, were in the dock. Twenty-five, including dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam who now lives in exile in Zimbabwe, are being tried in absentia.</p>
<p>They are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity and face the death penalty if found guilty. Prosecutors have charged 5,198 people who served under the &quot;Dergue&quot; with war crimes, homicide and genocide.</p>
<p>The trial was adjourned until Tuesday.</p>
