<title>UK: Refinery margins climb in March, Asia still leads.</title>
<headline>Refinery margins climb in March, Asia still leads.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>Oil refinery margins in Singapore have shed over 50 cents a barrel in recent days but are still much more healthy than profits in the West.</p>
<p>During March, refiners in all regions consolidated the recovery made from low points hit over the past three months, according to Reuters price data using standard product yields.</p>
<p>A complex refinery in Singapore is returning $4.53 a barrel refining Dubai crude while similar plants in the West running regional crude oils make around $2 a barrel.</p>
<p>A week ago, Singapore refiners were making around $5.25 a barrel while profits have averaged $5.19 during March.</p>
<p>The drop in Singapore reflects a sharp drop in the premium for gasoline over Dubai crude. The premium has dropped over $1 a barrel since the end of last week to below $9 a barrel after peaking at $11.49 in mid-March.</p>
<p>Gas oil also lost ground against crude oil but fuel remains broadly unchanged around $3.50 a barrel below the value of Dubai.</p>
<p>In the West, refinery profitability has also slipped slightly in recent days but the upward trend seen during March remains intact.</p>
<p>In Rotterdam complex plants running Brent make just under $2 a barrel and averaged $2.04 last week.</p>
<p>Hydroskimming plants managed to a turn in a profit last week of 62 cents a barrel having been running at a loss since the middle of February.</p>
<p>Mediterranean refiners showed a similar pattern. Complex plants running Urals were off last week's highs but at $2.26 a barrel were well above lows of just four cents a barrel seen at the end of January.</p>
<p>In the U.S. Gulf, refiners make profits of $1.93 a barrel running Brent and $1.15 running West Texas Intermediate (WTI), according to the price data.</p>
<p>Brent averaged $2.11 last week but WTI is above last week's average of $1.03.</p>
<p>This compares with 48 cents and zero cents respectively in the first week of March.</p>
