<title>USA: Outflows from Fidelity Magellan slowed in March.</title>
<headline>Outflows from Fidelity Magellan slowed in March.</headline>
<dateline>BOSTON 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>Flows out of Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund appeared to slow in March to less than $550 million, its lowest amount since June last year, analysts said.</p>
<p>Investors cashed out a net $521 million in March, down from $623 million in February, $1.2 billion in January, said David O'Leary, president of Alpha Equity Research.</p>
<p>The $51.4 billion fund, the largest in the country, has had outflows every month since April last year, he said, due to its poor performance versus the S&amp;P500 and most other broad indices of the U.S. stock market.  </p>
<p>Eric Kobren, the publisher of Fidelity Insight, estimated that outflows from Magellan in March totalled $540 million, down from $630 million in February.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's going to continue to get better, from Fidelity's perspective,&quot; Kobren said. &quot;It will get better as people focus less on last year's performance and more on this year's performance.&quot;</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, Magellan has lost 0.56 pct, versus a loss of 1.78 percent for the average growth fund, while the S&amp;P500 has climbed 7.08 percent, according to Morningstar Mutual Funds.</p>
<p>O'Leary estimated that Fidelity's U.S. stock funds had a net cash inflow of $1.6 billion in March, about nine percent of an estimated total inflow of $17.5 billion inflow for the industry, he said.</p>
<p>Among other Fidelity funds, Equity-Income had a net outflow of $477 million, Growth &amp; Income lost a net $423 million and Disciplined Equity lost $279 milllion, he said.</p>
