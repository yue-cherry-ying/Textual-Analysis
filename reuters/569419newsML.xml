<p>Singapore shares closed down on Thursday after institutional buyers backed out of the market following an overnight plunge on Wall Street while retail investors took the opportunity to buy, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The institutions always respond more cautiously to these external factors than retail buyers,&quot; one local dealer said.</p>
<p>The Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) ended 8.75 points down at 2,059.38, with market wide volume a slim 137.1 million shares producing 183 gainers and 155 losers.</p>
<p>Of the day's top 20 gainers, 13 were small cap stocks priced below Singapore $4.00, pointing to retail interest.</p>
<p>Losers were led by foreign tranches of bank stocks mainly held by institutions, dealers said.</p>
<p>With more U.S. news expected to hit the market on Friday from a speech by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, dealers said signals for buying intent were mixed.</p>
<p>Thursday's most active share, recent listing MMI Holdings, edged up S$0.015 at S$0.765 on volume of 8.6 million.</p>
<p>Uraco Holdings, a large holder of CAM International stock, suspended amid fraud allegations, also saw heavy trade with 8.4 million shares changing hands to close up S$0.025 at S$0.865.</p>
