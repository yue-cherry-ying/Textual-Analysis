<p>The Slovak central bank (NBS) appears to be winning the battle against speculators over the Slovak crown, but uncertainty over the future of the Czech crown is delaying any victory celebration, analysts said.</p>
<p>The NBS on Friday continued its fight to keep the crown strong, setting the currency above market rates at the daily fixing, while keeping the market short of liquidity to prevent foreign borrowing of crowns and their subsequent short-selling.</p>
<p>Both the Czech crown, and subsequently the Slovak crown, have been under strong speculative pressure for the past week, mainly from foreign institutions who have been preying upon emerging market currencies whose economies have shown weakness.</p>
<p>&quot;The (NBS) seems to be doing very well, mainly by reducing access to crown funds and by using a strong fixing, but it is still early to celebrate the victory,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;We still don't know how foreign players will react to the new situation and if they would not seek a way of how to repeat their run on the crown,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>While the Czech National Bank (CNB) this week intervened several times on the market to boost its ailing currency, the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) has used only indirect intervention through its daily fixing.</p>
<p>On Friday the NBS strengthened its fixing rate to -0.68 percent in the depreciation side of the crown's mark/dollar basket parity, from Thursday's fixing at -0.78 percent.</p>
<p>The crown was trading at -1.96 percent versus the midpoint at the time of fixing calculation but it firmed some 80 basis points shortly after the fixing.</p>
<p>&quot;This was another, and even stronger, signal from the NBS that the speculators will find it hard, or at least very expensive, to push the Slovak crown down,&quot; said one local trader.</p>
<p>Another Bratislava-based dealer said the NBS so far seemed to be winning the battle for the crown against foreign speculators, but he warned the fight was not completely over.</p>
<p>The NBS on Friday said it expected pressure on the crown to ease in the coming days as foreign speculators found it hard to obtain crown funds to convert to hard currencies.</p>
<p>Tibor Fratrik of ING Bank said the NBS seemed to have won the fight for the crown on domestic field.</p>
<p>But he added the fate of the currency was still uncertain as much would depend on the success of the CNB in its battle for the Czech crown.</p>
<p>&quot;Frankly, all eyes are now looking at the Czech market -- the two currencies are so closely connected, at least in the eyes of foreign investors, that we will have to wait for the result of the CNB's fight for the Czech crown,&quot; Fratrik said.</p>
<p>The Czech crown showed signs of steadying at about 4.5 percent on the depreciation side of its dollar/mark basket midpoint on Friday, though dealers said there was still strong market sentiment to push it lower.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the devaluation of the Czech crown may be inevitable, sparking fears that because the Slovak economy is so closely tied to its former federation partner, a similar move would have to be taken in Slovakia as well.</p>
<p>&quot;Only after it will be clear that the speculators counted their losses and definitely left the Czech market we will be able to say that the Slovak crown is saved,&quot; a local bank trader said.</p>
