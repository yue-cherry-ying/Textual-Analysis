<p>The first Chinese vessel to sail directly to rival Taiwan in nearly five decades left the southern port of Xiamen early on Saturday, port officials said.</p>
<p>The departure of the 6,000-tonne Sheng Da, registered in St Vincent and the Grenadines and owned by the Xiamen Shipping Company, ended a 48-year political impasse between Taiwan and China that had prevented direct sailings across the Taiwan strait.</p>
<p>The first Taiwan vessel to set sail for China -- under the new system that effectively ends a 40-year ban by Taipei on direct shipping links -- was expected to leave on April 24, the Xiamen port official said.</p>
<p>A second Chinese ship, the Far East Glory owned by Fujian Foreign Trade Centre Shipping Co, was loading containers in the Fujian provincial capital of Fuzhou on Saturday morning and was expected to set sail for the southern Taiwan port of Kaoshiung at midday, a port official said.</p>
<p>The Sheng Da, loaded with containers, was expected to arrive late on Saturday in Kaohsiung after an estimated 18-hour voyage, the Xiamen official said.</p>
<p>The vessel sailed out of Xiamen without fanfare in line with orders from Beijing to play down the first direct sailings to the island it has regarded as a rebel province since the Nationalists fled there after losing the civil war in 1949.</p>
<p>China wanted to keep the start of direct shipping links low-key because the breakthrough was regarded as too little, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Beijing has long demanded the full resumption of direct shipping, mail and trade links with Taiwan.</p>
<p>Taipei has refused, and the direct sailings will only begin under restrictions from Taipei forbidding direct cargo exchanges -- thus upholding its ban on direct mainland links.</p>
<p>Mainland cargoes will not be allowed to enter Taiwan customs but can be processed at Kaohsiung's new &quot;offshore transshipment centre&quot; for onward passage to third countries.</p>
<p>Likewise, Taiwan cargoes at Kaohsiung cannot be put aboard ships planning to cross directly to the Chinese mainland.</p>
<p>Chinese officials had given permission for 10 sailings each week from Xiamen, which faces the island of Taiwan, and a reciprocal 10 a week were expected from Kaohsiung, the Xiamen port official said.</p>
<p>China would allow five sailings each week from Fuzhou and an equal number was expected from Kaohsiung, officials said.</p>
<p>The Sheng Da was expected to arrive in Kaohsiung at around 10 p.m. (1400 GMT).</p>
<p>Kaoshiung port authorities said they had received formal notice from the Sheng Da that it was en route.</p>
<p>&quot;We just received the notice from the ship Sheng Da and we expected that it to enter our port by 10 p.m.,&quot; said a duty officer at the port.</p>
<p>Taiwan issued permits to five Chinese shipping lines several days ago, breaking with its ban on direct links with China.</p>
<p>China issued licences to six Taiwan shipping lines for direct sailings on Thursday.</p>
