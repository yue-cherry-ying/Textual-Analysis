<title>JAPAN: Sony posts record profit on robust sales, weak yen.</title>
<headline>Sony posts record profit on robust sales, weak yen.</headline>

<p>Sony Corp. said Thursday that its profits more than doubled last year as robust global sales and a weak yen helped it post record sales and earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;Our group sales, operating profit and net profit during the 1996/97 business year all reached the highest levels in Sony's history,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Parent sales and operating profit for the year ended march 31 were also the highest on record for the electronics giant.</p>
<p>Sony's group net profit was 139.46 billion yen ($1.12 billion), 2.6 times the previous year's, and parent current profit was 85.73 billion yen ($691 million), a three-fold increase.</p>
<p>Net profit is equal to current profit, which is pre-tax, minus taxes and extraordinary profits and losses.</p>
<p>The strong earnings result, which came after the Tokyo stock market closed, was probably not a great surprise to investors, who already pushed Sony's shares briefly to a record high of 9,800 yen Thursday. The shares closed at 9,720 yen in Tokyo, up 90 yen from Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>&quot;Larger group sales were due to higher sales in Japan, the United States, Europe and other areas as well as the yen's depreciation,&quot; Sony said in the statement.</p>
<p>During the fiscal year the yen fell about 15 percent against the dollar and weakened against other foreign currencies as well.</p>
<p>Sony said the yen's fall against other major currencies, which makes Japanese exports more competitive abroad, raised its group sales by about 520 billion yen ($4.19 billion).</p>
<p>Sony said that sales rose in all its business areas including electronics, entertainment, insurance and financing.</p>
<p>Sales of the company's cutting-edge 32-bit home game player, the PlayStation, contributed to a 24.3 percent gain in its group revenue in the electronics sector.</p>
<p>In the entertainment sector, group operating revenue grew 23.1 percent to 1.02 trillion yen ($8.2 billion).</p>
<p>Sony's entertainment revenues come largely from its troubled Hollywood film-making unit, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and its recording unit, Sony Music Entertainment.</p>
<p>&quot;Sales in the music group continued to rise despite the weak retail environment in the United States, primarily due to favourable sales growth outside Japan,&quot; Sony said.</p>
<p>One notable success was Canadian pop diva Celine Dion's &quot;Falling Into You,&quot; which has sold more than 21 million copies since its March 1996 release, it said.</p>
<p>Sales in the pictures group rose significantly, aided by continued strength in television operations and the success of videos such as &quot;Jumanji&quot; and &quot;Matilda.&quot;</p>
<p>The blockbuster romantic comedy &quot;Jerry Maguire,&quot; which has grossed $150 million at the U.S. box office, also contributed to the year's results, Sony said.</p>
<p>&quot;All of those positive factors, in addition to the yen's depreciation, more than offset the disappointing box office results of several films released during the year,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Sony said that it expected group net profit to grow to 160 billion yen ($1.29 billion) and parent current profit to increase to 100 billion yen ($806 million) in 1997/98.</p>
<p>&quot;We have made conservative estimates for the current business year because we don't want to make any downward revisions later,&quot; Sumio Sano, one of Sony's financial directors, told a news conference.</p>
