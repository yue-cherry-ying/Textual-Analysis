<p>Chanting &quot;Bibi resign&quot;, tens of thousands of Israelis demonstrated against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday in the Tel Aviv square where Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated.</p>
<p>The protest organised by the Movement For Early Elections, which says it is unaffiliated with any political party, was the biggest anti-Netanyahu demonstration in Israel since the right-wing Likud leader became prime minister a year ago.</p>
<p>It coincided with tensions within Netanyahu's fractious coalition and a Middle East peace crisis over his government's building of a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Many in the crowd in Rabin Square wore stickers with a photo of a scowling Netanyahu and the slogan &quot;Bibi is bad for all of us&quot;.</p>
<p>But most of the demonstrators appeared to be Ashkenazis -- Jews of European descent -- and not Sepharadi, or Middle Eastern Jews, who provide the Likud with its power base.</p>
<p>Police gave no official estimate of the size of the crowd. Israeli media said between 40,000 and 50,000 people were in the plaza where Labour Prime Minister Rabin had addressed a peace rally in 1995 moments before he was shot.</p>
<p>&quot;Netanyahu says he likes to win. Well, he has defeated peace and the next war and its casualties are on the horizon,&quot; Michal Hazan, head of a group called &quot;Mothers Against War&quot;, told the crowd.</p>
<p>A young woman, who asked not to be identified because she is serving in the army, said: &quot;My friends and I think that perhaps in the future we will emigrate. The situation here is deteriorating. I feel war could break out soon.&quot;</p>
<p>In a statement, a Likud spokeswoman called the rally for early elections &quot;ridiculous&quot; and said it was another sign that left-wing parties were still unable to accept their defeat in national elections in May 1996.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has vowed to lead Israel into the 21st century but some political analysts have predicted his government of right-wing, religious and immigrants' parties will not survive until the next elections scheduled for the year 2000.</p>
<p>The prime minister won a no-confidence vote in parliament on Tuesday but 11 coalition legislators pointedly withheld their support, angry at they view as his autocratic style of government.</p>
<p>In a separate demonstration a few blocks from Rabin Square, thousands of secular Jews took part in a &quot;Stop the ultraorthodox&quot; protest.</p>
<p>The gathering was held against the backdrop of the recent closure at the behest of ultraorthodox Jews of a main Jerusalem street to traffic on the Jewish Sabbath and a controversy in Israel and Jewish communities abroad over conversion to Judaism.</p>
