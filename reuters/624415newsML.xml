<title>USA: Bob Dylan hospitalized with heart infection.</title>

<p>Bob Dylan has called off a European tour after being admitted to a hospital suffering from a potentially life-threatening infection, his publicists said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>London media reports said the 56-year-old singer/songwriter was hospitalized in New York but a spokeswoman for Dylan said her office did not know where he was being treated or what his condition was.</p>
<p>&quot;This past weekend, Bob Dylan was admitted to hospital suffering from severe chest pains. His condition has been diagnosed as histoplasmosis, a potentially fatal infection which creates swelling in the sac which surrounds the heart,&quot; Dylan's London publicists said.</p>
<p>Dylan will remain in the hospital until his doctors are confident his condition has improved, they added.</p>
<p>His New York publicists said they hoped he would be well enough to go through with a U.S. tour slated for August.</p>
<p>The singer was due to perform in Ireland, Britain and Switzerland during the summer tour. Van Morrison, who was to appear with him in London on June 7, said he would still perform.</p>
<p>Dylan recently completed a swing through Canada and the Northeast and last appeared in Los Angeles earlier this month.</p>
<p>He released his first album in 1962 and is considered the most influential songwriter of his generation, with such classics as &quot;Blowin' in the Wind,&quot; &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin,&quot; &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues,&quot; &quot;Like a Rolling Stone,&quot; and &quot;Tangled Up in Blue.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. David Pegues, an infectious disease expert at UCLA Medical Centre, said histoplasmosis is caused by a fungus, which is extremely common in certain parts of the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not unusual,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;If untreated, sure it could kill him ... but it's an eminently treatable and curable illness, and I'm sure Mr. Dylan has the best medical supervision.&quot;</p>
<p>He said people in Dylan's case would be treated either orally or intravenously with a course of anti-virals, and would be out of action for a few weeks at least.</p>
<p>In recent years, Dylan has looked haggard as he fulfilled a grueling touring regimen, and he rarely seemed animated while performing. However some friends reported that he was looking relatively chipper and had even given up smoking.</p>
