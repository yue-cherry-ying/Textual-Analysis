<p>Nicaraguan doctors said on Friday they had successfully delivered an infant last week in an extremely rare case where the placenta had attached itself to the 15-year-old mother's small intestine.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an extremely rare case,&quot; Quiroz said. &quot;In the world, the percentage of survival for these babies is between 0.1 and 0.3 percent,&quot; gynecologist Sergio Quiroz, assistant director of the Bertha Calderon Hospital, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The placenta was adhered to the small intestine, which it perforated in order to absorb nutrients,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The little girl, who has not been named, was born surgically to 15-year-old Silvia Jimenez who was reported in good condition and recovering from the birth.</p>
<p>&quot;The mother is totally recovered and the pediatricians have given the baby a good prognosis,&quot; Quiroz said.</p>
<p>The baby weighed about four pounds (1.8 kg) at birth and is still in intensive care.</p>
<p>The young mother arrived at the hospital two weeks ago when a check showed it was an abnormal pregnancy. Doctors decided to operate three weeks short of the due date. Most such babies are aborted when discovered on time.</p>
