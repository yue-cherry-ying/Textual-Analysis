<p>President Bill Clinton has decided to wait until September before asking Congress for authority to negotiate new trade agreements, including those expanding trade with Latin America, it was announced on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The president has come to the conclusion that we should push hard for fast track authority beginning in the fall, in September,&quot; White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said.</p>
<p>White House officials had hoped to submit legislation for the negotiating authority in June, but dropped that timetable after congressional Democrats and Republicans became bogged down in various disputes over the measure, including whether environmental and labour issues should be part of such pacts.</p>
<p>Under fast track, Congress gives up its right to amend trade agreements and only would be able to vote for or against the entire treaty.</p>
<p>McCurry said the administration would &quot;use the time between now and then to help really educate the American people on all the benefits that free trade has brought to this country.&quot;</p>
<p>Although McCurry insisted &quot;the president is committed to making a very strong push for fast track in the coming year,&quot; a spokeswoman for Senate Finance Committee chairman William Roth said the Republican leader was &quot;very disappointed and concerned&quot; by the delay.</p>
<p>&quot;He is concerned that if the White House pushes it off until fall, that would eliminate chances of passage this year and diminish chances for passage at all quite significantly,&quot; Ginny Flynn, the spokeswoman, said.</p>
<p>Clinton earlier this month used a trip to Latin America and the Caribbean to reaffirm his plans to expand the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico to other nations in the hemisphere.</p>
<p>Republicans generally oppose incorporating environmental and labour issues in trade negotiations, while many Democrats insist they must be part of any trade agreement.</p>
<p>Waiting until autumn means final passage may not take place until next year. White House officials would like the authority in place by the time Clinton meets other hemispheric leaders in Santiago, Chile, next April to launch Free Trade Area of the Americas negotiations.</p>
<p>The idea of ending trade barriers in the Americas was first pushed by Republican President George Bush in 1990, when he called for a hemisphere-wide free trade zone.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Chilean President Eduardo Frei said in his annual speech to Congress that he hoped the Clinton administration would be able to overcome the obstacles to free trade in the region.</p>
<p>Frei said Chile, next in line to join NAFTA, was hopeful in can reach a free trade agreement with Washington.</p>
<p>Opponents of NAFTA claim the agreement has spawned a rapid rise in the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico, a loss of jobs from manfacturing moving south and lower wages for workers.</p>
<p>Business groups who want to bring Chile into NAFTA, however, argue that the pact has been good for the U.S. economy and that the United States will be left behind as competitors in Japan and Europe form new trade relationships with Latin American countries, a traditional market for U.S. exporters.</p>
<p>The administration has been without fast track authority since 1994.</p>
