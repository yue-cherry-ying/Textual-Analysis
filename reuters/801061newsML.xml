<p>Tokyo yen-based aluminium futures finished mostly higher in quiet trade on Thursday amid Japan's summer holidays, shrugging off the metal's fall on the London Metal Exchange (LME) overnight, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some fresh buying, but there were hardly any sellers,&quot; said a trader at one of Japan's major trading houses. &quot;Sentiment is pretty strong.&quot;</p>
<p>The June contract recovered to close up 3.3 yen at 198.5 yen per kg. It dropped to 194.3 yen earlier, hit by the dollar's retreat below 116 yen and the decline in London.</p>
<p>Other contracts were 1.0 yen lower to 2.7 yen higher. Estimated volume was a thin 2,120 lots.</p>
<p>Traders in Tokyo said aluminium's fall on the LME overnight was part of a correction after the metal rallied very quickly to more than $1,700 per tonne.</p>
<p>Aluminium's fundamental upward trend remains intact, although the correction may drag LME three-month aluminium down to $1,680 per tonne or possibly to $1,650-$1,660, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point, it's very difficult to imagine the price falling through those levels,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>In London overnight, aluminium shed $19 to finish the afternoon kerb at $1,696, after touching an intra-day low of $1,687.</p>
<p>LME stocks of the metal also increased by 4,100 tonnes, the second successive daily rise, which some traders said might herald a change in inventory trends.</p>
