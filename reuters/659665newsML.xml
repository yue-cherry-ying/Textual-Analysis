<p>Pink bubblegum and red lollipops won't satisfy kids' cravings for sweets today.</p>
<p>They want candy rats, slimy green bubble gum and vibrating suckers, according to some of the 9,000 candy makers gathered here for the first-ever &quot;All-Candy Expo,&quot; a trade show sponsored by the National Confectioners Association.</p>
<p>&quot;Kids have really changed,&quot; said A.G. Atwater, president of Amurol Confections in Yorkville, Ill. &quot;Before, you could amuse a kid with something really simple, but now you have to do a lot more.&quot;</p>
<p>Amurol, a division of the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co., manufactures novelty bubble gum and candy. The company's products include Green Slime bubble gum, which dissolves unless it's chewed quickly, and Grow Gum, which is formulated to expand as it's chewed.</p>
<p>&quot;Kids are just not interested in buying conventional bubble gum,&quot; Atwater said.</p>
<p>If Gummi Bear candy seems too tame, the Herman Goelitz Candy Co. Inc. of Fairfield, Calif., makes a 10-inch long Pet Rat gummi candy in five flavors. It comes with care and feeding instructions.</p>
<p>&quot;This is really fun, gross stuff,&quot; said Rob Muller, marketing manager for Herman Goelitz. &quot;It sells really well with children eight to 12.</p>
<p>For the action junkies, Tapper Candies, Inc. offers the Trembler, a vibrating lollipop holder that comes with a Tootsie Pop.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the one everyone wants to come play with and touch,&quot; said Michele Fite, vice president of marketing for the Cleveland-based candy company.</p>
<p>Also from Tapper is a line of candy-dispensing electronics that includes cameras, banks and soon to come -- a video camera.</p>
<p>&quot;Kids want all the electronics that their parents use,&quot; said Fite.</p>
<p>From Roswell, N.M., where legend has it aliens landed 50 years ago, come Alien Pops and UFO Space Pops.</p>
<p>The UFO Space Pop is armed with a lollipop missile, light and sound and has enough sugar to send kids into orbit.</p>
<p>Another offering is the Cow Pie, which is made of chocolate, pecan and carmel and resembles cow droppings.</p>
<p>&quot;We sell a pile of them,&quot; said Lennis Roney, owner of Baraboo Candy Co. in Baraboo, Wis.</p>
