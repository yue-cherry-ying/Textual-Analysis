<p>Hungarian securities house New York Broker Budapest revised its short-term recommendation upwards to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;hold&quot; it assigned in March for meat processor Pick Szeged Rt , on technical reasons.</p>
<p>At the same time New York Broker Budapest left Pick's long-term recommendation unchanged at &quot;buy&quot;.</p>
<p>Analyst Gabriella Bor supported the &quot;buy&quot; ratings by fundamental and technical reasons, and said she expected Pick to benefit from rising domestic demand for the company's products and its expansion on the Russian market.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic demand is expected to rise as living standards improve and also as a result of (Pick's) active marketing activity and its new products,&quot; Bor said.</p>
<p>The analyst estimated Pick's earnings per share (EPS) rising to 1,126 forints by the end of 1997 from 903 at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>She saw Pick's consolidated after-tax profit rising to 2.99 billion forints on sales of 34.50 billion this year.</p>
<p>In 1996 Pick posted an after-tax profit of 2.43 billion on sales of 28.56 billion.</p>
<p>The analyst said the company could expect declining interest expenditures, &quot;therefore its financial losses are approaching zero&quot;.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 1997 Pick reduced its consolidated net financial loss to 0.6 million forints from 87.2 million forints in the same period of 1996.</p>
<p>Looking at technical factors, Bor said there was strong support level at 10,700 forints and &quot;the price of the share was unlikely to fall below that.&quot;</p>
<p>She added that Pick's price was above the shorter-term moving averages which makes a rising trend probable.</p>
