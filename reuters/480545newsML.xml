<p>Taiwan's construction shares rose strongly at mid-morning on Tuesday on expectations of strong April sales in the beleaguered property market, brokers said.</p>
<p>After 65 minutes, constructions had risen 2.25 percent to outperform the overall index, which was up 1.47 percent.</p>
<p>Pacific Construction climbed T$1.2 or 4.03 percent to T$31 and Pao-Ku Co rose the daily seven percent limit to T$85.5.  </p>
<p>Brokers said construction firms, eyeing signs of a market recovery, had launched aggressive ad campaigns promoting planned residential buildings worth some T$200 billion, hoping to lure homebuyers into their sales rooms during the March 29-30 and April 4-6 holidays.</p>
<p>The United Daily News on Tuesday reported that real estate brokers enjoyed average sales growth of 40 percent in March, with brokers expecting even better performance in April.</p>
<p>&quot;With the government's continuous bullish attitude toward the property market, the market is expected to recover gradually,&quot; said HSBC James Capel analyst Alex Chen.  </p>
<p>Last week, the interior ministry said it was arranging T$61.477 billion in credits from the cabinet's Medium- and Long-term Funds to offer low-cost loans for first-time homebuyers.</p>
<p>The proposal was similar to a 1994-95 central bank scheme that offered some T$100 billion in low-cost loans to first-time homebuyers in a bid to boost the sluggish property market.</p>
