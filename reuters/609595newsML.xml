<p>Share prices across India drifted lower on Friday in anticipation of an increase in oil prices by the government over the weekend, brokers said.</p>
<p>The steering committee of India's 15-party coalition government is scheduled to meet on Sunday to decide on ways to tackle a huge oil pool deficit.</p>
<p>Traders expect the government to raise prices of some petroleum products, which India imports but sells below world prices to domestic customers, to offset the ballooning deficit.</p>
<p>The benchmark Bombay index fell 24.41 points to 3,706.37 and the National exchange index lost 3.50 points to 1,033.70.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was some stagnation,&quot; said Rasesh Maniar, dealer at brokerage Mukesh Babu Securities. &quot;People know the (oil price) hike is coming and they're waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>Activity was mainly in Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) which fell 4.25 rupees to 173.50 ahead of results.</p>
<p>After markets closed TISCO said its profits fell sharply due to sluggish global market, cheaper imports, tight money and fresh capacities going on stream.</p>
<p>In unofficial evening kerb deals the share was quoted at 168, traders said.</p>
