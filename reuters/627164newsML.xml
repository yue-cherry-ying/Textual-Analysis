<p>She was the reporter who once told mass murderer Charles Manson to shut up and she was even tougher on any copy editor who dared to change her stories.</p>
<p>In the days before television cameras were allowed into the courtroom -- back when notebooks were more important to reporters than blow dryers -- Theo Wilson was the camera for millions of readers, the greatest trial reporter in American journalistic history and about as gutsy as they came.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh shut up, Charlie,&quot; she told Manson as he launched into a monologue about reporters having &quot;bad karma&quot; during a break at his trial. The case had gone on for so long Manson had become part of the furniture, and reporters were not interested in another one of his rants.</p>
<p>Charlie did as he was told and shut up, just as the rewrite desk at the New York Daily News usually left her copy alone -- after she called them a bunch of &quot;dirty bastards&quot; and then bought them all a drink. When tiny Theo Wilson spoke or wrote, people paid attention. The only question anyone had of her was &quot;Theo, what's the lead?&quot;</p>
<p>She once dressed up as a chambermaid to interview the Beatles, who fell for the ploy and talked their mop-top heads off in the days when they did not talk to anyone.</p>
<p>The Daily News, once the largest paper in the United States with 2.5 million copies a day, would trumpet her stories on placards slapped across their trucks. The paper sold 100,000 extra copies on the day schoolmistress Jean Harris was found guilty of murdering her cold-hearted diet doctor lover because readers wanted to know what Theo saw.</p>
<p>SHE SAW IT ALL</p>
<p>Theo saw it all, pouring out thousands of words a day on a major story and painting as vivid a picture of a courtoom as any television camera -- but a thinking person's portrait that separated the wheat from the chaff and zeroed on on the moments that mattered.</p>
<p>She covered the Pentagon Papers case, the Sam Sheppard murder trials, the Claus von Bulow trials, the Robert Kennedy assassination case, the Patty Hearst case, the Manson trial, Son of Sam and many, many others.</p>
<p>After weeks of listening to what a terrible childhood Robert Kennedy's murderer, Sirhan Sirhan, had -- according to defence psychiatrists -- she fashioned this lead: &quot;Sirhan, Sirhan is sick, sick, sick.&quot;</p>
<p>Wilson died in January as she was about to step into a waiting limo that was to take her to the first of a round of interviews to promote her memoirs, &quot;Headline Justice.&quot;</p>
<p>With her death, the publishers assumed the book she spent years writing, between telephone calls from friends, would die as well. But that did not happen, thanks to her legion of friends, especially her &quot;best-best&quot; friend, the Associated Press's Linda Deutsch, who covered trials with Wilson for around 30 years. The two of them were known as &quot;Thelma and Louise,&quot; &quot;The Snoop Sisters&quot; and collectively as &quot;Thinda.&quot;</p>
<p>Deutsch has used her own vacation time and money to travel the country and appear on TV shows and in bookstores to promote the book, enlisting the aid of lawyers who, in her words, &quot;appeared before&quot; Theo, and even defendants like Daniel Ellsberg, the man who leaked the Pentagon Papers.</p>
<p>O.J. LAWYERS LACKED &quot;KLASS&quot;</p>
<p>It was not a hard sell; everyone respected Wilson because she had rules and followed them. One of her rules would have put the lawyers in the O.J. Simpson case to shame: do not accept leaked material from lawyers or shill for one side or the other. She thought the lawyers in the O.J. case lacked class, or &quot;klass&quot; as she would say in her New York accent.</p>
<p>As far as Wilson was concerned, a reporter reported what was said in the courtroom, not the hype delivered outside by lawyers seeking to spin things for their clients.</p>
<p>But that did not mean she was blind to a good story. When offered a chance to interview Southern belle Candace Mosler, accused of having her nephew/lover murder her rich husband, Wilson showed up, notebook at the ready.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; she asked, wasting no time beating about the bush, &quot;how do you feel about being accused of murder and incest?&quot;</p>
<p>Mosler thought about the question and answered, &quot;Well, Honey, nobody's perfect.&quot;</p>
<p>Deutsch's crusade is paying off. The book is in its second printing and a whole generation of American journalists is learning that their job is to be a camera, not a fashion accessory.</p>
