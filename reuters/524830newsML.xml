<headline>U.S. denies Latin jazz star Sandoval citizenship.</headline>
<dateline>MIAMI 1997-04-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>The United States has turned down a request for citizenship by Latin jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, who defected from Cuba seven years ago, the musician said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;I was really surprised and disappointed. It's a case of injustice,&quot; Sandoval said on Miami's Channel 7 news.</p>
<p>The Grammy-winning Sandoval, who has played at the White House and performed at this year's Oscar awards ceremony, said the Immigration and Naturalisation Service told him in a letter his citizenship request was denied because he had been a member of the Cuban Communist Party.</p>
<p>He said prominent musicians in Cuba were required to be party members, although he was not a communist.</p>
<p>&quot;In my situation, I don't have any citizenship,&quot; said Sandoval, now a Miami resident.</p>
<p>Sandoval, who was championed by the late jazz great Dizzy Gillespie while still based in Cuba, defected in July 1990 when he ran into the U.S. Embassy in Rome while on a European tour. His first album after his defection was called &quot;Flight to Freedom.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he would appeal the ruling.</p>
