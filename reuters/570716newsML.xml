<p>A British judge Thursday ordered Abbas Gokal, former head of the biggest single borrower from the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, to pay 2.9 million pounds ($4.8 million) for conspiring to account falsely and conspiracy to defraud.</p>
<p>The judge ruled at London's central criminal court that, if Gokal failed to pay the fine, he would be ordered to serve three years in prison, concurrently with any jail sentence he might impose.</p>
<p>Gokal was found guilty in April of conspiring to account falsely and of conspiracy to defraud following a trial lasting nearly five months.</p>
<p>He was due to be sentenced later and faces a maximum prison sentence of 17 years. He was the fifth person to be convicted for his part in the biggest known banking fraud.</p>
<p>BCCI collapsed in 1991 with debts of more than $12 billion after evidence emerged of widespread money laundering. Thousands of people lost their savings in the biggest fraud in banking history.</p>
<p>Gokal, 61, had been found to have masterminded, along with BCCI officials, a massive fraud totalling around $1.2 billion.</p>
