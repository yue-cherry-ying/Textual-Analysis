<p>Turkey's Islamist-led government suffered another series of body blows on Friday, pushing it closer to collapse after months of political gridlock.</p>
<p>A secularist cabinet member resigned, citing what he said were government Islamist leanings at odds with Turkey's decades-old tradition of keeping party politics out of the mosque.</p>
<p>And a far-right powerbroker refused a government invitation to form a broader coalition to ward off an anti-Islamist campaign by the secularist army.</p>
<p>Analysts said President Suleyman Demirel, who usually stays out of party politics, might have to step in.</p>
<p>&quot;We look like we're heading for a Demirel-appointed technocrat government in the summer and elections by the autumn,&quot; said a senior Western diplomat.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, modern Turkey's first Islamist leader, has said he would step down in favour of his conservative coalition partner Tansu Ciller by the end of this month and go for snap polls.</p>
<p>No date has been fixed for early elections, but on Friday leading Islamist deputy Salih Kapusuz told reporters that he saw no problem with the handover of the prime minister's post to Ciller by June 18.</p>
<p>A senior MP from her True Path Party said late on Thursday an announcement would be made on June 17 on the handover of power to Ciller, who previously served as Turkey's first woman prime minister.</p>
<p>The handover and polls would have to be approved by the president and parliament, where Erbakan lacks a clear majority.</p>
<p>Demirel, an avowed secularist, can block the planned power transfer, appoint a caretaker government and call polls himself if no viable coalition becomes apparent within 45 days of Erbakan's standing down.</p>
<p>However, the president said it was too early for him to play an active role. &quot;The head of the government comes and hands me his resignation. After that, I go on the stage but not until then,&quot; Anatolian news agency quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>Tourism Minister Bahattin Yucel quit on Friday, becoming the fourth minister from Ciller's conservative True Path Party wing to ditch the coalition in two months.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt that it went against my parliamentary oath to stay in power, with the contradictions to our country's values that were involved,&quot; Yucel told a news conference.</p>
<p>Istanbul shares closed 2.7 percent down on the political uncertainty. The general index had dropped 5.72 percent at one point in mid-afternoon, a steep plunge even by the standards of Turkey's volatile market.</p>
<p>NATO member Turkey has not had stable rule since a right-left coalition collapsed in 1995. Now, months of open criticism from the generals have brought the current alliance close to imploding.</p>
<p>A right-winger who could hold the balance in parliament said he would not join a caretaker government proposed by Foreign Minister Ciller and Erbakan.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not want to enter a government which is going to an election,&quot; Muhsin Yazicioglu, leader of the Grand Unity Party, said. He had been bargaining with the alliance to become a third coalition partner.</p>
<p>Bringing Yazicioglu and his seven MPs into the fold could have guaranteed the government success in pushing election legislation and Ciller's planned promotion through parliament.</p>
<p>Erbakan has only has 274 MPs in the 550-seat assembly. Two seats are vacant.</p>
<p>Generals have dubbed the Islamists Turkey's public enemy number one and have encouraged judicial crackdowns on illegal religious education classes.</p>
