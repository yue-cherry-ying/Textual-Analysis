<title>THAILAND: Securitisation seen small help for Thai property.</title>

<p>The Thai cabinet on Monday approved in principle a draft law on securitising doubtful assets and debts in a move to help the ailing property sector but analysts do not expect any quick respite for cash-strapped developers.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think this will have an immediate direct impact on them. They will help the banks more,&quot; Philip Sheridan, property analyst at Thaimex Finance and Securities, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The approved securitisation draft bill permits swaps of non-marketable and illiquid assets held mostly in bills receivable and housing loans, into tradable securities and bonds.</p>
<p>Sheridan said commercial banks and finance companies will be main beneficiaries of the measure which would allow them to trim doubtful property loans by selling them to third parties after turning the debts into equities.</p>
<p>The property sector is reeling under a four-year slump with no immediate recovery in sight. Its troubles have threatened the stability of some financial institutions with large exposure to the sector.</p>
<p>Prasarn Trairatvorakul, deputy secretary general of the Securities and Exchange (SEC), said after a cabinet meeting that securitisation is designed to help ease property sector problems by increasing housing loans.</p>
<p>&quot;Financial institutions will be able to raise longer term funds and extend more housing loans to the public,&quot; Prasarn said.</p>
<p>He said securitisation will also help develop the domestic capital market by increasing long-term debt instruments.</p>
<p>The securitisation bill requires parliament ratification, the official said.</p>
<p>Analysts said, however, that securitisation will not directly tackle underlying problems of the property sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The oversupply problem is still there. Developers still do not have cash to complete their projects and buyers are also not in the mood to buy property,&quot; Vikas Kawatra at Asia Equity said.</p>
