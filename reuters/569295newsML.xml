<p>Human rights groups painted a grim picture of Mexico's rights record in a private meeting on Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</p>
<p>The meeting between about a dozen independent local groups and Albright was kept under wraps by U.S. officials worried it would upset an otherwise smooth state visit by President Bill Clinton which was to end on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>&quot;We had about 45 minutes with the secretary to discuss some of the issues that most worry us,&quot; said Marisol Lopez Mendez of the Fray Francisco de Vitoria human rights centre.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the groups said they described to Albright an &quot;alarming&quot; rise in cases of torture, arbitrary arrest and disappearances in Mexico in the past few years, despite closer economic ties with the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;Those of us who document human rights abuse in Mexico have witnessed and chronicled an alarming rise in cases of abuse on an institutional level,&quot; the Fray Francisco centre said in a letter delivered to Albright.</p>
<p>Albright was also told how in the past weeks, Mexico has targeted human rights groups, expelling dozens of rights observers on the grounds they were foreigners who had &quot;abused&quot; their tourist visas and meddled in internal affairs.</p>
<p>&quot;This clearly indicates the government intends to restrict the monitoring of human rights,&quot; said the Miguel Agustin Pro Juarez rights group, which added that several of its members received death threats in recent months.</p>
<p>State Department officials declined to discuss details of the meeting. Mexico is traditionally sensitive about any attempt by foreign officials to talk about what it considers internal issues.</p>
<p>Most of the concern dealt with a reported rise in abuse by the Mexican army, which has been increasingly called upon by the government of Ernesto Zedillo to quell a Marxist guerrilla group, contain a 1994 uprising by Indian Zapatista rebels in the south, and help in the war on drugs.</p>
<p>The groups urged Albright to ensure that Mexico does not misuse U.S. military aid for the drug war by using hardware to clamp down on the guerrillas.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last years, Mexico has purchased a significant amount of military weaponry from the United States,&quot; the Vitoria centre said.</p>
<p>&quot;The argument for arms sales to Mexico is ostensibly to help the war on drugs, but in fact the arms are being used to keep and tighten a military cordon around the Zapatista insurgency,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The United States was not free from blame in the groups' reports. Many said the U.S. government had worsened rights in Mexico by urging the government to curb the drug trade by relying more and more on the military.</p>
<p>&quot;These policies, which originated in your country, are applied here with special virulence which serves the government as an excuse to crack down on growing social and political protest,&quot; wrote Mariclaire Acosta, a prominent Mexican human rights observer.</p>
<p>Acosta added that the United States also prevented change for the better in Mexico by steadfastly supporting Zedillo's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has ruled for 68 years.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States seems to understand Mexico is in crisis, a process of change. But throughout this change the role of your government has not been clear. Despite supporting democracy as the only legitimate form of government, it has systematically supported an authoritarian political system that is in the process of decay,&quot; she wrote.</p>
