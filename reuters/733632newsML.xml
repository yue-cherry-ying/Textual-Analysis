<p>Half-a-million people living in the Gulf Arab emirate of Sharjah are fuming after diesel from a grounded barge got into the local water supply.</p>
<p>Some 2,500 tonnes of diesel spilled off Sharjah's coast on Friday when an oil barge ran aground in shallow waters during high winds, causing a slick which spread across the coast.</p>
<p>Although the barge was towed away on Sunday diesel from the slick got into the desalination plant and pipelines that supply the city with 20 million gallons of fresh water each day.</p>
<p>&quot;Residents are now receiving water but most people are complaining about the sharp smell of diesel in the water being pumped into their tanks,&quot; the local English-language Khaleej Times newspaper reported.</p>
<p>The plant had pumped contaminated water into the city for almost two hours before discovering the slick around its intake valves, an unnamed source told the paper.</p>
<p>A local bottling plant was also shut because of the diesel slick which spread along the coastline, leaving the emirate dependent on limited supplies from deep water wells.</p>
<p>Residents battling against summer temperatures of more than 40 degrees Celsius took little comfort from the local water authority which has warned customers not to use tap water for drinking or cooking for the next two days at least.</p>
<p>&quot;You can smell the diesel in the water. When you try to wash the water is sticky. Because of the heat we need to shower at least twice a day. This is becoming very annoying...Our dinner plates are smelling of oil,&quot; said one frustrated resident.</p>
<p>To get water for cooking, the same resident said he had to take a 30-minute drive to a neighbouring emirate.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm having to use a lot of detergents in the water when I clean the house floors. The whole house smells,&quot; said one Sharjah housewife.</p>
<p>Sharjah is one of seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a leading world oil exporter whose population is mainly composed of expatriates drawn by tax-free living, bustling trade and petrodollars.</p>
<p>The emirate's sheikh or ruler has ordered a 25 percent discount for all water bills in July.</p>
