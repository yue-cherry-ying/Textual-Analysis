<p>U.S. special envoy Bill Richardson held talks with President Laurent Kabila on Saturday in the Democratic Republic of Congo's southern mining capital of Lubumbashi.</p>
<p>Richardson, Washington's ambassador to the United Nations, was heading a team of over a dozen experts from different branches of the U.S. administration, who will brief Kabila's government on international expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;They will be sticking close to the ministers and advising them what the international community wants to see -- but not really telling them what to do,&quot; one U.S. official told Reuters.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said that the initiative was unprecedented for Africa and ressembled something Washington organised for Eastern Europe following the collapse of Soviet Communism there.</p>
<p>Richardson and Kabila met at the Lubumbashi offices of the state mining giant Gecamines.</p>
<p>&quot;We are here with a broad delegation... we are eager to have a dialogue,&quot; Richardson told reporters.</p>
<p>His team included representatives from departments such as defense, the treasury and commerce plus aid and human rights experts.</p>
<p>Richardson was at the centre of diplomatic efforts to ensure what he called a &quot;soft landing&quot; when Kabila's forces arrived in Kinshasa, the capital of the former Zaire on May 17, one day after veteran dictator Mobutu Sese Seko fled the city.</p>
<p>Kabila and his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL) ousted Mobutu after a seven-month civil war. Mobutu had ruled since seizing power in a military coup in 1965.</p>
<p>Kabila proclaimed himself president with sweeping powers and was inaugurated last month. He has promised elections by April 1999.</p>
<p>Zaire, plundered by Mobutu and his cronies, was potentially one of Africa's richest nations with a wealth of minerals, hydroelectric energy potential and rich farmland.</p>
<p>Kabila and his government have flirted in public with the idea of free market economics but he and his team have a Marxist or socialist past and have spoken in favour of state intervention in key sectors.</p>
<p>Ministers have spoken of making certain mining contracts conditional on implementation of socially important schemes such as road building.</p>
<p>Richardson arrived in Lubumbashi from the capital Kinshasa and was due to fly on to the central city of Kisangani where international concern about the plight of Rwandan Hutu refugees has coloured Kabila's takeover.</p>
<p>Kabila's foreign minister, Bizima Karaha, paid tribute to support from the United States and African countries during the civil war. &quot;We would not have achieved all that without African countries, the international community and especially the United States,&quot; he said on Richardson's arrival in Lubumbashi.</p>
