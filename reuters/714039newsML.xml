<headline>FOCUS-Disruption hits BA ahead of strike.</headline>

<p>Disruption came early to British Airways Plc's flights ahead of Wednesday's planned three-day strike by cabin crew when 350 staff reported sick, causing 14 services to be cancelled.</p>
<p>The cancelled flights were all from London Heathrow to domestic and short-haul European destinations. BA said it was doing its best to transfer passengers to other BA services or on to rival airlines.</p>
<p>The developments were on the eve of major industrial action by striking cabin crew, following a breakdown of talks last Sunday over pay and conditions.</p>
<p>The 72-hour strike, scheduled to start in earnest at 0500 GMT on Wednesday and potentially the first of many, may strand thousands of tourists and business travellers.</p>
<p>British travel agents reported on Tuesday they had been flooded with calls from travellers trying to find alternative flights on rival airlines.</p>
<p>BA said Wednesday's strike now looked almost certain to go ahead. &quot;We're working on the assumption that there will be a strike and we're doing our best to minimise the impact on our customers,&quot; a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>BA said its contingency plan, aimed at keeping as many of its flights running as possible, would now swing into action but it admitted thousands of passengers may still be grounded.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if the strike is cancelled today, there is likely to be disruption,&quot; the BA spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Unless a solution is found, the Transport and General Workers Union (T&amp;G), the main union involved in the strike, is threatening to call further 72-hour strikes.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be more strikes unless BA comes to an agreement with the unions,&quot; said T&amp;G spokesman Andrew Murray. The cabin crew would receive &quot;solid&quot; support from workers in foreign aviation unions, he said.</p>
<p>BA has cancelled on Wednesday half its long-haul services from Heathrow and some two-thirds of intercontinental flights from Gatwick. But worst hit will be short-haul and domestic services from Heathrow.</p>
<p>The airline, which operates 1,000 flights a day worldwide, aims to run all its domestic and European flights to and from London Gatwick; all international flights to and from UK regional airports; domestic flights except those serving London Heathrow; and all those operated by its alliance partners.</p>
<p>BA says it expects 3,500 staff belonging to a smaller, non-striking union, Cabin Crew 89, to turn up for work on Wednesday as well as estimated 1,500 staff who are prepared to cross the picket line.</p>
<p>Under British civil aviation law, any flight carrying more than 20 passengers must have at least one cabin crew member per 50 passengers.</p>
<p>BA is ensnared in a separate dispute with ground crew over the sale of its catering division at Heathrow. The workers are expected to announce later today whether they have accepted BA's offer to resolve the row.</p>
<p>The disputes follow the airline's plans to save one billion pounds by 2000 through a major restructuring.</p>
