<p>Indian stocks rebounded in early trade on Tuesday on news that the government was determined to approve the 1997/98 pro-business budget in parliament, despite an ongoing political crisis, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;People want this budget to be passed irrespective of whether this government stays or not,&quot; said the head of an Indian broking firm.</p>
<p>And an initial slump in prices was swiftly reversed by the United Front government's announced aim to pass the budget before Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda took a vote of confidence on April 11.</p>
<p>Bombay's 30-share index jumped 19.31 points, or 0.6 percent, to 3380.20 -- and off the day's low of 3315.36.</p>
<p>Bombay's benchmark stocks index had shed more than 1.0 percent minutes after the open as investors saw no end in sight to the crisis triggered by the Congress party's withdrawal of crucial support to the ruling United Front coalition.</p>
<p>The political bombshell ripped through stocks on Monday, wiping more than eight percent off Bombay's benchmark index.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone's pinning their hopes on this budget because its reformist and it is bound to provide an impetus to industry,&quot; the head of the Indian broking firm said.</p>
<p>In the annual budget for 1997/98 (April-March), Finance Minister P. Chidambaram announced sweeping cuts in corporate and personal taxes. The proposals are scheduled to be voted on in parliament once it reconvenes.</p>
