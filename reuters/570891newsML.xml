<p>Asian dollar deposit rates were little changed in moderate trade on Thursday, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said most traders were sidelined ahead of tonight's release of the U.S. weekly jobless claims figures for the week ended May 3, which are forecast to be around 334,000 compared with 347,000 reported in the previous week.</p>
<p>&quot;The market was quiet and featureless in the morning on lack of fresh factors. Some people are waiting for tonight's release of the weekly jobless claims figures, for fresh clues to market direction,&quot; a local dealer said.  </p>
<p>&quot;But the numbers have been built into the market and most people have squared their positions for the day, so I don't think there will be much impact unless the numbers are way off market expectations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In day-to-day rates, Thursday/Friday, weekend and week-fixed were unchanged from Wednesday's common 5-5/8 5-1/2 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Among longer dates, one-month was unchanged at 5-11/16 5-9/16 percent, three-months unchanged at 5-13/16 5-11/16 and nine-months unchanged at 6-1/8 6 percent.</p>
