<p>The planned deal for a loose union between Russia and Belarus would be costly for Russia and its text has not yet been finalised, the chief government spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the agreement) means taking away some financial resources. To a certain extent it will make the financial situation in Russia more complicated,&quot; Igor Shabdurasulov told a news conference.  </p>
<p>&quot;Even on April 1 this document cannot be considered ready for signing. Even today very serious work is continuing on this document,&quot; said Shabdurasulov. He said some &quot;practical steps&quot; could be taken later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Presidents Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus are expected to sign a Union Treaty between the two Slav states in Moscow on Wednesday. The docment provides for close coordination of foreign, militrary and economic policies.</p>
<p>Shabdurasulov's remarks appeared to reflect a struggle in Russia's political elite over the draft document. Kremlin sources say reformers in the government oppose the deal, but not the idea itself, saying the accord may give too big a role to hardliner Lukashenko and be too costly for Moscow.</p>
<p>Yeltsin on Wednesday dispatched security adviser Ivan Rybkin to Minsk to talk to Lukashenko. &quot;He is charged with meeting...Lukashenko and handing him a message from the president of Russia,&quot; the Kremlin press service said.</p>
