<headline>DASA welcomes Waigel Eurofighter idea.</headline>
<dateline>BONN 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (DASA), the German partner in the four-country Eurofighter project, on Friday welcomed a proposal by Finance Minister Theo Waigel to put together interim financing to build the combat jet.</p>
<p>Waigel, in an interview with the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung, suggested that state aid granted to DASA to pay for the development of its Airbus business could be redirected to the Eurofighter to enable serial production to start up.</p>
<p>&quot;DASA is ready to examine and discuss any proposal by the Finance Minister,&quot; spokesman Christian Poppe said by telephone from DASA's Munich headquarters.</p>
<p>DASA says it is paying a million marks a day into its Eurofighter operations without the guarantee of a firm order from the German government. The aircraft's development has already cost the German taxpayer eight billion marks ($4.7 billion).</p>
<p>Partners Britain and Spain have committed to buying the Eurofighter and Italy's parliament is reviewing procurement.</p>
<p>But the Bonn government has yet to place an order for the 180 Eurofighters, costing 23 billion marks, which Defence Minister Volker Ruehe wants in service by early next century to replace the German air force's ageing Phantom aircraft.</p>
<p>Ruehe, in a recent newspaper interview, did not rule out the possibility that Germany would have to pull out of the Eurofighter. Junior coalition partners the Free Democrats (FDP) have also said that Bonn cannot afford the jet.</p>
<p>A decision on financing is expected in the next few weeks as part of drafting the 1998 budget.</p>
<p>Waigel, struggling to contain state borrowing to qualify this year for European monetary union, suggested that state aid paid to Airbus, which is due for repayment by the year 2000, should instead be redirected to the Eurofighter.</p>
<p>After 2000, the costs of unification and rebuilding eastern Germany's economy should fall, leaving scope for a full financing of the Eurofighter, Waigel told the newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in favour of building the Eurofighter, but we still need the approval of the Bundestag&quot; lower house of parliament, he said. The opposition Social Democrats (SPD) were running a polemical campaign against the project.</p>
<p>DASA's Poppe confirmed the federal government had the right to demand the repayment of the subsidies for the development of the Airbus civilian aircraft it is involved in building.</p>
<p>But he added that agreements governing the privatisation of Germany's Airbus operations stated that no money should be taken back from the company before 2000 in order to ensure that the business has a sound capital base.</p>
<p>Also after the year 2000, the government and DASA's parent Daimler-Benz AG should receive a share of profits from Airbus only if the business is going sufficiently well, he added.</p>
<p>DASA makes Airbus fuselages at its Hamburg-based unit, and is also set to build Eurofighter bodies as part of a total production run planned at over 600 planes.</p>
<p>DASA's Eurofighter partners are British Aerospace Plc, Alenia SpA of Italy and Spain's state-owned CASA. -- Douglas Busvine, Bonn newsroom, 49-228-26097150 ($ = 1.69 German Marks)</p>
