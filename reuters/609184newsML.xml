<p>The overnight interbank rate surged once again to its recent high of 18/20 percent for the weekend against 10/15 percent on Thursday, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said some foreign banks were also short and one large local bank was the only lender in the market, which had pushed up the overnight rate.  </p>
<p>&quot;The rise is probably because foreign banks, who are usually lenders, are also short today,&quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>&quot;It also looks like the market is very short. The Bank Negara bill maturity has not helped at all,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A 500-million ringgit Bank Negara bill issue matured on Friday.</p>
<p>Earlier, other interbank rates were mostly steady despite the maturity.</p>
<p>They said some of the rates had declined on Thursday in anticipation of the increase in liquidity.</p>
<p>&quot;But the liquidity shortage is too huge for rates to fall any further,&quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>One-week and two-week interbank rates were at 10/11 percent, one-month at 8.5/9.0 percent and three-month and six-month at 7.5/8.0 percent, all unchanged from previous levels.</p>
<p>The rise in interbank rates started last Thursday after Bank Negara intervened aggressively in the foreign exchange market to stem the slide of the ringgit. The central bank was said to have sold around $1 billion worth of dollars.</p>
<p>The intervention drained liquidity from the system, causing the market to be short and interbank rates to rise to unusually high levels.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were mixed, though many futures dealers expected a further fall in interest rates.</p>
<p>The three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) contract for June 1997 was down three points at 92.51, or an implied yield of 7.49 percent.</p>
<p>September 1997 contract was up two at 92.60, or 7.40 percent and December was up one at 92.60, or 7.40 percent.</p>
