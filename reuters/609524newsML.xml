<p>German police were on Friday investigating the background of a man they believe could help solve one of the greatest mysteries of World War Two -- the fate of Russia's fabled Amber Chamber, last sighted in 1945.</p>
<p>The man, identified only as Hans A, had handed a fragment of the lost tsarist treasure to a notary's office in the German port of Bremen for safekeeping, a spokeswoman for Berlin justice authorities said.</p>
<p>The office caused a sensation last week by revealing it had the mosaic depicting couples relaxing in a garden which police believe was part of the assembly of amber wall panels and furniture presented to the tsars by Prussia in 1712.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said police had confiscated documents there which led them to Hans A. They searched his flat but he had not yet been taken in for questioning. Hans A. is under investigation on suspicion of fraud, she said.</p>
<p>The notary said Hans A, believed to be the son of a wartime soldier, had wanted to find a buyer for the mosaic.</p>
<p>In his flat, police said they found German army documents for soldiers posted around the imperial Catherine Palace outside St Petersburg, then Leningrad, where the Amber Chamber was kept before it was dismantled and removed by German troops in 1941.</p>
<p>It was last seen in the German city of Koenigsberg, formerly in East Prussia and now Kaliningrad in Russia, just before the German retreat in 1945. The chamber tops Russia's list of missing treasures looted by the Nazis.</p>
<p>Police said on Thursday they had found a lacquered wooden chest inlaid with floral patterns that probably also belonged to the Amber Chamber. The chest and mosaic are being checked by experts for authenticity.</p>
<p>But German police are certain they were part of the treasure.</p>
