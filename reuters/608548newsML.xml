<headline>Copper ends LME stable, aluminium jumps off low.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Base metal prices ended the week on a high note on the LME on Friday, with copper bouncing away from the $2,500 level and aluminium recovering smartly from a mid-afternoon slippage.</p>
<p>However, although these markets were well above their lows, final values were not radically different from Thursday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, business was not over-active, and prices were largely on the defensive ahead of a long holiday week-end in the U.K. and the U.S, where metal markets re-open Tuesday.</p>
<p>Copper spent most of the session around the $2,500 level, before forging higher during the latter part of the session.</p>
<p>&quot;On a weekly chart basis it is a good close at $2,520 - I have the feeling it is building up for another spike,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Copper is seeing a lot of buying interest, and there is still a lot of short-covering to be done,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Prices did run into some resistance above $2,520, but that was only to be expected, given Thursday's high was at $2,530 and there was profit-taking ahead of the holiday weekend.</p>
<p>Last three months trade was at $2,520 a tonne, down $6 from Thursday's kerb close. The cash/threes backwardation was around $78/83.</p>
<p>Aluminium came under pressure in mid-afternoon when fund selling triggered some sell-stops, with the market dropping to $1,610 at one stage.</p>
<p>This market proved resilient at the lows, with the contango narrowing further, and prices jumped back to end the session at an unchanged $1,633.</p>
<p>The cash/threes contango contracted into $10/11, having narrowed persistently over the last three weeks from the financeable level of $30/31.</p>
<p>Nickel dived early, but was supported above the $7,500 level, which suggested technical consolidation. Last trade was at $7,530, down $110 from the previous kerb.</p>
<p>Lead gave up Thursday's gains, but held above $630 to close at $633, an $11 loss. Zinc traded in a narrow band, ending at $1,363, down just $1.</p>
<p>Tin was $60 lower at $5,710, while alloy was steady at $1,500/1,505.</p>
