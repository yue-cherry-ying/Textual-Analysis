<p>Sri Lanka has appealed to the world community to persuade Afghanistan's Taleban Islamic movement to prevent the destruction of giant Buddha statues in that country, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>They said that Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar and Minister for Religious and Cultural Affairs Lakshman Jayakody had met Colombo representatives of Buddhist and Islamic nations to seek their cooperation to ensure that the statues were not harmed.</p>
<p>The two 4th century statues, one of them the world's tallest standing Buddha, in Afghanistan's Bamiyan province are considered sacred by Sri Lanka, where 70 percent of the population follows Buddhism.</p>
<p>A Taleban commander said last week that his purist Islamic militia would destroy the statues on religious grounds after capturing Bamiyan from the opposition Shi'ite Moslem faction of Hezb-i-Wahdat.</p>
<p>&quot;We will destroy them because Islam has forbidden statues,&quot; commander Ahmadzai said.</p>
<p>Officials quoted Kadirgamar as telling a meeting of ambassadors from countries where Buddhism is practised late on Wednesday that he had asked the Sri Lankan High Commission (embassy) in Pakistan to communicate his government's concern to the Taleban.</p>
<p>&quot;With great respect and humility and with limited knowledge of the teachings of Islam, I do not think it could possibly be that Islam would encourage the destruction of objects held sacred by other faiths,&quot; Kadirgamar said.</p>
<p>The United Nations has also expressed its concern to the Taleban. U.N. sources said in Peshawar on Wednesday that the issue had been raised with Mullah Hassan, Taleban governor of the southern Afghan town of Kandahar.</p>
<p>The United Nations has told the Taleban that no action should be taken against the statues and has reminded the militia of a U.N. General Assembly resolution that called last year for the preservation of monuments and culture in war-shattered Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Kadirgamar said the destruction of the statues would be seen as a calamity in Sri Lanka.</p>
