<title>SOUTH KOREA: Seoul stocks close lower on consolidation.</title>
<headline>Seoul stocks close lower on consolidation.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1997-06-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>South Korean stocks ended Saturday's half-day trading session lower as a consolidation eclipsed earlier sharp gains, brokers said.</p>
<p>The composite stock index lost 2.90 points to 762.77 after earlier hitting a new yearlly high of 775.15.</p>
<p>&quot;The market took a rest following recent steep rises,&quot; said analyst Hwang Chang-joong of LG Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;But the underlying market sentiment remains very strong, bolstered by falling interest rates and the strenthening yen.&quot;</p>
<p>Yields on benchmark three-year corporate bonds hit a new 1997 low of 11.52 percent on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The South Korean stock and debt markets were closed on Friday for a national Memorial Day holiday.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors were pinning hopes on the local economy recovering sooner than many had earlier anticipated. Such expectations were spurring active foreign buying, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;The consolidation is expected to continue early next week but the marekt will rise further toward the weekend,&quot; Hwang said. &quot;I'm sure the market is riding a bull-run.&quot;</p>
