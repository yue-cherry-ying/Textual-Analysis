<p>Pen pictures of women's favourites for next week's French Open:</p>
<p>MARTINA HINGIS (Switzerland) - WTA ranking: 1. Age: 16. Height: 1.67 m. Weight: 62 kg. Grand Slam victories: Australian Open (1). Best French Open result: 3rd round 1996.</p>
<p>The world number one returns to competition in Paris with an impressive record of 26 wins in as many matches this season. The 16-year-old Swiss suffered a slight tear of a knee ligament late last month in a riding accident. Whether she has fully recovered will be the main question at this year's French Open, in which she will try to win her second Grand Slam title after the Australian Open in January. Should she succeed, she would not become the youngest winner in Paris. Monica Seles was 16 years and 6 months old when she won here in 1990.</p>
<p>STEFFI GRAF (Germany) - WTA ranking: 2. Age: 28. Height: 1.75 m. Weight: 59 kg. Grand Slam victories: Australian Open (4), French Open (5), Wimbledon (7), U.S. Open (5). Best French Open results: won 1987, 1988, 1993, 1995, 1996.</p>
<p>Like Hingis, Graf will be fighting her way back after three months out because of a knee injury. Everybody will be looking for a final showdown between the German and the teenager who ousted her from the top of the world rankings in March. She returned to action last week in Berlin, losing to her &quot;bete noire&quot;, South African Amanda Coetzer in straight sets. Victory this year would make her only the fourth player to win here three times in succession. A loss would strengthen Hingis' number one ranking.</p>
<p>MONICA SELES (U.S.) - WTA ranking: 3. Age: 23. Height: 1.79 m. Weight: 65 kg. Grand Slam victories: Australian Open (4), French Open (3), U.S. Open (2). Best French Open results: won 1990, 1991, 1992.</p>
<p>After a very promising comeback to tennis late in 1995, Seles has struggled to regain her form of old. Probably the player most suited to win in Paris, as her 1990-92 treble amply proved, she lost in the quarter-finals last year. This season, after missing the Australian Open with a broken finger, she was twice outclassed by Hingis in the Lipton and Hilton Head finals.</p>
<p>ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO (Spain) - WTA ranking: 6. Age: 25. Height: 1.69 m. Weight: 56 kg. Grand Slam victories: French Open (2), U.S. Open (1). Best French Open results: won 1989, 1994.</p>
<p>Like Hingis, Graf and Seles, Sanchez Vicario does not quite know where she stands ahead of the French Open having not won a tournament for over a year. Crashed out of the Italian Open in Rome two weeks ago with a pulled arm muscle.</p>
<p>MARY PIERCE (France) - WTA ranking: 10. Age: 22. Height: 1.80 m. Weight: 61 kg. Grand slam victories: Australian Open (1). Best French Open results: losing finalist 1994.</p>
<p>Booed off court in Paris last year after losing to Germany's Barbara Rittner, Pierce has looked back on track in recent weeks with victory in the Italian Open and a final lost to Mary-Joe Fernandez in Berlin. Wins over Seles and Conchita Martinez have boosted her confidence as she will try to conquer back the hearts of French crowds, who have been generally hostile since her lost final here in 1994.</p>
<p>CONCHITA MARTINEZ (Spain) - WTA ranking: 7. Age: 25. Height: 1.70 m. Weight: 59 kg. Grand slam victories: Wimbledon (1). Best French Open results: semifinalist 1994, 1995, 1996.</p>
<p>The Spaniard failed to confirm her 1994 Wimbledon triumph but she remains one of the leading players in the world on clay and, as a semifinalist for the past three years, will again be a favourite to do at least as well this year.</p>
<p>LEADING OUTSIDERS: Jana Novtona (Czech Republic), Mary Joe Fernandez (U.S.), Iva Majoli (Croatia).</p>
