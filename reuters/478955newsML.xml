<title>CHINA: China activist wife on hunger strike.</title>

<p>The wife of a Chinese dissident held in a labour camp said on Tuesday she had started an indefinite hunger strike to back her demand that authorities allow her to stay with her husband.</p>
<p>&quot;I will fast until I die if necessary,&quot; Wang Hui, wife of dissident poet Zhou Guoqiang said in a telephone interview from Shuanghe in northeastern Heilongjiang province.</p>
<p>&quot;I want the right to live with my husband. Other people regularly have this right to visits of seven days and why should I be denied it?&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Wang said she would only give up her hunger strike if her demand was met.</p>
<p>Wang said she needed to be near her husband, who is serving a three-year term of re-education through labour in the Shuanghe Labour Farm, because of his poor health.</p>
<p>Zhou, 42, was ordered in November 1994 to undergo re-education through labour and was later ordered to serve an additional year after he was caught trying to escape. He still has 11 months to serve before he can be released, Wang said.</p>
<p>Re-education through labour is an administrative punishment with a maximum length of three years that can be imposed by police without recourse to prosecutors or the courts.</p>
<p>Chinese authorities have begun to favour the administrative punishment as a way to remove dissidents from circulation without the complicated process of a judicial trial.</p>
<p>Zhou was suffering from pneumonia, heart problems and kidney problems but had received no treatment for a year, Wang said.</p>
