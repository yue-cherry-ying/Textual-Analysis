<title>NIGERIA: Nigeria bans multiple taxes by government agencies.</title>

<text>
<p>Nigeria's federal government on Tuesday published a list of taxes approved for the three tiers of government in the African country and banned the practice of charging the same tax by different agencies.</p>
<p>&quot;With the publication of the list of taxes and levies collectible by each tier of government, all forms of multiple taxes and levies in the country are abolished,&quot; the ministry of finance said in a statement in the capital Abuja.</p>
<p>&quot;No levy or tax should be imposed concurrently by more than one tier of government in any state,&quot; said the statement, signed by finance minister Anthony Ani.</p>
<p>Taxes approved at federal level include company and petroleum profits taxes, VAT and personal income taxes for armed forces personnel and residents of Abuja federal territory.</p>
<p>State governments can charge personal income taxes, property, business registration while local governments, the lowest tier of authority are entitled to charge a series of small taxes ranging from marriage to vehicle and radio licence.</p>
<p>Streamlining taxation was a key issue promised by the military government in this year's fiscal budget in January in response to state authorities sealing up businesses in a bid to collect taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;The machinery of tax collection does not involve the closure of any business premises, therefore such practice should be discontinued forthwith,&quot; Ani's statement said.</p>
<p>It also barred state and local governments from mounting road blocks to collect taxes and said the police had been given approval to arrest officials setting up such road blocks.</p>
