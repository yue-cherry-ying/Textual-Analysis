<p>Egypt said on Saturday that Israeli and Palestinian representatives would meet in Cairo on Sunday for talks about Middle East peace talks but Israel quickly poured cold water on the report.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of a meeting tomorrow between Israeli and Palestinian representatives was raised but no meeting has been set,&quot; said Shai Bazak, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. &quot;The contacts aimed at reviving peace talks continue,&quot; he told Reuters in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, speaking after Palestinian President Yasser Arafat briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on his latest contacts with the Israelis, said the meeting would be at the level of experts with an Egyptian official present as an observer.</p>
<p>The meeting would discuss &quot;important points connected with the peace process, including settlements&quot;, he added.</p>
<p>Egyptian officials said senior negotiator Saeb Erekat would head the Palestinian side and Yitzhak Molkho the Israeli side.</p>
<p>A PLO official said Molkho was the Israeli adviser who arranged the meeting in talks with Arafat on Friday.</p>
<p>Egyptian and Palestinian officials were not available in Cairo later on Saturday to explain the misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Egyptian state television, in its first evening news bulletin, again reported the plan for Israelis and Palestinians to meet on Sunday. It did not mention the Israeli denial.</p>
<p>Moussa said the Israeli adviser had given Arafat new Israeli ideas to break the deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian talks.</p>
<p>Egypt has been mediating between Israel and the Palestinians in an attempt to revive substantial negotiations, suspended since Netanyahu decided in March to go ahead with a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;What's been put to President Arafat now is some Israeli ideas. One mustn't go into details because that is the right of the Palestinian side, which has its known positions on the (Israeli) settlement policy,&quot; Moussa said.</p>
<p>Arafat arrived in Cairo from Gaza on Saturday morning and PLO officials said he later returned to Gaza.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources said on Friday that Egypt and the Palestinians were working on a five-point plan which included a freeze on any change in the status of Jerusalem and a ban on Jewish settlement of the West Bank for &quot;a sufficient period&quot;.</p>
<p>In return the Palestinians would give a firm commitment to address Israel's security demands, they added.</p>
<p>But the sources said the gap between the two sides remained very wide, especially on the question of the Jewish settlements.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refused to go back on a decision to build 6,500 homes for Jews on the site in East Jerusalem, known to Israelis as Har Homa and to Palestinians as Jabal Abu Ghneim. Bazak denied reports Israel was willing to halt construction at the site.</p>
<p>Palestinians said they were briefed in Cairo on the Egyptian plan and that the Israeli position had not changed.</p>
<p>&quot;Until now there is nothing new from the Israelis, they still refuse to freeze settlement activities,&quot; said Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu Rdainah.</p>
<p>Moussa said on Thursday it was premature to talk about any openings on the Israeli side, particularly since the Jewish state this week outlined a vision for peace in which Palestinians are largely sidelined.</p>
