<title>UNITED NATIONS: EU rebuffed by poor nations on aid commitments.</title>

<p>The European Union, in a puzzling turn of events, was rebuffed by Third World nations when it attempted to negotiate stronger language on foreign aid, the Netherlands' development minister said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The negotiations stopped because developing countries were not interested,&quot; Jan Pronk told a news conference. &quot;It is difficult for Europe now to stick out its neck.&quot;</p>
<p>At issue was one of the most contentious sections in the document that ended the week-long Earth Summit -- the fall in government development aid from most northern countries except those in Scandinavia and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The gathering in New York was to review progress since the landmark 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>Pronk, whose country holds the EU presidency until next week, said he wanted donor countries to &quot;go for an undertaking and reverse the negative trends&quot; in development aid by 2000.</p>
<p>He said the language of the proposed section was not an airtight promise but was stronger than the mere appeal the final document would contain. He said the United States and Japan would have objected to setting a specific deadline for an increase in aid but might have registered their reservations separately.</p>
<p>But he said no African country attended the meeting called by the EU except for Tanzania, as the leader of the Third World bloc at the United Nations.</p>
<p>&quot;There are more confrontations on conceptual, political and ideological concepts than five years ago (in Rio),&quot; he said. There was no immediate explanation from African countries.</p>
<p>He said he suspected that wealthier East Asian counries were not interested in development aid or the EU text, which also called on countries that &quot;have reaped the fruits of economic progress&quot; to make money available to poorer nations.</p>
<p>Pronk characterised the week-long summit as &quot;not a failure but not a big success either.&quot;</p>
<p>He said U.N. review conferences were structured for failure, as too many countries used the opportunity to reopen questions on which they had had objections at previous conferences on population or women or development. The result was often a weaker document than the original, he said.</p>
<p>He said many speeches by prime ministers and presidents had little relationship to what their delegations were negotiating and that too many countries took different positions in U.N. forums discussing development from their stands on related environmental issues.</p>
<p>He said review conferences should register progress made by individual countries, monitor them and draw up a list of &quot;best practices&quot; for leaders to review.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he said, &quot;any new issue would be killed or watered down.&quot;</p>
<p>For example, a tax on aviation fuel did not need to be accepted by the entire world all at one time, he said. European transport, environment and finance ministers might discuss implementing it on European flights only, he added.</p>
