<p>A year after emerging from an arms embargo, Croatia's weapons industry has made an impressive debut at an international arms show but analysts warn of hidden dangers in ambitious export plans.</p>
<p>Military experts and economists say state-subsidised military production for export could harm an economy undergoing privatisation after decades of Yugoslav communism.</p>
<p>Croatia used its war of independence against the Yugoslav army and Serb insurgents in 1991-95 to upgrade its range of old Soviet-made weapons systems and develop new ones.</p>
<p>Alan, a defence ministry agency representing arms makers in Croatia, exhibited 122 items at the IDEX '97 arms show in the United Arab Emirates city of Abu Dhabi in mid-March.</p>
<p>Among potential export favourites were the main battle tank M-84 AB, based on a Yugoslav variant of the popular Soviet T-72; a fast assault ship RTOP 21; and a 20mm tactical rifle RT-20.</p>
<p>RT-20 is a high-calibre tactical sniper rifle with an effective range of more than 1,800 metres (5,905 feet) used for special tasks, a unique Croatian product based on its war experience.</p>
<p>After independence, Zagreb managed to build up a modern high-tech army by the ingenious evasion of a United Nations arms embargo.</p>
<p>Combining domestic production and imports of parts bought on the black market, Croatian firepower vanquished Serb rebels in Croatia and helped Moslem allies roll back Serb forces in Bosnia, setting the stage for the 1995 Dayton peace treaty.</p>
<p>PROBLEMS IN CHANGING FROM BUYER INTO SUPPLIER</p>
<p>But there are problems in transforming a large arms buyer into a large supplier and they are illustrated in the case of Croatia's hallmark military product -- the M-84 AB tank.</p>
<p>The head of Alan, General Vladimir Zagorac, said Croatia could produce up to 200 a year in the Djuro Djakovic factory in Slavonski Brod, east of the capital Zagreb, but some military experts question this.</p>
<p>What Zagorac failed to acknowledge, they say, is that the industry is not ready to mass produce the tank because it lacks facilities for manufacturing several crucial components.</p>
<p>At the moment, the tanks are put together largely from imported parts and the situation is not likely to improve in the short term, said military commentator Igor Alborghetti.</p>
<p>It would be easier for Croatia to purchase tanks abroad than spend taxpayers' money on such complex and dubious projects, he wrote in the independent weekly Globus.</p>
<p>OTHER PROBLEMS</p>
<p>Other problems marring the prospects of building a strong export-oriented military industry in Croatia are the small domestic market and a relative lack of resources for research and development.</p>
<p>Experts question the rationale behind a grand plan to put a small country like Croatia in a position to compete in a lucrative but highly competitive world arms market with the likes of the United States, France and Germany.</p>
<p>Apart from the high production costs, an additional limiting factor is the fact that Croatia does not produce certain strategic raw materials or some types of explosive.</p>
<p>Economists, for their part, say keeping and developing a large, state-owned military industry, which can hardly be profitable, would exert continued pressure on the budget and tempt protectionism.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the fact that the war has ended, Croatia still spends some 7-8 percent of its Gross Domestic Product on defence, which is almost three times the standard,&quot; said Zarko Miljenovic, chief economist at Zagrebacka Banka.</p>
<p>Subsidising an expanded state military sector could frustrate efforts to cut defence spending to more reasonable levels, a key condition for long-term economic growth.</p>
<p>It could also prompt various protectionist measures to save companies of &quot;special interest&quot; from competition, which in turn would damage the country's productivity, Miljenovic said.</p>
