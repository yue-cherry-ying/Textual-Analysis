<p>New Zealand's International Trade Minister on Tuesday welcomed an agreement with Taiwan that will substantially cut tariffs and improve export access.</p>
<p>Lockwood Smith said in a statement the liberalisation deal, the result of negotiations running alongside Taiwan's application to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO), would boost exports to New Zealand's seventh largest market.</p>
<p>&quot;It means better access for all of New Zealand's main exports to Taiwan, including dairy and forestry products, beef and seafood,&quot; Smith said.  </p>
<p>Although most of the concessions will come into force only when Taiwan joins the WTO, some changes will take immediate effect. These include lower tariffs on butter (halved to five percent), cheese (to five percent from 20 percent), and an early cut in the tariff on beef to NZ$27 from $30 a kilo ahead of a planned phase-in of a cut to $10 per kilo after WTO accession.</p>
<p>As well as moves that should improve the competitiveness of key dairy and meat products, New Zealand has also secured the phasing out of import bans on fisheries products, including squid and mackerel.  </p>
<p>Smith said he hoped that both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan would enter the WTO as soon as possible in light of the linkage of their applications.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the process to be completed in the course of next year,&quot; he said.</p>
