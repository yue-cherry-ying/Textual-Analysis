<p>Allstate Insurance Co said it would reduce boatowners insurance premiums for certain boat owners in Texas, Michigan, Arizona, California, Wisconsin and Connecticut.</p>
<p>In these states, boatowners insurance would fluctuate based on a boat's age, type, value, the age of operators and the type of coverage, the company said.</p>
<p>The new rates were effective for new business effective April 1, it said. They were effective for renewal after May 16, the company said.</p>
<p>Allstate said it also introduced two new discounts for boat owners. For boats up to 11 years old, a new boat discount of up to 40 percent was introduced for new and existing customers. A 15 percent discount would be applied to liability, medical payments and physical damage coverage of qualified customers who had both their boats and autos insured with Allstate, it said.</p>
