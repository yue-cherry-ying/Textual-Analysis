<p>Kazakhstan's output of ferro-alloys, including those of chrome, could rise 10-15 percent this year if world metals prices become slightly more positive, the country's main ferro-alloy producer said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;If international markets develop normally, Kazakhstan's output of ferro-alloys could rise by 10-15 percent this year,&quot; Yevgeny Maramygin, aide to the director of the Aksussky Ferro-alloy Plant, told Reuters from the northern town of Aksu.</p>
<p>The Aksussky plant is one of Kazakhstan's two producers of ferro-alloys and accounts for four-fifths of the former Soviet republic's alloys output.</p>
<p>Aksussky has already started up a new furnace with an annual processing capacity of 80,000 tonnes of chrome.</p>
<p>Maramygin told Reuters that by the end of this year or in the first quarter of 1998, the plant would install, with the help of Germany's Mannesmann AG, another $25 million furnace of equal capacity.</p>
<p>Aksussky is part of national chrome company TNK Kazkhrom, whose main shareholder is British Virgin islands-registered Japan Chrome Corporation, which owns a 55.2 percent stake.</p>
<p>Due to lower prices on international markets, Kazkhrom ended 1996 with losses of 126 million tenge after profits of 8.12 billion in the previous year.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan produced 548,800 tonnes of ferro-alloys last year, or 23.8 percent less than in 1995.</p>
<p>Ferro-alloys are important for the production of high-quality stainless and heatproof steels.</p>
<p>Maramygin said the main reason for Aksussky's troubles was a market glut last year.</p>
<p>&quot;We simply could not sell our output, including ferro-chrome, and could only stock it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But, anyway, we are becoming recognised on world markets -- and, besides, our chrome is the best quality in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Kazakh chrome-alloys contained 65-69 percent chrome, while similar alloys offered by major competitors contained 52-55 percent chrome.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan's chrome ore reserves are estimated to be the second largest in the world, and Kazkhrom groups all of Kazakkstan's chrome mines and plants.</p>
