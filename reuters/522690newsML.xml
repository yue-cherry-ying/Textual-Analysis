<p>Cuban President Fidel Castro met Grenada Prime Minister Keith Mitchell at Havana airport on Saturday at the start of a five-day visit to the communist-ruled island aimed at fostering better ties.</p>
<p>Castro and Mitchell greeted each other on the airport tarmac but did not speak to reporters.</p>
<p>The Cuban official news agency Prensa Latina said Mitchell's visit represented a chance for Cuba and Grenada to boost links after setbacks in recent years.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry said earlier this week Mitchell would cover a wide range of issues, including possible future economic cooperation, during talks with Cuban officials. Mitchell, whose country is currently secretary-general of the Association of Caribbean States, is set to hold formal talks with Castro on Monday.</p>
<p>The Grenada premier was also due to meet Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Tourism Minister Osmany Cienfuegos and Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas.</p>
<p>Mitchell is the first senior Grenada official to visit Cuba since leftist leader Maurice Bishop in 1983. Bishop had strong ties with Cuba until his arrest and excution during a political crisis in October 1983. The crisis triggered the U.S. military invasion of Grenada later in October 1983.</p>
