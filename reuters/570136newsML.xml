<p>Dayton Hudson currently operates 1,092 stores in 39 states. This includes 752 Target stores, 276 Mervyn's stores and 64 Department Stores.  </p>

<p>April and year-to-date sales by operating division were as follows:</p>
<p>-- Target's total sales for the month increased 15.6 percent and comparable-store sales increased 6.7 percent. Year-to-date, Target's total sales increased 13.8 percent and comparable-store sales increased 5.2 percent.  </p>
