<headline>Dlr spurred by data, reined by Dow in late Europe.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>The dollar ticked gently higher in late Europe as a cluster of strong U.S. data pointed to strong growth with subdued inflation, but remained down on the day as nerves persisted over U.S. stocks, analysts said.</p>
<p>The National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) index for March came in at 55.0, up from February's 53.1 and way over the consensus forecast of 53.6, but the prices component fell to 50.9 from 55.1.</p>
<p>U.S. February construction spending jumped to 2.3 percent from January's 0.3, far above the expected 0.9, while leading indicators just outpaced forecasts with a 0.5 percent rise.  </p>
<p>&quot;The data basically confirm the economy's growing above trend and the manufacturing sector seems to be gathering momentum, but there are few signs of inflation pressures,&quot; said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International here. &quot;So all in all I think it's good news for the dollar.&quot;</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 1.6716/21 marks at 1553 GMT, down from 1.6772/77 in late Europe on Thursday -- the last trading day here before the long Easter break -- but off its session low of 1.6663 marks.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen was more sluggish, sticking around the day's lows as the mark/yen cross slid around half a yen.  </p>
<p>The U.S. currency stood at 122.40/45 yen at 1602 GMT, well down from late Thursday's rate here of 123.48/53.</p>
<p>Players kept an eagle eye on U.S. stocks, which fell at the open and depressed the dollar, before later edging into positive territory -- dragging the currency up with them.</p>
<p>&quot;The dollar had broken (below) some key levels today, but it's bounced back with the Dow this afternoon as the European session has gone along,&quot; said David Coleman, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy in London.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials index sank 157 points on Monday after falling 140 on Thursday -- an aggregate decline of 4.3 percent.  </p>
<p>&quot;The biggest risk for the dollar in the near term is the equity market,&quot; said DKB's Stamenkovic.</p>
<p>The forex market's close focus on U.S. stocks means the rule-of-thumb that interest rate rises boost currencies may not hold true if the Federal Reserve tightens again, analysts said.</p>
<p>The market widely expects the Fed to follow up last week's quarter-point Fed funds rate hike, but analysts said the likely negative impact on U.S. asset markets could knock the dollar.</p>
<p>With all eyes on the state of the U.S. economy and its implications for monetary policy, the market is now eagerly awaiting non-farm payrolls data for March, due out on Friday.  </p>
<p>Before that, however, the market will scrutinise Japan's quarterly Tankan corporate survey for the first quarter of 1997, to be released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Analysts said a strong Tankan could support the yen as the market re-examined expectations for Japanese interest rates, but was unlikely to change the Bank of Japan's monetary stance as concerns over the financial sector persisted.</p>
<p>In the near term, dollar/yen could be more influenced by U.S. policy towards its currency and perceptions about the Japanese trade surplus, analysts said.</p>
<p>U.S. House speaker Newt Gingrich said overnight that Japan had made some progress in redressing trade imbalances but current forex rates meant its surplus with the United States was becoming a cause for concern.</p>
<p>&quot;If we continue to see signs of emerging trade tensions between the U.S. and Japan, I think the dollar's upside against the yen is going to be somewhat limited,&quot; said Stamenkovic.</p>
