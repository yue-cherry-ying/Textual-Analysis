<p>China has become the most important Asian market for oils, fats and feed ingredients, and investment opportunities are expected to soar as consumption continues to grow, organisers of an industry conference said.</p>
<p>But ongoing changes to China's import and export system mean traders and investors are often in the dark about how to deal with the world's most dynamic economy, officials of the Singapore-based Centre for Management Technology (CMT) said.</p>
<p>The conference, China Oils/Fats &amp; Feed Ingredients Markets '97, will take place in Beijing on June 10-11.</p>
<p>The official press in China reported earlier this year that 1997 domestic soybean output would be more than 900,000 tonnes short of demand.</p>
<p>The Edible Oils Market News said China was expected to produce 13.3 million tonnes of soybeans in 1997, a drop of 200,000 tonnes or 1.48 percent on the 1996 output figure.</p>
<p>This compared to expected 1997 demand for feed and food soybeans of 14.22 million tonnes, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Total consumption of soybeans in 1997 was expected to rise to 14.1 million tonnes, from 1996's 14.83 million tonnes, it said.</p>
<p>China's total annual grain demand is expected to rise to 500 million tonnes by the end of the century as the population hits 1.3 billion, from the current 1.2 billion, Chinese agriculture officials have said.</p>
<p>By 2030, demand will be 640 million tonnes and the population 1.6 billion, according to official projections.</p>
<p>It is figures such as these that has led some expert to predict that China will soon be the world's biggest importer of U.S. farm products.</p>
<p>The U.S. Agriculture Department has said that China's course feed grain imports will rise by more than 10 percent a year into the foreseeable future, with imports expanding an annual four percent.</p>
<p>The conference will examine the global outlook for oils/fats and feed ingredients supply as well as China's long-term consumption patterns in the edible and non-edible sectors.</p>
<p>China's domestic pricing system and recent price trends, as well as the systems for licencing, quotas, tariffs and other control measures will be dealt with, organisers said.</p>
<p>Joint-venture opportunities, management risk, futures trading and issues pertaining to bulk handling, storage and shipment will be the subject of sessions at the conference, they said.</p>
<p>Participants are expected to include representatives of China's State Council, or cabinet, State Planning Commission and State Administration of Grains Reserve, as well as a number of related ministries and Beijing's food trading arm China National Cereal, Oils and Foodstuff Import and Export Corp (COFCO).</p>
<p>International participants will include the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, the Malaysian Palm Oil Promotion Council, and a number of major international trading firms.</p>
<p>CMT can be contacted in Singapore on 65-345-7322.</p>
