<p>The IBM supercomputer Deep Blue and world chess champion Garry Kasparov fought out their second consecutive draw on Wednesday in the fourth game of their $1.1 million re-match.</p>
<p>Kasparov, playing with the black pieces, sacrificed a pawn in the middlegame and then maneuvered to a draw in a complex endgame with only rooks and a few pawns on the board to share the point with the computer. The match is tied at two points after one win each and two draws. One point is awarded for a win and a 1/2 point for a draw.  </p>
<p>Kasparov told reporters he might have had winning chances in the tense game that ended after he accepted a draw offer from Deep Blue's programmers on the 56th move and more than five hours of play.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt I was winning, I thought the pawn sacrifice was good, but I missed something in my time trouble,&quot; said Kasparov, who was always behind the machine on the clock.</p>
<p>The draw was another disappointment for the champion, who had suffered a double embarrassment in the previous two games. In Sunday's second game, analysis revealed Kasparov resigned in a drawn position and on Tuesday he was held to a draw despite playing with the advantage of the white pieces. White makes the first move, similar to holding serve in tennis.</p>
<p>The fifth game of the re-match, part chess contest and part scientific project to test powerful, high-speed computer calculations, was scheduled for Saturday. Kasparov defeated Deep Blue over six games in Philadelphia in February 1996.</p>
