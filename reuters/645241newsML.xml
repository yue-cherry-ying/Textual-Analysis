<p>Japan's Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko on Saturday greeted fans and visited a lettuce farm owned by Japanese immigrants in the southern state of Parana, the next-to-last leg of their 10-day tour of Brazil.</p>
<p>&quot;The entire community is excited about their visit, even the Brazilians,&quot; said a spokeswoman for Cassio Taniguchi, the mayor of Parana's capital of Curitiba.</p>
<p>The imperial couple arrived on Friday night in Parana, home to the second largest colony of Japanese-Brazilians, after two days in Sao Paulo, where most of Brazil's 1.3 million citizens of Japanese descent live.</p>
<p>Brazilians of Japanese descent in mostly rural Parana state flocked to Curitiba, chartering 120 buses. Many awakened before dawn and travelled hours for a glimpse of the imperial couple, news reports said.</p>
<p>Television footage showed one man stepping off a bus waving a large Brazilian flag and shouting: &quot;Banzai! Banzai!&quot;</p>
<p>Asked what the imperial couple represented to her, elderly Mochiko Kato responded: &quot;More than father or mother.&quot;</p>
<p>After meeting with 500 children and elderly on Friday, Akihito and Michiko visited on Saturday the lettuce farm and bonsai garden of 86-year-old Hiroshi Atsumi, who moved to Brazil with his wife and four children in 1959.</p>
<p>&quot;The imperial couple wanted to visit a typical immigrant family, see how they lived,&quot; said the spokeswoman.</p>
<p>&quot;When the family was told they would receive a visit from the emperor, they called their relatives in Japan to tell them. At first, no one believed them,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The imperial couple later had lunch at Curitiba's Botanical Gardens with state Gov. Jaime Lerner and Taniguchi, the son of Japanese immigrants and the first Brazilian Japanese elected mayor of a Brazilian state capital.</p>
<p>&quot;The mayor exchanged gifts with them and they spoke in Japanese,&quot; the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Later on Saturday, the imperial couple was to meet some 12,000 members of Parana state's Japanese-Brazilian community.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Akihito and Michiko were slated to visit a new city library before flying to Rio de Janeiro for the last leg of their Brazil tour.</p>
<p>Making the first Japanese imperial visit to Latin America, Akihito and Michiko will fly on Monday to Buenos Aires for a three-day visit to Argentina.</p>
