<p>Societe Generale, a French bank, on Thursday had no comment on rumors that the bank has bought roughly $1 billion of U.S. municipal bonds in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Details were sketchy, and at least one municipal market source described that figure as &quot;a little on the high side.&quot; However, municipal market sources said the bank appears to be engaged in an investment strategy that involves derivatives and has purchased &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars of bonds,&quot; mainly from New York State municipal bond issuers.</p>
<p>Jeff Stein, a public relations associate at Societe Generale, said the bank had no comment.</p>
<p>&quot;(Societe Generale) have been single handedly a major buyer of municipal bonds,&quot; a market source said. &quot;They are running some sort of derivative program, and they are buying a lot of bonds.&quot;</p>
<p>Societe Generale has been involved in just about every major deal of late, market sources said. One source said he first became aware of their presence on the recent $934 million Port Authority of New York and New Jersey deal.</p>
<p>&quot;They are carving out large, not-reoffered blocks of bonds supposedly paying through the market in order to secure sizeable positions, and they are running a derivative program,&quot; the source said. &quot;...We think that they are doing something against the municipal swap market, the PSA swap market.&quot;</p>
<p>Another municipal source also cited derivatives.</p>
<p>&quot;They are certainly not a traditional tax-exempt buyer so it probably is for other rationales,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A New York City official, who declined to be named, said Societe Generale ordered $100 million in two maturities in a recent bond sale by the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority, closing out both maturities.</p>
<p>&quot;(Societe Generale) did put in that order for water, but we did not know what they did with it,&quot; the city official said.</p>
<p>The official added he had heard a recent sale by the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York also closed a few maturities due to orders by big buyers.</p>
