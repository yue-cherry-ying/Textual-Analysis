<p>Mediterranean oil products were flat to weaker on Tuesday, traders said.</p>
<p>The gas oil arb eastwards was seen to have survived the Easter break and fob cargoes of the right size were attracting good premiums. Traders said a 45,000 tonne Russian cargo should be able to attact high fob quotes +$4 a tonne compared with only high fob quotes +$2 for 30,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Italian 0.2 percent material was offered at high fob quotes +$3.50, but no real bids were seen. &quot;Its looks fairly balanced,&quot; commented one trader.</p>
<p>Gasoline was slightly easier in line with weaker crude.</p>
<p>But traders said the market was extremely quiet.</p>
<p>&quot;With crudes off the market's slipped a bit,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Few saw weaker prices lasting for long with recent fine weather expected to boost end-user demand. Traders also expected the recent wave of refinery maintenance to also boost the market as pre-maintenance stocks began to dwindle.</p>
<p>Naphtha was supported by the continuing stream of material out of the region to the East.</p>
<p>Low sulphur fuel oil markets were balanced to weak. Buyers heard cargoes indicated to them in the $106 to $108 range.</p>
<p>Slack demand was said to be meeting poor supply.</p>
<p>High U.S. freight rates hindered the trans-atlantic arbitrage and the rumour of a large European cargo heading to the Far East tightened the northern market.</p>
<p>High sulphur fuel oil generated interest. Demand was said good from Romania and regional supply limited.</p>
<p>Italian refiner ISAB, which had been expected to offer 60,000 tonnes of high sulphur fuel, experienced production problems six days ago that left it with only 20,000, which it sold to another Italian refiner.</p>
<p>Bad weather had blocked a 50,000 tonne Russian straight run cargo from berthing for three days.</p>
