<headline>Jakarta index ends sharply down on Wall Street.</headline>
<dateline>JAKARTA 1997-04-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Jakarta share prices ended 1.54 percent down on Tuesday following foreign-led selling due to fears of higher interest rates in the United States and renewed uncertainties over local state-controlled firms, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Jakarta composite index tumbled 10.23 points, or 1.54 percent, to close at 652.01 points, after touching a day-low of 649.08 points in late trading.</p>
<p>Total volume was some 303 billion rupiah.  Decliners led gainers by 91 to 37 with some 48 issues unchanged.</p>
<p>The market was closed on Monday due to the financial year-end and on Friday for Good Friday.  </p>
<p>&quot;A lot of players are nervous. The Wall Street falls on Monday because of fears of an interest rate hike had further dampened sentiment on the local market,&quot; one sales manager at a large brokerage firm said.</p>
<p>The sales manager said sentiment was already cautious on news reports last week of riots in the central Javanese town of Pekalongan.</p>
<p>Most state-controlled firms suffered heavy losses due to the riots reports and lingering uncertainties over the government's policy on state-owned firms, brokers said.  </p>
<p>State-controlled telecommunications firm Telkom fell 125 rupiah to 3,550 rupiah after touching a year-low of 3,525 rupiah.</p>
<p>State mining firm Tambang Timah was down 175 rupiah to 3,575 rupiah after briefly touching a year-low of 3,500 rupiah while cement manufacturer Semen Gresik fell 300 rupiah to touch a low of 5,675 rupiah.</p>
<p>Brokers said uncertainties over Indonesia's policy on state-controlled firms still lingered despite government denials of recent news reports that a possible competitor may end Telkom's monopoly ahead of schedule.  </p>
<p>Plywood firm Daya Sakti topped the active list as it fell 125 rupiah to 1,325 rupiah after reports of the government's decision to raise forest fees for cutting logs by 10 percent effective from April 1.</p>
<p>Second-liner trading firm Aneka Kimia rose 25 rupiah to 1,200 rupiah in active trade on renewed talk of a possible merger with starch-based sorbitol manufacturer Sorini. Neither firm was immediately available for comment.</p>
