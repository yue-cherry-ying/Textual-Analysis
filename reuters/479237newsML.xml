<title>USA: Repeal of Florida intangibles tax may go to voters.</title>
<headline>Repeal of Florida intangibles tax may go to voters.</headline>
<dateline>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 1997-04-01</dateline>

<p>A Florida Senate committee has approved a proposal to let voters decide whether to abolish the intangibles tax on stocks, bonds and other investments, the bill's sponsor said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Senate Commerce and Economic Opportunities Committee voted 11-2 Monday to put the constitutional amendment on the ballot.</p>
<p>The bill (SB642) was sponsored by Sen. John Ostalkiewicz, R-Windermere, who also sponsored an earlier version (SB500) that would have eliminated the tax legislatively.</p>
<p>The first bill stalled in the legislature. It would have required the signature of Gov. Lawton Chiles, who was exepcted to veto any effort to repeal the tax because it raises $1 billion a year.</p>
<p>The revised version would require three-fifths approval by both houses but would not need Chiles' signature. Given voters' anti-tax mood, it would be expected to pass in a referendum.</p>
<p>Ostalkiewicz said the tax impairs Florida efforts to attract new businesses because it taxes accounts receivable, as well as stocks, bonds and other financial instruments.</p>
<p>&quot;It inhibits job growth and keeps businesses out of the state. There is not another state in the country as of next year that would have an intangible tax on receivables,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ostalkiewicz said Florida's economy continues to grow fast enough to offset the revenue that would be lost, noting that the state budget grew by $2 billion this year, to $42 billion.</p>
<p>Additionally, he said, the tax is levied on holdings that are already subject to federal income taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;It's double taxation,&quot; Ostalkiewicz said.</p>
<p>His proposal would phase out the tax over five years.</p>
