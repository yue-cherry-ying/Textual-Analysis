<p>British discount supermarket chain Kwik Save Group Plc would like to see its like-for-like sales recover to be unchanged or positive by the end of this calendar year, chief executive Graeme Bowler told journalists at a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to arrest the like-for-like decline, to neutral or positive by the end of the calendar year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kwik Save said earlier on Thursday that same store sales in the first seven weeks of the second half were down six percent, after a fierce price war this time last year brought in new customers from the catering trade.</p>
<p>Bowler said the company estimated that exceptional trading last year accounted for around two percent of the comparable decline.</p>
<p>He added that although currently the group did not expect a repeat of the price war, which saw retailers selling tins of baked beans as cheaply as three pence per can, &quot;we are in an industry which tears itself apart periodically and we can't stay on the sidelines.&quot;</p>
<p>Kwik Save reported on Thursday that half-year, pre- tax profits before exceptionals inched up to 44.8 million stg from 44.2 million stg previously and paid out an unchanged dividend of 5.95 pence per share.</p>
<p>The group is undergoing a three-year restructuring programme aimed at boosting sales and profits.</p>
<p>Bowler said although the company had been expecting a fall in sales during the current period,&quot;We weren't expecting them to be down six percent&quot;.</p>
<p>He said the recovery strategy was &quot;a long programme&quot;, but added that it would be a demonstration of the company rewarding shareholders for their patience if possible.</p>
