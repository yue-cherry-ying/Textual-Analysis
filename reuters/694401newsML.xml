<p>Timorese activist and Nobel laureate Jose Ramos Horta on Saturday criticised Chile for its close ties with Indonesia and forgetting the world's support for Chileans' own efforts against the Pinochet military regime in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>Horta, visiting Chile as part of a Latin America tour, said at a news conference that Chile's close economic ties with Indonesia were blinding it to repression in East Timor. He said he had a &quot;distressing&quot; meeting with Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza.</p>
<p>Chileans, he said, had forgotten the world's support for their fight against the military rule of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, when the country faced international isolation until he yielded power to civilians in 1990.</p>
<p>&quot;We the Timorese struggled side by side with the Chileans in the 1970s, as thousands of people did, out of the desire to help Chile reach peace and democracy ... But Chilean society has a very short memory,&quot; Horta said.</p>
<p>Chile has growing trade ties with Indonesia, a major buyer of Chile's top export copper and its partner in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</p>
<p>Last year Chile abstained when the U.N. Human Rights Commission passed a resolution criticising human rights abuses by the Jakarta government in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand that Chile has economic relations with Indonesia (but) I am convinced that it's possible to reconcile economic interests with a firm stand in support of peace and justice in the world,&quot; said Horta, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996.</p>
<p>Indicating that he won little support in a meeting with Insulza, the leading socialist in President Eduardo Frei's centre-left coalition Cabinet, Horta said, &quot;It was distressing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was not like meetings in Brazil or Ecuador, where we we could thank those countries for their support,&quot; said Horta. He also criticised Chile's &quot;provincial&quot; news media, which has almost completely ignored his visit.</p>
<p>Horta won public support from leaders of Chilean political parties, including the socialists, and said he hoped they would persuade Frei's government to change its position on East Timor.</p>
<p>Indonesia occupied East Timor in 1975 after civil war erupted following Portugal's withdrawal from its colony. Toppling the leftist party that had established a de facto government, Indonesia incorporated East Timor as its 27th province in 1976. The annexation has not been recognised by the international community.</p>
<p>After an initial two days of U.N.-sponsored meetings, the foreign ministers of Portugal and Indonesia agreed last week that senior officials of the two sides would hold intensive talks beginning on July 28.</p>
