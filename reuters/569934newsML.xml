<p>Indian edible oil prices eased slightly during the week on the domestic market due to increased arrivals of imported oils, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market for edible oil is weak because of high imports of palm olein, soybean and sunflower oil,&quot; said Navinbhai Shah, president of the Bombay Oilseeds and Oil Exchange Ltd.</p>
<p>Shah said India's edible oil imports in May were estimated at 100,000 tonnes compared with around 75,000 tonnes in the previous two months.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices are coming down in the short term,&quot; said G.K. Sood, chief executive of the Vanaspati Manufacturers Association of India.</p>
<p>But in the longer term prices would go up with the start of the lean season for edible oils in June, Sood said. Price movements would be subdued if the monsoon was good and timely.</p>
<p>India's monsoon starts in June and lasts till September.</p>
<p>Shah said India's monthly import of palm olein and other oils in June and July were also expected to be around 100,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Traders said domestic prices of palm olein had dropped to 28,900 from 30,000 rupees per tonne ten days ago while groundnut oil was currently quoted at 36,200 rupees per tonne compared with 37,500 rupees last week.</p>
<p>Shah said prices had also eased due to groundnut arrivals from the Saurashtra region in Gujarat. India's edible oil imports in 1997/98 (April-March) were estimated at about 1.1 million tonnes, the same as 1996/97, he said. --Hari Ramachandran, New Delhi newsroom +91-11 301 2024</p>
