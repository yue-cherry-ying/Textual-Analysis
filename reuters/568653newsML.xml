<p>Guingamp will become a ghost town on Saturday with more fans at the Parc des Princes in Paris for the French Cup final against Nice than the whole population of the tiny Britanny market town.</p>
<p>&quot;It's going to be very hot,&quot; a Guingamp resident said on Thursday. &quot;People have talked about nothing but the final. On Saturday Guingamp will be a ghost town. There are already 12,000 of us leaving here for the Parc.&quot;</p>
<p>Guingamp, whose team climbed from the third to the first division in three years, has only 8,700 inhabitants, although the number swells to 22,000 when the population of surrounding villages is included.</p>
<p>The club, whose full name is Go Ahead Guingamp, had never previously progressed beyond the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>But the players appear to be the calmest people in town as they prepare for the clash with relegated Nice, going about their training as usual while the fans deck their windows with the black and red team colours.</p>
<p>At their Roudourou ground, coach Francis Smerecki has brushed off criticism for fielding reserves in recent league games while he prepares his side for their match of the season after ensuring first division survival.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to ensure we don't get carried away by the possibility of becoming the cup holders,&quot; he said. &quot;Before that there is football and a match to play.&quot;</p>
<p>Both sides appear evenly balanced after winning away in their two league encounters this season, Guingamp 2-1 at Nice in August and Nice 1-0 in Britanny in December.</p>
<p>Smerecki, who took charge in 1992 when Guingamp were in the third division and guided them through the Intertoto Cup to the first round of this season's UEFA Cup, has a few worries as he prepares to take his side to a secret location in Paris on Friday.</p>
<p>Key defender Jerome Foulon and playmaker Stephane Carnot are both nursing pulled thigh muscles.</p>
<p>&quot;We are halfway between doubt and hope,&quot; Smerecki said, though he has hinted Carnot, who has scored twice in the competition, will play.</p>
<p>Smerecki's chief concern is up front with Guingamp, despite playing a fit Liberia international Christopher Wreh, having failed to score in their three leagues games since beating Montpellier 2-0 after extra-time in their cup semifinal.</p>
<p>Guingamp will have a special fan at the Parc des Princes, former chairman Noel Le Graet, now president of the French League.</p>
<p>Le Graet, the current mayor of Guingamp, played a major part in the club's rise from the third division on a limited budget that even now, at 44 million francs ($7.6 million), is one of the lowest in the first division.</p>
