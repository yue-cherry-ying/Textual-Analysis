<headline>Taiwan to issue T$3 bln in certificates of deposit.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Taiwan's central bank said on Friday it would issue T$3 billion in two-month negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) later in the day.</p>
<p>Bids would close at 3.00 pm (0700 GMT), a central bank official said.</p>
<p>During a sustained stock rally in March and April, the central bank repeatedly issued NCDs, a move seen as aimed at keeping a lid on the loose liquidity that many experts said had been fuelling the stock market's upward surge.  </p>
<p>The central bank has confirmed that it was responding to the liquidity sitution but denied that it was acting directly in response to the stock market bull run.</p>
<p>The stock market in recent week has entered a consolidation phase with recent daily turnover plunging to less than half of the record levels set during the big rally.</p>
