<title>FRANCE: Single-engine copter fails trans-Atlantic flight.</title>
<headline>Single-engine copter fails trans-Atlantic flight.</headline>

<p>A leak in a fuel tank prevented two French pilots on Saturday from carrying out the first non-stop trans-Atlantic flight by a single-engine helicopter.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a breakdown -- a leak in a reserve fuel tank,&quot; a spokeswoman for the attempt said.</p>
<p>&quot;The helicopter has put down on an ocean barge. The leak would require welding and cannot be repaired, so the barge will carry them back to Gander in Canada,&quot; the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The helicopter had flown some 2,800 km (1,740 miles), a little more than halfway across the Atlantic, when it was forced to call off the flight, she added.</p>
<p>The Eurocopter ASTAR 350 B3 helicopter piloted by Philippe Boutry, 45, and Gerard David, 55, had lifted off from a small airfield at Teterboro, near New York, at about 2.15 p.m. EDT (1815 GMT) on Friday.</p>
<p>It had been expected at Le Bourget airport near Paris 27 hours later.</p>
<p>Equipped with special tanks and other gear enabling it to be refuelled in flight, it was scheduled to take on fuel five times -- at Fredericton, New Brunswick, and Gander, Newfoundland, and from tugs between Newfoundland and Europe.</p>
<p>The flight, sponsored by Eurocopter Group and Intertechnique Group, a French flight equipment company, had been designed to display in-flight refuelling equipment and techniques.</p>
<p>Eurocopter is owned by France's Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale and Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA).</p>
<p>The Atlantic has been flown non-stop several times by multi-engine helicopters that refuelled en route.</p>
