<p>Schalke and Internazionale Milan's dismal UEFA Cup final first leg provided perfect ammunition for those who have argued for the final's two-match format being scrapped.</p>
<p>Apart from a spectacular goal from Belgian Marc Wilmots which kept alive Schalke's dream of their first European trophy, the game was a dreary tactical, defensive affair which provided little excitement for the neutral observer.</p>
<p>It was a game dominated by fear. Both sides appeared afraid to push forward too much in case they gave away a goal.</p>
<p>Even Schalke, who face an immense task to keep their lead when they visit Milan's intimidating San Siro stadium for the second leg in two weeks, failed to use their home advantage to the full despite an enthusiastic capacity crowd of more than 56,000.</p>
<p>Both sides gave the impression that the final would  really start in the second leg.</p>
<p>&quot;We said that we didn't want to lose a goal and we wanted to score one if possible,&quot; Schalke's captain Olaf Thon said.</p>
<p>Although all of the three European club competitions play earlier rounds over two legs, the UEFA Cup is the only tournament which has a two-leg final.</p>
<p>The format provides clubs with extra revenue from television and gate receipts. But it is debatable whether large numbers of fans outside Germany and Italy would have kept their televisions tuned in to Wednesday's dour affair for the whole game.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most significant moments came in the middle of the second half when a frustrated Wilmots stood in the middle of the pitch and waved at his players to put pressure on Inter.</p>
<p>It was a gesture of King Canute effectiveness. In the end the Belgian took matters into his own hands.</p>
<p>In the 70th minute he picked up the ball in the middle of the Inter half, took a few strides towards the edge of the box and fired the ball low into the left-hand corner.</p>
<p>Wilmots admitted afterwards he had few other options but to have a speculative shot at goal. Schalke were hardly throwing players forward with abandon.</p>
<p>&quot;We've still got half a job to do. Some might say it was a weak performance from Schalke but we didn't see much of Inter either,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The fact that Inter were not a full strength because of the suspension of French defender Jocelyn Angloma, England midfielder Paul Ince and Frenchman Youri Djorkaeff, could account for some of their hesitant play.</p>
<p>But the Italians, winners of the Cup twice in the 1990s, have a much stronger squad than their German rivals who have not won a trophy of any sort since 1972. Inter could have produced a lot more.</p>
<p>One of the most important factors for the home side was that several of their players were carrying yellow cards and were therefore in danger of missing the second leg through suspension.</p>
<p>Those worries would not have been a factor in a one-match final. Gelsenkirchen could have been spared a tedious night.</p>
