<p>The United States, in a move clearly boosting pressure on Indonesia over its national car policy, is seeking a World Trade Organisation (WTO) dispute panel on the issue, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The U.S. request was placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) only hours after it set up a three-man panel to consider complaints from the European Union and Japan on the policy.</p>
<p>U.S. sources said Washington would have no objection to joining in the EU-Japan panel, which once it is constituted within the next 20 days will have from six to nine months to come up with a ruling.</p>
<p>The United States, like the other two trade powers, argues the policy giving tax and import duty breaks to an Indonesian car firm headed by a son of President Suharto, discriminates against its exports and violated a range of WTO accords.</p>
<p>But Indonesia will be able to block the U.S. request at the coming DSB meeting on June 25, as this will be the first time Washington has formally asked for a panel. The next time, the request will be approved by the DSB automatically.</p>
<p>The case has wide implications for developing countries in the 131-member WTO seeking to build their own national industrial base to enable them to compete with goods from the richer economies.</p>
<p>Indonesia has denied that import and luxury tax concessions enjoyed by the PT Timor Putra Nasional company, which currently produces its &quot;Timor&quot; sedan car in South Korea at a plant of the South Korean Kia Motors Corp, break WTO rules.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, after news that the tax breaks had not helped a slump in sales of the car in the rapidly growing Indonesian market, a Jakarta cabinet minister indicated government bodies might be compelled to buy it.</p>
<p>On Thursday Japan told the DSB -- on which all members of the WTO can sit -- that consultations with Indonesia over the past few weeks in a bid to reach a settlement had failed to produce any sign of movement from Jakarta.</p>
<p>An EU official told the DSB Brussels had also failed to convince Indonesia to adjust the policy and bring it into line with WTO rules on goods trade, subsidies and trade-related investment measures (TRIMs).</p>
<p>If the panel finds against Indonesia, an appeal can be lodged, and an appeals board would then have 60 days to come to a decision.</p>
<p>But if the final ruling also goes against Jakarta, it would have to bring its policy in line with the panel recommendations or agree to pay compensation for the value of trade lost to the complainants.</p>
<p>If it refused to do either, the WTO could authorise Japan and the EU to take trade measures against Jakarta that would compensate for the losses they have incurred.</p>
