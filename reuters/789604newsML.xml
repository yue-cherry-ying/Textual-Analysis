<p>The bald eagle swept in triumphantly, Roy of the Rovers made a winning debut and Neil Redfearn made history to a samba beat.</p>
<p>It was debut day in the English premier league on Saturday, with a host of new arrivals eager to impress the fans and justify fat transfer fees.</p>
<p>Arsenal paraded Dutchman Marc Overmars, Liverpool had German international KarlHeinz Riedle and England midfielder Paul Ince back from Italy but none found the net on a day when the locals fared best.</p>
<p>Of the 21 premier league goals scored, only six were scored by the foreign legionnaires.</p>
<p>Three were in one match -- Newcastle's Colombian striker Faustino Asprilla scoring twice and Sheffield Wednesday's Italian Benito Carbone replying in a 2-1 defeat.</p>
<p>Arsenal, for all their foreign firepower, relied on Ian Wright once again in a 1-1 draw at Leeds while Coventry's Dion Dublin put three past Chelsea.</p>
<p>Liverpool's 17-year-old Michael Owen scored their goal from a 71st minute penalty. They drew 1-1 with Wimbledon.</p>
<p>All were made to sweat for their money on a blisteringly hot afternoon but few caused as much of a stir as a debutant in small-town Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Redfearn cannot boast world fame. He has not played in Europe or in a World Cup final.</p>
<p>But his ninth minute goal for Barnsley against West Ham guaranteed him as much exposure in Sunday's newspapers as many a big-name player.</p>
<p>After 110 years in the lower ranks, the small northern club had arrived in the top flight and Redfearn had scored their first ever premier league goal.</p>
<p>For the first half, the newcomers seemed to be headed for a dream start.</p>
<p>A mass of red and white balloons were released from the pitch before kickoff and fans among the 19,000 strong sellout crowd beat out a samba rhythm.</p>
<p>There was even a Brazilian flag fluttering in the stands, for no very good reason beyond wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Manager Danny Wilson, speaking before the match, had revealed that his aims for a club tipped more for relegation than anything else were high.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody seems to think that it's just survival and of course that would be fantastic,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But everybody can have a dream and my dream is for Europe. And why not? I'm allowed to dream like anyone else. If you set your targets low, you possibly only achieve that. I try and look a bit higher.&quot;</p>
<p>So do Barnsley fans, who could for a matter of minutes claim that their club was leading the premier league as the only team to be winning at that stage.</p>
<p>The euphoria was predictably short-lived, with the visitors equalising shortly after halftime and then seizing all the points in the 76th minute.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Barnsley face newly-promoted Crystal Palace -- the south London &quot;Eagles&quot; who won on Saturday at Everton, as did fellow premier league newcomers Bolton, who triumphed at Southampton.</p>
<p>Balding Italian winger Attilio Lombardo, Palace's record signing from Juventus, made an immediate impact with the opening goal in the 2-1 win.</p>
<p>Despite suggestions before he arrived by some team officials that he could prove an expensive mistake, the Italian scored a fine first half goal and set up the second.</p>
<p>Lombardo had made little impact initially but he produced the final touch to a pass from Paul Warhurst and slotted past veteran 'keeper Neville Southall.</p>
<p>In doing so, he spoilt another man's party -- that of Everton boss Howard Kendall, architect of the club's success in the 1980s, who was making his return to Goodison Park for the third time in his lengthy career.</p>
<p>Up the road at Blackburn Rovers, the former Swiss national team coach and Inter Milan boss Roy Hodgson was also making his premier league debut.</p>
<p>Roy's Rovers won, beating Derby 1-0.</p>
