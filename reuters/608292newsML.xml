<p>General Motors Corp's May U.S. sales are meeting company expectations, though sales will fall short of GM's strong results a year earlier, a top official said Friday.</p>
<p>After the company's annual shareholder meeting, Richard Wagoner, president of GM's North American Operations, said the overall sales climate in May had improved from April but it was not as strong as during the first quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;We're within the track we established where we thought we would be,&quot; he said. &quot;I doubt if we'll be up year to year.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the difficult market conditions had resulted in GM and its competitors offering higher incentives to buyers than they did a year ago.</p>
<p>GM had strong sales in May 1996 as it recovered from a crippling strike at a parts plant.</p>
<p>Commenting on a separate walkout at the company 's Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, car assembly plant, Wagoner said the current work stoppage, which began nearly two months ago, has dragged on longer than the company had expected. But he did not offer any indications that GM and the United Auto Workers union were making progress in talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We're just looking to solve it. It's gone on longer, I think, than either of us would have hoped,&quot; he said.</p>
