<title>PHILIPPINES: Philippines, Swiss to step up efforts over Marcos money.</title>
<headline>Philippines, Swiss to step up efforts over Marcos money.</headline>

<p>The Philippines and Switzerland have agreed to step up efforts to resolve a decade-old battle over $500 million in assets kept in Swiss banks by late president Ferdinand Marcos, the government said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>President Fidel Ramos and Swiss Federal Councillor Jean-Pascal Delamuraz met on Monday and agreed to facilitate the resolution of conflicting claims over the fortune frozen in Switzerland, a presidential palace news release said.</p>
<p>&quot;President Ramos and Councillor Delamuraz agreed it to be in the best interest of both the Philippines and Switzerland that a solution be found to this long and complicated problem as early as possible,&quot; the release quoted Swiss Ambassador Kurt Hochner as saying.</p>
<p>The solution being sought would be &quot;in a manner consistent with the laws of both countries,&quot; Hochner said.</p>
<p>The money held in Swiss banks is part of what the Philippine government alleges is some $5 billion looted from the economy by Marcos and his associates during his 20-year rule.</p>
<p>Marcos was ousted in a 1986 popular revolt and died in exile in Hawaii three years later. He and his family denied they plundered the Philippine treasury.</p>
<p>Besides Manila and the Marcos family, the fortune is also being claimed by victims of human rights abuses during the Marcos rule and by a company representing a late Filipino locksmith who had accused Marcos of stealing a Buddha statue supposedly made of gold which the locksmith said he found in a treasure hunt.</p>
<p>Swiss justice officials last month said in Zurich they had asked the Swiss supreme court to make it easier to hand the money over to Philippine authorities.</p>
<p>Specifically, they asked the court to drop its insistence in a 1990 ruling that the money only be returned once a Philippine court issued a binding sentence on the Marcos family and ordered the money confiscated.</p>
<p>Manila has filed scores of criminal and civil suits against former first lady Imelda Marcos, accusing her of helping her husband loot the economy.</p>
<p>A Manila court convicted her in one case in 1993 and sentenced her to 18 years in jail but Marcos is appealing the decision and remains free on bail.</p>
<p>The palace statement did not say what kind of solution was being worked out.</p>
