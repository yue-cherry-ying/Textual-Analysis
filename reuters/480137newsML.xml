<p>The Portuguese state and the Mello group signed an accord on Tuesday to restructure bankrupt ship repairer Lisnave that will include a 15 billion escudo investment to upgrade a shipyard near Lisbon, officials said.</p>
<p>The Mello group, Lisnave's majority shareholder, will provide five billion escudos and the state will provide investments and incentives for 10 billion, they said. Any further investment would be paid by the Mello group, they added.</p>
<p>Lisnave now owes the government some 11 billion escudos in tax and social security arrears, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The state will join the investment to upgrade the yard at Mitrena (in Setubal, south of Lisbon),&quot; Economy Minister Augusto Mateus told a news conference after the signing.</p>
<p>&quot;It is expected that the investment will be realised, and activities transferred to the new yard, in 2000,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He said Lisnave would shut its loss-making yard at Margueira, across the River Tagus from Lisbon.</p>
<p>Lisnave had previously announced that it planned to set up a new operating company for the ship repair business. Some of its workers would become employees of a &quot;human resources&quot; company.&quot;</p>
<p>Mateus said he expected Lisnave to increase its workforce to 3,700 after the restructuring from a recent average level of 3,200.</p>
<p>The financial markets watchdog, the Securities Market Commission (CMVM), suspended Lisnave shares on Lisbon bourse on Tuesday and would lift the suspension after the company issued a statement about the restructuring, an official CMVM source said.</p>
