<p>Bangladesh Industries and Commerce Minister Tofael Ahmed said on Thursday the government would soon begin selling off 64 state-owned companies under the country's privatisation programme.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to part with public enterprises at any cost or our development efforts are bound to falter,&quot; Ahmed told members of the Overseas Correspondent Association of Bangladesh (OCAB).</p>
<p>Ahmed said international tenders would be floated for the sale of the companies soon.</p>
<p>Ahmed said state-owned companies suffered $572 million in losses yearly, equal to one third of the annual foreign aid Bangladesh receives.</p>
<p>&quot;Resistance from labour unions, lack of interest from buyers and lengthy procedures had delayed the country's privatisation process,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are under pressure from the World Bank. We are certain to disinvest the enterprises. We will offer a better compensation package to the labourers.&quot;</p>
<p>Ahmed said Bangladesh could attract huge foreign investment in energy and telecommunications.</p>
<p>Some $3.3 billion worth of foreign investment was registered with the Board of Investment (BOI) in the first six months of fiscal 1996/97 (July-June), BOI officials said.</p>
<p>The officials said Bangladesh could expect only 50 percent of the amount registered to be actually invested.</p>
<p>The actual investment was only $50 million out of $2.7 billion registered in 1995/96. &quot;But the wide gap between the actual investment and registration was due mainly to political chaos that year,&quot; said one official.</p>
<p>Ahmed said the bulk of foreign investment was in the country's energy sector.</p>
<p>He said British Cairn Energy Plc, American Occidental Corp, United Meridian Corp, Halliburton Co and Unocal Corp were investing in the country's energy sector.</p>
<p>&quot;The Asian Development Bank (ADB), which earlier suspended aid to Bangladesh's energy sector, has resumed fresh funding,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ahmed said Bangladesh was also seeking foreign investment in development of sea ports.</p>
<p>He said Bangladesh, as member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), had liberalised its trade policy.</p>
<p>&quot;We have removed all tariff and non-tariff barriers to pursue a free trade policy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But at the same time we have paid the cost for a faster move to that (free trade) as our domestic industries suffered.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Bangladesh had signed a border trade treaty with Burma.</p>
<p>&quot;And there will be such treaty with India. But we are now moving slow and cautiously,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bangladesh has an annual trade deficit of more than $1 billion with neighbouring India.</p>
