<headline>Shares of Bandai, Sega jump, inspired by Sony Music.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-05-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bandai Co Ltd and Sega Enterprises Ltd jumped in the Thursday session, buoyed by signs that amusement game-related shares are on the upswing following a bright earnings forecast by Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc, brokers said.</p>
<p>Bandai's shares were up 160 yen or 6.3 percent at 2,700 as of 0423 GMT, the fifth largest percentage gainer on the first section of the Tokyo bourse.</p>
<p>Sega rose 200 yen or 5.75 percent to 3,680, ranking it seventh on the list.  </p>
<p>&quot;The shares were inspired by Sony Music's robust earnings announced on Wednesday as well as news that the firm's manufacturing division which is involved in making software for video games, posted an increase in sales,&quot; Harushige Kobayashi, Yamaichi Securities deputy general manager, said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sony Music's shares are still bid-only and Bandai and Sega are hitching a ride on the lofty mood surrounding the amusement game-related sector.&quot;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Sony Music said it expects its group net profits for the business year that ends on March 31, 1998, to be 26.50 billion yen, far larger than its net group profits in the previous year of 12.82 billion yen.</p>
<p>Sony's custom manufacturing division was the only product group which posted an increase in sales in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Net sales rose 4.1 percent due mainly to robust demand for CD-ROMs for software used in Sony Computer Entertainment Inc's hit home video game machine, PlayStation.</p>
<p>Sony Music's shares were bid-only at 4,820 yen after closing at 4,420 yen on the previous day.</p>
<p>&quot;News that sales of Bandai's 'Tamagotchi' toy are booming is of course a supportive factor also,&quot; Kobayashi said.</p>
<p>Bandai said Wednesday the launch of three new models of the &quot;virtual pet&quot; toys featuring an electronic bird which were originally due by the end of June, would be delayed to between July and September while it boosted production of existing models to meet soaring demand.</p>
<p>Bandai and Sega are due to merge later this year to form a powerful entertainment entity which will rival Sony.</p>
