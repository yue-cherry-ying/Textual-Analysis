<p>Vandals have desecrated a Roman Catholic church in southern Poland dedicated to Poles who perished in the former Soviet Union, PAP news agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The unknown attackers, striking during the visit of Pope John Paul to his homeland, smashed down the door of the church, in Bedzin near the city of Katowice, the agency said.</p>
<p>It quoted the parish priest, Stefan Gibala, as saying they scattered vestments from the sacristy, strewed communion wafers over the floor, bent crosses on liturgical vessels and stole altar wine and a microphone.</p>
<p>The priest has made his church of the Visitation of the Most Holy Virgin Mary a shrine to Poles deported by Soviet invaders, especially during World War Two. Many never returned, dying instead in Soviet labour camps.</p>
<p>Remembering the victims has been a theme of the Pope's 11-day trip, which will include areas near Katowice.</p>
<p>There was no clear indication of the motives for the desecration. Similar incidents have sometimes been the work of teenagers who are drunk or call themselves Satanists.</p>
