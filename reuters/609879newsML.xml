<p>FAR EAST ESCAPES STERLING SLUMP</p>
<p>Sterling's fall of nearly three pfennigs yesterday, following news that a rogue trader accidentally sold 200m stg or 300m stg of Deutschmarks and that export demand was at its lowest since November 1993, was not replicated in the Far East. Instead, the market digested the dramatic slide of the dollar against the yen which has taken place this week.</p>

<p>'TAKEOVERS' BACKLASH HITS NEWS</p>
<p>News Corp's share price has been sliding in Australia, despite the announcement of a bumper A$373 million (185 million stg) quarterly profit. The slide is the result of a feeling that Murdoch has reneged on his February statement that he was not considering acquisitions, in the light of the attempt to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers and a rumoured $1bn deal to buy the US Family Channel.</p>
