<headline>U.S. to promote Africa economic initiative in region.</headline>

<p>By Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent</p>
<p>The United States is taking its wide-ranging initiative to promote economic reform and recovery in Africa on the road next week with a visit to the region by Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.</p>
<p>In a trip that is expected to last nearly a week, Summers will attend the annual meeting of the African Development Bank in Abidjan on Tuesday and Wednesday before visiting South Africa and Mozambique.</p>
<p>&quot;We are interested in trying to help economic development proceed in Africa,&quot; a senior Treasury official, who declined to be named, said. &quot;It's clearly the last great development challenge,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Summers will be the highest-ranking Treasury official to attend an annual meeting of the African Development Bank since President Bill Clinton took office more than four years ago.</p>
<p>Treasury officials described his trip as a show of U.S. support for the once scandal-ridden but now reformed Bank. Summers will also explore what role the lending organization can play in the new U.S. initiative to help Africa.</p>
<p>That initiative, which was formally unveiled last month, stresses trade and investment rather than aid and aims to reward countries carrying out tough economic reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying in essence to create a club of reformers that get special attention,&quot; the Treasury official said.</p>
<p>He said that Treasury was open to discussion about the African Bank's role in the initiative, but suggested that one possibility would be for it to promote the development of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p>The Bank has a major role in another plan to help poor countries that dovetails with the U.S. initiative on Africa -- a recently launched program to provide debt relief to nations carrying out tough reforms.</p>
<p>Under that program, international financial institutions, including the World Bank and the African Bank, will effectively write off billions of dollars of loans.</p>
<p>The African Bank's share of that could come to about $800 million, but the organization does not have enough money on its own to cover that and will need to depend on contributions from rich countries and from the World Bank.</p>
<p>The Bank could also try encouraging African nations that are behind on their debt repayments to the organization to come up with the money. Those arrears total about $900 million, with the Democratic Republic of Congo accounting for just over half of that.</p>
<p>Congo, the former Zaire, is trying to get its hands on the billions of dollars that ousted dictator Mobutu Sese Seko reportedly stashed abroad and could conceivably use some of that to pay off its arrears to the African Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be quite significant,&quot; the U.S. official said.</p>
<p>After attending the African Bank annual meeting, Summers will visit South Africa and Mozambique. The Treasury official described Mozambique as being &quot;very keen on economic reform&quot; and &quot;totally open&quot; to advice from outside.</p>
<p>Its economic success might help others in the region, because its port of Maputo could act as a gateway for neighboring land-locked nations.</p>
