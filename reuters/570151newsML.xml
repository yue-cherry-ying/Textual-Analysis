<p>Sears Roebuck and Co said total domestic store revenues for the four weeks ending May 3 were $2.19 billion, 9.9 percent above revenues of $1.99 billion for the four weeks ended May 4, 1996.</p>
<p>Domestic same-store revenues increased 3.4 percent, on top of a 10.9 percent increase in the same period a year ago, it said.  </p>
<p>For the four weeks ended May 3, Sears reported total revenues of $2.96 billion, 7.9 percent above the $2.74 billion in the prior-year period.</p>
<p>For the 13 weeks ended May 3, Sears reported total revenues of $9.05 billion, 6.7 percent above the $8.48 billion in the prior-year period.  </p>
<p>&quot;Sears performance was led by strong apparel sales -- including exceptional growth in private and national brands -- and a modest improvement in hardlines which built upon a mid-teen increase in April 1996,&quot; said Arthur Martinez, chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>&quot;Our full-line stores generated strong increases in softlines, including women's, men's and children's apparel and home furnishings,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Footwear, cosmetics and fragrances, and fine jewelry posted double-digit increases, while hardlines saw solid sales of appliances and electronics, led by a surge in demand for home office equipment, Sears said.</p>
<p>Off the mall, auto stores experienced a drop in comparable store sales while dealer and hardware stores continued their steady growth, Sears said.</p>
