<p>Russia is continuing a Cold War era programme to build deep underground bunkers, subways and command posts to help Moscow's leaders flee the capital and survive a nuclear attack, the Washington Times reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Among the ambitious projects was a secret subway being built directly to the residence of Russian President Boris Yeltsin outside Moscow, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>&quot;The underground construction appears larger than previously assessed,&quot; the Times quoted a top secret CIA report as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Three decrees last year on an emergency planning authority under Yeltsin with oversight of underground facility construction suggest that the purpose of the Moscow area projects is to maintain continuity of leadership during nuclear war,&quot; the CIA said.</p>
<p>The Washington Times said it had obtained a copy of the CIA report from defence sources.</p>
<p>Construction work was continuing on a &quot;nuclear survivable, strategic command post at Kosvinsky Mountain,&quot; located deep in the Ural mountains about 850 miles (1,360 km) from Moscow, the CIA said according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>The report noted the Russians were building or renovating four complexes within Moscow that would be used to house senior Russian government leaders during a nuclear strike.</p>
<p>A map published in the report showed new subway construction under way from Victory Park Station in Moscow to Yeltsin's dacha, some 13 miles (21 km) west of the Kremlin, the Times said.</p>
<p>The CIA report also stated that a bunker for Russian leaders at Voronovo, about 46 miles (74 km) south of Moscow, was nearly complete, the newspaper added.</p>
