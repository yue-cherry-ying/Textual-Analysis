<p>The movement of South Australian apples and pears into other states of Australia has been suspended after three plants in the Adelaide Botanic Gardens tested positive for the fire blight bacterial disease, the state's primary industries department said on Friday.</p>
<p>A departmental spokesman said the ban, which did not affect the Northern Territory, was on all host materials for the bacteria, including the plants, cuttings and fruit from apples, pears, quinces, medlars, and ornamentals.  </p>
<p>Officials had been alerted to the bacteria by New Zealand's chief plants officer Richard Ivess during a visit to Adelaide, he said.</p>
<p>Primary Industries Minister John Kerin said no fire blight bacteria had been found in any commercial orchards in South Australia but inspectors were now surveying all apples and pear growing regions, 2,600 metropolitan sites and selected nurseries around the state.  </p>
<p>The spokesman said the interstate ban had been self-imposed immediately to protect other states, and follows similar bans on Victorian apples, pears and nursery stocks following the earlier detection of the bacteria in Melbourne.</p>
<p>The Apple and Pear Growers Association of South Australia said the detection could have a devastating effect on the state's A$46 million industry which was expected to produce 1.9 million cartons of apples and 400,000 cartons of pears this year, with 300,000-400,000 cartons earmarked for interstate.  </p>
<p>&quot;If the disease were to spread it has the potential to be very devastating in maybe the next five to 20 years (until we) established techniques to work with the disease as has happened in other countries,&quot; general manager Trevor Ranford said.</p>
<p>Ranford said he did not believe planned exports of 50,000-100,000 cartons to south east Asia and Europe would be affected, as the markets currently took fruit from the United States and New Zealand where fire blight already existed, and growers would be seeking to increase exports to make up for local losses.  </p>
<p>Australia's quarantine service said last month it would reject New Zealand apples because they could carry fire blight.</p>
