<p>Animal rights campaigners in London and Taiwan on Friday condemned a Taiwanese plan to kill some 1.3 million stray dogs in a year using methods they described as cruel.</p>
<p>The London-based World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) demanded that Taiwan's government abandon the plan to start the stray dog cull from July.</p>
<p>&quot;The knee-jerk reaction to the problem of stray dogs is the ultimate act of an irresponsible government that is flouting international opinion and the guidelines of the World Health Organisation,&quot; WSPA said.</p>
<p>&quot;It amounts to a deliberate and unnecessary slaughter of dogs in a country where they are viewed as rubbish to be cleared away,&quot; the world group said.</p>
<p>It said Taiwan already uses some of the world's cruelest and most inhumane methods in handling stray dogs, including gassing, electrocuting and poisoning the dogs or leaving them in shallow pits to starve to death.</p>
<p>&quot;The planned genocide of over a million dogs breaks the promises made to WSPA by Taiwanese government officials,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Council of Agriculture, under fire from international animal rights campaigners, agreed earlier in 1997 to take measures to improve the treatment of stray dogs.</p>
<p>But on Thursday, it ordered the hunting and killing of stray dogs in Taipei, the central city of Taichung, and Kaohsiung in the south to avert a possible outbreak of rabies.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Life Conservationist Association lashed out at the council for failing to find other ways to prevent a possible rabies outbreak.</p>
<p>&quot;Preparation against rabies is important, but there is no need to create a panic in society when Taiwan is still not an infected area,&quot; an association spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Officials at the council declined to comment on the animal rights group's statement.</p>
