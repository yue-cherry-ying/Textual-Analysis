<headline>Gilts biggest loser in mixed week - Salomon.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Bond markets were mixed in the latest week with Britain chalking up the biggest losses and Canada climbing the most, according to data from Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>British gilts dropped 0.91 percent in the week in local currency terms amid lower-than-expected M4 money supply data. The market was also tracking losses in Bunds.</p>
<p>Canadian bonds gained 0.65 percent in the week, boosted by foreign buying and tame Canadian economic data and a rally as U.S. interest rates remained unchanged after Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting.</p>
<p>The Salomon Brothers World Government Bond Index lost 0.22 percent in local terms for the week ended May 21.</p>
<p>Other losers in the week in local currency terms were France, Germany and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>German Bunds fell 0.58 percent, while French debt lost 0.60 percent and Dutch bonds dropped 0.65 percent, dragged lower by losses in Germany and general weakness in the European markets.</p>
<p>The other top gainer of the week was Australia with a climb of 0.52 percent. Italian BTPs and Spanish Bonos swam against the European tide to notch up gains of 0.31 and 0.16 respectively in local terms.</p>
<p>For dollar-based investors the pattern was broadly similar, with Japan the only market showing a strikingly different picture in dollar terms compared to local currency.</p>
<p>JGBs clocked up considerable gains of 3.35 percent in dollar terms against a loss of 0.22 percent in yen.</p>
<p>U.S Treasuries offered returns of 0.11 percent.</p>
<p>Salomon's bond index is calculated using all government bonds with over one year to maturity, weighted for market capitalisation. Only bonds freely available to institutional investors and with a certain minimum amount outstanding are included. Returns take account of price moves and accrued interest.</p>
