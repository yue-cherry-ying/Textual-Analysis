<p>More than 20,000 people from a Burmese group backed by the government staged a rally in Karen State this week and attacked the United States for interfering in the country's internal affairs.</p>
<p>Official newspapers and state-run television on Thursday showed pictures of the rally, which took place on Monday and was attended by about 20,570 members of the Union Solidarity and Development Association.</p>
<p>Speakers at the rally urged the crowd to oppose Washington for imposing sanctions on Burma's military government.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to call on the rally to oppose the so-called world police, the American government, which is interfering in our internal affairs to jeopardise national interests and to dominate our country,&quot; said Kyaw Htay, secretary of the Karen State USDA.</p>
<p>He also urged people to crush &quot;traitors&quot; like opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi who was a strong proponent of sanctions.</p>
<p>This is the third mass rally held by the association since April 22 when the United States banned all new American investment in Burma. The sanctions were meant as a condemnation of Rangoon's poor human rights record, and its repression of Suu Kyi's democracy movement.</p>
<p>At least 10 more rallies were expected to take place in large cities across the country, analysts said.</p>
<p>Similar rallies have been staged over the past few years to denounce Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party. Speakers often urge people to &quot;crush&quot; or &quot;annihilate&quot; anyone who opposes the government or threatens to destabilise it.</p>
<p>Diplomats call the rallies staged, while residents say they are often forced by military officials or police to attend.</p>
