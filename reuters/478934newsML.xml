<p>Taiwan corn buying interests will remain sidelined through April as a hog foot and mouth disease outbreak slashes demand for feed corn, grain buyers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no Taiwan corn tenders in April,&quot; Jack Lee at Taiwan's Hui Shung Agriculture Co told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;They are slaughtering pigs en masse and it will take mouths to rebuild the hog population,&quot; Lee said by telephone.</p>
<p>Buyers contacted at other major Taiwan corn buying interests shared similar view.</p>
<p>&quot;The earliest will be in May,&quot; a corn buyer at Taiwan's Members Feed Industry Group said when asked when the group would return to market.</p>
<p>State-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp, the island's largest hog breeder, has reduced its pig feedings to twice a day from three in normal times -- a measure to reduce production by slowing the fattening process, but one that also will cut feed demand.</p>
<p>&quot;We have excess corn inventories on hand because our pigs are eating less,&quot; Taiwan Sugar corn buyer Stella Yuan said.</p>
<p>Taiwan corn buyers have estimated the crisis would slash the island's feed corn imports by about one-fifth.</p>
<p>A Reuters Survey of five major Taiwan grain importers found that all expected significant reductions in corn imports, with most estimating the downturn at about 1.2 million tonnes or 19 percent of the island's annual imports of 6.5 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Taiwan has been importing almost all of its corn from the United States.</p>
<p>A mass slaughter of all hogs -- healthy or otherwise -- at all farms struck by the deadly contagion has continued with experts from the cabinet's Council of Agriculture reporting that over 886,000 pigs would have to be destroyed.</p>
<p>As of March 28, the virus had been detected on 1,008 of Taiwan's 25,000 hog farms, though only 160,315 pigs were reported to have been slaughtered, official statistics showed.</p>
<p>The farm council banned all pork exports after confirming the outbreak on March 20, when the virus had been found in just nine of the island's 25,000 hog breeding farms.</p>
<p>Taiwan's Bergerco, an affiliate of U.S. supplier Peavey, on March 28 cancelled delivery of a 25,000-tonne shipment of U.S. corn due the hog crisis.</p>
<p>Since March 20, Taiwan importers have cancelled tenders for nearly 200,000 tonnes of corn and soybeans due to plunging demand for feed. Traders have estimated the epidemic could lead to a 10 percent fall in soybean imports.</p>
