<p>Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore said Friday that a settlement of tobacco litigation was not imminent, although he said he hoped to know within two weeks whether a deal could be reached.</p>
<p>Moore said in a telephone interview that news reports that the settlement was near were incorrect.  </p>
<p>&quot;We've completed some of our work, but have a long way to go,&quot; he said. &quot;We'll know if we're going to resolve this thing in the next two weeks is what I believe. If we don't I've got to come home and get ready for trial.&quot;</p>
<p>Moore is the lead negotiator for Mississippi and the 28 other states that have sued the tobacco industry to recoup Medicaid costs of smokers. Mississippi's trial is scheduled to begin July 7, followed by Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>He criticised Friday's Wall Street Journal report that said a core group of attorneys general and tobacco company lawyers negotiating a settlement were close to a plan that would sharply restrict the ability of current smokers to bring lawsuits.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the proposal would also make it virtually impossible for future smokers to be compensated for the most common tobacco-related illnesses, such as lung cancer.</p>
