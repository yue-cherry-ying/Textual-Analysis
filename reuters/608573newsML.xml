<title>UK: Dollar calmer as volatile Europe week winds down.</title>
<headline>Dollar calmer as volatile Europe week winds down.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>The dollar meandered in late Europe, visibly calming after its recent volatile spell as Japanese rate rise speculation cooled to a gentle simmer.</p>
<p>But analysts said a slew of Japanese data next week would prove key to whether the U.S. unit could maintain its composure.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of the volatility in FX markets has stemmed from shifting rate expectations in Tokyo, so it'll be important to look at the April figures, which are the first real indication of how the economy's performing after the increase in consumption tax,&quot; said Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International in London.  </p>
<p>Next week sees Japan release April figures including industrial production, retail sales and CPI. But those are concentrated at the back-end of the week, and players in London and New York are currently more focused on Monday's market holidays in their centres, traders said.</p>
<p>That kept trade subdued today. The dollar edged down to 115.51/56 yen by 1530 GMT from late Thursday's European level of 115.80/85, while dollar/mark eased to 1.6902/09 from 1.6943/53.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen lurched downwards -- hitting an over five-month low of 111.88 on Tuesday -- as jitters over possible Japanese monetary tightening bubbled over in the market again.  </p>
<p>But dollar/yen barely reacted today to comments by influential Japan finance ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara, known to the markets as 'Mr Yen'.</p>
<p>Sakakibara told French daily Le Monde that a half-point rise would still leave the Bank of Japan's discount rate at a low level, and such a move should be expected in the coming year.</p>
<p>He also said he was pleased with the recent rise in the yen and there was no disagreement between the U.S. Treasury and the Japanese Finance Ministry on exchange rate policy.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Japan and the U.S. are quite happy about where the dollar is now,&quot; said Pat Magill at Daiwa Europe.  </p>
<p>&quot;But if the trade situation doesn't turn around quickly, there might be some more pressure building up,&quot; said Magill, who heads up the corporate desk at Daiwa Europe in London.</p>
<p>Data released on Monday showed Japan's trade surplus soared in April, and Vice Finance Minister Tadashi Ogawa said the pace of decline in the surplus was slowing.</p>
<p>Thus weekend sees the first round of French parliamentary elections, and analysts said victory for the ruling centre-right coalition -- the expected outcome -- would bolster dollar/mark as the franc responded favourably. A left-wing win could hit the U.S. unit via a broad move into marks, they warned.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere, traders noted a wave of Swiss franc buying, which lifted the franc to 1.4050/55 per dollar and 83.13/15 centimes per mark by 1556 GMT from late yesterday's 1.4120/30 and 83.37/40 respectively.</p>
<p>Sterling was hit by a bout of profit-taking which swept it to intraday lows of 2.7422 marks and $1.6225, but it had recovered to 2.7570/80 and $1.6321/31 by the close. It finished here at 2.7580/90 and $1.6270/75 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Traders said the pound had been hit by speculation that Bank of England governor Eddie George would not be reappointed next year at the end of his five-year term. That cast a question mark over the prospect of higher interest rates in the UK, they said.</p>
