<p>Four years after Branch Davidian cult leader David Koresh and about 80 followers died during a botched FBI raid on their compound, dozens of survivors and relatives gathered on Saturday to remember their dead and demand justice.</p>
<p>Amid the charred ruins of their compound at Waco in central Texas, the surviving Branch Davidians held a prayer service in memory of Koresh and the 81 others killed by flames or gunfire when the building burned down on April 19, 1993.</p>
<p>Relatives, many crying, knelt at the graves of those who perished as invited speakers paid tribute to the religious group and condemned what they said was an FBI cover-up.</p>
<p>In Washington's Lafayette Park across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, a small group of demonstrators used the anniversary to protest the government's assault on the Branch Davidians' compound.</p>
<p>&quot;FBI Killed a Village and Its Children,&quot; said a banner, making reference to first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's book on children, &quot;It Takes a Village.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman, Carol Moore, of the &quot;Committee for Waco Justice,&quot; said the Oklahoma City bombing might not have taken place had Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno prosecuted the federal agents involved in the Waco assault in which 76 Branch Davidians were killed.</p>
<p>&quot;I personally blame the Oklahoma City bombing on Clinton and Reno,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>But there was little anti-government rhetoric at the Waco memorial service. Instead, most people spoke of religious freedom and the belief that theirs was violated.</p>
<p>&quot;The Branch Davidians symbolise the eternal struggle for the right of humans to pray to their God as they see fit,&quot; said former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who is representing some of the survivors in a civil suit against the government.</p>
<p>Others distanced the group from radical militias and also paid tribute to the ATF agents who died at the start of the siege, even as they criticised those who ordered the raid.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not sponsor the hatred of people who have affected our lives,&quot; said Clive Doyle, a Davidian who suffered burns in the fire and was then jailed on weapons charges. &quot;We stay away from militias or groups with that type of reputation.&quot;</p>
<p>The Waco siege began on Feb. 28, 1993, when federal agents stormed the compound in a bid to arrest Koresh on weapons charges. Four agents and six Davidians were killed in a gunfight before the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms retreated, and then sealed off the compound.</p>
<p>On April 19, after a 51-day standoff, FBI tanks broke through an outer wall and agents threw tear gas inside to flush the Davidians out. Instead, a fire started and most all those inside were killed.</p>
<p>While government officials say the Branch Davidians started the blaze, cult members claim federal agents opened fire on them and that the tear gas canisters ignited the fire.</p>
<p>Waco quickly became a rallying cry of the extremist right-wing militia movement, and it was on the two-year anniversary of the tragedy that a huge truck bomb blew apart the Alfred P. Murrah federal government building in downtown Oklahoma City, killing 168 people.</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege that Timothy McVeigh, currently on trial for the Oklahoma City bombing, planted the bomb in revenge for the FBI raid on the Branch Davidians. McVeigh is believed to have visited the compound and has made no secret of his anger over the events here.</p>
