<p>Britain's company car tax system increases driving by business users and it needs to be overhauled, environmental and business groups said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;If the taxation system is encouraging increased mileage, it is important that changes are made to correct these distortions. We would like detailed discussions with government on how to do that,&quot; said David Edmonds, a senior Nationl Westminister Bank executive involved in fleet management.</p>
<p>The current 2,500 and 18,000 mile business tax thresholds were highlighted as encouraging drivers to reach this target in order to reduce their tax charges.</p>
<p>Statistics show a dramatic leap in the number of business users who achieve the 2,500 break point and cutting incentives to drive up to the tax break levels would lead to less miles being driven, a report by The Ashden Trust, business grouping London First and the University of Westminster found.</p>
<p>Company car drivers also do 35 percent more commuting miles than similar employees using private cars.</p>
<p>With motor vehicles contributing up to 80 percent of poor air quality and company cars held responsible for 20 percent of total car milelage, despite accounting for only eight percent of vehicles on the road, reducing company car journeys could significantly cut pollution levels.</p>
<p>British executives have been used to company cars as a perk since the 1970s when they were given to employees to circumnavigate wage freezes and they are now firmly entrenched in the Britain's corporate psyche, but some companies have shown a willingness to change.</p>
<p>The government is noticeably reticient about the proposals to change the company car tax system just two weeks ahead of finance minister Gordon Brown's first budget.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is pleased to see any level of interest but it will be a matter for the chancellor to decide on these issues,&quot; a spokesman at the Department of Transport said.</p>
<p>Last week Transport Minister Gavin Strang was calling on companies to encourage employees to use private and company cars less.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not against car ownership, but we have to minimise car usage,&quot; he said.</p>
