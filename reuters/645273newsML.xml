<p>Three South Korean students have been arrested in connection with the fatal beating of a man suspected to be a police informer, a police official said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;A Seoul court issued an arrest warrant early this morning,&quot; the official told Reuters. &quot;We are still investigating the three suspects as we believe more students are involved in the case.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Kwon Soon-wook and Lee Ho-jun, who were turned over to police by the militant student group Hanchongryon late on Thursday, had admitted they beat Lee Suk with clubs.</p>
<p>The other person arrested was Kil So-yon, one of four students whom the outlawed pro-Pyongyang student body handed over to the authorities on Thursday, saying they witnessed the fatal beating.</p>
<p>&quot;Kil finally admitted she also joined the beating during an interrogation of Lee Suk in the student union building of the Hanyang University to extract a confession that he was a spy,&quot; the police official said.</p>
<p>Hanchongryon, which has been at the forefront of student riots in South Korea in the past week, had already admitted responsibility for the violent death of Lee Suk whose badly bruised body was delivered to a hospital in Hanyang University on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Autopsy reports showed Lee Suk, a 22-year-old worker, died as a direct result of the battering. He had been beaten and his wrists roped together during a lengthy interrogation.</p>
<p>His funeral was held on Saturday.</p>
<p>Another police official said on Friday the police also believed some leaders of Hanchongryon were involved in the shocking torture-killing.</p>
<p>He said the two male suspects told police that Lee Suk was passed to them by a student with a mask, but they refused to elaborate.</p>
<p>The leading Dong-A Ilbo newspaper said the police planned to summon several leaders of Hanchongryon on Sunday for questioning over their role in the killing.</p>
<p>Police declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p>Students demanding the resignation of President Kim Young-sam and details of his 1992 election spending went on the rampage at the end of last week.</p>
<p>Since then there have been frequent clashes between police firing teargas and militant students wielding metal pipes and hurling firebombs.</p>
<p>A riot policeman died during clashes around Hanyang University on Monday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Koh Kun vowed to put an end to campus violence and ordered the arrest of Hanchongryon leaders by the end of June.</p>
