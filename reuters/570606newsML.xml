<p>The nation's borrowing binge lost steam in March as consumers amassed debt more slowly, especially on credit cards, and paid off some of their auto loans, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The growth of consumer instalment credit, which includes all borrowings except mortgages and home equity loans, slowed in March to $2 billion, or a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 percent, the central bank said.</p>
<p>In February, consumers took on $6.7 billion in new debt, a 6.7 percent annual growth rate, the Fed said.</p>
<p>The modest growth in March, which was much smaller than expected and the smallest increase since last September, signalled a cooling of borrowing habits and a shift by consumers toward more savings, economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that consumer credit growth is clearly moving out of its double-digit range,&quot; said economist Lynn Reaser of Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla. &quot;The slowdown in credit card borrowing is particularly significant.&quot;</p>
<p>Reaser said she expects the growth of consumer credit to slow to 5 percent to 6 percent this year from about 8 percent last year and 14 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>In its periodic report on the economy known as the Beige Book, the Fed also found some softening of consumer borrowing in March and April.</p>
<p>&quot;Overall lending activity was decidedly split, with most of the strength on the business side and most of the weakness on the consumer side,&quot; the central bank said in the report.</p>
<p>Consumer spending, much of it fuelled by borrowing, accounts for two-thirds of the economy and helped drive economic growth to a 5.6 percent rate in the first quarter, the strongest in more than nine years.</p>
<p>Credit card debt, also known as revolving debt, rose $1.5 billion in March, a 3.7 percent annual rate, down sharply from February when credit-card debt jumped $5 billion, a 12.7 percent rate, the Fed said.</p>
<p>Car loans actually fell $1.1 billion in March, declining at a 3.3 percent rate, after advancing in February by $300 million, a 0.7 percent rate.</p>
<p>Other credit, including bank loans for things such as mobile homes, boats or education, rose $1.6 billion in March, a 5.4 percent growth rate, after rising $1.5 billion, or 5.1 percent, in February.</p>
