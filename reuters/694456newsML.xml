<p>Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping had only one word to say to Hong Kong politicians who voiced anxiety about the stationing of People's Liberation Army troops in a Hong Kong under Chinese rule.</p>
<p>&quot;Bullshit,&quot; Deng told the Hong Kong visitors in May 1983.</p>
<p>What mattered to Deng was sovereignty, and that was what mattered to his heirs when they announced that a heavily armoured force of Chinese troops would stream into Hong Kong just six hours after the curtain falls on British rule.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an expression of sovereignty,&quot; said Jane's Defence correspondent and Asian specialist Robert Karniol. &quot;This is hardly surprising.&quot;</p>
<p>Beijing said on Friday that 4,000 troops, backed by helicopters, ships and armoured personnel carriers, would cross the border into Hong Kong at three points on Tuesday, Hong Kong's first day under Chinese rule since Britain seized the island in 1841.</p>
<p>&quot;The message they are trying to give is that it is back to Chinese sovereignty,&quot; said one Western diplomat.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a big symbol, a big thing for them,&quot; said an Asian diplomat. &quot;I would expect them to have ceremonies to say here we are, we have arrived, the defenders of the motherland are here.&quot;</p>
<p>For Chinese, for their communist rulers and for the late Deng Xiaoping who negotiated Hong Kong's handover, resumption of sovereignty over an outpost occupied by British colonial invaders for more than a century and a half is an issue of visceral importance.</p>
<p>&quot;To unify China has been the goal of the communists since (Chairman) Mao Zedong took power in 1949 and sending in the army is a symbol of what they gain with the handover,&quot; said one Western political analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't see this as something scary,&quot; he said. &quot;This is the symbol of the sovereign nation, not to mention national defence.&quot;</p>
<p>Diplomats and military analysts said it would have been naive of Hong Kong, the British or outgoing Governor Chris Patten to have expected China to act in any other way, or to allow soldiers defending the realm to enter without hardware.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't expect them (Chinese soldiers) to go around Hong Kong by taxi,&quot; said a second Asian diplomat.</p>
<p>Patten condemned the troop move as &quot;a most appalling signal to send to the people of Hong Kong&quot;, still chilled by images of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) tanks and troops crushing unarmed students around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.</p>
<p>Diplomats said Britain -- and Patten -- were being somewhat disingenuous since they were as much aware of the last-minute surprise announcement as the Chinese themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;I would be very surprised if the British did not know all along... but when things have blown up the British have done nothing to throw cold water to calm things down,&quot; said the first Asian diplomat.</p>
<p>&quot;They have acted like spoilt schoolboys who have just thrown down their bats and walked off the field,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;If they were geniune about the handover, what they should have been saying is calm down, this is all normal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>British diplomats have hinted that the Beijing move was indeed no surprise. The British and Chinese militaries have been in talks for more than one year on the detailed logistics of the military angle of the handover process.</p>
<p>&quot;What else did anyone expect?&quot; said Karniol. &quot;Hong Kong has very litle strategic significance and a garrison is hardly necessary, but this is about pomp and circumstance.&quot;</p>
