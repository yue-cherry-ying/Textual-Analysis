<p>Serbia's biggest retail and wholesale food chain C-market is working on its capital evaluation ahead of a new privatisation law, a senior company official said Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall make an evaluation of the company's capital while the law is still in procedure. I expect this evaluation to be ready in one month,&quot; the company's general manager Slobodan Radulovic told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the company would wait for Serbia's ownership transformation law to be passed before making any concrete privatisation plans but was certain the law would both inspire confidence in foreigners and be fair to domestic workers.</p>
<p>&quot;I am convinced that is a key law which will satisfy interests both of foreign investors and people now working in this country,&quot; said Radulovic, who is also Serbian Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Serbia's privatisation law is under a month-long public debate and is due for adoption by the end of June.</p>
<p>According to the draft document the government plans to privatise over 4,000 publicly-owned companies, involve almost four million people and establish a clear ownership structure.</p>
<p>Radulovic expected the law to introduce private ownership as a dominant form of ownership, to be based on economic logic and to respect what workers have contributed to firms they have worked in.</p>
<p>&quot;It will also make room for foreign capital to come here through a possibility of capitalisation. Money does not necessarily have to come from foreigners alone but also from Yugoslavs working abroad,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Radulovic expected C-market to be an attractive investment target for foreigners and said the company could become a joint stock company with majority private capital.</p>
<p>According to Nikola Macura, director of marketing and development, C-market, which employs 3,450 workers, has an annual turnover of around 450 million German marks in domestic sales in its 220 stores mostly located in Belgrade and its surroundings.</p>
<p>The company's monthly turnover stands at some 100 million dinars ($17.6 million), he said. -- Beti Bilandzic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 43 05</p>
