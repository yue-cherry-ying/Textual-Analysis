<p>Shun Shing Holdings Ltd said on Thursday that consent of the Hong Kong securities watchdog was required before the company could complete its placing of old shares and the issue of new shares.</p>
<p>The company's announcement comes in response to a Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) inquiry following a general offer for Shun Shing made by COSCO (H.K.) Property Ltd.</p>
<p>SFC consent was required &quot;if a person purchases any shares of a company within six months of the closure of an offer made by him for that company, at a higher price than that made available under the offer&quot;, the announcement said.  </p>
<p>COSCO announced a general offer for Shun Shing on February 28 after having raised its stake in the construction and property development company to 61 percent from 30 percent in December 1996.</p>
<p>Under the general offer, COSCO agreed to buy 208.32 million shares, or about 31 percent of Shun Shing's issued share capital, at HK$0.72 per share from Golden Success Ltd, the previous parent of Shun Shing.</p>
<p>Shun Shing shares were at HK$5.85 when trading was suspended on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>On May 5, Shun Shing announced a share placement and a new issue, both at HK$4.68 per share, aimed at raising HK$623.3 million.</p>
<p>Shun Shing and its advisers were discussing the provisions of the rules on takeovers and mergers with the SFC and would inform shareholders of the conclusion of the talks as soon as possible, the announcement said.</p>
<p>Trading in Shun Shing shares would resume as soon as was practicable, it said.</p>
