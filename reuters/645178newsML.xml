<title>UK: Corrupt British MPs face jail under new law.</title>

<p>Corrupt British members of parliament will face up to seven years in jail under tough new proposals to be announced on Monday, officials said.</p>
<p>Home Secretary (interior minister) Jack Straw will detail plans for a bill intended to root out parliamentary corruption, or sleaze, from British public life.</p>
<p>The issue came to a head in the election which the Labour Party won by a landslide on May 1.</p>
<p>Former BBC war correspondent Martin Bell, standing as an independent &quot;anti-sleaze&quot; candidate, defeated sitting Conservative MP Neil Hamilton, who denies accepting cash in return for asking questions in parliament.</p>
<p>The Home Office said the new Labour government wanted to legislate as soon as possible but faced a packed parliamentary programme.</p>
<p>Anti-corruption legislation was therefore unlikely to find its way on to the statute books before late next year.</p>
<p>MPs are not at present covered by laws on bribery in public bodies and must be disciplined by the House of Commons rather than the courts.</p>
<p>Although the last years of the defeated Conservative government were overshadowed by allegations of sleaze, Labour has run into the problem since coming to power.</p>
<p>Labour's Mohammed Sarwar, Britain's first Moslem MP, is under investigation followng allegations he broke election law by lending 5,000 pounds ($8,000) to a rival candidate.</p>
